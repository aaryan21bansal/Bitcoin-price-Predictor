Hollywood duo complete Wrexham takeover,"This video can not be played Archive: When 'Ryan and Rob' visited Wrexham... Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have completed their takeover of Wrexham. Deadpool actor Reynolds and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia creator McElhenney have invested an immediate Â£2m into the National League club. Boosting women's football is also among their plans for the Wrexham area. ""It is a special day for the two of us to become the latest stewards in the long and storied history of Wrexham AFC,"" said Reynolds and McElhenney. ""Together with the players, the staff, the fans and the local community, we can now pursue our goal to grow the team and return it to the EFL in front of increased attendances, and in an improved stadium, while making a positive difference to the wider community in Wrexham. ""Wrexham AFC is only in a position to thrive because of the incredible efforts of the Wrexham Supporters Trust. Their members are a fitting reflection of the integrity and spirit of the town and they will always have an important role at the club."" The pair signalled the announcement in advance by adding the letter W to the start of their names on social media accounts. Reynolds, who has over 17 million followers on Twitter, and McElhenny also used the platform to add their own brand of humour to the completed takeover. Allow Twitter content?

In November Wrexham Supporters Trust voted overwhelmingly in favour of the deal, which has since gained approval from football authorities and the Financial Conduct Authority. Reynolds and McElhenney have pledged four guiding principles to protect the club's heritage, reinforce community values, help promote the club at home and abroad and create a winning culture. ""The work has already begun with Gemma Owen and Steve Dale in the community team on a new women's football initiative,"" they added. ""We are also committed to investing in current and identifying future members of the first-team squad as we build towards a promotion challenge. ""In addition, we are in the process of developing an outstanding team off the field by combining the know-how of the committed club staff and volunteers with new hires and experienced advisors. Our CEO search is progressing and we expect to have someone in place before the end of the season. ""All of these people will help us create the kind of commercial opportunities that the third oldest club in the world deserves, and we will reinvest that revenue back into Wrexham AFC and the community. ""2020 was a difficult year and there are likely to be further public health challenges in the months ahead, but we hope to be cheering the team on from the stands as soon as it's safe to do so in 2021.""

The takeover was completed on the night the clubwon 2-1 at Altrinchamto climb into the play-off zone. Contracts were exchanged in January but McElhenney and Reynolds donated money to the club to strengthen the squad before the transfer deadline while waiting for the takeover to be approved by the FCA. Former Liverpool chief executive Peter Moore, who has taken on an informal role advising the actors, said that they are ""in it for the long term"". Moore said he received assurances about the ""authentic and genuine"" intentions behind the deal during conversations with the screen stars. School friends 'predicted' Reynolds arrival The completion of the takeover has received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from supporters. One fan, based in America, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfasthe believes the investment will improve the team and raise the profile of his home town. Dyfed Avalon-Thomas, originally from Wrexham but now living in Pullman, Washington State told the programme: ""I think they'll attract the higher calibre of player, people who maybe wouldn't have wanted to come up to Wrexham are going to be tempted now. ""This is literally putting Wrexham on the map, I no longer have to say I'm from North Wales slash near Liverpool, I can just say I'm from Wrexham.""

'I Love You Will U Marry Me' graffiti removed,"The romantic gesture - overlaid with neon lights in 2008 - had formed part of the city's skyline since 2001 A graffiti marriage proposal which became a symbol of a city has been removed by developers. Jason Lowe's public display of affection was spray-painted on a bridge at Park Hill, Sheffield, in 2001. His bid to woo girlfriend Clare Middleton formed part of the city skyline, inspired a track by singer Yungblud and appeared on a t-shirt worn by Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner. Urban Splash said the graffiti was removed for ""essential repair work"". Sam Feeley, who lives in one of the renovated flats, said he noticed the writing - I Love You Will U Marry Me - had been removed on Sunday. Describing it as ""a piece of Sheffield history"", he said: ""It means a lot to the people of the city, so I was quite surprised to see it had gone."" ""I would class it as a piece of artwork and famous artwork fades over the years. ""[Leonardo] da Vinci paintings fade and people touch them up and restore them, I wouldn't see why this isn't any different really."" Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys sported a t-shirt bearing an image of the graffiti during gigs Although Mr Lowe and his girlfriend never married, his romantic gesture has formed part of the city's skyline since, with many considering it an ""iconic"" piece of history. In aBBC radio documentary, Mr Lowe explained how he braved his fear of heights to make a public show of proposing to Ms Middleton, who he had had been dating for a year. He said: ""You used to be able to see it from the Odeon cinema. ""I took her there, she thought she was going to see a film and I said: 'I've got something to show you'. I told her to look up and she read it. ""She said 'yeah'. She thought I was mad."" The pair split up three months later and Ms Middleton died in 2007 from cancer. When Urban Splash started renovation of the flats in 2008, they decided to immortalise Mr Lowe's words. Neon lights were placed over the writing and it formed part of the developer's marketing campaign. Yungblud, real name Dominic Harrison, from Doncaster, described the graffiti as ""a quirky act of romance"" in his song I Love You, Will You Marry Me. Alex Turner, lead singer of Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys, has also worn the slogan on a T-shirt during gigs. Surriya Falconer, speaking on behalf of the developers, said there were ""some structural issues"" which meant the words had to be removed so a coating could be put on the bridge. The story of the graffiti bridge Hawley to co-write musical set in flats Read more Yorkshire stories She said Mr Lowe would be involved in deciding upon a replacement and the meaning would ""continue to be celebrated"". ""I understand people may feel a sense of loss but we're talking about new futures and celebrating a piece of history. It's still going to be there but it needs to be safe,"" she said.

'Under-loved' fish renamed to boost British sales,"Spider crab is to be sold as Cornish King crab Fishermen are to rename two of their biggest exports in a bid to attract British consumers after post-Brexit difficulties selling to the EU. Megrim sole is to be sold as Cornish sole, with spider crab being rebranded as Cornish King crab. It is being driven by the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO) after research with chefs and consumers. Paul Trebilcock from the CFPO said: ""There is something about the names that has negative connotations."" Both species primarily rely on exports to Europe, which he explained that ""in the current climate is not a pleasant experience"". ""The two species are particularly under-loved in this country but really popular with some of our export markets."" Padstow is one fishing town that could benefit from the name changes Each year about 1,000 tonnes of megrim sole is brought into Newlyn, Cornwall's biggest fish market, with 98% exported. About 85% of spider crab is exported, mainly to Spain. Trade has been disrupted this year by the extra paperwork and border checks required after Brexit. Chef Jack Stein said megrim sole had a taste similar to plaice Mr Trebilcock said: ""Our investigation revealed that simply by calling it Cornish sole, straight away more people were willing to to try it and were more interested in finding out where it came from."" Johnny Murt, a shell fisherman off Padstow, said: ""It can only be a good thing."" ""It is a hard sell but if the rebranding can just get people to taste it, they will immediately realise just how good spider crab is,"" he said. Stein's chef director Jack Stein is the son of restaurateur Rick Stein Chef Jack Stein agreed and said spider crab and megrim sole were both ""good value and delicious"". He said spider crab was very sustainable with ""amazing quality meat and there is just so much of it in the summer"" but lots of it was sold in the EU. Similarly megrim sole had a ""lovely taste"" similar to plaice, he said. ""With a bit of a rebrand and a bit of a publicity drive we might be able to eat more of it in this country,"" he added.

Narrow government win in genocide trade bill vote,"Uighur women during a 2009 protest in China The government has been hit by a backbench rebellion over plans to ensure Britain's future trade partners are not committing genocide. MPs backed a government proposal to give select committees a greater role in examining allegations of genocide. But a number of Tory MPs rebelled and the government saw its working majority of about 80 slashed to just 15. Those pressing the UK to take a tougher stance on human rights abuses in China have vowed to carry on the fight. A total of 31 Conservative MPs voted against the government on Tuesday, several accusing ministers of playing ""appalling"" parliamentary games to avoid defeat. MPs were expecting to vote on a plan to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. Tory MPs pose new rebellion over anti-genocide law Who are the Uighurs? Will the UK really refuse trade deals over human rights? But the government, which opposed the plan, used a procedure to prevent a vote and instead backed a separate move giving Parliament greater say. This passed by 318 votes to 303 but peers will seek to overturn this and re-insert a clause empowering British courts into the Trade Bill when it returns to the House of Lords later this month. The government was heavily defeated on the issue in the Lords last month and independent peer Lord Alton has said he will resurrect his amendment in the hope MPs will get the chance to vote on it. ""Denying them that right makes a mockery of democracy,"" he said. MPs were prevented from having their say on it on Tuesday after ministers used a parliamentary procedure to lump it together with a Labour proposal which required ministers to determine whether a prospective trade partner has committed crimes against humanity. Downing Street argues it's ""common practice"" to package certain amendments together during parliamentary ping-pong but developments have undoubtedly provoked anger on the Conservative backbenches. Some MPs view what's happened as pure ""parliamentary chicanery"" on what is a very important and emotive issue. And, looking to the longer term, there are claims that the episode has ""hardened"" attitudes against the government, a government, it's said, that had been getting ""very twitchy"" on the numbers following a big whipping operation. Another backbencher described that operation as ""heavy, full-on stuff"" and an exercise which had revealed the extent of a potentially ""stonking"" rebellion. What's more, it appeared that some newer MPs were gearing up to rebel for the first time. That is a habit any government doesn't want its backbenchers to get into. A number of Conservative MPs criticised the government's tactics, Nusrat Ghani saying ""she was appalled at the parliamentary games being played over such a grave issue"". The UK, she said, should not be ""using its newfound post-Brexit freedoms to trade with states which commit and profit from genocide...Britain is better than that"". Trade Minister Greg Hands said a committee could trigger a Commons debate and vote if it decided there were ""credible reports"" that genocide had been committed by a state with which the UK was negotiating a trade deal. ""This approach rightly puts Parliament, not the courts, in the driving seat on the issue of who generates a debate in Parliament,"" he told MPs. But former Conservative leader Sir Ian Duncan Smith said there was a reason why matters of huge public importance, such as public inquiries into tragedies and scandals, were overseen by judges. ""I have my own differences with judges but when we need an impartial taking of evidence and a judgement, we turn not to select committees but judges. Why do we do that? ""One, because we assume they are impartial. Two because they are trained to take evidence and deal with evidence. We are not here."" And Labour's Emily Thornberry accused the government of ""shameful, shabby and shifty"" behaviour. Campaigners want British courts to hear genocide cases so that persecuted minorities, such as the Uighurs in Xinjiang, China, can have their situation considered by a court of law. A legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers has already concluded there was a ""very credible case"" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs.

Coal mine plan to be re-examined,"The mining company behind the project said it would provide hundreds of jobs Plans for a controversial coking coal mine in Cumbria have been suspended by the county council. Councillors will reconsider the planning application for a site near Whitehaven in light of concerns about climate change. The council granted planning permission to West Cumbria Mining back in October, and the government decided recently not to challenge the decision. But now the council has said it will re-assess the permission. Guidance from the government's advisory Climate Change Committee (CCC) in December recommended that the use of coking coal should be curbed by 2035, whereas the council have granted permission to dig until 2049. A council statement said: ""In light of this the council has decided that the planning application should be reconsidered by the Development Control and Regulation Committee."" The decision may prove a relief for the prime minister who has been under pressure to halt the mine as he aspires to lead the world away from the fossil fuels that are heating the climate. The mine has divided opinion in Cumbria, with many in favour of the well-paid manual jobs it would bring, but others warning of the risks of climate change - especially in an area prone to severe flooding. Greenpeace said: ""This decision could prevent Boris Johnson's climate credentials being buried under a tonne of coal."" The CCC, many green groups and scientists have been pressed the prime minister to overturn the council's decision to grant permission for the mine. Alok Sharma, who will head this year's climate summit on behalf of the UK, was said to be apoplectic that the mine had been given the go-ahead, and the Lib Dems wrote to him urging him to resign unless the government stopped the project. But local Conservatives, including Copeland MP Trudy Harrison and Copeland mayor Mike Starkie, have been supportive of the mine, especially as some of its produce will be able to be used by the UK steel industry. They said they were ""dismayed"" by the county council's move and added the area ""needs"" the Â£160m of private investment and 500 jobs the mine was set to bring. ""The decision has been made time and again, based on the forensic details the planning committee had in front of them, and the decision has repeatedly been to approve this important development. ""The project fully accords with the UK's green industrial commitments and includes legal conditions that production will not go beyond 2049 and the highest levels of greenhouse gas emission mitigation."" Supporters have claimed the mine would rejuvenate the Whitehaven economy Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband, said the party welcomed the decision to take the application back to the planning committee. ""The government now has a second chance to do the right thing and call it in. The UK cannot claim to be a climate leader whilst opening a new coal mine and ministers must realise that by doing so they undermine our credibility both at home and abroad. ""A new mine is neither the answer for climate change nor the answer for our steel industry. Indeed, 85% of the mine's production is due for export. ""People in Cumbria deserve good, secure jobs and there are so many crying out to be done in the green industries of the future."" However, the South Lakes Action on Climate Change group said it was sceptical planning officers would ""change their minds and advise councillors to refuse this time"". A spokesperson said: ""Cumbria County Council will almost certainly be seeking to justify a further decision to approve, as a way of defending themselves from a judicial review. ""It is possible that the committee meeting will be on the 19th February, and objectors will have little more than a week to prepare further objections and apply to speak at the committee.""

Kobe Bryant pilot 'likely disorientated amid fog',"NBA legend Kobe Bryant was killed in a 2020 helicopter crash alongside his daughter, and seven other people The pilot of the helicopter which crashed killing basketball superstar Kobe Bryant, his young daughter, and seven other people had probably become disorientated amid fog, US safety investigators have said. The helicopter smashed into a hillside near Calabasas, California, on 26 January 2020. Pilot Ara Zobayan was among the dead. Investigators also said Zobayan may have felt ""self-induced pressure"" to complete the flight for Bryant. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has been investigating the circumstances around the crash, and met on Tuesday to vote on the probable cause. It is an independent federal agency with no enforcement powers. In its official finding, the NTSB said the main cause of the crash was most likely the pilot's decision to keep flying in inclement conditions, ""which resulted in the pilot's spatial disorientation and loss of control"". During the flight, Zobayan told air traffic controllers the helicopter was climbing out of heavy cloud when it was actually descending. ""This manoeuvre is consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation in limited visibility conditions,"" said NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt. ""We are talking about spatial disorientation where literally the pilot may not know which way is up or down, whether he or she is leaning left or right."" The NTSB added that ""inadequate review and oversight"" of safety management processes by the helicopter charter company, Island Express, may have also contributed to the crash. However, the board did not find that the Sikorsky S-76B had experienced any mechanical problems. The helicopter was not required to have ""black box"" recorders, which capture flight data and voices in the cockpit, and was not carrying any. Zobayan violated federal rules and went against his own flight training by flying into thick clouds, safety officials said. Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna attend an NBA game weeks before the crash The pilot ""was flying under visual flight orders or VFR which legally prohibited him from penetrating the clouds"", but he did so anyway, said Mr Sumwalt. Investigators also criticised Zobayan for banking the helicopter to the left, instead of bringing the aircraft straight up while trying to escape the bad weather. Zobayan was an experienced pilot who had often flown for Bryant. The widely respected pilot had logged more than 1,200 hours in the Sikorsky-76 helicopter. Disorientation can set in when pilots can't see the sky or landscape, making it harder to judge an aircraft's altitude and acceleration. Investigators also said that the close relationship between Bryant and Zobayan may have compelled the pilot to fly even in unsafe conditions. In text messages on the eve of the crash released by the NTSB, Zobayan wrote that the forecast seemed to be ""not the best"". The next morning, he wrote that the conditions were ""looking ok"". A giant who had his controversies Gianna Bryant: The basketball talent killed alongside father Kobe Bryant helicopter crash post-mortem released At the time of the crash, retired NBA legend Bryant, 41, was travelling to a youth basketball tournament with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, two of her teammates, and several other friends. The fatal crash prompted a global outpouring of support for the NBA star and his family - as well as a number of lawsuits. Bryant's wife, Vanessa Bryant, sued Zobayan and the companies that owned and operated the helicopter for alleged negligence and wrongful death. Families of the other victims sued the helicopter companies - but not Zobayan. In September, Ms Bryant sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department after officers shared unauthorised photos of the crash site. California now has a state law prohibiting first responders from taking unauthorised pictures of people who died at the scene of an accident or crime.

Grenfell firm sold flammable cladding 'by default',"The company that made Grenfell Tower's cladding would ""by default"" sell flammable materials to construction projects, including high-rise buildings, a sales manager has said. Deborah French told the public inquiry into the June 2017 west London blaze that Arconic could have sold a fire-retardant product. But she said it saw the UK market as preferring a slightly cheaper version, albeit with a greater fire risk. Seventy-two people died in the fire. The first phase of the Grenfell Inquiry concluded that cladding put on the tower block during refurbishment fuelled the fire. Statements from a series of Arconic managers shown to the inquiry on Tuesday said the ""UK was generally a 'PE market'"" - PE referring to polyethylene, which is used as the core material of the panel and is highly flammable. Combustible cladding is the major cause of thebuilding safety crisisnow affecting millions of flat owners. New body to ban dangerous building materials Lies, sham tests & buck-passing - Grenfell's year of evidence The Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast Giving evidence, Ms French, the company's UK sales manager, said a type of product called Reynobond PE panels were 4 to 5 euros cheaper per square metre than the fire-retardant version. In June 2014, she sent an email listing large construction projects to which she was hoping to sell cladding sheets. They include a major development, Pendletons in Salford, Greater Manchester, on which Reynobond PE was used, as well as towers in Swansea and London. Smaller projects listed by Ms French included Grenfell Tower, which was listed as awaiting an order for cladding, with just the colour to choose. She told the inquiry ""the discussions never came up about requiring anything other than a PE core"". When asked by inquiry lead barrister Richard Millett QC if Arconic would ""by default sell them PE"", she replied: ""That's right, yes."" Ms French said it was ""very, very, very rare"" for customers to ask about fire safety. ""It was not something that was discussed,"" she said. ""The majority of what I dealt with was colours, availabilities and those types of things."" Sales of Reynobond PE cladding were encouraged by a certificate issued by the independent British Board of Agrement. It said that the flammable panels ""may be regarded"" as meeting a British fire performance standard known as Class 0. However the cladding had not passed the relevant British laboratory test, and had failed several of the European tests on which the certificate was based. Mr Millett asked Ms French: ""If you were selling that product based on claims made about its fire performance [...] do you agree that you would be tending to mislead buyers?"" ""Yes, I wouldn't knowingly have done that, but inadvertently I would have been,"" she said. Ms French insisted throughout her evidence that she was not a technical expert and passed detailed questions on to a technical manager, Claude Wehrle, based in France. Mr Wehrle is one of three potential witnesses to the inquiry who have refused to give evidence on legal advice that, if they did so, they could incriminate themselves under a law in France. The so-called French Blocking Statute prevents its citizens taking part in some foreign legal cases. All three worked for Arconic. Mr Wehrle and fellow potential witness Gwenaelle Derrendinger live in France, while the third, Peter Froehlich, is based in Germany. Mr Millett said ""the refusal of these witnesses to come and give evidence is unreasonable"". The inquiry was also told that Arconic refused to disclose documents to the inquiry and only did so following a criminal European Investigation Order requested by the Metropolitan Police. The police force is investigating potential corporate manslaughter, fraud, and breaches of health and safety law. Ms French will continue giving evidence on Wednesday.

Coal mine plan to be re-examinedCouncillors will reconsider the planning application in the light of climate change advice.Cumbria,"The mining company behind the project said it would provide hundreds of jobs Plans for a controversial coking coal mine in Cumbria have been suspended by the county council. Councillors will reconsider the planning application for a site near Whitehaven in light of concerns about climate change. The council granted planning permission to West Cumbria Mining back in October, and the government decided recently not to challenge the decision. But now the council has said it will re-assess the permission. Guidance from the government's advisory Climate Change Committee (CCC) in December recommended that the use of coking coal should be curbed by 2035, whereas the council have granted permission to dig until 2049. A council statement said: ""In light of this the council has decided that the planning application should be reconsidered by the Development Control and Regulation Committee."" The decision may prove a relief for the prime minister who has been under pressure to halt the mine as he aspires to lead the world away from the fossil fuels that are heating the climate. The mine has divided opinion in Cumbria, with many in favour of the well-paid manual jobs it would bring, but others warning of the risks of climate change - especially in an area prone to severe flooding. Greenpeace said: ""This decision could prevent Boris Johnson's climate credentials being buried under a tonne of coal."" The CCC, many green groups and scientists have been pressed the prime minister to overturn the council's decision to grant permission for the mine. Alok Sharma, who will head this year's climate summit on behalf of the UK, was said to be apoplectic that the mine had been given the go-ahead, and the Lib Dems wrote to him urging him to resign unless the government stopped the project. But local Conservatives, including Copeland MP Trudy Harrison and Copeland mayor Mike Starkie, have been supportive of the mine, especially as some of its produce will be able to be used by the UK steel industry. They said they were ""dismayed"" by the county council's move and added the area ""needs"" the Â£160m of private investment and 500 jobs the mine was set to bring. ""The decision has been made time and again, based on the forensic details the planning committee had in front of them, and the decision has repeatedly been to approve this important development. ""The project fully accords with the UK's green industrial commitments and includes legal conditions that production will not go beyond 2049 and the highest levels of greenhouse gas emission mitigation."" Supporters have claimed the mine would rejuvenate the Whitehaven economy Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband, said the party welcomed the decision to take the application back to the planning committee. ""The government now has a second chance to do the right thing and call it in. The UK cannot claim to be a climate leader whilst opening a new coal mine and ministers must realise that by doing so they undermine our credibility both at home and abroad. ""A new mine is neither the answer for climate change nor the answer for our steel industry. Indeed, 85% of the mine's production is due for export. ""People in Cumbria deserve good, secure jobs and there are so many crying out to be done in the green industries of the future."" However, the South Lakes Action on Climate Change group said it was sceptical planning officers would ""change their minds and advise councillors to refuse this time"". A spokesperson said: ""Cumbria County Council will almost certainly be seeking to justify a further decision to approve, as a way of defending themselves from a judicial review. ""It is possible that the committee meeting will be on the 19th February, and objectors will have little more than a week to prepare further objections and apply to speak at the committee.""

"Kobe Bryant pilot 'likely disorientated amid fog'Investigators say he may have felt ""pressure"" to complete the NBA star's ill-fated flight in 2020.US & Canada","NBA legend Kobe Bryant was killed in a 2020 helicopter crash alongside his daughter, and seven other people The pilot of the helicopter which crashed killing basketball superstar Kobe Bryant, his young daughter, and seven other people had probably become disorientated amid fog, US safety investigators have said. The helicopter smashed into a hillside near Calabasas, California, on 26 January 2020. Pilot Ara Zobayan was among the dead. Investigators also said Zobayan may have felt ""self-induced pressure"" to complete the flight for Bryant. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has been investigating the circumstances around the crash, and met on Tuesday to vote on the probable cause. It is an independent federal agency with no enforcement powers. In its official finding, the NTSB said the main cause of the crash was most likely the pilot's decision to keep flying in inclement conditions, ""which resulted in the pilot's spatial disorientation and loss of control"". During the flight, Zobayan told air traffic controllers the helicopter was climbing out of heavy cloud when it was actually descending. ""This manoeuvre is consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation in limited visibility conditions,"" said NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt. ""We are talking about spatial disorientation where literally the pilot may not know which way is up or down, whether he or she is leaning left or right."" The NTSB added that ""inadequate review and oversight"" of safety management processes by the helicopter charter company, Island Express, may have also contributed to the crash. However, the board did not find that the Sikorsky S-76B had experienced any mechanical problems. The helicopter was not required to have ""black box"" recorders, which capture flight data and voices in the cockpit, and was not carrying any. Zobayan violated federal rules and went against his own flight training by flying into thick clouds, safety officials said. Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna attend an NBA game weeks before the crash The pilot ""was flying under visual flight orders or VFR which legally prohibited him from penetrating the clouds"", but he did so anyway, said Mr Sumwalt. Investigators also criticised Zobayan for banking the helicopter to the left, instead of bringing the aircraft straight up while trying to escape the bad weather. Zobayan was an experienced pilot who had often flown for Bryant. The widely respected pilot had logged more than 1,200 hours in the Sikorsky-76 helicopter. Disorientation can set in when pilots can't see the sky or landscape, making it harder to judge an aircraft's altitude and acceleration. Investigators also said that the close relationship between Bryant and Zobayan may have compelled the pilot to fly even in unsafe conditions. In text messages on the eve of the crash released by the NTSB, Zobayan wrote that the forecast seemed to be ""not the best"". The next morning, he wrote that the conditions were ""looking ok"". A giant who had his controversies Gianna Bryant: The basketball talent killed alongside father Kobe Bryant helicopter crash post-mortem released At the time of the crash, retired NBA legend Bryant, 41, was travelling to a youth basketball tournament with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, two of her teammates, and several other friends. The fatal crash prompted a global outpouring of support for the NBA star and his family - as well as a number of lawsuits. Bryant's wife, Vanessa Bryant, sued Zobayan and the companies that owned and operated the helicopter for alleged negligence and wrongful death. Families of the other victims sued the helicopter companies - but not Zobayan. In September, Ms Bryant sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department after officers shared unauthorised photos of the crash site. California now has a state law prohibiting first responders from taking unauthorised pictures of people who died at the scene of an accident or crime.

'I Love You Will U Marry Me' graffiti removedJason Lowe's famous proposal disappears from Sheffield's Park Hill flats after almost 20 years.,"The romantic gesture - overlaid with neon lights in 2008 - had formed part of the city's skyline since 2001 A graffiti marriage proposal which became a symbol of a city has been removed by developers. Jason Lowe's public display of affection was spray-painted on a bridge at Park Hill, Sheffield, in 2001. His bid to woo girlfriend Clare Middleton formed part of the city skyline, inspired a track by singer Yungblud and appeared on a t-shirt worn by Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner. Urban Splash said the graffiti was removed for ""essential repair work"". Sam Feeley, who lives in one of the renovated flats, said he noticed the writing - I Love You Will U Marry Me - had been removed on Sunday. Describing it as ""a piece of Sheffield history"", he said: ""It means a lot to the people of the city, so I was quite surprised to see it had gone."" ""I would class it as a piece of artwork and famous artwork fades over the years. ""[Leonardo] da Vinci paintings fade and people touch them up and restore them, I wouldn't see why this isn't any different really."" Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys sported a t-shirt bearing an image of the graffiti during gigs Although Mr Lowe and his girlfriend never married, his romantic gesture has formed part of the city's skyline since, with many considering it an ""iconic"" piece of history. In aBBC radio documentary, Mr Lowe explained how he braved his fear of heights to make a public show of proposing to Ms Middleton, who he had had been dating for a year. He said: ""You used to be able to see it from the Odeon cinema. ""I took her there, she thought she was going to see a film and I said: 'I've got something to show you'. I told her to look up and she read it. ""She said 'yeah'. She thought I was mad."" The pair split up three months later and Ms Middleton died in 2007 from cancer. When Urban Splash started renovation of the flats in 2008, they decided to immortalise Mr Lowe's words. Neon lights were placed over the writing and it formed part of the developer's marketing campaign. Yungblud, real name Dominic Harrison, from Doncaster, described the graffiti as ""a quirky act of romance"" in his song I Love You, Will You Marry Me. Alex Turner, lead singer of Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys, has also worn the slogan on a T-shirt during gigs. Surriya Falconer, speaking on behalf of the developers, said there were ""some structural issues"" which meant the words had to be removed so a coating could be put on the bridge. The story of the graffiti bridge Hawley to co-write musical set in flats Read more Yorkshire stories She said Mr Lowe would be involved in deciding upon a replacement and the meaning would ""continue to be celebrated"". ""I understand people may feel a sense of loss but we're talking about new futures and celebrating a piece of history. It's still going to be there but it needs to be safe,"" she said.

'A mum cried when I gave her nappies for her child',"Emilie de Bruijn says increasing numbers of people are asking for help from her baby bank The boot of the red car lifts up to reveal a sea of plastic bags. Inside each one are the essentials for bringing up young children: nappies, wipes, baby food and shampoo, as well as sanitary items for their mums - all free to those in need. Within a minute or two, the first customer arrives. Soon followed by another, and another. Since the first lockdown, on every Thursday Emilie de Bruijn runs this ""baby bank"" out of the back of her car in Hartlepool. Covid has put paid to the indoor space she used in normal times. It's also increased demand amongst families now suffering real and deepening hardship. Her parking spot is beside a church which doubles up as a food bank. On the freezing Thursday we visited, almost 100 people queued in the cold for several hours for the food parcels on offer there. Among them were parents with pushchairs and young children, who stepped out of the queue to collect some baby basics before rejoining it as it crept towards the church door. ""It's just getting harder and harder,"" Emilie told me. ""We are increasingly finding people who have been furloughed or laid off work coming to us and saying, 'I'm so sorry. I never thought I'd see myself in this position. Can you help me?'"" Emilie says parents who have lost their jobs due to Covid are turning to the baby bank for help Emilie recalls how one mother got in touch to ask for help after being put on furlough since the end of her maternity leave. ""She cried on her doorstep because I gave her nappies, wipes and winter clothes for her child. I went away with a lump in my throat."" A report from London-based baby bank charity Little Village and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, seen first by BBC Newsnight, outlines the scale, depth and persistence of poverty in families with children aged under five across the UK. It finds one-third (34%) of these children live below the poverty line - meaning their family lives on less than 60% of the median household income in the UK. That equates to 1.3 million under-fives, according to the analysis. Two in five of these families have seen a reduction in their earnings as a result of the ongoing Covid crisis. London has the worst rates of poverty in the UK for children in this age group. The North East of England runs the capital a close second, which doesn't surprise Kay - one of Emilie's regulars. Mum of four Kay says she has had to go without food and clothes herself to provide for her children Kay moved to Hartlepool from London in search of cheaper rents and a better life for her young children. She's worked in supermarkets but is now a single parent with four children, aged between seven months and seven years old. Struggling on benefits, and after housing costs, Kay's left with around Â£600 for the month. ""That's got to pay your gas, your electric, your water, your council tax and any other bills that may pop up,"" she says. ""And your food. So within a week my money's gone. ""I've gone without meals, without clothes. I have one meal a day providing my children have three. It's basic chicken nuggets and chips, fish fingers and chips. The diets are really poor because the money's not there to buy fresh food, to cook fresh meals."" Little Village founder Sophia Parker, who wrote the report, says Covid had made things ""much worse"" for families who were already struggling. ""People have used up savings. People have gone to their families and friends and borrowed what they can,"" she says. ""As a result, we're seeing families who are falling into rent arrears. We're seeing families who are having to rely on high-cost loans. ""We're just very worried about where this is going to land for families that are already in a difficult situation."" One mother says she is left with Â£10 a month after paying her bills Rachel, not her real name, is a trained nursery practitioner who spent six months in a refuge after fleeing an abusive relationship. She now lives in cramped temporary accommodation with her three-year-old son and nine-month-old daughter. She is employed for a few hours a week by Little Village, but relies for now on universal credit. ""When we came out of the refuge, I looked for full-time work but I couldn't make it pay because of childcare costs,"" she tells me. ""My rent is so high, after bills I'm left with Â£10 a month for us to live on. I don't drink, smoke or buy clothes. ""If my son is invited to a child's birthday party, I die, as I know I have to say no. I can't afford a present. It's very embarrassing to keep asking for help. Little Village did our Christmas. Otherwise there would have been nothing under the tree. ""The pandemic has made things more expensive.  We're always home, so electric and gas costs more. Food shopping online costs more too. My children are my reason for everything. But I can't see a way out. I am stuck in a trap."" The government said it was committed to ""making sure every child gets the best start in life, and this is central to our steadfast determination to level up opportunity across the country"". A spokesman said it had targeted its support to families most in need by raising the living wage and spending hundreds of billions to safeguard jobs. ""Additionally, we have boosted welfare support by billions, introduced the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme to help children and families during the coldest months, and in April we will be increasing the value of our Healthy Start vouchers by over a third to help those in need with young children.""

Saira Khan receives threats for Muslim article,"Saira Khan was the runner-up in the first season of The Apprentice in 2005 TV presenter Saira Khan has said she received death threats after revealing she is not a practising Muslim. The former Loose Women panellist clarified her faith earlier this weekin a column for The Daily Mirror.,external ""The problem for women like me, who have a Muslim name and are of Asian heritage, is that others make assumptions about us before we even open our mouths,"" she said. In an Instagram Live on Monday, Khan said she had received death threats. She alsoposted a statement on her account,externalwhich said she had been abused and trolled online. Khan shot to fame as a contestant on The Apprentice. She has since appeared on Dancing on Ice and Celebrity Big Brother. For the last five years she has been a regular panellist on ITV's Loose Women, but she stepped down from her role in December. In a newspaper column, the broadcaster said she wanted to clarify her stance ""for [her] own wellbeing"". ""I feel that by saying this as a public figure, I will no longer inadvertently confuse or unintentionally hurt others of the Muslim faith,"" she wrote. ""People assume that because we have Muslim parents we are practising Muslims, that we have read the Quran, that we fast every Ramadan, that we don't drink, that we don't have sex before marriage."" Khan said many aspects of her lifestyle did not fit with Islam, such as wearing clothes that go against the accepted dress code, drinking alcohol and having a boyfriend ""behind closed doors"". Khan previously appeared alongside Linda Robson, Andrea McLean and Coleen Nolan on Loose Women The broadcaster, who is of Pakistani heritage, also highlighted that she had adopted a child and had not followed Islamic rules on her daughter's inheritance rights. She continued: ""I respect people who have Islam in their lives - some are the most humble people I know. ""However, I don't share their conviction. I've tried hard over many years, not for myself, but for my parents and the wider family."" She said that having been brought up in a practising Muslim family, ""most of my values are based on the spiritual aspects of the Muslim faith. But I'm also influenced by other spiritual teachings"". Khan took part in an Instagram Live broadcast on Monday evening, during which she said she had received death threats since the publication of her article. On Tuesday, she posted a statement on Instagram reiterating that she has ""been sent threats, abuse and been trolled"". ""Why my personal choice of how I choose to live my life should stir such hatred in others is incomprehensible to me,"" she said. But, the presenter added, she had also received support from several followers. She shared screengrabs of some messages she had been sent. Khan said she had been ""contacted by so many women in the last 24 hours documenting their fears for wanting to live their life how they wish"". ""Whilst I like to keep things upbeat and positive, I cannot forget that I as a woman have a duty on my platform to help other women.

"Frost: UK relations with EU 'more than bumpy'The UK's chief Brexit negotiator says Brussels must adopt a ""different spirit"" towards its neighbour.UK Politics","This video can not be played Lord Frost calls for ""different spirit"" from Brussels The UK's chief Brexit negotiator has criticised the EU for its actions since the trade deal agreed by the two sides came into force six weeks ago. Lord David Frost said the relationship had been ""more than bumpy"" and more ""problematic"" than he had hoped. He told a committee the EU'sthreat to increase controls on vaccine exports to Northern Ireland, as well as ""niggling border issues"", were two examples. Lord Frost called for ""a different spirit"" from Brussels going forward. Asked about his thoughts on the situation, Cabinet Officer Minister Michael Gove compared it to a bumpy start to a flight, saying: ""We all know that when an aeroplane takes off, that is the point where you sometimes get an increased level of turbulence.

Frost: UK relations with EU 'more than bumpy',"This video can not be played Lord Frost calls for ""different spirit"" from Brussels The UK's chief Brexit negotiator has criticised the EU for its actions since the trade deal agreed by the two sides came into force six weeks ago. Lord David Frost said the relationship had been ""more than bumpy"" and more ""problematic"" than he had hoped. He told a committee the EU'sthreat to increase controls on vaccine exports to Northern Ireland, as well as ""niggling border issues"", were two examples. Lord Frost called for ""a different spirit"" from Brussels going forward. Asked about his thoughts on the situation, Cabinet Officer Minister Michael Gove compared it to a bumpy start to a flight, saying: ""We all know that when an aeroplane takes off, that is the point where you sometimes get an increased level of turbulence. ""But eventually, you then reach a cruising altitude and the crew tell you to take your seatbelt off and enjoy a gin and tonic and some peanuts.""

Why hasn't the UK closed its borders?,"There are more than 40 countries onthe government's red list,external, which has the strictest travel restrictions. One is India, where a new mutation of coronavirus first identified in the country has spread to the UK. This has been linked to international travel. It has been classified as a""variant of concern"",externaland more than 3,400 cases of it have been found in the UK. But despite this and the discovery in the UK of other variants identified abroad, the government has never banned international travel altogether - unlike some countries. A traffic light system has been introduced for travel, with countries classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests. What are the travel rules? Matt Hancock's India Covid claim fact-checked Red list countries (which include India, Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa) are those the UK government says are at the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited ""except in the most extreme of circumstances"". If you have been in one, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident. You must be tested negative for Covid-19 before departure and self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel. Direct flights from many red list countries to the UK are banned but some are allowed. These include flights from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. The government says this is to avoid potential disruption to critical freight and British nationals seeking to return home. On one day (19 May), Reality Check counted 4 direct flights from India to Heathrow. Coronavirus variants originally found in Brazil, South Africa and India are believed to be more transmissible, and there are concerns vaccines may not be quite as effective against them. British and Irish citizens who have been in these countries are allowed to return to the UK and - until mid-February - were trusted to self-isolate at home and could take public transport to get there. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had moved ""as fast as we could"" to introduce quarantine hotels, describing them as a ""very tough regime"". The measures began on 15 February 2021, after weeks of speculation. Labour said there had been a lack of a ""comprehensive"" border system. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? What is the government doing about the South Africa strain? The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. The country was placed on the red list on 23 April and there has been criticism that it should have been added earlier. Why was India not on the red list sooner? Matt Hancock's India Covid claim fact-checked Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling,according to a 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Positive tests from passengers arriving in the UK are automatically sent for genome sequencing, which identifies new variants. But there is concern that by the time a variant has been identified, it may already have spread in the UK. The debate over whether to shut UK borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic. Between January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus. Quarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from ""high-risk countries"" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days. Aninquiry into the pandemic,externalsuggested it was understandable the government ""did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights"" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home. But these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March 2020 - 10 days before the UK went into the first lockdown. ""The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,"" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said. One study found,externalthe virus was introduced to the UK ""well over a thousand times in early 2020"", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)advised against travel bans,external, saying they were ""usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact"". In April 2021, the WHO said it wouldupdate its ""risk-based guidance"",externalon Covid and international travel. The Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was ""incorrect in their assertions"". It said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons. It argued that by mid-March 2020 there was ""significant transmission"" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would have had a ""very marginal"" impact. At ameeting in February 2020,external, the government advisory committee Sage suggested that cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the epidemic by five days. The scientists estimated that a 95% reduction in imported cases, which would have required ""draconian"" travel restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month. But at itsmeeting in January 2021,external, Sage said: ""No intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants.""

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.

Saira Khan receives threats for Muslim articleThe former Loose Women panellist explained she is not a practising Muslim earlier this week.Entertainment & Arts,"Saira Khan was the runner-up in the first season of The Apprentice in 2005 TV presenter Saira Khan has said she received death threats after revealing she is not a practising Muslim. The former Loose Women panellist clarified her faith earlier this weekin a column for The Daily Mirror.,external ""The problem for women like me, who have a Muslim name and are of Asian heritage, is that others make assumptions about us before we even open our mouths,"" she said. In an Instagram Live on Monday, Khan said she had received death threats. She alsoposted a statement on her account,externalwhich said she had been abused and trolled online. Khan shot to fame as a contestant on The Apprentice. She has since appeared on Dancing on Ice and Celebrity Big Brother. For the last five years she has been a regular panellist on ITV's Loose Women, but she stepped down from her role in December. In a newspaper column, the broadcaster said she wanted to clarify her stance ""for [her] own wellbeing"". ""I feel that by saying this as a public figure, I will no longer inadvertently confuse or unintentionally hurt others of the Muslim faith,"" she wrote. ""People assume that because we have Muslim parents we are practising Muslims, that we have read the Quran, that we fast every Ramadan, that we don't drink, that we don't have sex before marriage."" Khan said many aspects of her lifestyle did not fit with Islam, such as wearing clothes that go against the accepted dress code, drinking alcohol and having a boyfriend ""behind closed doors"". Khan previously appeared alongside Linda Robson, Andrea McLean and Coleen Nolan on Loose Women The broadcaster, who is of Pakistani heritage, also highlighted that she had adopted a child and had not followed Islamic rules on her daughter's inheritance rights. She continued: ""I respect people who have Islam in their lives - some are the most humble people I know. ""However, I don't share their conviction. I've tried hard over many years, not for myself, but for my parents and the wider family."" She said that having been brought up in a practising Muslim family, ""most of my values are based on the spiritual aspects of the Muslim faith. But I'm also influenced by other spiritual teachings"". Khan took part in an Instagram Live broadcast on Monday evening, during which she said she had received death threats since the publication of her article. On Tuesday, she posted a statement on Instagram reiterating that she has ""been sent threats, abuse and been trolled"". ""Why my personal choice of how I choose to live my life should stir such hatred in others is incomprehensible to me,"" she said. But, the presenter added, she had also received support from several followers. She shared screengrabs of some messages she had been sent. Khan said she had been ""contacted by so many women in the last 24 hours documenting their fears for wanting to live their life how they wish"". ""Whilst I like to keep things upbeat and positive, I cannot forget that I as a woman have a duty on my platform to help other women.

"Executive must fund Troubles pension, court rules","Stormont's Executive Office is under a legal duty to fund a pension for people badly injured in the Troubles, Northern Ireland's Court of Appeal has ruled. The scheme is due to open for applications next month but it is not clear who will fund the payments. Stormont and Westminsterhave been engaged in a long-running rowabout who is responsible. On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal said it was giving the parties four weeks to find a solution. It said if that was not possible the case would be relisted to include Stormont's Department of Finance as an additional notice party. A spokesperson for the department said Finance Minister Conor Murphy had been pressing Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis to meet him about the pension since September. A UK government spokesperson said Mr Lewis had ""always been clear"" that the responsibility for funding the scheme lay with the Stormont Executive.Â Â It is understood the NI secretary has agreed to meet Stormont ministers and has asked for more detail about estimated costs and wider spending plans. The pension scheme was initially approved at Westminster when devolution in Northern Ireland had collapsed. What's the trouble with the Troubles pension? Victims 'outraged' over Troubles payment row Since power-sharing returned in January 2020, estimates from Stormont for the cost of the scheme have been suggested to run toas high as Â£800m. The executive argues that Westminster should help fund it, as it is a UK-wide scheme and people injured outside Northern Ireland will be able to apply. Last year, a judge ruled that the Executive Officewas acting unlawfullyin delaying Troubles pensions, following a legal challenge from some victims. Tuesday's appeal was brought by Brian Turley, one ofthose known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early-1970s. In the ruling, Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said there was a legal duty on the Executive Office regarding the funding, to ensure payments could be made. He backed submissions that there is no discretion involved but said the court expressed ""no view"" on the political dispute between the Stormont Executive and Northern Ireland Office. Brian Turley instigated the latest court action Speaking after the hearing, Mr Turley said the judgement confirmed there were ""no justifiable reasons"" for delaying the payments to victims. ""The need to keep taking cases to court to obtain what I am entitled to is another form of torture,"" he said. Alan McBride from Wave Trauma Centre told BBC Newsline that he was ""disappointed"" that it had been left to the courts system to make progress with the scheme. ""It is up now to the executive and Northern Ireland Office to sit down around the table like mature adults and sort this out once and for all."" DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster said the ruling was ""reassuring"" for victims and that she looked forward to payments being issued. ""Whilst the payments will be made from the Northern Ireland Executive, there is a strong argument that the government should be increasing the NI budget accordingly to fund the pension,"" she added. Sinn FÃ©in's Linda Dillon said her party was committed to ensuring payments were made as quickly as possible, but insisted the executive alone does not have the resources to deliver it. Stormont's Justice Minister Naomi Long said she hoped Stormont and Westminster could agree a resolution. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chair of Stormont's Executive Office Committee, the SDLP's Colin McGrath said it was ""welcome"" that a four-week deadline had been set. ""While the British government clearly must meet their financial commitments to this scheme, the public row between the Secretary of State and Finance Minister is unedifying and also serves to re-traumatise victims and survivors,"" he said. Ulster Unionist assembly member (MLA) Doug Beattie described the ruling as the ""latest abject failure"" in supporting the needs of Troubles victims. ""The Executive Office has not only a moral obligation but now a legal one to provide the funding to this scheme and end the uncertainty for those who have spent years suffering as a result of injuries caused by no fault of their own,"" he said. The scheme is due to run for two or three decades and payments are to be backdated to 2014, the year in which it was first agreed. Last August, Stormont's Department of Justice was designated to administer the scheme. But in January, the Department of Financedid not set aside fundingfor payments in the draft budget for 2021-22, only the administrative cost of the pension. The legislation came on to the statute book in January 2020. To qualify, applicants must have an injury which is severe and permanent and caused by no fault of their own. That can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example. The scheme covers violence related to the Northern Ireland Troubles between 1966 and 2010, including incidents in Great Britain and Europe. Non-UK residents injured outside the UK cannot apply - such as victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings carried out by loyalists in 1974. People will get between Â£2,000 and Â£10,000 a year for the rest of their lives. Upon their death, a spouse or carer, will get the payments for a further 10 years. The scheme is a recognition that criminal injuries awards from decades ago were largely inadequate. What's the trouble with the Troubles pension?

""People assume that because we have Muslim parents we are practising Muslims, that we have read the Quran, that we fast every Ramadan, that we don't drink, that we don't have sex before marriage."" Khan said many aspects of her lifestyle did not fit with Islam, such as wearing clothes that go against the accepted dress code, drinking alcohol and having a boyfriend ""behind closed doors"". Khan previously appeared alongside Linda Robson, Andrea McLean and Coleen Nolan on Loose Women The broadcaster, who is of Pakistani heritage, also highlighted that she had adopted a child and had not followed Islamic rules on her daughter's inheritance rights. She continued: ""I respect people who have Islam in their lives - some are the most humble people I know. ""However, I don't share their conviction. I've tried hard over many years, not for myself, but for my parents and the wider family."" She said that having been brought up in a practising Muslim family, ""most of my values are based on the spiritual aspects of the Muslim faith. But I'm also influenced by other spiritual teachings"". Khan took part in an Instagram Live broadcast on Monday evening, during which she said she had received death threats since the publication of her article. On Tuesday, she posted a statement on Instagram reiterating that she has ""been sent threats, abuse and been trolled"". ""Why my personal choice of how I choose to live my life should stir such hatred in others is incomprehensible to me,"" she said. But, the presenter added, she had also received support from several followers. She shared screengrabs of some messages she had been sent. Khan said she had been ""contacted by so many women in the last 24 hours documenting their fears for wanting to live their life how they wish"". ""Whilst I like to keep things upbeat and positive, I cannot forget that I as a woman have a duty on my platform to help other women. ""We don't need to look the same in order to feel each other's pain. I feel your pain if you are hurt."" Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Jail threat and Â£10k fines in new travel enforcement,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirms the new ""enhanced testing"" regime for international travellers From Monday in England, anyone arriving into the country must book two PCR tests to take on days two and eight of their quarantine Any positive result will undergo genomic sequencing to confirm whether they have a variant of concern Returning residents from ""red list countries"" will have to pay up to Â£1,750 for hotel quarantine, transport and testing There will be fines of up to Â£10,000 and 10-year jail sentences for those who break travel rules All international arrivals into Scotland from Monday will have to enter ""managed"" quarantine facilities such as hotels Further Covid surge testing is to be deployed in Lambeth, south London, where the South African variant has been found A theory that coronavirus leaked from a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan is discredited as ""extremely unlikely"" by a team of investigators A further 1,052 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, and 12,364 more cases confirmed Edited by Sarah Collerton and Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage for today. It was written by Ella Wills, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Meierhans and George Wright, and edited by Sarah Collerton and Holly Wallis. We'll be back with more live coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Hereâs what you need to know this evening:  Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) - a group of scientists which advise government - have classed a variant first identified in Bristol - the Kent variant with a mutation - as a ""variant of concern"". Itâs not surprising that officials are adding this new
version of coronavirus to their ""variants of concern"" list. Targeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21
that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England. This new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant ""plus"". It has the same
N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that
scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra
mutation called E484K. E484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen
in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern. A cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the
E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus
rather than the Kent one. Inevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make
sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus. Experts are confident that the vaccines being used today
will still save lives and stop severe illness from Covid. As we've reported today, a series of measures are to come into force on Monday to prevent new variants of the coronavirus from being imported into the UK. Some travellers will be required to quarantine in hotels, at the cost of up to Â£1,750 for accommodation, food and tests. The changes will be applied differently across the UK - in Scotland everyone arriving from abroad will be affected, while in England and Wales hotel quarantine will be mandatory only for passengers who have recently travelled to a country hit by a new variant. The health secretary also confirmed that all international arrivals would need to take two PCR tests on days two and eight of their quarantine. Those who violate the rules will face fines and potentially up to 10 years in prison. The travel and tourism industries have said they understand why the measures are necessary, but have called on the government to do more to support firms and protect jobs. A spokeswoman for travel trade organisation Abta said that requiring passengers to pay for multiple tests once leisure travel is restarted would have ""serious cost implications"" and ""hurt demand"". She also urged ministers to ""develop a roadmap to reopen travel"". Mayeni JonesBBC News, Lagos Nigeriaâs Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says it has closed an unnamed test centre in the capital Abuja that was issuing fake Covid-19 certificates to travellers. Director general of the NCDC, Chikwe Ihekweazu, said they had found evidence that the lab was collecting samples and money from unsuspecting travellers, but failing to test them. They issued certificates claiming they had tested negative for the virus, enabling them to travel. Mr Ihekweazu added that a full list of accredited labs was available on the NCDCâs website and encouraged members of the public to only get tested at centres on the list. He said they were working on a platform where every lab in Nigeria could publish their test results which could then be easily verified by airlines or other countries wishing to check whether a result was genuine. He did not specify when this platform would be ready. Authorities in Nigeria recently suspended flights from the Emirates airline because the carrier wanted passengers from Nigeria to take a rapid Covid-19 test four hours before flying, in addition to the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Hotel chain Premier Inn has said it is investigating an allegation that staff broke Covid-19 lockdown rulesby having a party at one of its hotels. A photo showing 10 people lined up in a restaurant area has beenpublished in a newspaper,externalin Wales. The Daily Post said it understood the photo was taken at a leaving party at the Premier Inn in Holyhead, on Anglesey, on 29 January. The company said its Welsh hotels are shut in line with government guidance. Premier Inn said it had ""clear safety procedures in place for our team members to follow"". Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. The Scottish government said it would be ""block booking"" 1,300 rooms at six hotels near the country's airports. The some Â£1,750 cost of the stay will have to be borne by passengers themselves. A similar scheme will operate in other parts of the UK, but unlike Scotland, only flightsfrom countries on a ""red list"" will be covered. No hotels have yet confirmed whether rooms have been booked. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said there were approximately 1,600 Scottish arrivals in the last week of January, and numbers fell to 730 in the first week of February. He said: ""The number of travellers coming to Scotland directly is reducing and I expect these restrictions to reduce arrivals yet further. ""These measures will be backed with criminal offences as usual. The stronger approach we are taking are necessary and appropriate."" A tiger at Chessington zoo Animals are at risk of dying unless the government changes its Covid-19 funding for zoos, a charity has warned. The Zoo Animals Fund was created by the government to help zoos facing financial trouble in the pandemic with Â£100m available. In a letter to the prime minister, the British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums (Biaza) says the fund has ""failed to provide"" adequate support. It claims many zoos are unable to access the money. A spokeswoman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told Radio 1 Newsbeat the government understood challenges faced by zoos and aquariums. ""That is why we have set up the Zoo Animals Fund on top of the other support available - to ensure that those facing severe financial difficulties can continue to provide the best possible care for their animals."" Zoos are currently shut in this lockdown. Further Covid testing is being deployed in Lambeth, south London, where the South African variant has been found. The surge testing and genomic sequencing will be carried out in the SE27 0, SE27 9 and SW16 2 postcodes. People living within these areas are being urged to take a Covid-19 test this week, whether they are showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms should book a test in the usual way while others should visit their council website. Meanwhile the surge testing carried out in Woking is now complete and further data will be provided in due course, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Mass testing - or surge testing - is taking place across various parts of England to help stop the spread of new, more infectious strains of Covid-19. The South Africa variant and a new mutation of the Kent variant are those currently being targeted. More than 10,000 tests are being deployed in Manchester, after cases of the Kent variantwere found in two unconnected households. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris The French lunch hour - famous as a bastion of the French way of life - is under threat. The government says itâs planning to pass a new decree allowing workers to eat at their desks, a practice officially banned in the countryâs labour law.  But is this concession to changing times all down to coronavirus? Like many cultural ideals, the leisurely and elaborate French lunch-break is often defended more in theory than in practice. Even before Covid, the daily queues outside sandwich shops were just as daunting as the waiters straightening tables on cafÃ© terraces. In fact, several polls suggest that a majority of French workers have been eating their lunch in the office for years. But, long under siege, the concept of the pause-dÃ©jÃ©uner is now under attack from Covid as well. With restaurants and cafes closed - except for take-aways or deliveries - and workplace canteens rife with new restrictions, many people have little option but to eat their lunch at their desks - or even, according to one report, eating in isolation in their cars. The idea that eating at your desk was officially banned has been greeted with surprise - even derision - here.   Eye-rolling at Franceâs impenetrable labour laws is another workplace tradition, and thereâs comfort in hanging on to at least some of them. The first doses of Sinopharm vaccines arrived late on Sunday Peru has started its Covid vaccination campaign after the first consignment of 300,000 Sinopharm vaccines arrived on Sunday. The South American country is in the midst of a second wave of the pandemic. With the hospitals close to full capacity, the authorities have decided that medical staff should be among the first to be vaccinated. On Tuesday morning local time, Josef Vallejos, the chief of the intensive care unit at a hospital in Lima, received the first jab. Members of the military, security guards and election workers will also be given priority ahead of the general election scheduled for 11 April. Peru has had almost 1.2 million confirmed cases and more than 42,000 people have died. Earlier, the health secretary announcedtougher border measures in Englandto tackle the spread of new variants of the coronavirus - such asthe one originally found in South Africa. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, says 170 cases of the South African variant have been identified so far, including 18 that are not linked to travel. Our health editor, Michelle Roberts, saysthere's no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illnessfor most people - but there are concerns it can spread more readily than the original strain and vaccines may not work quite as well against it. More on that fact-finding mission to China. Dr Peter Daszak, who is part of the WHO team looking into the origins of Covid-19, said ""the supply chains to Huanan Seafood Market were extensive"". Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan was linked to early cases of coronavirus and was quickly closed by the authorities. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Focus needs to shift to Huanan market supply chains' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online As we've been reporting, a team of investigators led by the World Health Organization (WHO) has spent four weekslooking into the origins of Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It was unlikely that the group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Covid-19 restrictions will not be fully lifted in Northern Ireland until 70 to 80% of people have been vaccinated, the chief medical officer says. So far, about 22% of adults have received at least a first dose of a vaccine, Dr Michael McBride told a media briefing. If the rate of case numbers keeps falling, ""we will hopefully be able to do some things this summer like we did last summer"", he says. Over time new variants such as those which have emerged in South Africa and Brazil could be detected in NI, however, he says ""they may not become the dominant strain"". Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, says arrangements are being made for clinically vulnerable 16 to 18-year-olds to receive the Pfizer vaccinewithin weeks. Here are some graphs to show today's coronavirus figures. Although deaths are still high, they are coming down - and so are case numbers compared to last Tuesday. We can see that if the rate of vaccinations keeps going the way it is, the government will surpass its goal of reaching 15m people by mid-February. Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg South Africa's decision to pause its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine aftera study showed ""disappointing"" resultsagainst its new Covid-19 variant has left the nation in shock. An small preliminary trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases. One and half million doses of the jab had been bought for healthcare workers and they were due to start getting their vaccinations this week. Frontline workers have been left feeling anxious. Siviwe Gwarube, head of health for the main opposition Democratic Alliance, said the setback left them vulnerable to a third wave. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. ""I had a lot of hope that the vaccine would change the situation we're in as a country,"" a young male medic, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC. ""A lot of people are losing jobs. I'm a medical student and we are really exposed to Covid-19. It was a blow for me when I heard that the efficacy of the vaccine was lower."" Read more here Samuel LandoBBC Monitoring A video in which a Cameroonian
politician makes a series of false claims about Covid-19 vaccines and the
coronavirus pandemic has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. Andre Banda Kani - who is the
chairman of the Nouveau Mouvement Populaire (NMP), a minor political party in
Cameroon - repeats baseless conspiracy theories that Western coronavirus
vaccines cause genetic changes and contain âmicrochipsâ. The BBC hasdebunked
these claims in detail here. Kani falsely alleges that vaccination campaigns for Covid-19 are part of a âglobalistâ plot to reduce the world's population, led by influential figures like Bill Gates. Weâve written previously about how the Microsoft founder becamea popular target of coronavirus conspiracies. The video has now been removed from Facebook, but others containing false claims about vaccines are still online. More than two million people have died with Covid-19. Scientists and health experts say that vaccines are the best way of reducing deaths and protecting people against the virus. This video can not be played Covid: Matt Hancock praises doctor who DJs in scrubs A junior doctor has been performing DJ sets in his kitchen in Birmingham to boost medics' morale during the pandemic. Kishan Bodalia, 26, launched ""NHSessions"" in England's first lockdown ""to lift the spirits of my NHS colleagues and the nation as a whole"". ""I just want to help everyone dance, exercise, and above all, smile,"" he said. It's even grabbed the attention of Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who called it a ""brilliant initiative"" and picked his track of the day. ""I am so flattered to hear that the health secretary is a fan and that the project has received such recognition,"" Dr Bodalia said. A studentis due to stand trial accused of holding a partyfor about 50 people in an alleged breach of Covid-19 laws. Police said Bailey Stancer, 19, was fined Â£10,000 after officers were called to Harlaxton Drive, Lenton, Nottingham, on 11 September. Mr Stancer, of the same address, denied the charge at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Monday. The University of Nottingham student is set to face a two-day trial, starting on 4 August, at the same court. Mr Stancer was released on unconditional bail, Nottinghamshire Police added. Â© 2025 BBC.

Historic second Trump impeachment trial under way,"Donald Trump's impeachment trial will go ahead in the US Senate after a vote declaring it constitutional He is accused of inciting his supporters ahead of a deadly riot at the US Capitol on 6 January Six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats and voted to proceed Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Democrat Jamie Raskin played new, hard-hitting footage of Trump supporters ransacking the Capitol The defence lawyers argued it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through this process And they accused the Democrats of acting out of spite, to remove a political rival Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thank you for joining our live coverage of day one in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. You can keep following the story on our site, here. Here's a look back at today's key moments: It all picks back up again tomorrow at1200 EST (1700 GMT). Our live coverage will begin here at1100 EST (1600 GMT). See you then! Today's writers and editors were Tom Geoghegan, Marianna Brady, Sarah Fowler, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Tara McKelvey, Anthony Zurcher, Sam Granville, Georgina Rannard, Holly Honderich and Alice Cuddy.

If you want to read more about the Capitol riot, check out these stories:  Or are you looking for more on impeachment? This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What the Proud Boys did before president's speech The storming of the Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. The impeachment trial comes down to this one question: Did Donald Trump incite the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January? No matter what the Senate decides, the repercussions of that day tell us a frightening truth about the divided American public. BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse takes a closer look at the movements of far-right extremists on the day of the riot - and how the Proud Boys were already heading to the Capitol before President Trump had even spoken at his rally. But the vast majority of those arrested for their actions on 6 January did not have affiliations to such groups before the siege. Experts say that many more Americans have become radicalised since the election and warn that the risk of political violence could grow. A month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people,which you can read about here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington What can be done if Republicans refuse to convict Trump?- Cody, Ohio, USA Yes. The senators could censure Trump. This would be a formal denunciation and condemnation by the Senate, but holds no real penalties. Still, it would be a defeat for a man who once described himself as the âgreatest of all presidentsâ. Very little will be remembered from the first day of Trump's impeachment trial, aside from the opening video. After hours of arguments, the montage of footage from the Capitol riot that Democrats played remains the top search term in the US. It's garnered praise online, with one lawyer who worked on Trump's first impeachment calling it a ""smart"" move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's a look at what Republicans are saying about this first day of impeachment proceedings. TexasSenator John Cornyntold NBC he was not impressed by the Trump defence team. ""The presidentâs lawyer just rambled on and on,"" Cornyn said. ""Iâve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments and that was not one of the finest Iâve seen."" But Alabama CongressmanMo Brookscontinued to back the president (he was among the lawmakers to dispute the election results last month). ""Impeaching Donald Trump for inciting a riot is akin to impeaching him for Russian collusion â neither of which happened and both of which are Socialist Democrat concoctions,"" he tweeted. A Trump campaign account, meanwhile, tweeted a criticism of having Democrat Patrick Leahy chair the session. (Typically ensuring trial rules are followed is the job of the Chief Supreme Court Justice, but he declined.) ""Imagine having a 'trial' where the 'judge' had already voted to convict the defendant? 

That's what happens in banana republics, third world dictatorships and now the United States Senate. SAD!"" Conservative punditAnn Coultershared an opinion piece from political news site The Hill that suggested Republicans could unite the country by convicting Trump, commenting: ""And Democrats could unite the nation by giving them a wall in return!"" Rab is a doctor who has been very frustrated with Trump over the past four years and says his irresponsible conduct since the election merits his impeachment. He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Yes. Even before the violence at the Capitol, he made comments calling people to come to DC on 6 January and ""stop the steal"". When the president of the United States says something, people believe it. He also made comments encouraging people to fight like hell and scared them that they wouldn't have a country anymore if they didn't. We need to hold people accountable for doing things that are wrong. Six Republican senators just joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to move the trial forward. They are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. You may have heard most of those names before - Murkowski, Collins, Sasse, Toomey and Romney had previously taken a similar vote upholding the constitutionality of the trial proceedings. But Bill Cassidy is a noteworthy name on the list: he had previously voted to dismiss the trial. Cassidy later told CNN the House prosecutors made ""very good arguments"", noting he'd always planned to approach the trial ""with an open mind"" and as an ""impartial juror"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Well, that should about do it. There are going to be four days of arguments, Senate questions and, perhaps, witnesses. The final outcome, however, is all but certain. When the first substantive vote of the impeachment trial was taken on Tuesday â a vote about whether to have a trial at all â only six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats to proceed. Thatâs well short of the 17 Republicans who would be necessary to convict. And if there arenât 17 Republicans who think there should be a trial at all, it seems unlikely that the House impeachment managers are going to be able to change enough minds. Sam voted twice for Donald Trump but has turned his back on him, saying the attack on the Capitol ""made me sick to my stomach"". He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? There is not enough direct correlation and evidence for him to be convicted, so he should not be. But the impeachment in the House was a good slap on the wrist. There needed to be some sort of response to the way he handled - or didnât handle - the peaceful transfer of power. I don't think Trump himself was directly responsible for getting people riled up but I do think that he set the stage for what happened. But pursuing a conviction is just another means of tribalistic partisan politics that will further divide the country because there are still millions of Americans who voted for Trump and really like him. Alright, so in the last four hours, we've heard from House prosecutors and the Trump defence team. And we've just had a speedy vote on whether or not the trial is constitutional and can continue (it is, and it will). Now what?  Both Republicans and Democrats are keen on a speedy trial, US media report, so we could see a vote on conviction as early as this weekend if there are no witnesses to hear from. The Senate has voted 56-44 that it is constitutional to hold a trial for a president who is no longer in office. This means Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will continue, starting tomorrow. Only a simple majority was required on the measure. Now that arguments from both sides have concluded, the Senate is voting on whether or not to go forward with Trump's impeachment trial. BBC editors in Washington have cast a critical eye on how well the defence lawyers are making their case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill There is only one camera in the Senate chambers and it's not on the senators. Here's what's going on that you can't see. Republican Senators Murkowski, Collins and Graham are the studious notetakers. Senator Josh Hawley, also a Republican, was reading papers that didnât seem to be marked with the symbols of the House - so they probably weren't trial-related documents. Senator Sasse looked confused at one point and seemed to just shake his head before sharing a whisper with Senators Scott, Burr and Portman. Democratic Senator Sanders is staring straight ahead and listening to the arguments. Fellow Democrat Senator Booker is in the back of the room. He appeared to get a little restless and stood up and leaned against the back wall of the chamber. The former president's lawyers continue their arguments that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. Later tonight, the Senate will hold a vote on whether or not the trial can take place. Here are some of defence attorney David Schoen's arguments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump is facing legal troubles in Washington, and at home in Palm Beach, Florida, too. He bought his ocean-side property, an estate called Mar-a-Lago, in 1985, and spent part of his winters there. Then, after leaving the White House, he moved in. Some of his neighbours want him out, saying he will bring down property values, and have talked about evicting him. They say an agreement that was reached nearly 30 years ago, one that turned the estate into a private club, does not allow anyone to live there on a permanent basis unless they work on the premises. Trump, through a lawyer, has argued that he should be allowed to stay, as an employee. The issue is being discussed at a Palm Beach Town Council meeting on Tuesday. One of his former employees, Wes Blackman, a former project director at Mar-a-Lago, says that Trump will see the designation as an employee not as a demotion, but as an opportunity, a loophole that will allow him to stay where he is. The designation as an employee is ""convenient and expedient"", says Blackman. ""It gets him out of a tight situation."" Besides, says Blackman, the fight with his neighbours in Florida is not the biggest problem Trump is facing today. Over the course of the day, Blackman has been watching the impeachment trial in Washington, wondering how his old boss will fare. Now up, Trump lawyer David Schoen. He begins by saying it's an honour to appear in this chamber, but ""that is tempered by a feeling of grave concern"". ""My overriding emotion is frankly wanting to cry for what I believe these proceedings will do to our great long-enduring Constitution and to the American people on both sides of the great divide that now characterises our nation."" Schoen says the trial is unconstitutional and ""wrong as wrong can be"". He adds that while Democrats claim the proceedings are for accountability if that was the case, they would wait for a full investigation. He says the trial is a ""chance for partisan politicians to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scheme and to disenfranchise"" the millions of people who voted for him. Schoen says the trial is for ""pure, raw, misguided partisanship"". Much of Trump lawyer Castor's speech has focused on appealing to the patriotism of the Senate. ""The top responsibility of a US senator and the top characteristic that you all have in common... there isn't a single one of you who doesn't consider yourself a patriot of the US."" ""That is why this attack on the constitution will not prevail,"" he says, reiterating his argument that the impeachment of Trump is unconstitutional. Trump attorney, Bruce Castor Jr, denounces the Capitol riot and says those responsible ought to be prosecuted. He adds that there is a reasonable desire to ask ""how do we make them pay?"" But Castor argues that Trump should not be the scapegoat for this tragedy. ""We expect US senators to not react to popular will and emotions, but do what is right,"" Castor says. Â© 2025 BBC.

This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What the Proud Boys did before president's speech The storming of the Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. The impeachment trial comes down to this one question: Did Donald Trump incite the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January? No matter what the Senate decides, the repercussions of that day tell us a frightening truth about the divided American public. BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse takes a closer look at the movements of far-right extremists on the day of the riot - and how the Proud Boys were already heading to the Capitol before President Trump had even spoken at his rally. But the vast majority of those arrested for their actions on 6 January did not have affiliations to such groups before the siege. Experts say that many more Americans have become radicalised since the election and warn that the risk of political violence could grow. A month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people,which you can read about here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington What can be done if Republicans refuse to convict Trump?- Cody, Ohio, USA Yes. The senators could censure Trump. This would be a formal denunciation and condemnation by the Senate, but holds no real penalties. Still, it would be a defeat for a man who once described himself as the âgreatest of all presidentsâ. Very little will be remembered from the first day of Trump's impeachment trial, aside from the opening video. After hours of arguments, the montage of footage from the Capitol riot that Democrats played remains the top search term in the US. It's garnered praise online, with one lawyer who worked on Trump's first impeachment calling it a ""smart"" move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's a look at what Republicans are saying about this first day of impeachment proceedings. TexasSenator John Cornyntold NBC he was not impressed by the Trump defence team. ""The presidentâs lawyer just rambled on and on,"" Cornyn said. ""Iâve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments and that was not one of the finest Iâve seen."" But Alabama CongressmanMo Brookscontinued to back the president (he was among the lawmakers to dispute the election results last month). ""Impeaching Donald Trump for inciting a riot is akin to impeaching him for Russian collusion â neither of which happened and both of which are Socialist Democrat concoctions,"" he tweeted. A Trump campaign account, meanwhile, tweeted a criticism of having Democrat Patrick Leahy chair the session. (Typically ensuring trial rules are followed is the job of the Chief Supreme Court Justice, but he declined.) ""Imagine having a 'trial' where the 'judge' had already voted to convict the defendant? 

That's what happens in banana republics, third world dictatorships and now the United States Senate. SAD!"" Conservative punditAnn Coultershared an opinion piece from political news site The Hill that suggested Republicans could unite the country by convicting Trump, commenting: ""And Democrats could unite the nation by giving them a wall in return!"" Rab is a doctor who has been very frustrated with Trump over the past four years and says his irresponsible conduct since the election merits his impeachment. He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Yes. Even before the violence at the Capitol, he made comments calling people to come to DC on 6 January and ""stop the steal"". When the president of the United States says something, people believe it. He also made comments encouraging people to fight like hell and scared them that they wouldn't have a country anymore if they didn't. We need to hold people accountable for doing things that are wrong. Six Republican senators just joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to move the trial forward. They are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. You may have heard most of those names before - Murkowski, Collins, Sasse, Toomey and Romney had previously taken a similar vote upholding the constitutionality of the trial proceedings. But Bill Cassidy is a noteworthy name on the list: he had previously voted to dismiss the trial. Cassidy later told CNN the House prosecutors made ""very good arguments"", noting he'd always planned to approach the trial ""with an open mind"" and as an ""impartial juror"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Well, that should about do it. There are going to be four days of arguments, Senate questions and, perhaps, witnesses. The final outcome, however, is all but certain. When the first substantive vote of the impeachment trial was taken on Tuesday â a vote about whether to have a trial at all â only six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats to proceed. Thatâs well short of the 17 Republicans who would be necessary to convict. And if there arenât 17 Republicans who think there should be a trial at all, it seems unlikely that the House impeachment managers are going to be able to change enough minds. Sam voted twice for Donald Trump but has turned his back on him, saying the attack on the Capitol ""made me sick to my stomach"". He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? There is not enough direct correlation and evidence for him to be convicted, so he should not be. But the impeachment in the House was a good slap on the wrist. There needed to be some sort of response to the way he handled - or didnât handle - the peaceful transfer of power. I don't think Trump himself was directly responsible for getting people riled up but I do think that he set the stage for what happened. But pursuing a conviction is just another means of tribalistic partisan politics that will further divide the country because there are still millions of Americans who voted for Trump and really like him. Alright, so in the last four hours, we've heard from House prosecutors and the Trump defence team. And we've just had a speedy vote on whether or not the trial is constitutional and can continue (it is, and it will). Now what?  Both Republicans and Democrats are keen on a speedy trial, US media report, so we could see a vote on conviction as early as this weekend if there are no witnesses to hear from. The Senate has voted 56-44 that it is constitutional to hold a trial for a president who is no longer in office. This means Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will continue, starting tomorrow. Only a simple majority was required on the measure. Now that arguments from both sides have concluded, the Senate is voting on whether or not to go forward with Trump's impeachment trial. BBC editors in Washington have cast a critical eye on how well the defence lawyers are making their case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill There is only one camera in the Senate chambers and it's not on the senators. Here's what's going on that you can't see. Republican Senators Murkowski, Collins and Graham are the studious notetakers. Senator Josh Hawley, also a Republican, was reading papers that didnât seem to be marked with the symbols of the House - so they probably weren't trial-related documents. Senator Sasse looked confused at one point and seemed to just shake his head before sharing a whisper with Senators Scott, Burr and Portman. Democratic Senator Sanders is staring straight ahead and listening to the arguments. Fellow Democrat Senator Booker is in the back of the room. He appeared to get a little restless and stood up and leaned against the back wall of the chamber. The former president's lawyers continue their arguments that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. Later tonight, the Senate will hold a vote on whether or not the trial can take place. Here are some of defence attorney David Schoen's arguments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump is facing legal troubles in Washington, and at home in Palm Beach, Florida, too. He bought his ocean-side property, an estate called Mar-a-Lago, in 1985, and spent part of his winters there. Then, after leaving the White House, he moved in. Some of his neighbours want him out, saying he will bring down property values, and have talked about evicting him. They say an agreement that was reached nearly 30 years ago, one that turned the estate into a private club, does not allow anyone to live there on a permanent basis unless they work on the premises. Trump, through a lawyer, has argued that he should be allowed to stay, as an employee. The issue is being discussed at a Palm Beach Town Council meeting on Tuesday. One of his former employees, Wes Blackman, a former project director at Mar-a-Lago, says that Trump will see the designation as an employee not as a demotion, but as an opportunity, a loophole that will allow him to stay where he is. The designation as an employee is ""convenient and expedient"", says Blackman. ""It gets him out of a tight situation."" Besides, says Blackman, the fight with his neighbours in Florida is not the biggest problem Trump is facing today. Over the course of the day, Blackman has been watching the impeachment trial in Washington, wondering how his old boss will fare. Now up, Trump lawyer David Schoen. He begins by saying it's an honour to appear in this chamber, but ""that is tempered by a feeling of grave concern"". ""My overriding emotion is frankly wanting to cry for what I believe these proceedings will do to our great long-enduring Constitution and to the American people on both sides of the great divide that now characterises our nation."" Schoen says the trial is unconstitutional and ""wrong as wrong can be"". He adds that while Democrats claim the proceedings are for accountability if that was the case, they would wait for a full investigation. He says the trial is a ""chance for partisan politicians to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scheme and to disenfranchise"" the millions of people who voted for him. Schoen says the trial is for ""pure, raw, misguided partisanship"". Much of Trump lawyer Castor's speech has focused on appealing to the patriotism of the Senate. ""The top responsibility of a US senator and the top characteristic that you all have in common... there isn't a single one of you who doesn't consider yourself a patriot of the US."" ""That is why this attack on the constitution will not prevail,"" he says, reiterating his argument that the impeachment of Trump is unconstitutional. Trump attorney, Bruce Castor Jr, denounces the Capitol riot and says those responsible ought to be prosecuted. He adds that there is a reasonable desire to ask ""how do we make them pay?"" But Castor argues that Trump should not be the scapegoat for this tragedy. ""We expect US senators to not react to popular will and emotions, but do what is right,"" Castor says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Frost: UK relations with EU 'more than bumpy'The UK's chief Brexit negotiator says Brussels must adopt a ""different spirit"" towards its neighbour.","This video can not be played Lord Frost calls for ""different spirit"" from Brussels The UK's chief Brexit negotiator has criticised the EU for its actions since the trade deal agreed by the two sides came into force six weeks ago. Lord David Frost said the relationship had been ""more than bumpy"" and more ""problematic"" than he had hoped. He told a committee the EU'sthreat to increase controls on vaccine exports to Northern Ireland, as well as ""niggling border issues"", were two examples. Lord Frost called for ""a different spirit"" from Brussels going forward. Asked about his thoughts on the situation, Cabinet Officer Minister Michael Gove compared it to a bumpy start to a flight, saying: ""We all know that when an aeroplane takes off, that is the point where you sometimes get an increased level of turbulence. ""But eventually, you then reach a cruising altitude and the crew tell you to take your seatbelt off and enjoy a gin and tonic and some peanuts."" He added: ""We are not at the gin and tonic and peanut stage yet, but I am confident we will be."" Brexit: What are the key points of the deal? Brexit: Irish Sea border issues foreseen when deal was done 'Pandora's Box' opened over UK-EU vaccine row The post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU came into force on 1 January after negotiations came to a rushed end on Christmas Eve. Lord Frost said the UK wanted ""friendly cooperation between sovereign equals as our vision of the future"", but said: ""I don't think it has been quite the experience of the last few weeks, if we are honest about it."" He added: ""I think the EU is still adjusting somewhat, as we thought they might, to the existence of a genuinely independent actor in their neighbourhood."" Lord Frost - who now acts as the prime minister's representative on Brexit,after his offer to be National Security Adviser was taken back- listed a number of issues that had arisen in the first few weeks of the deal being in place. Speaking to a Lords committee on the EU, he said a threat from the EU to control vaccine exports to Northern Ireland -which was later revoked- had created ""political difficulties... which played back into the broader relationship"". He said criticism of the Oxford AstraZenica vaccine by EU figures -including French President Emmanuel Macron- and the bloc's decision to introducean indefinite ban on UK shellfishadded to the problems. And an ongoing row aboutthe diplomatic status of ambassadors to the UK and EU""obviously does not help the good conduct of business"", along with a possible request from Brussels to extend the timetable for the European parliament to ratify the deal. Lord Frost led the negotiations for the UK throughout 2020 ""None of those things are in themselves dramatic, although some have been very, very serious,"" said Lord Frost. ""I think it has been more than bumpy in the last six weeks, I think it has been problematic. ""I hope we will get over this. It is going to require a different spirit, probably, from the EU, but I am sure we are going to see that and some of this subside as we go forward.""

'I fought off dognappers who threatened to stab me',"Pub landlord James Cosens claims two men threatened to stab him as they tried to steal his puppy A claim ""dognappers"" threatened to stab a dog owner out for a walk is being investigated by police. Former amateur boxer James Cosens said he fought off two attackers as he would not hand over his 20-week-old collie Rosie while out for a walk last Friday. The 29-year-old father and pub landlord was on Millennium Coastal Path near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire when he was threatened by two men. Dyfed Powys Police is investigating the ""extremely rare"" incident. It comes as police warn that dog theft has risen during the Covid lockdowns because prices of animals have increased - with the RSPCA saying criminals have even impersonated their officers in an attempt to steal pets. Mr Cosens said his dog Rosie ran up to the two strangers at the Morfa Berwig Nature Reserve near Bynea - and one of them picked her up and said: ""I am taking your dog. If you try to take her back I will stab you."" More arrests as 28 stolen dogs returned to owners 'Eighty stolen dogs' rescued in police raids Lockdown year 'worst ever' for dog thefts The former light-heavyweight amateur fighter, who moved to the area with wife Samantha and toddler Jacob last August, said he used his boxing skills to fend off the attackers. Mr Cosens said that despite the threats of the attackers, he did not see any weapons - and rescued Rosie after a ""struggle"". He posted details of the attack on social media to warn others - and Mr Cosens has contacted his local MP Nia Griffith. The dognappers allegedly struck while Mr Cosens was walking his dog at Morfa Berwig Nature Reserve He is concerned as not everyone in the same situation would be able to defend themselves. ""I think they're probably more used to targeting the vulnerable - the elderly, children maybe,"" Mr Cosens said. ""But they saw a young pup and thought it's worth the risk to have a go and take her. Police said the men were described as one being in his 40s, around 6ft tall, of stocky build, and wearing light blue jeans and a dark puffer jacket and the other in his 20s, around 5ft 6in tall, and wearing similar clothing. ""We are aware that news of this incident is causing a high level of concern among dog owners in Llanelli and the surrounding area, some of whom are now fearful of walking their pets,"" said Insp Shaun Bowen of Dyfed-Powys Police. ""The incident in Bynea is at present isolated in terms of an individual being targeted while walking their dog, and we have received no further reports. ""We urge people to continue to take their usual safety measures while not reacting out of fear, but please do report any incidents or suspicious behaviour to us."" Police have warned that organised criminals are turning to dog theft amid a rise in demand for puppies during lockdown - saying2020 was one of the ""worst ever"". ""Dog theft can be a devastating crime for families and causes considerable distress to owners,"" said Ms Blackman, of the National Police Chiefs Council. More than 80 stolen dogs were rescued by police in just one weekend in January ""Whilst it is still a very rare crime, it's sadly something we have seen increasing recently. ""During the coronavirus pandemic, criminals have adjusted their activities and are taking advantage of the big demand for pets over the lockdown period. ""The cost of a puppy has considerably increased over the past year making this a lucrative market for organised criminals to exploit."" She warned pet owners to be careful posting pictures of their new puppy on social media, and for buyers to consider where the animal had come from. Some criminals are also pretending to be from animal charities in a bid to steal pets from people. ""It's really quite shocking and very worrying to hear people are impersonating RSPCA officials as a means to gain access to their beloved pets,"" said Dr Jane Tyson of the RSPCA. She reassured the public that personnel from the RSPCA will ""always wear an identity badge and a branded uniform"". Dr Tyson advised owners not to leave their dog unattended - either outside a shop or inside a car - and ensure gardens are secure. According to the Dogs Trust, there was a 62% year-on-year increase in the number of enquiries from people looking to adopt a rescue dog in 2020. This video can not be played An organised crime expert on the rising number of dog thefts in the UK At the start of January, there were more than 1,000 adverts for dogs on three of the largest classified websites - a 59% year-on-year increase. The charity said it is also seeing huge increases in puppy prices, as sellers capitalise on demand.""Demand for dogs is at an all-time high,"" said Dogs Trust's chief executive Owen Sharp. In October, MPs debated two petitions, signed by almost 300,000 people,urging the government to make pet theft a specific offence- and the Dogs Trust has called for tougher sentences. ""Current sentencing does very little to deter thieves and does not take into consideration how devastating it can be to have your dog taken from you,"" added Mr Sharp. ""At the very least, a community order or custodial sentence being given, rather than a fine.""

Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO,"This video can not be played Dr Peter Daszak: ""Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market"" International experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China. Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) mission, said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus spread from a lab leak in the city of Wuhan. He said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus. The investigation could now focus on South East Asia, one expert said. The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission. Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, is the first place in the world that the virus was detected in 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Dr Embarek told a press conference the investigation had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed the picture of the outbreak. Experts believe the virus is likely to have originated in animals before spreading to humans, but they are not sure how. Wuhan- City of silence 'Wuhan whistleblower' remembered one year on Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial Dr Embarek said work to identify the origins of Covid-19 pointed to a ""natural reservoir"" in bats, but it was unlikely that this happened in Wuhan. He said identifying the animal pathway remained a ""work in progress"", but that it was ""most likely"" to have crossed over to humans from an intermediary species. The experts also said there was ""no indication"" that the virus was circulating in Wuhan before the first official cases were recorded there in December 2019. Liang Wannian, an expert with China's Health Commission, said Covid-19 could have been in other regions before it was detected in Wuhan. The team called for further investigation into the possibility of ""cold chain"" transmission, referring to the transport and trade of frozen food. Dr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia. ""We've done a lot of work in China and if you map that back it starts to point towards the border and we know that there is very little surveillance on the other side in the whole region of South East Asia,"" he told the BBC's John Sudworth in Wuhan. ""China is a very big place and South East Asia is a very big place. The supply chains to the Huanan seafood market were extensive, they were coming in from other countries, they were coming in from various parts of China, so to really trace that back it's going to take some work."" He added that the focus should now be on those supply chains. The WHO mission began in January, following months of negotiations with Beijing. The experts' visit was closely-monitored by the Chinese authorities. It was unlikely that the expert group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic in China a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Speculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump. In April,US state department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. The office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. But Dr Embarek said a visit to the laboratory during the mission showed it was ""very unlikely"" that anything could have leaked out. He said the laboratory theory was ""not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies"". Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial The road back to Wuhan.

If you want to read more about the Capitol riot, check out these stories:  Or are you looking for more on impeachment? This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What the Proud Boys did before president's speech The storming of the Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. The impeachment trial comes down to this one question: Did Donald Trump incite the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January? No matter what the Senate decides, the repercussions of that day tell us a frightening truth about the divided American public. BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse takes a closer look at the movements of far-right extremists on the day of the riot - and how the Proud Boys were already heading to the Capitol before President Trump had even spoken at his rally. But the vast majority of those arrested for their actions on 6 January did not have affiliations to such groups before the siege. Experts say that many more Americans have become radicalised since the election and warn that the risk of political violence could grow. A month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people,which you can read about here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington What can be done if Republicans refuse to convict Trump?- Cody, Ohio, USA Yes. The senators could censure Trump. This would be a formal denunciation and condemnation by the Senate, but holds no real penalties. Still, it would be a defeat for a man who once described himself as the âgreatest of all presidentsâ. Very little will be remembered from the first day of Trump's impeachment trial, aside from the opening video. After hours of arguments, the montage of footage from the Capitol riot that Democrats played remains the top search term in the US. It's garnered praise online, with one lawyer who worked on Trump's first impeachment calling it a ""smart"" move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's a look at what Republicans are saying about this first day of impeachment proceedings. TexasSenator John Cornyntold NBC he was not impressed by the Trump defence team. ""The presidentâs lawyer just rambled on and on,"" Cornyn said. ""Iâve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments and that was not one of the finest Iâve seen."" But Alabama CongressmanMo Brookscontinued to back the president (he was among the lawmakers to dispute the election results last month). ""Impeaching Donald Trump for inciting a riot is akin to impeaching him for Russian collusion â neither of which happened and both of which are Socialist Democrat concoctions,"" he tweeted. A Trump campaign account, meanwhile, tweeted a criticism of having Democrat Patrick Leahy chair the session. (Typically ensuring trial rules are followed is the job of the Chief Supreme Court Justice, but he declined.) ""Imagine having a 'trial' where the 'judge' had already voted to convict the defendant? 

That's what happens in banana republics, third world dictatorships and now the United States Senate. SAD!"" Conservative punditAnn Coultershared an opinion piece from political news site The Hill that suggested Republicans could unite the country by convicting Trump, commenting: ""And Democrats could unite the nation by giving them a wall in return!"" Rab is a doctor who has been very frustrated with Trump over the past four years and says his irresponsible conduct since the election merits his impeachment. He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Yes. Even before the violence at the Capitol, he made comments calling people to come to DC on 6 January and ""stop the steal"". When the president of the United States says something, people believe it. He also made comments encouraging people to fight like hell and scared them that they wouldn't have a country anymore if they didn't. We need to hold people accountable for doing things that are wrong. Six Republican senators just joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to move the trial forward. They are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. You may have heard most of those names before - Murkowski, Collins, Sasse, Toomey and Romney had previously taken a similar vote upholding the constitutionality of the trial proceedings. But Bill Cassidy is a noteworthy name on the list: he had previously voted to dismiss the trial. Cassidy later told CNN the House prosecutors made ""very good arguments"", noting he'd always planned to approach the trial ""with an open mind"" and as an ""impartial juror"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Well, that should about do it. There are going to be four days of arguments, Senate questions and, perhaps, witnesses. The final outcome, however, is all but certain. When the first substantive vote of the impeachment trial was taken on Tuesday â a vote about whether to have a trial at all â only six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats to proceed. Thatâs well short of the 17 Republicans who would be necessary to convict. And if there arenât 17 Republicans who think there should be a trial at all, it seems unlikely that the House impeachment managers are going to be able to change enough minds. Sam voted twice for Donald Trump but has turned his back on him, saying the attack on the Capitol ""made me sick to my stomach"". He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? There is not enough direct correlation and evidence for him to be convicted, so he should not be. But the impeachment in the House was a good slap on the wrist. There needed to be some sort of response to the way he handled - or didnât handle - the peaceful transfer of power. I don't think Trump himself was directly responsible for getting people riled up but I do think that he set the stage for what happened. But pursuing a conviction is just another means of tribalistic partisan politics that will further divide the country because there are still millions of Americans who voted for Trump and really like him. Alright, so in the last four hours, we've heard from House prosecutors and the Trump defence team. And we've just had a speedy vote on whether or not the trial is constitutional and can continue (it is, and it will). Now what?  Both Republicans and Democrats are keen on a speedy trial, US media report, so we could see a vote on conviction as early as this weekend if there are no witnesses to hear from. The Senate has voted 56-44 that it is constitutional to hold a trial for a president who is no longer in office. This means Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will continue, starting tomorrow. Only a simple majority was required on the measure. Now that arguments from both sides have concluded, the Senate is voting on whether or not to go forward with Trump's impeachment trial. BBC editors in Washington have cast a critical eye on how well the defence lawyers are making their case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill There is only one camera in the Senate chambers and it's not on the senators. Here's what's going on that you can't see. Republican Senators Murkowski, Collins and Graham are the studious notetakers. Senator Josh Hawley, also a Republican, was reading papers that didnât seem to be marked with the symbols of the House - so they probably weren't trial-related documents. Senator Sasse looked confused at one point and seemed to just shake his head before sharing a whisper with Senators Scott, Burr and Portman. Democratic Senator Sanders is staring straight ahead and listening to the arguments. Fellow Democrat Senator Booker is in the back of the room. He appeared to get a little restless and stood up and leaned against the back wall of the chamber. The former president's lawyers continue their arguments that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. Later tonight, the Senate will hold a vote on whether or not the trial can take place. Here are some of defence attorney David Schoen's arguments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump is facing legal troubles in Washington, and at home in Palm Beach, Florida, too. He bought his ocean-side property, an estate called Mar-a-Lago, in 1985, and spent part of his winters there. Then, after leaving the White House, he moved in. Some of his neighbours want him out, saying he will bring down property values, and have talked about evicting him. They say an agreement that was reached nearly 30 years ago, one that turned the estate into a private club, does not allow anyone to live there on a permanent basis unless they work on the premises. Trump, through a lawyer, has argued that he should be allowed to stay, as an employee. The issue is being discussed at a Palm Beach Town Council meeting on Tuesday. One of his former employees, Wes Blackman, a former project director at Mar-a-Lago, says that Trump will see the designation as an employee not as a demotion, but as an opportunity, a loophole that will allow him to stay where he is. The designation as an employee is ""convenient and expedient"", says Blackman. ""It gets him out of a tight situation."" Besides, says Blackman, the fight with his neighbours in Florida is not the biggest problem Trump is facing today. Over the course of the day, Blackman has been watching the impeachment trial in Washington, wondering how his old boss will fare. Now up, Trump lawyer David Schoen. He begins by saying it's an honour to appear in this chamber, but ""that is tempered by a feeling of grave concern"". ""My overriding emotion is frankly wanting to cry for what I believe these proceedings will do to our great long-enduring Constitution and to the American people on both sides of the great divide that now characterises our nation."" Schoen says the trial is unconstitutional and ""wrong as wrong can be"". He adds that while Democrats claim the proceedings are for accountability if that was the case, they would wait for a full investigation. He says the trial is a ""chance for partisan politicians to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scheme and to disenfranchise"" the millions of people who voted for him. Schoen says the trial is for ""pure, raw, misguided partisanship"". Much of Trump lawyer Castor's speech has focused on appealing to the patriotism of the Senate. ""The top responsibility of a US senator and the top characteristic that you all have in common... there isn't a single one of you who doesn't consider yourself a patriot of the US."" ""That is why this attack on the constitution will not prevail,"" he says, reiterating his argument that the impeachment of Trump is unconstitutional. Trump attorney, Bruce Castor Jr, denounces the Capitol riot and says those responsible ought to be prosecuted. He adds that there is a reasonable desire to ask ""how do we make them pay?"" But Castor argues that Trump should not be the scapegoat for this tragedy. ""We expect US senators to not react to popular will and emotions, but do what is right,"" Castor says. Â© 2025 BBC.

You can keep following the story on our site, here. Here's a look back at today's key moments: It all picks back up again tomorrow at1200 EST (1700 GMT). Our live coverage will begin here at1100 EST (1600 GMT). See you then! Today's writers and editors were Tom Geoghegan, Marianna Brady, Sarah Fowler, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Tara McKelvey, Anthony Zurcher, Sam Granville, Georgina Rannard, Holly Honderich and Alice Cuddy. It's been a long day of impeachment proceedings, but if you haven't had your fill of US politics yet, we understand. If you want to read more about the Capitol riot, check out these stories:  Or are you looking for more on impeachment? This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What the Proud Boys did before president's speech The storming of the Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. The impeachment trial comes down to this one question: Did Donald Trump incite the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January? No matter what the Senate decides, the repercussions of that day tell us a frightening truth about the divided American public. BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse takes a closer look at the movements of far-right extremists on the day of the riot - and how the Proud Boys were already heading to the Capitol before President Trump had even spoken at his rally. But the vast majority of those arrested for their actions on 6 January did not have affiliations to such groups before the siege. Experts say that many more Americans have become radicalised since the election and warn that the risk of political violence could grow. A month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people,which you can read about here.

"'I fought off dognappers who threatened to stab me'Police investigating attack on former amateur boxer in a nature reserve amid a rise in ""dognapping"".","Pub landlord James Cosens claims two men threatened to stab him as they tried to steal his puppy A claim ""dognappers"" threatened to stab a dog owner out for a walk is being investigated by police. Former amateur boxer James Cosens said he fought off two attackers as he would not hand over his 20-week-old collie Rosie while out for a walk last Friday. The 29-year-old father and pub landlord was on Millennium Coastal Path near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire when he was threatened by two men. Dyfed Powys Police is investigating the ""extremely rare"" incident. It comes as police warn that dog theft has risen during the Covid lockdowns because prices of animals have increased - with the RSPCA saying criminals have even impersonated their officers in an attempt to steal pets. Mr Cosens said his dog Rosie ran up to the two strangers at the Morfa Berwig Nature Reserve near Bynea - and one of them picked her up and said: ""I am taking your dog. If you try to take her back I will stab you."" More arrests as 28 stolen dogs returned to owners 'Eighty stolen dogs' rescued in police raids Lockdown year 'worst ever' for dog thefts The former light-heavyweight amateur fighter, who moved to the area with wife Samantha and toddler Jacob last August, said he used his boxing skills to fend off the attackers. Mr Cosens said that despite the threats of the attackers, he did not see any weapons - and rescued Rosie after a ""struggle"". He posted details of the attack on social media to warn others - and Mr Cosens has contacted his local MP Nia Griffith. The dognappers allegedly struck while Mr Cosens was walking his dog at Morfa Berwig Nature Reserve He is concerned as not everyone in the same situation would be able to defend themselves. ""I think they're probably more used to targeting the vulnerable - the elderly, children maybe,"" Mr Cosens said. ""But they saw a young pup and thought it's worth the risk to have a go and take her. Police said the men were described as one being in his 40s, around 6ft tall, of stocky build, and wearing light blue jeans and a dark puffer jacket and the other in his 20s, around 5ft 6in tall, and wearing similar clothing. ""We are aware that news of this incident is causing a high level of concern among dog owners in Llanelli and the surrounding area, some of whom are now fearful of walking their pets,"" said Insp Shaun Bowen of Dyfed-Powys Police. ""The incident in Bynea is at present isolated in terms of an individual being targeted while walking their dog, and we have received no further reports. ""We urge people to continue to take their usual safety measures while not reacting out of fear, but please do report any incidents or suspicious behaviour to us."" Police have warned that organised criminals are turning to dog theft amid a rise in demand for puppies during lockdown - saying2020 was one of the ""worst ever"". ""Dog theft can be a devastating crime for families and causes considerable distress to owners,"" said Ms Blackman, of the National Police Chiefs Council. More than 80 stolen dogs were rescued by police in just one weekend in January ""Whilst it is still a very rare crime, it's sadly something we have seen increasing recently. ""During the coronavirus pandemic, criminals have adjusted their activities and are taking advantage of the big demand for pets over the lockdown period. ""The cost of a puppy has considerably increased over the past year making this a lucrative market for organised criminals to exploit."" She warned pet owners to be careful posting pictures of their new puppy on social media, and for buyers to consider where the animal had come from. Some criminals are also pretending to be from animal charities in a bid to steal pets from people. ""It's really quite shocking and very worrying to hear people are impersonating RSPCA officials as a means to gain access to their beloved pets,"" said Dr Jane Tyson of the RSPCA. She reassured the public that personnel from the RSPCA will ""always wear an identity badge and a branded uniform"". Dr Tyson advised owners not to leave their dog unattended - either outside a shop or inside a car - and ensure gardens are secure. According to the Dogs Trust, there was a 62% year-on-year increase in the number of enquiries from people looking to adopt a rescue dog in 2020. This video can not be played An organised crime expert on the rising number of dog thefts in the UK At the start of January, there were more than 1,000 adverts for dogs on three of the largest classified websites - a 59% year-on-year increase. The charity said it is also seeing huge increases in puppy prices, as sellers capitalise on demand.""Demand for dogs is at an all-time high,"" said Dogs Trust's chief executive Owen Sharp. In October, MPs debated two petitions, signed by almost 300,000 people,urging the government to make pet theft a specific offence- and the Dogs Trust has called for tougher sentences. ""Current sentencing does very little to deter thieves and does not take into consideration how devastating it can be to have your dog taken from you,"" added Mr Sharp. ""At the very least, a community order or custodial sentence being given, rather than a fine.""

"Brexit worse than feared, says JD Sports boss","The boss of one of Britain's big retailers says Brexit has turned out to be ""considerably worse"" than he feared. Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports, said the red tape and delays in shipping goods to mainland Europe meant ""double-digit millions"" in extra costs. He told the BBC JD Sports may open an EU-based distribution centre to ease the problems, which would mean creating jobs overseas and not in the UK. The government said it is providing businesses with support. Mr Cowgill's criticism echoes that from exporters and importers across the UK. New UK-EU trade rules came into operation on 1 January. But since then, there has been growing concern from businesses as diverse as seafood exporters from Scotland and food suppliers shipping products to Northern Ireland. Fishing taskforce to tackle Brexit export 'issues' How many trade deals has the UK done? Mr Cowgill told the BBC's World at One that there is no true free trade with the EU, because goods that JD Sports imports from East Asia incur tariffs when they go to its stores across Europe. He said: ""I actually think it was not properly thought out. All the spin that was put on it about being free trade and free movement has not been the reality. ""The new system and red tape just slows down efficiency. The freedom of movement and obstacles are quite difficult at the moment. I don't see that regulatory paperwork easing much in the short term,"" Mr Cowgill said. Opening a big warehouse distribution centre in mainland Europe ""would make a lot of economic sense,"" he said. He estimated such a facility would employ about 1,000 people. While JD Sports' existing warehouse in Rochdale would not close, ""it would mean the transfer of a number of jobs into Europe,"" Mr Cowgill said. He also warned that the UK needed a complete overhaul of business rates and rents if the High Street was to survive. ""It is basic economics,"" he said. ""Bricks and mortar retailing is becoming uneconomic."" Mr Cowgill had particular criticism for the government's decision-making on forcing non-essential shops to close, while allowing essential shops to stay open. In reality, that meant supermarkets could sell clothes, while firms such as JD Sports had to shut. ""Some essential retailers have been making hay out of selling clothes, whilst clothing retailers have been closed. It is bizarre,"" he said. The Cabinet Office said in a statement: ""We know that some businesses are facing challenges with specific aspects of our new trading relationship, and that's why we are operating export helplines, running webinars with experts and offering businesses support via our network of 300 international trade advisers. 'We will ensure businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and to seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets and explore our newfound regulatory freedoms."" Last weekend, the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said exports to the EU had fallen as much as 68% since 1 January due to Brexit border hold-ups. But the government has said freight movements are now close to normal levels, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. On Monday, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told a committee of MPs that the RHA's claims were ""erroneous"" and ""based on a partial survey"". He added that ""truer figures"" were published on the Cabinet Office website, adding that the port of Dover saw 90% of normal levels of traffic on Monday. Mr Gove acknowledged that traders faced issues with exports and imports to and from the EU, but said it was ""important to put it in context"".

"'Under-loved' fish renamed to boost British salesThe spider crab and megrim sole are to be rebranded to get rid of ""negative connotations"".CornwallComments","Spider crab is to be sold as Cornish King crab Fishermen are to rename two of their biggest exports in a bid to attract British consumers after post-Brexit difficulties selling to the EU. Megrim sole is to be sold as Cornish sole, with spider crab being rebranded as Cornish King crab. It is being driven by the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO) after research with chefs and consumers. Paul Trebilcock from the CFPO said: ""There is something about the names that has negative connotations."" Both species primarily rely on exports to Europe, which he explained that ""in the current climate is not a pleasant experience"". ""The two species are particularly under-loved in this country but really popular with some of our export markets."" Padstow is one fishing town that could benefit from the name changes Each year about 1,000 tonnes of megrim sole is brought into Newlyn, Cornwall's biggest fish market, with 98% exported. About 85% of spider crab is exported, mainly to Spain. Trade has been disrupted this year by the extra paperwork and border checks required after Brexit. Chef Jack Stein said megrim sole had a taste similar to plaice Mr Trebilcock said: ""Our investigation revealed that simply by calling it Cornish sole, straight away more people were willing to to try it and were more interested in finding out where it came from."" Johnny Murt, a shell fisherman off Padstow, said: ""It can only be a good thing."" ""It is a hard sell but if the rebranding can just get people to taste it, they will immediately realise just how good spider crab is,"" he said. Stein's chef director Jack Stein is the son of restaurateur Rick Stein Chef Jack Stein agreed and said spider crab and megrim sole were both ""good value and delicious"". He said spider crab was very sustainable with ""amazing quality meat and there is just so much of it in the summer"" but lots of it was sold in the EU. Similarly megrim sole had a ""lovely taste"" similar to plaice, he said. ""With a bit of a rebrand and a bit of a publicity drive we might be able to eat more of it in this country,"" he added.

Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHOA team of international and Chinese experts say more work is needed to identify the source of the virus.China,"This video can not be played Dr Peter Daszak: ""Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market"" International experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China. Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) mission, said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus spread from a lab leak in the city of Wuhan. He said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus. The investigation could now focus on South East Asia, one expert said. The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission. Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, is the first place in the world that the virus was detected in 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Dr Embarek told a press conference the investigation had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed the picture of the outbreak. Experts believe the virus is likely to have originated in animals before spreading to humans, but they are not sure how. Wuhan- City of silence 'Wuhan whistleblower' remembered one year on Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial Dr Embarek said work to identify the origins of Covid-19 pointed to a ""natural reservoir"" in bats, but it was unlikely that this happened in Wuhan. He said identifying the animal pathway remained a ""work in progress"", but that it was ""most likely"" to have crossed over to humans from an intermediary species. The experts also said there was ""no indication"" that the virus was circulating in Wuhan before the first official cases were recorded there in December 2019. Liang Wannian, an expert with China's Health Commission, said Covid-19 could have been in other regions before it was detected in Wuhan. The team called for further investigation into the possibility of ""cold chain"" transmission, referring to the transport and trade of frozen food. Dr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia. ""We've done a lot of work in China and if you map that back it starts to point towards the border and we know that there is very little surveillance on the other side in the whole region of South East Asia,"" he told the BBC's John Sudworth in Wuhan. ""China is a very big place and South East Asia is a very big place. The supply chains to the Huanan seafood market were extensive, they were coming in from other countries, they were coming in from various parts of China, so to really trace that back it's going to take some work."" He added that the focus should now be on those supply chains. The WHO mission began in January, following months of negotiations with Beijing. The experts' visit was closely-monitored by the Chinese authorities. It was unlikely that the expert group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic in China a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Speculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump. In April,US state department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. The office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. But Dr Embarek said a visit to the laboratory during the mission showed it was ""very unlikely"" that anything could have leaked out. He said the laboratory theory was ""not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies"". Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial The road back to Wuhan.

"Brexit worse than feared, says JD Sports bossChairman Peter Cowgill says the new EU trade deal has meant ""double-digit millions"" in extra costs.BusinessComments","The boss of one of Britain's big retailers says Brexit has turned out to be ""considerably worse"" than he feared. Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports, said the red tape and delays in shipping goods to mainland Europe meant ""double-digit millions"" in extra costs. He told the BBC JD Sports may open an EU-based distribution centre to ease the problems, which would mean creating jobs overseas and not in the UK. The government said it is providing businesses with support. Mr Cowgill's criticism echoes that from exporters and importers across the UK. New UK-EU trade rules came into operation on 1 January. But since then, there has been growing concern from businesses as diverse as seafood exporters from Scotland and food suppliers shipping products to Northern Ireland. Fishing taskforce to tackle Brexit export 'issues' How many trade deals has the UK done? Mr Cowgill told the BBC's World at One that there is no true free trade with the EU, because goods that JD Sports imports from East Asia incur tariffs when they go to its stores across Europe. He said: ""I actually think it was not properly thought out. All the spin that was put on it about being free trade and free movement has not been the reality. ""The new system and red tape just slows down efficiency. The freedom of movement and obstacles are quite difficult at the moment. I don't see that regulatory paperwork easing much in the short term,"" Mr Cowgill said. Opening a big warehouse distribution centre in mainland Europe ""would make a lot of economic sense,"" he said. He estimated such a facility would employ about 1,000 people. While JD Sports' existing warehouse in Rochdale would not close, ""it would mean the transfer of a number of jobs into Europe,"" Mr Cowgill said. He also warned that the UK needed a complete overhaul of business rates and rents if the High Street was to survive. ""It is basic economics,"" he said. ""Bricks and mortar retailing is becoming uneconomic."" Mr Cowgill had particular criticism for the government's decision-making on forcing non-essential shops to close, while allowing essential shops to stay open. In reality, that meant supermarkets could sell clothes, while firms such as JD Sports had to shut. ""Some essential retailers have been making hay out of selling clothes, whilst clothing retailers have been closed. It is bizarre,"" he said. The Cabinet Office said in a statement: ""We know that some businesses are facing challenges with specific aspects of our new trading relationship, and that's why we are operating export helplines, running webinars with experts and offering businesses support via our network of 300 international trade advisers. 'We will ensure businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and to seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets and explore our newfound regulatory freedoms."" Last weekend, the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said exports to the EU had fallen as much as 68% since 1 January due to Brexit border hold-ups. But the government has said freight movements are now close to normal levels, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. On Monday, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told a committee of MPs that the RHA's claims were ""erroneous"" and ""based on a partial survey"". He added that ""truer figures"" were published on the Cabinet Office website, adding that the port of Dover saw 90% of normal levels of traffic on Monday.

Bitcoin sets fresh records after Musk investment,"Bitcoin has hit record highs for a second day after Elon Musk's car company Tesla said it had bought about $1.5bn (Â£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin rose above $48,000 (Â£34,820) before falling back, but it remains about 25% higher than a week ago. Some investors took Tesla's move as a signal that Bitcoin would become a mainstream financial asset. However, there was some criticism about a green car firm investing in such an energy intensive currency. Bitcoin currently uses more energy than Argentina every year,according to analysis from the University of Cambridge,external. Production of the cryptocurrency, known as ""Bitcoin mining"", needs energy-hungry computer hardware and ever-greater amounts of processing power.

This means it doesn't have a physical form. Instead, units of digital currency are traded over a computer network. It operates over a global network with thousands upon thousands of nodes - a machine within a network like a computer or some other device - which together process and store transactions. Read more here. Explaining its investment on Monday, Tesla said thatit wanted to maximise returns on cash lying dormant in the company's accounts. It also expects to accept payment for its electric cars in Bitcoin in future. The moves sparked market interest which carried on into Tuesday. Shares of companies that provide trading platforms for Bitcoin and the technology to mine the cryptocurrency have surged in China, South Korea and Australia, and big computer chip-making firms such as SK Hynix also rose. The cryptocurrency has already risen in value by 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally in 2020, as investors search for alternative assets at a time when interest rates in many countries are at record lows. Bitcoin has had some interest from big investment firms, including Blackrock, which recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency. However, central banks remain sceptical about the cryptocurrency. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method, saying it lacked ""intrinsic value"" unlike cash or gold. Some institutional investors are also wary of the price volatility of Bitcoin. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said: ""The average institutional investor is shaking their head. ""For these folks who are believers in cryptocurrency, [Tesla's investment] gives them another layer of support that crypto is the future."" But Bitcoin scepticism does not mean that central banks and regulators are against digital currencies per se. In China in particular regulators are starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use.

"Brexit worse than feared, says JD Sports bossChairman Peter Cowgill says the new EU trade deal has meant ""double-digit millions"" in extra costs.BusinessCommentsTravel disruption as temperatures plunge to -16.7CAn amber weather warning for snow is in place across parts of Scotland as temperature hits 11-year low.ScotlandComments","The boss of one of Britain's big retailers says Brexit has turned out to be ""considerably worse"" than he feared. Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports, said the red tape and delays in shipping goods to mainland Europe meant ""double-digit millions"" in extra costs. He told the BBC JD Sports may open an EU-based distribution centre to ease the problems, which would mean creating jobs overseas and not in the UK. The government said it is providing businesses with support. Mr Cowgill's criticism echoes that from exporters and importers across the UK. New UK-EU trade rules came into operation on 1 January. But since then, there has been growing concern from businesses as diverse as seafood exporters from Scotland and food suppliers shipping products to Northern Ireland. Fishing taskforce to tackle Brexit export 'issues' How many trade deals has the UK done? Mr Cowgill told the BBC's World at One that there is no true free trade with the EU, because goods that JD Sports imports from East Asia incur tariffs when they go to its stores across Europe. He said: ""I actually think it was not properly thought out. All the spin that was put on it about being free trade and free movement has not been the reality. ""The new system and red tape just slows down efficiency. The freedom of movement and obstacles are quite difficult at the moment. I don't see that regulatory paperwork easing much in the short term,"" Mr Cowgill said. Opening a big warehouse distribution centre in mainland Europe ""would make a lot of economic sense,"" he said. He estimated such a facility would employ about 1,000 people. While JD Sports' existing warehouse in Rochdale would not close, ""it would mean the transfer of a number of jobs into Europe,"" Mr Cowgill said. He also warned that the UK needed a complete overhaul of business rates and rents if the High Street was to survive. ""It is basic economics,"" he said. ""Bricks and mortar retailing is becoming uneconomic."" Mr Cowgill had particular criticism for the government's decision-making on forcing non-essential shops to close, while allowing essential shops to stay open. In reality, that meant supermarkets could sell clothes, while firms such as JD Sports had to shut. ""Some essential retailers have been making hay out of selling clothes, whilst clothing retailers have been closed. It is bizarre,"" he said. The Cabinet Office said in a statement: ""We know that some businesses are facing challenges with specific aspects of our new trading relationship, and that's why we are operating export helplines, running webinars with experts and offering businesses support via our network of 300 international trade advisers. 'We will ensure businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and to seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets and explore our newfound regulatory freedoms."" Last weekend, the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said exports to the EU had fallen as much as 68% since 1 January due to Brexit border hold-ups. But the government has said freight movements are now close to normal levels, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. On Monday, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told a committee of MPs that the RHA's claims were ""erroneous"" and ""based on a partial survey"". He added that ""truer figures"" were published on the Cabinet Office website, adding that the port of Dover saw 90% of normal levels of traffic on Monday. Mr Gove acknowledged that traders faced issues with exports and imports to and from the EU, but said it was ""important to put it in context"".

"Grocery shopping changed for good, says Ocado","The grocery landscape worldwide is changing ""for good"", online supermarket Ocado has said, after a year in which the global pandemic forced many people to buy online for the first time. Ocado's comments came as it reported a 35% jump in sales,externalover the past year. Amid rocketing demand the UK-based firm, which is 21 years old this year, narrowed losses from Â£214.5m to Â£44m. The company said many customers were saying they were unlikely to revert to pre-crisis shopping habits. Ocado's chief executive, Tim Steiner, said he wanted to ""pay tribute to the remarkable work of our colleagues in exceptionally challenging circumstances"". Lockdown has thrown up challenges for all supermarkets and Ocado itself has struggled to deliver smoothly at all times. The firm, which previously delivered for Waitrose, had to cancel some orders when its new partnership with Marks & Spencer launched on 1 September, angering customers. That move was its most notable in the UK, but Ocado has been expanding around the world, spurred by demand for its advanced technology and robot-operated warehouses. It has tie ups with Kroger in the US, Casino in France and Aeon in Japan, and is also planning three new warehouses in the UK this year, which will boost capacity by 40%. Ocado has been one of the best-performing shares in the FTSE 100 in the past year, roughly doubling in value since last March. It is in the perfect position to benefit from the restrictions put in place to control the coronavirus, with shoppers clamouring for online deliveries in order to avoid a trip to the supermarket. These results - for the 12 months to the end of November, so not including the most recent national lockdown in England - show grocery sales up 35% to Â£2.2bn. You might have thought that jump in sales would have sent the shares up, but in fact they were down - 4% - in early trading. Investors have looked past the headline sales number to see another pre-tax loss for the year  - Â£44m. That is not so surprising in itself, but shareholders would also have noted the projected increase in capital spending, which will rise to Â£700m in the coming year. Ocado is spending heavily not only on technology, but also new warehouses. Shares in Ocado have always priced in the promise of future profits, and today's numbers made that promise seem that much further off. Ocado said in its full year statement on Tuesday: ""The pandemic has accelerated the rate of channel shift to online. ""Online grocery market share in the UK has nearly doubled over the last year to 14%, according to Kantar. Similar trends are observable in the United States as well as many other countries around the world."" Ross Hindle, from research firm Third Bridge, said: ""These are not just results, these are remarkable results. Ocado couldn't have asked for better trading conditions. ""The M&S partnership has, so far, proved positive for Ocado, with management highlighting that access to M&S products is now higher than the benchmark Waitrose set.""

Covid laboratory leak 'extremely unlikely' - WHO,"This video can not be played Dr Peter Daszak: ""Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market"" International experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China. Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) mission, said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus spread from a lab leak in the city of Wuhan. He said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus. The investigation could now focus on South East Asia, one expert said. The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission. Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, is the first place in the world that the virus was detected in 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Dr Embarek told a press conference the investigation had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed the picture of the outbreak. Experts believe the virus is likely to have originated in animals before spreading to humans, but they are not sure how. Wuhan- City of silence 'Wuhan whistleblower' remembered one year on Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial Dr Embarek said work to identify the origins of Covid-19 pointed to a ""natural reservoir"" in bats, but it was unlikely that this happened in Wuhan. He said identifying the animal pathway remained a ""work in progress"", but that it was ""most likely"" to have crossed over to humans from an intermediary species. The experts also said there was ""no indication"" that the virus was circulating in Wuhan before the first official cases were recorded there in December 2019. Liang Wannian, an expert with China's Health Commission, said Covid-19 could have been in other regions before it was detected in Wuhan. The team called for further investigation into the possibility of ""cold chain"" transmission, referring to the transport and trade of frozen food. Dr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia. ""We've done a lot of work in China and if you map that back it starts to point towards the border and we know that there is very little surveillance on the other side in the whole region of South East Asia,"" he told the BBC's John Sudworth in Wuhan. ""China is a very big place and South East Asia is a very big place. The supply chains to the Huanan seafood market were extensive, they were coming in from other countries, they were coming in from various parts of China, so to really trace that back it's going to take some work."" He added that the focus should now be on those supply chains. The WHO mission began in January, following months of negotiations with Beijing. The experts' visit was closely-monitored by the Chinese authorities. It was unlikely that the expert group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic in China a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Speculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump. In April,US state department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. The office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. But Dr Embarek said a visit to the laboratory during the mission showed it was ""very unlikely"" that anything could have leaked out. He said the laboratory theory was ""not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies"". Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial The road back to Wuhan.

Holiday giant Tui bets on summer bounce back,"Travel company Tui has said it expects to run 80% of its normal capacity for this summer, with 2.8 million customers already booked for its holidays. The statement follows optimism from other travel firms that the industry is set for recovery as coronavirus vaccination programmes advance. Despite the upbeat mood, summer bookings for 2021 are down 44% so far compared with last year, the firm said. Boss Fritz Joussen said the UK market had ""a special significance"" for Tui. ""We see an impressive pace and ambitious targets for vaccinations there."" He added: ""We should do everything we can to quickly return to basic freedoms and make travel possible again."" Average prices for holidays are 20% higher than for summer 2019. Although demand for breaks appears to be building, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said on Monday it was ""too early to say"" whether people would be able to have holidays as normal this summer. Tui's predictions for the summer season came in a trading statement that underlined the scale of the collapse in the tourism market due to Covid curbs. The firm's winter bookings fell 89% compared with a year ago, with November and December hardest hit. Income in the three months to the end of 2020 fell 87.8% year-on-year, from â¬3.86bn (Â£3.4bn) to â¬468.1m. ""With strict cost discipline and the realignment of the group, which is being driven forward at full speed, we succeeded in reducing the loss in the past quarter,"" Mr Joussen said. ""As expected, customers will book their summer holidays much later this year than in normal years. However, demand remains strong, people want to travel - this is shown by the already good number of bookings for the summer."" 'I'm chancing a 2021 holiday abroad - why not?' Ryanair says beach holidays will be back in summer UK holiday boom: Bookings are 'coming in fast' Tui also disclosed that it had agreed a third coronavirus financing package with banks, shareholders and the German government's Economic Stabilisation Fund, created to support companies hit by coronavirus. This raised â¬1.8bn, including â¬500m from shareholders in a rights issue, which it hopes will tide it over until conditions improve. ""The travel sector has been hammered by the global coronavirus pandemic, with revenues falling off a cliff-edge as travel restrictions have scuppered any holiday plans for consumers,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""Investors will be eager to see if vaccinations can give the business the shot in the arm it desperately needs, having already secured three bailouts from the German government. ""Regardless, Tui needs to reduce its costs and take advantage of the millions of consumers desperate to go on holiday as soon as the restrictions are eased.""

"'Under-loved' fish renamed to boost British salesThe spider crab and megrim sole are to be rebranded to get rid of ""negative connotations"".Cornwall","Spider crab is to be sold as Cornish King crab Fishermen are to rename two of their biggest exports in a bid to attract British consumers after post-Brexit difficulties selling to the EU. Megrim sole is to be sold as Cornish sole, with spider crab being rebranded as Cornish King crab. It is being driven by the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO) after research with chefs and consumers. Paul Trebilcock from the CFPO said: ""There is something about the names that has negative connotations."" Both species primarily rely on exports to Europe, which he explained that ""in the current climate is not a pleasant experience"". ""The two species are particularly under-loved in this country but really popular with some of our export markets."" Padstow is one fishing town that could benefit from the name changes Each year about 1,000 tonnes of megrim sole is brought into Newlyn, Cornwall's biggest fish market, with 98% exported. About 85% of spider crab is exported, mainly to Spain. Trade has been disrupted this year by the extra paperwork and border checks required after Brexit. Chef Jack Stein said megrim sole had a taste similar to plaice Mr Trebilcock said: ""Our investigation revealed that simply by calling it Cornish sole, straight away more people were willing to to try it and were more interested in finding out where it came from."" Johnny Murt, a shell fisherman off Padstow, said: ""It can only be a good thing."" ""It is a hard sell but if the rebranding can just get people to taste it, they will immediately realise just how good spider crab is,"" he said. Stein's chef director Jack Stein is the son of restaurateur Rick Stein Chef Jack Stein agreed and said spider crab and megrim sole were both ""good value and delicious"". He said spider crab was very sustainable with ""amazing quality meat and there is just so much of it in the summer"" but lots of it was sold in the EU. Similarly megrim sole had a ""lovely taste"" similar to plaice, he said. ""With a bit of a rebrand and a bit of a publicity drive we might be able to eat more of it in this country,"" he added.

LiveLiveHistoric second Trump impeachment trial to open5 minutes ago,"Donald Trump's impeachment trial will go ahead in the US Senate after a vote declaring it constitutional He is accused of inciting his supporters ahead of a deadly riot at the US Capitol on 6 January Six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats and voted to proceed Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Democrat Jamie Raskin played new, hard-hitting footage of Trump supporters ransacking the Capitol The defence lawyers argued it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through this process And they accused the Democrats of acting out of spite, to remove a political rival Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thank you for joining our live coverage of day one in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. You can keep following the story on our site, here. Here's a look back at today's key moments: It all picks back up again tomorrow at1200 EST (1700 GMT). Our live coverage will begin here at1100 EST (1600 GMT). See you then! Today's writers and editors were Tom Geoghegan, Marianna Brady, Sarah Fowler, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Tara McKelvey, Anthony Zurcher, Sam Granville, Georgina Rannard, Holly Honderich and Alice Cuddy.

If you want to read more about the Capitol riot, check out these stories:  Or are you looking for more on impeachment? This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What the Proud Boys did before president's speech The storming of the Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. The impeachment trial comes down to this one question: Did Donald Trump incite the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January? No matter what the Senate decides, the repercussions of that day tell us a frightening truth about the divided American public. BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse takes a closer look at the movements of far-right extremists on the day of the riot - and how the Proud Boys were already heading to the Capitol before President Trump had even spoken at his rally. But the vast majority of those arrested for their actions on 6 January did not have affiliations to such groups before the siege. Experts say that many more Americans have become radicalised since the election and warn that the risk of political violence could grow. A month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people,which you can read about here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington What can be done if Republicans refuse to convict Trump?- Cody, Ohio, USA Yes. The senators could censure Trump. This would be a formal denunciation and condemnation by the Senate, but holds no real penalties. Still, it would be a defeat for a man who once described himself as the âgreatest of all presidentsâ. Very little will be remembered from the first day of Trump's impeachment trial, aside from the opening video. After hours of arguments, the montage of footage from the Capitol riot that Democrats played remains the top search term in the US. It's garnered praise online, with one lawyer who worked on Trump's first impeachment calling it a ""smart"" move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Journalists who covered the proceedings on Tuesday said the acoustics of the Senate amplified the sounds. ""The sounds of the montage seemed to echo a lot more in the chamber, filling it with the screams and yells of the mob,"" wrote Emily Cochrane. ""When the video concluded, it was silent in the chamber."" Reporter James Poniewozik said that it included footage he had not seen before while MSNBC host Tiffany Cross commented on how powerful the montage was. Allow Twitter content?

Here's a look at what Republicans are saying about this first day of impeachment proceedings. TexasSenator John Cornyntold NBC he was not impressed by the Trump defence team. ""The presidentâs lawyer just rambled on and on,"" Cornyn said. ""Iâve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments and that was not one of the finest Iâve seen."" But Alabama CongressmanMo Brookscontinued to back the president (he was among the lawmakers to dispute the election results last month). ""Impeaching Donald Trump for inciting a riot is akin to impeaching him for Russian collusion â neither of which happened and both of which are Socialist Democrat concoctions,"" he tweeted. A Trump campaign account, meanwhile, tweeted a criticism of having Democrat Patrick Leahy chair the session. (Typically ensuring trial rules are followed is the job of the Chief Supreme Court Justice, but he declined.) ""Imagine having a 'trial' where the 'judge' had already voted to convict the defendant? 

That's what happens in banana republics, third world dictatorships and now the United States Senate. SAD!"" Conservative punditAnn Coultershared an opinion piece from political news site The Hill that suggested Republicans could unite the country by convicting Trump, commenting: ""And Democrats could unite the nation by giving them a wall in return!"" Rab is a doctor who has been very frustrated with Trump over the past four years and says his irresponsible conduct since the election merits his impeachment. He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Yes. Even before the violence at the Capitol, he made comments calling people to come to DC on 6 January and ""stop the steal"". When the president of the United States says something, people believe it. He also made comments encouraging people to fight like hell and scared them that they wouldn't have a country anymore if they didn't. We need to hold people accountable for doing things that are wrong. Six Republican senators just joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to move the trial forward. They are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. You may have heard most of those names before - Murkowski, Collins, Sasse, Toomey and Romney had previously taken a similar vote upholding the constitutionality of the trial proceedings. But Bill Cassidy is a noteworthy name on the list: he had previously voted to dismiss the trial. Cassidy later told CNN the House prosecutors made ""very good arguments"", noting he'd always planned to approach the trial ""with an open mind"" and as an ""impartial juror"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Well, that should about do it. There are going to be four days of arguments, Senate questions and, perhaps, witnesses. The final outcome, however, is all but certain. When the first substantive vote of the impeachment trial was taken on Tuesday â a vote about whether to have a trial at all â only six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats to proceed. Thatâs well short of the 17 Republicans who would be necessary to convict. And if there arenât 17 Republicans who think there should be a trial at all, it seems unlikely that the House impeachment managers are going to be able to change enough minds. Sam voted twice for Donald Trump but has turned his back on him, saying the attack on the Capitol ""made me sick to my stomach"". He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? There is not enough direct correlation and evidence for him to be convicted, so he should not be. But the impeachment in the House was a good slap on the wrist. There needed to be some sort of response to the way he handled - or didnât handle - the peaceful transfer of power. I don't think Trump himself was directly responsible for getting people riled up but I do think that he set the stage for what happened. But pursuing a conviction is just another means of tribalistic partisan politics that will further divide the country because there are still millions of Americans who voted for Trump and really like him. Alright, so in the last four hours, we've heard from House prosecutors and the Trump defence team. And we've just had a speedy vote on whether or not the trial is constitutional and can continue (it is, and it will). Now what?  Both Republicans and Democrats are keen on a speedy trial, US media report, so we could see a vote on conviction as early as this weekend if there are no witnesses to hear from. The Senate has voted 56-44 that it is constitutional to hold a trial for a president who is no longer in office. This means Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will continue, starting tomorrow. Only a simple majority was required on the measure. Now that arguments from both sides have concluded, the Senate is voting on whether or not to go forward with Trump's impeachment trial. BBC editors in Washington have cast a critical eye on how well the defence lawyers are making their case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill There is only one camera in the Senate chambers and it's not on the senators. Here's what's going on that you can't see. Republican Senators Murkowski, Collins and Graham are the studious notetakers. Senator Josh Hawley, also a Republican, was reading papers that didnât seem to be marked with the symbols of the House - so they probably weren't trial-related documents. Senator Sasse looked confused at one point and seemed to just shake his head before sharing a whisper with Senators Scott, Burr and Portman. Democratic Senator Sanders is staring straight ahead and listening to the arguments. Fellow Democrat Senator Booker is in the back of the room. He appeared to get a little restless and stood up and leaned against the back wall of the chamber. The former president's lawyers continue their arguments that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. Later tonight, the Senate will hold a vote on whether or not the trial can take place. Here are some of defence attorney David Schoen's arguments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump is facing legal troubles in Washington, and at home in Palm Beach, Florida, too. He bought his ocean-side property, an estate called Mar-a-Lago, in 1985, and spent part of his winters there. Then, after leaving the White House, he moved in. Some of his neighbours want him out, saying he will bring down property values, and have talked about evicting him. They say an agreement that was reached nearly 30 years ago, one that turned the estate into a private club, does not allow anyone to live there on a permanent basis unless they work on the premises. Trump, through a lawyer, has argued that he should be allowed to stay, as an employee. The issue is being discussed at a Palm Beach Town Council meeting on Tuesday. One of his former employees, Wes Blackman, a former project director at Mar-a-Lago, says that Trump will see the designation as an employee not as a demotion, but as an opportunity, a loophole that will allow him to stay where he is. The designation as an employee is ""convenient and expedient"", says Blackman. ""It gets him out of a tight situation."" Besides, says Blackman, the fight with his neighbours in Florida is not the biggest problem Trump is facing today. Over the course of the day, Blackman has been watching the impeachment trial in Washington, wondering how his old boss will fare. Now up, Trump lawyer David Schoen. He begins by saying it's an honour to appear in this chamber, but ""that is tempered by a feeling of grave concern"". ""My overriding emotion is frankly wanting to cry for what I believe these proceedings will do to our great long-enduring Constitution and to the American people on both sides of the great divide that now characterises our nation."" Schoen says the trial is unconstitutional and ""wrong as wrong can be"". He adds that while Democrats claim the proceedings are for accountability if that was the case, they would wait for a full investigation. He says the trial is a ""chance for partisan politicians to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scheme and to disenfranchise"" the millions of people who voted for him. Schoen says the trial is for ""pure, raw, misguided partisanship"". Much of Trump lawyer Castor's speech has focused on appealing to the patriotism of the Senate. ""The top responsibility of a US senator and the top characteristic that you all have in common... there isn't a single one of you who doesn't consider yourself a patriot of the US."" ""That is why this attack on the constitution will not prevail,"" he says, reiterating his argument that the impeachment of Trump is unconstitutional. Trump attorney, Bruce Castor Jr, denounces the Capitol riot and says those responsible ought to be prosecuted. He adds that there is a reasonable desire to ask ""how do we make them pay?"" But Castor argues that Trump should not be the scapegoat for this tragedy. ""We expect US senators to not react to popular will and emotions, but do what is right,"" Castor says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Covid laboratory leak 'extremely unlikely' - WHOA team of international and Chinese experts say more work is needed to identify the source of the virus.China,"This video can not be played Dr Peter Daszak: ""Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market"" International experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China. Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) mission, said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus spread from a lab leak in the city of Wuhan. He said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus. The investigation could now focus on South East Asia, one expert said. The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission. Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, is the first place in the world that the virus was detected in 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Dr Embarek told a press conference the investigation had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed the picture of the outbreak. Experts believe the virus is likely to have originated in animals before spreading to humans, but they are not sure how. Wuhan- City of silence 'Wuhan whistleblower' remembered one year on Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial Dr Embarek said work to identify the origins of Covid-19 pointed to a ""natural reservoir"" in bats, but it was unlikely that this happened in Wuhan. He said identifying the animal pathway remained a ""work in progress"", but that it was ""most likely"" to have crossed over to humans from an intermediary species. The experts also said there was ""no indication"" that the virus was circulating in Wuhan before the first official cases were recorded there in December 2019. Liang Wannian, an expert with China's Health Commission, said Covid-19 could have been in other regions before it was detected in Wuhan. The team called for further investigation into the possibility of ""cold chain"" transmission, referring to the transport and trade of frozen food. Dr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia. ""We've done a lot of work in China and if you map that back it starts to point towards the border and we know that there is very little surveillance on the other side in the whole region of South East Asia,"" he told the BBC's John Sudworth in Wuhan. ""China is a very big place and South East Asia is a very big place. The supply chains to the Huanan seafood market were extensive, they were coming in from other countries, they were coming in from various parts of China, so to really trace that back it's going to take some work."" He added that the focus should now be on those supply chains. The WHO mission began in January, following months of negotiations with Beijing. The experts' visit was closely-monitored by the Chinese authorities. It was unlikely that the expert group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic in China a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Speculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump. In April,US state department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. The office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. But Dr Embarek said a visit to the laboratory during the mission showed it was ""very unlikely"" that anything could have leaked out. He said the laboratory theory was ""not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies"". Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial The road back to Wuhan.

'Under-loved' fish renamed to boost British salesThe spider crab and megrim sole are to be rebranded to get rid of the names' 'negative connotations'.Cornwall,"Spider crab is to be sold as Cornish King crab Fishermen are to rename two of their biggest exports in a bid to attract British consumers after post-Brexit difficulties selling to the EU. Megrim sole is to be sold as Cornish sole, with spider crab being rebranded as Cornish King crab. It is being driven by the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO) after research with chefs and consumers. Paul Trebilcock from the CFPO said: ""There is something about the names that has negative connotations."" Both species primarily rely on exports to Europe, which he explained that ""in the current climate is not a pleasant experience"". ""The two species are particularly under-loved in this country but really popular with some of our export markets."" Padstow is one fishing town that could benefit from the name changes Each year about 1,000 tonnes of megrim sole is brought into Newlyn, Cornwall's biggest fish market, with 98% exported. About 85% of spider crab is exported, mainly to Spain. Trade has been disrupted this year by the extra paperwork and border checks required after Brexit. Chef Jack Stein said megrim sole had a taste similar to plaice Mr Trebilcock said: ""Our investigation revealed that simply by calling it Cornish sole, straight away more people were willing to to try it and were more interested in finding out where it came from."" Johnny Murt, a shell fisherman off Padstow, said: ""It can only be a good thing."" ""It is a hard sell but if the rebranding can just get people to taste it, they will immediately realise just how good spider crab is,"" he said. Stein's chef director Jack Stein is the son of restaurateur Rick Stein Chef Jack Stein agreed and said spider crab and megrim sole were both ""good value and delicious"". He said spider crab was very sustainable with ""amazing quality meat and there is just so much of it in the summer"" but lots of it was sold in the EU. Similarly megrim sole had a ""lovely taste"" similar to plaice, he said. ""With a bit of a rebrand and a bit of a publicity drive we might be able to eat more of it in this country,"" he added.

Cyberpunk 2077 makers hit by ransomware hackThe hackers claim to have obtained game source code.,"Cyberpunk 2077 has been beset by delays and glitches The maker of popular video game Cyberpunk 2077 has been hacked in a ransomware attack. CD Projekt Red said hackers had accessed its internal network, digitally scrambled some of its data servers and tried to blackmail it. The perpetrators claim to have stolen source code for several of the firm's games which they said they would leak unless a payment was made. But the Polish games company said it would not negotiate. In a statement on Twitter,,externalCD Projekt Red posted a copy of the ransom note which said the hackers had copied code from Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent, and Witcher 3, including an unreleased version of the latter. âWe have also dumped all of your documents relating to accounting, administration legal, HR, investor relations and more!â the note added. ""Dumping"" means copying the information to an external source. âIf we will not come to an agreement, then your source codes will be sold or leaked online and your documents will be sent to our contacts in gaming journalism,â read the note, giving a deadline of 48 hours. Source code is the human-readable version of a computer program before it is transformed for use. Releasing it could make it easier for people to write hacks for the titles or even publish their own altered versions, as well as reveal some of their development secrets. In a statement, posted by the game developers on Twitter, it said it has secured its âIT infrastructure and begun restoring the dataâ from back-ups. âWe will not give in to the demands or negotiate with the actor,â it said, adding that no personal data had been compromised in the breach. The company has informed law enforcement and data protection authorities, while it investigates the issue. This video can not be played Keanu Reeves talks to BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue This is the latest in a series of bad news for the developers after the release of Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed several times, only for users to then experience glitches in the game. ""This will be frustrating for users of the game, but as consumers are generally very sympathetic when something like this happens,"" said Louise Shorthouse, senior gaming analyst at Ampere Analysis. ""This comes after a string of recent ransomware attacks on games companies, including Capcom and Ubisoft late last year. ""Fixes and updates for Cyberpunk 2077 may take a backseat for a while, as mitigating the effects of the ransomware attack becomes the priority."" This probably couldn't have come at a worse time for the embattled games studio. However, its response has been extraordinary and is already being praised by the cyber-security world. In one Tweet, the company has demonstrated a new gold standard response to dealing with ransomware. The company is being transparent about the attack but also says it is not negotiating with the cyber-criminals and instead relying on well-managed back-up systems. CD Projekt Red has even released a screen grab of the ransom note which will be invaluable for researchers. It doesn't sound like much and there will be questions about how the firm was able to be breached in the first place. But in a world of empty press releases and companies secretly paying criminals huge ransoms, CD Projekt Red has shown what can and, in the eyes of many, should be done to deal with the growing problem of ransomware hacking.

You can keep following the story on our site, here. Here's a look back at today's key moments: It all picks back up again tomorrow at1200 EST (1700 GMT). Our live coverage will begin here at1100 EST (1600 GMT). See you then! Today's writers and editors were Tom Geoghegan, Marianna Brady, Sarah Fowler, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Tara McKelvey, Anthony Zurcher, Sam Granville, Georgina Rannard, Holly Honderich and Alice Cuddy. It's been a long day of impeachment proceedings, but if you haven't had your fill of US politics yet, we understand. If you want to read more about the Capitol riot, check out these stories:  Or are you looking for more on impeachment? This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What the Proud Boys did before president's speech The storming of the Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. The impeachment trial comes down to this one question: Did Donald Trump incite the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January? No matter what the Senate decides, the repercussions of that day tell us a frightening truth about the divided American public. BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse takes a closer look at the movements of far-right extremists on the day of the riot - and how the Proud Boys were already heading to the Capitol before President Trump had even spoken at his rally. But the vast majority of those arrested for their actions on 6 January did not have affiliations to such groups before the siege. Experts say that many more Americans have become radicalised since the election and warn that the risk of political violence could grow. A month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people,which you can read about here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington What can be done if Republicans refuse to convict Trump?- Cody, Ohio, USA Yes. The senators could censure Trump. This would be a formal denunciation and condemnation by the Senate, but holds no real penalties. Still, it would be a defeat for a man who once described himself as the âgreatest of all presidentsâ. Very little will be remembered from the first day of Trump's impeachment trial, aside from the opening video. After hours of arguments, the montage of footage from the Capitol riot that Democrats played remains the top search term in the US. It's garnered praise online, with one lawyer who worked on Trump's first impeachment calling it a ""smart"" move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's a look at what Republicans are saying about this first day of impeachment proceedings. TexasSenator John Cornyntold NBC he was not impressed by the Trump defence team. ""The presidentâs lawyer just rambled on and on,"" Cornyn said. ""Iâve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments and that was not one of the finest Iâve seen."" But Alabama CongressmanMo Brookscontinued to back the president (he was among the lawmakers to dispute the election results last month). ""Impeaching Donald Trump for inciting a riot is akin to impeaching him for Russian collusion â neither of which happened and both of which are Socialist Democrat concoctions,"" he tweeted. A Trump campaign account, meanwhile, tweeted a criticism of having Democrat Patrick Leahy chair the session. (Typically ensuring trial rules are followed is the job of the Chief Supreme Court Justice, but he declined.) ""Imagine having a 'trial' where the 'judge' had already voted to convict the defendant? 

That's what happens in banana republics, third world dictatorships and now the United States Senate. SAD!"" Conservative punditAnn Coultershared an opinion piece from political news site The Hill that suggested Republicans could unite the country by convicting Trump, commenting: ""And Democrats could unite the nation by giving them a wall in return!"" Rab is a doctor who has been very frustrated with Trump over the past four years and says his irresponsible conduct since the election merits his impeachment. He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Yes. Even before the violence at the Capitol, he made comments calling people to come to DC on 6 January and ""stop the steal"". When the president of the United States says something, people believe it. He also made comments encouraging people to fight like hell and scared them that they wouldn't have a country anymore if they didn't. We need to hold people accountable for doing things that are wrong. Six Republican senators just joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to move the trial forward. They are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. You may have heard most of those names before - Murkowski, Collins, Sasse, Toomey and Romney had previously taken a similar vote upholding the constitutionality of the trial proceedings. But Bill Cassidy is a noteworthy name on the list: he had previously voted to dismiss the trial. Cassidy later told CNN the House prosecutors made ""very good arguments"", noting he'd always planned to approach the trial ""with an open mind"" and as an ""impartial juror"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Well, that should about do it. There are going to be four days of arguments, Senate questions and, perhaps, witnesses. The final outcome, however, is all but certain. When the first substantive vote of the impeachment trial was taken on Tuesday â a vote about whether to have a trial at all â only six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats to proceed. Thatâs well short of the 17 Republicans who would be necessary to convict. And if there arenât 17 Republicans who think there should be a trial at all, it seems unlikely that the House impeachment managers are going to be able to change enough minds. Sam voted twice for Donald Trump but has turned his back on him, saying the attack on the Capitol ""made me sick to my stomach"". He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? There is not enough direct correlation and evidence for him to be convicted, so he should not be. But the impeachment in the House was a good slap on the wrist. There needed to be some sort of response to the way he handled - or didnât handle - the peaceful transfer of power. I don't think Trump himself was directly responsible for getting people riled up but I do think that he set the stage for what happened. But pursuing a conviction is just another means of tribalistic partisan politics that will further divide the country because there are still millions of Americans who voted for Trump and really like him. Alright, so in the last four hours, we've heard from House prosecutors and the Trump defence team. And we've just had a speedy vote on whether or not the trial is constitutional and can continue (it is, and it will). Now what?  Both Republicans and Democrats are keen on a speedy trial, US media report, so we could see a vote on conviction as early as this weekend if there are no witnesses to hear from. The Senate has voted 56-44 that it is constitutional to hold a trial for a president who is no longer in office. This means Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will continue, starting tomorrow. Only a simple majority was required on the measure. Now that arguments from both sides have concluded, the Senate is voting on whether or not to go forward with Trump's impeachment trial. BBC editors in Washington have cast a critical eye on how well the defence lawyers are making their case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill There is only one camera in the Senate chambers and it's not on the senators. Here's what's going on that you can't see. Republican Senators Murkowski, Collins and Graham are the studious notetakers. Senator Josh Hawley, also a Republican, was reading papers that didnât seem to be marked with the symbols of the House - so they probably weren't trial-related documents. Senator Sasse looked confused at one point and seemed to just shake his head before sharing a whisper with Senators Scott, Burr and Portman. Democratic Senator Sanders is staring straight ahead and listening to the arguments. Fellow Democrat Senator Booker is in the back of the room. He appeared to get a little restless and stood up and leaned against the back wall of the chamber. The former president's lawyers continue their arguments that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. Later tonight, the Senate will hold a vote on whether or not the trial can take place. Here are some of defence attorney David Schoen's arguments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump is facing legal troubles in Washington, and at home in Palm Beach, Florida, too. He bought his ocean-side property, an estate called Mar-a-Lago, in 1985, and spent part of his winters there. Then, after leaving the White House, he moved in. Some of his neighbours want him out, saying he will bring down property values, and have talked about evicting him. They say an agreement that was reached nearly 30 years ago, one that turned the estate into a private club, does not allow anyone to live there on a permanent basis unless they work on the premises. Trump, through a lawyer, has argued that he should be allowed to stay, as an employee. The issue is being discussed at a Palm Beach Town Council meeting on Tuesday. One of his former employees, Wes Blackman, a former project director at Mar-a-Lago, says that Trump will see the designation as an employee not as a demotion, but as an opportunity, a loophole that will allow him to stay where he is. The designation as an employee is ""convenient and expedient"", says Blackman. ""It gets him out of a tight situation."" Besides, says Blackman, the fight with his neighbours in Florida is not the biggest problem Trump is facing today. Over the course of the day, Blackman has been watching the impeachment trial in Washington, wondering how his old boss will fare. Now up, Trump lawyer David Schoen. He begins by saying it's an honour to appear in this chamber, but ""that is tempered by a feeling of grave concern"". ""My overriding emotion is frankly wanting to cry for what I believe these proceedings will do to our great long-enduring Constitution and to the American people on both sides of the great divide that now characterises our nation."" Schoen says the trial is unconstitutional and ""wrong as wrong can be"". He adds that while Democrats claim the proceedings are for accountability if that was the case, they would wait for a full investigation. He says the trial is a ""chance for partisan politicians to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scheme and to disenfranchise"" the millions of people who voted for him. Schoen says the trial is for ""pure, raw, misguided partisanship"". Much of Trump lawyer Castor's speech has focused on appealing to the patriotism of the Senate. ""The top responsibility of a US senator and the top characteristic that you all have in common... there isn't a single one of you who doesn't consider yourself a patriot of the US."" ""That is why this attack on the constitution will not prevail,"" he says, reiterating his argument that the impeachment of Trump is unconstitutional. Trump attorney, Bruce Castor Jr, denounces the Capitol riot and says those responsible ought to be prosecuted. He adds that there is a reasonable desire to ask ""how do we make them pay?"" But Castor argues that Trump should not be the scapegoat for this tragedy. ""We expect US senators to not react to popular will and emotions, but do what is right,"" Castor says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Executive must fund Troubles pension, court rulesStormont and Westminster have been involved in a long-running row over cash for the scheme.","Stormont's Executive Office is under a legal duty to fund a pension for people badly injured in the Troubles, Northern Ireland's Court of Appeal has ruled. The scheme is due to open for applications next month but it is not clear who will fund the payments. Stormont and Westminsterhave been engaged in a long-running rowabout who is responsible. On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal said it was giving the parties four weeks to find a solution. It said if that was not possible the case would be relisted to include Stormont's Department of Finance as an additional notice party. A spokesperson for the department said Finance Minister Conor Murphy had been pressing Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis to meet him about the pension since September. A UK government spokesperson said Mr Lewis had ""always been clear"" that the responsibility for funding the scheme lay with the Stormont Executive.Â Â It is understood the NI secretary has agreed to meet Stormont ministers and has asked for more detail about estimated costs and wider spending plans. The pension scheme was initially approved at Westminster when devolution in Northern Ireland had collapsed. What's the trouble with the Troubles pension? Victims 'outraged' over Troubles payment row Since power-sharing returned in January 2020, estimates from Stormont for the cost of the scheme have been suggested to run toas high as Â£800m. The executive argues that Westminster should help fund it, as it is a UK-wide scheme and people injured outside Northern Ireland will be able to apply. Last year, a judge ruled that the Executive Officewas acting unlawfullyin delaying Troubles pensions, following a legal challenge from some victims. Tuesday's appeal was brought by Brian Turley, one ofthose known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early-1970s. In the ruling, Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said there was a legal duty on the Executive Office regarding the funding, to ensure payments could be made. He backed submissions that there is no discretion involved but said the court expressed ""no view"" on the political dispute between the Stormont Executive and Northern Ireland Office. Brian Turley instigated the latest court action Speaking after the hearing, Mr Turley said the judgement confirmed there were ""no justifiable reasons"" for delaying the payments to victims. ""The need to keep taking cases to court to obtain what I am entitled to is another form of torture,"" he said. Alan McBride from Wave Trauma Centre told BBC Newsline that he was ""disappointed"" that it had been left to the courts system to make progress with the scheme. ""It is up now to the executive and Northern Ireland Office to sit down around the table like mature adults and sort this out once and for all."" DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster said the ruling was ""reassuring"" for victims and that she looked forward to payments being issued. ""Whilst the payments will be made from the Northern Ireland Executive, there is a strong argument that the government should be increasing the NI budget accordingly to fund the pension,"" she added. Sinn FÃ©in's Linda Dillon said her party was committed to ensuring payments were made as quickly as possible, but insisted the executive alone does not have the resources to deliver it. Stormont's Justice Minister Naomi Long said she hoped Stormont and Westminster could agree a resolution. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chair of Stormont's Executive Office Committee, the SDLP's Colin McGrath said it was ""welcome"" that a four-week deadline had been set. ""While the British government clearly must meet their financial commitments to this scheme, the public row between the Secretary of State and Finance Minister is unedifying and also serves to re-traumatise victims and survivors,"" he said. Ulster Unionist assembly member (MLA) Doug Beattie described the ruling as the ""latest abject failure"" in supporting the needs of Troubles victims. ""The Executive Office has not only a moral obligation but now a legal one to provide the funding to this scheme and end the uncertainty for those who have spent years suffering as a result of injuries caused by no fault of their own,"" he said. The scheme is due to run for two or three decades and payments are to be backdated to 2014, the year in which it was first agreed. Last August, Stormont's Department of Justice was designated to administer the scheme. But in January, the Department of Financedid not set aside fundingfor payments in the draft budget for 2021-22, only the administrative cost of the pension. The legislation came on to the statute book in January 2020. To qualify, applicants must have an injury which is severe and permanent and caused by no fault of their own. That can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example. The scheme covers violence related to the Northern Ireland Troubles between 1966 and 2010, including incidents in Great Britain and Europe. Non-UK residents injured outside the UK cannot apply - such as victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings carried out by loyalists in 1974. People will get between Â£2,000 and Â£10,000 a year for the rest of their lives. Upon their death, a spouse or carer, will get the payments for a further 10 years. The scheme is a recognition that criminal injuries awards from decades ago were largely inadequate. What's the trouble with the Troubles pension?

One of his former employees, Wes Blackman, a former project director at Mar-a-Lago, says that Trump will see the designation as an employee not as a demotion, but as an opportunity, a loophole that will allow him to stay where he is. The designation as an employee is ""convenient and expedient"", says Blackman. ""It gets him out of a tight situation."" Besides, says Blackman, the fight with his neighbours in Florida is not the biggest problem Trump is facing today. Over the course of the day, Blackman has been watching the impeachment trial in Washington, wondering how his old boss will fare. Now up, Trump lawyer David Schoen. He begins by saying it's an honour to appear in this chamber, but ""that is tempered by a feeling of grave concern"". ""My overriding emotion is frankly wanting to cry for what I believe these proceedings will do to our great long-enduring Constitution and to the American people on both sides of the great divide that now characterises our nation."" Schoen says the trial is unconstitutional and ""wrong as wrong can be"". He adds that while Democrats claim the proceedings are for accountability if that was the case, they would wait for a full investigation. He says the trial is a ""chance for partisan politicians to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scheme and to disenfranchise"" the millions of people who voted for him. Schoen says the trial is for ""pure, raw, misguided partisanship"". Much of Trump lawyer Castor's speech has focused on appealing to the patriotism of the Senate. ""The top responsibility of a US senator and the top characteristic that you all have in common... there isn't a single one of you who doesn't consider yourself a patriot of the US."" ""That is why this attack on the constitution will not prevail,"" he says, reiterating his argument that the impeachment of Trump is unconstitutional. Trump attorney, Bruce Castor Jr, denounces the Capitol riot and says those responsible ought to be prosecuted. He adds that there is a reasonable desire to ask ""how do we make them pay?"" But Castor argues that Trump should not be the scapegoat for this tragedy. ""We expect US senators to not react to popular will and emotions, but do what is right,"" Castor says. Â© 2025 BBC.

If you want to read more about the Capitol riot, check out these stories:  Or are you looking for more on impeachment? This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What the Proud Boys did before president's speech The storming of the Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. The impeachment trial comes down to this one question: Did Donald Trump incite the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January? No matter what the Senate decides, the repercussions of that day tell us a frightening truth about the divided American public. BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse takes a closer look at the movements of far-right extremists on the day of the riot - and how the Proud Boys were already heading to the Capitol before President Trump had even spoken at his rally. But the vast majority of those arrested for their actions on 6 January did not have affiliations to such groups before the siege. Experts say that many more Americans have become radicalised since the election and warn that the risk of political violence could grow. A month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people,which you can read about here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington What can be done if Republicans refuse to convict Trump?- Cody, Ohio, USA Yes. The senators could censure Trump. This would be a formal denunciation and condemnation by the Senate, but holds no real penalties. Still, it would be a defeat for a man who once described himself as the âgreatest of all presidentsâ. Very little will be remembered from the first day of Trump's impeachment trial, aside from the opening video. After hours of arguments, the montage of footage from the Capitol riot that Democrats played remains the top search term in the US. It's garnered praise online, with one lawyer who worked on Trump's first impeachment calling it a ""smart"" move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""When the video concluded, it was silent in the chamber."" Reporter James Poniewozik said that it included footage he had not seen before while MSNBC host Tiffany Cross commented on how powerful the montage was. Allow Twitter content?

Here's a look at what Republicans are saying about this first day of impeachment proceedings. TexasSenator John Cornyntold NBC he was not impressed by the Trump defence team. ""The presidentâs lawyer just rambled on and on,"" Cornyn said. ""Iâve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments and that was not one of the finest Iâve seen."" But Alabama CongressmanMo Brookscontinued to back the president (he was among the lawmakers to dispute the election results last month). ""Impeaching Donald Trump for inciting a riot is akin to impeaching him for Russian collusion â neither of which happened and both of which are Socialist Democrat concoctions,"" he tweeted. A Trump campaign account, meanwhile, tweeted a criticism of having Democrat Patrick Leahy chair the session. (Typically ensuring trial rules are followed is the job of the Chief Supreme Court Justice, but he declined.) ""Imagine having a 'trial' where the 'judge' had already voted to convict the defendant? 

That's what happens in banana republics, third world dictatorships and now the United States Senate. SAD!"" Conservative punditAnn Coultershared an opinion piece from political news site The Hill that suggested Republicans could unite the country by convicting Trump, commenting: ""And Democrats could unite the nation by giving them a wall in return!"" Rab is a doctor who has been very frustrated with Trump over the past four years and says his irresponsible conduct since the election merits his impeachment. He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Yes. Even before the violence at the Capitol, he made comments calling people to come to DC on 6 January and ""stop the steal"". When the president of the United States says something, people believe it. He also made comments encouraging people to fight like hell and scared them that they wouldn't have a country anymore if they didn't. We need to hold people accountable for doing things that are wrong. Six Republican senators just joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to move the trial forward. They are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. You may have heard most of those names before - Murkowski, Collins, Sasse, Toomey and Romney had previously taken a similar vote upholding the constitutionality of the trial proceedings. But Bill Cassidy is a noteworthy name on the list: he had previously voted to dismiss the trial. Cassidy later told CNN the House prosecutors made ""very good arguments"", noting he'd always planned to approach the trial ""with an open mind"" and as an ""impartial juror"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Well, that should about do it. There are going to be four days of arguments, Senate questions and, perhaps, witnesses. The final outcome, however, is all but certain. When the first substantive vote of the impeachment trial was taken on Tuesday â a vote about whether to have a trial at all â only six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats to proceed. Thatâs well short of the 17 Republicans who would be necessary to convict. And if there arenât 17 Republicans who think there should be a trial at all, it seems unlikely that the House impeachment managers are going to be able to change enough minds. Sam voted twice for Donald Trump but has turned his back on him, saying the attack on the Capitol ""made me sick to my stomach"". He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? There is not enough direct correlation and evidence for him to be convicted, so he should not be. But the impeachment in the House was a good slap on the wrist. There needed to be some sort of response to the way he handled - or didnât handle - the peaceful transfer of power. I don't think Trump himself was directly responsible for getting people riled up but I do think that he set the stage for what happened. But pursuing a conviction is just another means of tribalistic partisan politics that will further divide the country because there are still millions of Americans who voted for Trump and really like him. Alright, so in the last four hours, we've heard from House prosecutors and the Trump defence team. And we've just had a speedy vote on whether or not the trial is constitutional and can continue (it is, and it will). Now what?  Both Republicans and Democrats are keen on a speedy trial, US media report, so we could see a vote on conviction as early as this weekend if there are no witnesses to hear from. The Senate has voted 56-44 that it is constitutional to hold a trial for a president who is no longer in office. This means Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will continue, starting tomorrow. Only a simple majority was required on the measure. Now that arguments from both sides have concluded, the Senate is voting on whether or not to go forward with Trump's impeachment trial. BBC editors in Washington have cast a critical eye on how well the defence lawyers are making their case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill There is only one camera in the Senate chambers and it's not on the senators. Here's what's going on that you can't see. Republican Senators Murkowski, Collins and Graham are the studious notetakers. Senator Josh Hawley, also a Republican, was reading papers that didnât seem to be marked with the symbols of the House - so they probably weren't trial-related documents. Senator Sasse looked confused at one point and seemed to just shake his head before sharing a whisper with Senators Scott, Burr and Portman. Democratic Senator Sanders is staring straight ahead and listening to the arguments. Fellow Democrat Senator Booker is in the back of the room. He appeared to get a little restless and stood up and leaned against the back wall of the chamber. The former president's lawyers continue their arguments that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. Later tonight, the Senate will hold a vote on whether or not the trial can take place. Here are some of defence attorney David Schoen's arguments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump is facing legal troubles in Washington, and at home in Palm Beach, Florida, too. He bought his ocean-side property, an estate called Mar-a-Lago, in 1985, and spent part of his winters there. Then, after leaving the White House, he moved in. Some of his neighbours want him out, saying he will bring down property values, and have talked about evicting him. They say an agreement that was reached nearly 30 years ago, one that turned the estate into a private club, does not allow anyone to live there on a permanent basis unless they work on the premises. Trump, through a lawyer, has argued that he should be allowed to stay, as an employee. The issue is being discussed at a Palm Beach Town Council meeting on Tuesday.

It was written by Ella Wills, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Meierhans and George Wright, and edited by Sarah Collerton and Holly Wallis. We'll be back with more live coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Hereâs what you need to know this evening:  Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) - a group of scientists which advise government - have classed a variant first identified in Bristol - the Kent variant with a mutation - as a ""variant of concern"". Itâs not surprising that officials are adding this new
version of coronavirus to their ""variants of concern"" list. Targeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21
that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England. This new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant ""plus"". It has the same
N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that
scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra
mutation called E484K. E484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen
in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern. A cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the
E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus
rather than the Kent one. Inevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make
sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus. Experts are confident that the vaccines being used today
will still save lives and stop severe illness from Covid. As we've reported today, a series of measures are to come into force on Monday to prevent new variants of the coronavirus from being imported into the UK. Some travellers will be required to quarantine in hotels, at the cost of up to Â£1,750 for accommodation, food and tests. The changes will be applied differently across the UK - in Scotland everyone arriving from abroad will be affected, while in England and Wales hotel quarantine will be mandatory only for passengers who have recently travelled to a country hit by a new variant. The health secretary also confirmed that all international arrivals would need to take two PCR tests on days two and eight of their quarantine. Those who violate the rules will face fines and potentially up to 10 years in prison. The travel and tourism industries have said they understand why the measures are necessary, but have called on the government to do more to support firms and protect jobs. A spokeswoman for travel trade organisation Abta said that requiring passengers to pay for multiple tests once leisure travel is restarted would have ""serious cost implications"" and ""hurt demand"". She also urged ministers to ""develop a roadmap to reopen travel"". Mayeni JonesBBC News, Lagos Nigeriaâs Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says it has closed an unnamed test centre in the capital Abuja that was issuing fake Covid-19 certificates to travellers. Director general of the NCDC, Chikwe Ihekweazu, said they had found evidence that the lab was collecting samples and money from unsuspecting travellers, but failing to test them. They issued certificates claiming they had tested negative for the virus, enabling them to travel. Mr Ihekweazu added that a full list of accredited labs was available on the NCDCâs website and encouraged members of the public to only get tested at centres on the list. He said they were working on a platform where every lab in Nigeria could publish their test results which could then be easily verified by airlines or other countries wishing to check whether a result was genuine. He did not specify when this platform would be ready. Authorities in Nigeria recently suspended flights from the Emirates airline because the carrier wanted passengers from Nigeria to take a rapid Covid-19 test four hours before flying, in addition to the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Hotel chain Premier Inn has said it is investigating an allegation that staff broke Covid-19 lockdown rulesby having a party at one of its hotels. A photo showing 10 people lined up in a restaurant area has beenpublished in a newspaper,externalin Wales. The Daily Post said it understood the photo was taken at a leaving party at the Premier Inn in Holyhead, on Anglesey, on 29 January. The company said its Welsh hotels are shut in line with government guidance. Premier Inn said it had ""clear safety procedures in place for our team members to follow"". Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. The Scottish government said it would be ""block booking"" 1,300 rooms at six hotels near the country's airports. The some Â£1,750 cost of the stay will have to be borne by passengers themselves. A similar scheme will operate in other parts of the UK, but unlike Scotland, only flightsfrom countries on a ""red list"" will be covered. No hotels have yet confirmed whether rooms have been booked. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said there were approximately 1,600 Scottish arrivals in the last week of January, and numbers fell to 730 in the first week of February. He said: ""The number of travellers coming to Scotland directly is reducing and I expect these restrictions to reduce arrivals yet further. ""These measures will be backed with criminal offences as usual. The stronger approach we are taking are necessary and appropriate."" A tiger at Chessington zoo Animals are at risk of dying unless the government changes its Covid-19 funding for zoos, a charity has warned. The Zoo Animals Fund was created by the government to help zoos facing financial trouble in the pandemic with Â£100m available. In a letter to the prime minister, the British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums (Biaza) says the fund has ""failed to provide"" adequate support. It claims many zoos are unable to access the money. A spokeswoman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told Radio 1 Newsbeat the government understood challenges faced by zoos and aquariums. ""That is why we have set up the Zoo Animals Fund on top of the other support available - to ensure that those facing severe financial difficulties can continue to provide the best possible care for their animals."" Zoos are currently shut in this lockdown. Further Covid testing is being deployed in Lambeth, south London, where the South African variant has been found. The surge testing and genomic sequencing will be carried out in the SE27 0, SE27 9 and SW16 2 postcodes. People living within these areas are being urged to take a Covid-19 test this week, whether they are showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms should book a test in the usual way while others should visit their council website. Meanwhile the surge testing carried out in Woking is now complete and further data will be provided in due course, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Mass testing - or surge testing - is taking place across various parts of England to help stop the spread of new, more infectious strains of Covid-19. The South Africa variant and a new mutation of the Kent variant are those currently being targeted. More than 10,000 tests are being deployed in Manchester, after cases of the Kent variantwere found in two unconnected households. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris The French lunch hour - famous as a bastion of the French way of life - is under threat. The government says itâs planning to pass a new decree allowing workers to eat at their desks, a practice officially banned in the countryâs labour law.  But is this concession to changing times all down to coronavirus? Like many cultural ideals, the leisurely and elaborate French lunch-break is often defended more in theory than in practice. Even before Covid, the daily queues outside sandwich shops were just as daunting as the waiters straightening tables on cafÃ© terraces. In fact, several polls suggest that a majority of French workers have been eating their lunch in the office for years. But, long under siege, the concept of the pause-dÃ©jÃ©uner is now under attack from Covid as well. With restaurants and cafes closed - except for take-aways or deliveries - and workplace canteens rife with new restrictions, many people have little option but to eat their lunch at their desks - or even, according to one report, eating in isolation in their cars. The idea that eating at your desk was officially banned has been greeted with surprise - even derision - here.   Eye-rolling at Franceâs impenetrable labour laws is another workplace tradition, and thereâs comfort in hanging on to at least some of them. The first doses of Sinopharm vaccines arrived late on Sunday Peru has started its Covid vaccination campaign after the first consignment of 300,000 Sinopharm vaccines arrived on Sunday. The South American country is in the midst of a second wave of the pandemic. With the hospitals close to full capacity, the authorities have decided that medical staff should be among the first to be vaccinated. On Tuesday morning local time, Josef Vallejos, the chief of the intensive care unit at a hospital in Lima, received the first jab. Members of the military, security guards and election workers will also be given priority ahead of the general election scheduled for 11 April. Peru has had almost 1.2 million confirmed cases and more than 42,000 people have died. Earlier, the health secretary announcedtougher border measures in Englandto tackle the spread of new variants of the coronavirus - such asthe one originally found in South Africa. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, says 170 cases of the South African variant have been identified so far, including 18 that are not linked to travel. Our health editor, Michelle Roberts, saysthere's no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illnessfor most people - but there are concerns it can spread more readily than the original strain and vaccines may not work quite as well against it. More on that fact-finding mission to China. Dr Peter Daszak, who is part of the WHO team looking into the origins of Covid-19, said ""the supply chains to Huanan Seafood Market were extensive"". Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan was linked to early cases of coronavirus and was quickly closed by the authorities. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Focus needs to shift to Huanan market supply chains' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online As we've been reporting, a team of investigators led by the World Health Organization (WHO) has spent four weekslooking into the origins of Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It was unlikely that the group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Covid-19 restrictions will not be fully lifted in Northern Ireland until 70 to 80% of people have been vaccinated, the chief medical officer says. So far, about 22% of adults have received at least a first dose of a vaccine, Dr Michael McBride told a media briefing. If the rate of case numbers keeps falling, ""we will hopefully be able to do some things this summer like we did last summer"", he says. Over time new variants such as those which have emerged in South Africa and Brazil could be detected in NI, however, he says ""they may not become the dominant strain"". Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, says arrangements are being made for clinically vulnerable 16 to 18-year-olds to receive the Pfizer vaccinewithin weeks. Here are some graphs to show today's coronavirus figures. Although deaths are still high, they are coming down - and so are case numbers compared to last Tuesday. We can see that if the rate of vaccinations keeps going the way it is, the government will surpass its goal of reaching 15m people by mid-February. Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg South Africa's decision to pause its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine aftera study showed ""disappointing"" resultsagainst its new Covid-19 variant has left the nation in shock. An small preliminary trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases. One and half million doses of the jab had been bought for healthcare workers and they were due to start getting their vaccinations this week. Frontline workers have been left feeling anxious. Siviwe Gwarube, head of health for the main opposition Democratic Alliance, said the setback left them vulnerable to a third wave. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. ""I had a lot of hope that the vaccine would change the situation we're in as a country,"" a young male medic, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC. ""A lot of people are losing jobs. I'm a medical student and we are really exposed to Covid-19. It was a blow for me when I heard that the efficacy of the vaccine was lower."" Read more here Samuel LandoBBC Monitoring A video in which a Cameroonian
politician makes a series of false claims about Covid-19 vaccines and the
coronavirus pandemic has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. Andre Banda Kani - who is the
chairman of the Nouveau Mouvement Populaire (NMP), a minor political party in
Cameroon - repeats baseless conspiracy theories that Western coronavirus
vaccines cause genetic changes and contain âmicrochipsâ. The BBC hasdebunked
these claims in detail here. Kani falsely alleges that vaccination campaigns for Covid-19 are part of a âglobalistâ plot to reduce the world's population, led by influential figures like Bill Gates. Weâve written previously about how the Microsoft founder becamea popular target of coronavirus conspiracies. The video has now been removed from Facebook, but others containing false claims about vaccines are still online. More than two million people have died with Covid-19. Scientists and health experts say that vaccines are the best way of reducing deaths and protecting people against the virus. This video can not be played Covid: Matt Hancock praises doctor who DJs in scrubs A junior doctor has been performing DJ sets in his kitchen in Birmingham to boost medics' morale during the pandemic. Kishan Bodalia, 26, launched ""NHSessions"" in England's first lockdown ""to lift the spirits of my NHS colleagues and the nation as a whole"". ""I just want to help everyone dance, exercise, and above all, smile,"" he said. It's even grabbed the attention of Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who called it a ""brilliant initiative"" and picked his track of the day. ""I am so flattered to hear that the health secretary is a fan and that the project has received such recognition,"" Dr Bodalia said. A studentis due to stand trial accused of holding a partyfor about 50 people in an alleged breach of Covid-19 laws. Police said Bailey Stancer, 19, was fined Â£10,000 after officers were called to Harlaxton Drive, Lenton, Nottingham, on 11 September. Mr Stancer, of the same address, denied the charge at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Monday. The University of Nottingham student is set to face a two-day trial, starting on 4 August, at the same court. Mr Stancer was released on unconditional bail, Nottinghamshire Police added. Â© 2025 BBC.

Two tests for all UK arrivals during quarantine,"All travellers entering the UK will be required to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining in an attempt to prevent variants entering the country. Arrivals will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The Department of Health said the move would enable authorities to track new cases more effectively. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out more details in the Commons later. It is in addition to the current rules which require travellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. This test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. Travellers must provide contact details and theirUK address,external. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. Who has to self-isolate and for how long? The new test and quarantine rules for travellers Why Australia's quarantine system has seen breaches The new testing policy comes amid concern about new variants entering the country that are more resistant to existing vaccines. Early trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine suggest it offers""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. There have been 147 cases of the variant have found in the UK. Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results were ""expected"" because the virus is ""introducing mutations... to allow it to still transmit in populations where there's some immunity."" ""As long as we have enough immunity to prevent severe disease, hospitalisations and death, then we're going to be fine in the future in the pandemic,"" he said. On Monday, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said the South African variant did not appear to have a ""transmissibility advantage"" over the one first identified in Kent, which has spread across the UK. It was therefore unlikely to ""overrun"" the Kent variant, he told Monday's coronavirus briefing. Why we should not rush to judgement on Oxford jab How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains how to fly safely during a global pandemic From 15 February, UK residents and Irish nationals arriving from certain countries will have to quarantine in hotels. Passengers will have to stay in their rooms for 10 nights, with security guards accompanying if they go outside. The rules will apply to UK nationals and residents arriving from33 ""red list"" Covid-19 hotspots,external- mostly in South America and Africa - where it's feared Covid variants may have already spread. Passengers will be expected to pay for the cost of the accommodation. Non-UK travellers who have been in these countries in the 10 days before travelling are banned from entry. All travellers - including British nationals -must self-isolate for 10 dayswhen they get to the UK. The ""test to release scheme"" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules. Passengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests. Derek Jones, chief executive of luxury travel company Kuoni, welcomed the testing plan. ""As we have said all along, a robust testing regime is the way to open up travel again but it has to replace or at least shorten quarantine,"" he said. It comes as Prof Van-Tam warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays. Speaking at Monday's coronavirus briefing, he said: ""The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,"" he said. ""I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say."" Lockdown rules mean people mustonly travel abroad for essential reasons,external. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including: Work that cannot be done from home Medical appointments Educational reasons People leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure.

Bitcoin hits fresh highs after Tesla investment,"Bitcoin has hit record highs for a second day after Elon Musk's car company Tesla said it had bought about $1.5bn (Â£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin rose above $48,000 (Â£34,820) before falling back, but it remains about 25% higher than a week ago. Some investors took Tesla's move as a signal that Bitcoin would become a mainstream financial asset. However, there was some criticism about a green car firm investing in such an energy intensive currency. Bitcoin currently uses more energy than Argentina every year,according to analysis from the University of Cambridge,external. Production of the cryptocurrency, known as ""Bitcoin mining"", needs energy-hungry computer hardware and ever-greater amounts of processing power. Mike Butcher, an editor at news website Techcrunch, tweeted: ""Tesla: Sells carbon credits to buy Bitcoin, which requires as much energy (not always Green energy) as a small country to mine.""

This means it doesn't have a physical form. Instead, units of digital currency are traded over a computer network. It operates over a global network with thousands upon thousands of nodes - a machine within a network like a computer or some other device - which together process and store transactions. Read more here. Explaining its investment on Monday, Tesla said thatit wanted to maximise returns on cash lying dormant in the company's accounts. It also expects to accept payment for its electric cars in Bitcoin in future. The moves sparked market interest which carried on into Tuesday. Shares of companies that provide trading platforms for Bitcoin and the technology to mine the cryptocurrency have surged in China, South Korea and Australia, and big computer chip-making firms such as SK Hynix also rose. The cryptocurrency has already risen in value by 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally in 2020, as investors search for alternative assets at a time when interest rates in many countries are at record lows. Bitcoin has had some interest from big investment firms, including Blackrock, which recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency. However, central banks remain sceptical about the cryptocurrency. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method, saying it lacked ""intrinsic value"" unlike cash or gold. Some institutional investors are also wary of the price volatility of Bitcoin. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said: ""The average institutional investor is shaking their head. ""For these folks who are believers in cryptocurrency, [Tesla's investment] gives them another layer of support that crypto is the future."" But Bitcoin scepticism does not mean that central banks and regulators are against digital currencies per se. In China in particular regulators are starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use.

Government's Covid help 'skewed towards men' - MPs,"This video can not be played Sharon Luca says she has ""the brunt of everything"" as she tries to juggle work and home-schooling Government policies have ""repeatedly skewed towards men"", a committee of MPs has said in a report on the impact of coronavirus on men and women. Committee chair Caroline Nokes said the government had ""repeatedly failed to consider"" the labour market and caring inequalities faced by women. The report makes 20 recommendations including making it easier for staff to get flexible working arrangements. The government said it had spent over Â£200bn on job support schemes. ""Throughout the pandemic this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods, and will continue to do so,"" a spokesperson said. 'I had to give up my job to home school my son' Covid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' Will women have to work harder after the pandemic? Sharon Luca from Warwickshire works from home, running a clothing business and a charity raising money to help parents of stillborn children. Her husband also works full time and so cannot help with homeschooling. Because she is helping her son do school work, Sharon says she has ""barely had anytime to focus on my business or the charity"". This has meant losing ""a big chunk"" of her earnings she says, adding: ""My income is my only independence."" Sharon thinks women are bearing the brunt of homeschooling. ""I know a lot of mums who work from home or have small businesses like myself and all of them are saying that they've been affected by homeschooling. ""They really don't have the time now to put in the energy to earn a living from their small business - homeschooling overtook everything."" During the pandemic, Clare has struggled to find work that will accommodate her child care responsibilities Clare Jeffries, a single mother from Banbury, was made redundant from her job in HR during the pandemic and now can't find a role that's flexible enough to accommodate childcare  - despite lots of searching. She worries this is a problem that largely impacts on those with caring responsibility and ""disproportionately affects women"". She says ""inclusion is a choice"" and that employers ""need to think about the choices they're making"". ""Things like flexible working need to be a right for everybody."" She also wants the government to fund more childcare ""so that we can actually get back into work easier"". The Women and Equalities Committee has examined some of these problems and says the government needs to ""start actively analysing and assessing the equality impact of every policy"". Its chair Ms Nokes said: ""Government policies have repeatedly skewed towards men - and it keeps happening."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said although ministers had not ""deliberately designed policies to be sexist,"" there had been ""institutional thoughtlessness"" about their particular impact on women. The Conservative MP - wholost her job as immigration ministerwhen Boris Johnson entered Downing Street - also said the opinions of female cabinet ministers were ""not being played into debates and decisions"". She told the programme there was a ""very blokey mentality at the top"" of government, which had suffered from ""the predominance of single-sex education round the cabinet table"". The report notes that during the pandemic, women spent more time on caring duties than men, yet ""furlough was not clearly articulated as a right for those with caring responsibilities"". On sick pay, the report cites evidence that women were less likely to qualify for statutory sick pay, in part due to caring responsibilities, which meant their wages were too low to be eligible for the support, Making over 20 recommendations, the committee said the government should: Change the law to allow employees to request flexible working arrangements when they start a job rather than waiting 26 weeks as currently mandated by law Maintain increases in support including the Â£20 rise in Universal Credit Extend redundancy protection to cover pregnant women and new mothers Review the availability of sick pay Conduct an equality assessment of the support measures introduced during the pandemic Reinstate gender pay gap reporting which was cancelled in March 2020 due to the pandemic Review childcare provision to provide support not only for working parents but those who are job-seeking or retraining. The MPs also urged the Women and Equalities Minister Liz Truss to be ""much more ambitious"" in getting other government departments to consider inequality when designing policies. Responding to the report, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, called for a ""gendered response to the crisis"". She added: ""The unequal impact of coronavirus on women is huge - women are more likely to work in low-paid sectors, to work in sectors which are currently shutdown such as retail and hospitality, and have taken on more caring responsibilities. ""The government cannot continue to deny and dismiss the reality of gender inequality across society."" Joeli Brearley, CEO and founder of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said ""policy decisions have repeatedly ignored the specific needs of women"", adding: ""We are currently witnessing a generational roll back in maternal employment that will take us decades to repair."" British Chambers of Commerce co-executive director Claire Walker said that a national focus was needed to help parents and carers. ""Employers value the skills women bring to the workplace and the evidence shows that businesses with a diverse and inclusive workforce perform better."" She added: ""Economic growth will depend on access to high quality, affordable childcare."" A government spokesperson said it had spent over Â£200bn on schemes ""safeguarding people's jobs"" including the Self Employment Income Scheme helping the 1.7 million self-employed women in the UK. ""Covid-19 is prompting a culture shift with more people than ever before working flexibly, and the government wants to harness that as we recover. ""By doing so, we could see more equal sharing of care work by parents, and more flexibility from employers, enabling us to unleash the potential of everyone across the country.""

"Grocery shopping has changed for good, says Ocado","The grocery landscape worldwide is changing ""for good"", online supermarket Ocado has said, after a year in which the global pandemic forced many people to buy online for the first time. Ocado's comments came as it reported a 35% jump in sales,externalover the past year. Amid rocketing demand the UK-based firm, which is 21 years old this year, narrowed losses from Â£214.5m to Â£44m. The company said many customers were saying they were unlikely to revert to pre-crisis shopping habits. Ocado's chief executive, Tim Steiner, said he wanted to ""pay tribute to the remarkable work of our colleagues in exceptionally challenging circumstances"". Lockdown has thrown up challenges for all supermarkets and Ocado itself has struggled to deliver smoothly at all times. The firm, which previously delivered for Waitrose, had to cancel some orders when its new partnership with Marks & Spencer launched on 1 September, angering customers. That move was its most notable in the UK, but Ocado has been expanding around the world, spurred by demand for its advanced technology and robot-operated warehouses. It has tie ups with Kroger in the US, Casino in France and Aeon in Japan, and is also planning three new warehouses in the UK this year, which will boost capacity by 40%. Ocado has been one of the best-performing shares in the FTSE 100 in the past year, roughly doubling in value since last March. It is in the perfect position to benefit from the restrictions put in place to control the coronavirus, with shoppers clamouring for online deliveries in order to avoid a trip to the supermarket. These results - for the 12 months to the end of November, so not including the most recent national lockdown in England - show grocery sales up 35% to Â£2.2bn. You might have thought that jump in sales would have sent the shares up, but in fact they were down - 4% - in early trading. Investors have looked past the headline sales number to see another pre-tax loss for the year  - Â£44m. That is not so surprising in itself, but shareholders would also have noted the projected increase in capital spending, which will rise to Â£700m in the coming year. Ocado is spending heavily not only on technology, but also new warehouses. Shares in Ocado have always priced in the promise of future profits, and today's numbers made that promise seem that much further off. Ocado said in its full year statement on Tuesday: ""The pandemic has accelerated the rate of channel shift to online. ""Online grocery market share in the UK has nearly doubled over the last year to 14%, according to Kantar. Similar trends are observable in the United States as well as many other countries around the world."" Ross Hindle, from research firm Third Bridge, said: ""These are not just results, these are remarkable results. Ocado couldn't have asked for better trading conditions. ""The M&S partnership has, so far, proved positive for Ocado, with management highlighting that access to M&S products is now higher than the benchmark Waitrose set.""

Cyberpunk 2077 makers hit by ransomware hack,"Cyberpunk 2077 has been beset by delays and glitches The maker of popular video game Cyberpunk 2077 has been hacked in a ransomware attack. CD Projekt Red said hackers had accessed its internal network, digitally scrambled some of its data servers and tried to blackmail it. The perpetrators claim to have stolen source code for several of the firm's games which they said they would leak unless a payment was made. But the Polish games company said it would not negotiate. In a statement on Twitter,,externalCD Projekt Red posted a copy of the ransom note which said the hackers had copied code from Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent, and Witcher 3, including an unreleased version of the latter. âWe have also dumped all of your documents relating to accounting, administration legal, HR, investor relations and more!â the note added. ""Dumping"" means copying the information to an external source. âIf we will not come to an agreement, then your source codes will be sold or leaked online and your documents will be sent to our contacts in gaming journalism,â read the note, giving a deadline of 48 hours. Source code is the human-readable version of a computer program before it is transformed for use. Releasing it could make it easier for people to write hacks for the titles or even publish their own altered versions, as well as reveal some of their development secrets. In a statement, posted by the game developers on Twitter, it said it has secured its âIT infrastructure and begun restoring the dataâ from back-ups. âWe will not give in to the demands or negotiate with the actor,â it said, adding that no personal data had been compromised in the breach. The company has informed law enforcement and data protection authorities, while it investigates the issue. This video can not be played Keanu Reeves talks to BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue This is the latest in a series of bad news for the developers after the release of Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed several times, only for users to then experience glitches in the game. ""This will be frustrating for users of the game, but as consumers are generally very sympathetic when something like this happens,"" said Louise Shorthouse, senior gaming analyst at Ampere Analysis. ""This comes after a string of recent ransomware attacks on games companies, including Capcom and Ubisoft late last year. ""Fixes and updates for Cyberpunk 2077 may take a backseat for a while, as mitigating the effects of the ransomware attack becomes the priority."" This probably couldn't have come at a worse time for the embattled games studio. However, its response has been extraordinary and is already being praised by the cyber-security world. In one Tweet, the company has demonstrated a new gold standard response to dealing with ransomware. The company is being transparent about the attack but also says it is not negotiating with the cyber-criminals and instead relying on well-managed back-up systems. CD Projekt Red has even released a screen grab of the ransom note which will be invaluable for researchers. It doesn't sound like much and there will be questions about how the firm was able to be breached in the first place. But in a world of empty press releases and companies secretly paying criminals huge ransoms, CD Projekt Red has shown what can and, in the eyes of many, should be done to deal with the growing problem of ransomware hacking.

Chinese regulators throw spanner in Tesla's works,"Five Chinese regulators have summoned Tesla over quality and safety issues as it ramps up production of its latest model in its Shanghai factory. China is Tesla's largest market after the US and the electric carmaker sold 120,000 units there in 2020. Authorities have recently received complaints about abnormal acceleration and battery fires, according to a statement released on Monday. Tesla said it will strengthen self-inspection and its internal management. China is the world's largest car market and its government has been heavily promoting the adoption of electric vehicles. This helped Tesla sell 15,484 locally-made vehicles there last month, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Bitcoin jumps as Tesla buys $1.5bn of currency Ford to start building electric Mustangs in China Tesla recalls vehicles over failing touchscreens But Tesla now faces a setback from Chinese consumer watchdogs who have asked Tesla to improve internal management, comply with Chinese law and regulations and to protect consumers' rights. Tesla Shanghai said it ""sincerely accepted the guidance of government departments"" and that it had ""deeply reflected on shortcomings"" in a statement. Tesla is already facing quality issues in the US and is to recall large numbers of Model S and Model X cars over failing touchscreens. All Teslas have built-in screen displays, which in some models are now failing The timing couldn't be worse for the world's most valuable car company as it faces growing competition from Chinese rivals. Chinese electric-vehicle startup NIO unveiled a fourth production model last month while Li Auto and XPeng have new models in production. Elon Musk's car firm won approval for its Shanghai factory in 2018, becoming the first foreign automaker to operate a wholly-owned plant in China. On Monday, Tesla threw its weight behind Bitcoin after revealing it bought $1.5bn (Â£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency in January and expects to start accepting it as payment in future.

Prison 'behind smallest county's Covid surge',"The Ministry of Justice said it is taking ""precautionary measures"" and ""will continue to closely monitor the situation"" An outbreak of Covid-19 at a prison has caused England's smallest county to have the highest infection rates in the country, officials have said. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed cases at HMP Stocken in Rutland. On Monday, statistics showed the county had 199 new cases in the week up to 4 February, giving it a rate per 100,000 people of 498.4. Rutland and Melton MP Alicia Kearns said she understands ""around half"" of cases in the county were in the prison. The rate in the week up to 28 January was 162.8, with 65 new infections. The category C prison - which can hold up to 950 inmates - had been free of the virus for 11 months, according to the Prison Service. Mike Sandys, director of public health for Leicestershire County Council and Rutland, said Rutland's small population of just under 40,000 residents meant its infection rate was more susceptible to spikes. He said the outbreak at Stocken probably involved ""tens of cases"", but urged people to maintain social distancing and other preventative measures to ""stop the virus spreading"". ""It doesn't take so many cases, given the small size of Rutland's population, for that to make a really big difference to the rate,"" he said. ""There is at least some reassurance for local people - it isn't that we're seeing a massive increase in community transmission, it is contained within the prison setting."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Despite the prison outbreak Mr Sandys said infection rates in Rutland had been following a downward trend, with rates across the East Midlands ""coming down steadily"" in recent weeks. As well as lateral flow tests for staff, the prison has organised mass testing for those on affected wings Ms Kearns, the Conservative MP for the county, said she believed ""around half of all cases"" in Rutland were in the prison. But she added the governor had her ""full support and confidence"" to get the outbreak under control. Officials confirmed mass testing for all staff and everyone housed on four of its seven wings which are affected by the virus. The MoJ has not confirmed how many positive cases have been identified at the prison, but said it is taking ""precautionary measures"" and ""will continue to closely monitor the situation"". ""Our priority is to limit the spread of the virus and protect the lives of those who live and work in our prisons,"" a statement said.

"Government's Covid help 'skewed towards men' - MPsGender inequalities in the economy have been ignored in the pandemic, a Commons committee says.UK Politics","This video can not be played Sharon Luca says she has ""the brunt of everything"" as she tries to juggle work and home-schooling Government policies have ""repeatedly skewed towards men"", a committee of MPs has said in a report on the impact of coronavirus on men and women. Committee chair Caroline Nokes said the government had ""repeatedly failed to consider"" the labour market and caring inequalities faced by women. The report makes 20 recommendations including making it easier for staff to get flexible working arrangements. The government said it had spent over Â£200bn on job support schemes. ""Throughout the pandemic this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods, and will continue to do so,"" a spokesperson said. 'I had to give up my job to home school my son' Covid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' Will women have to work harder after the pandemic? Sharon Luca from Warwickshire works from home, running a clothing business and a charity raising money to help parents of stillborn children. Her husband also works full time and so cannot help with homeschooling. Because she is helping her son do school work, Sharon says she has ""barely had anytime to focus on my business or the charity"". This has meant losing ""a big chunk"" of her earnings she says, adding: ""My income is my only independence."" Sharon thinks women are bearing the brunt of homeschooling. ""I know a lot of mums who work from home or have small businesses like myself and all of them are saying that they've been affected by homeschooling. ""They really don't have the time now to put in the energy to earn a living from their small business - homeschooling overtook everything."" During the pandemic, Clare has struggled to find work that will accommodate her child care responsibilities Clare Jeffries, a single mother from Banbury, was made redundant from her job in HR during the pandemic and now can't find a role that's flexible enough to accommodate childcare  - despite lots of searching. She worries this is a problem that largely impacts on those with caring responsibility and ""disproportionately affects women"". She says ""inclusion is a choice"" and that employers ""need to think about the choices they're making"". ""Things like flexible working need to be a right for everybody."" She also wants the government to fund more childcare ""so that we can actually get back into work easier"". The Women and Equalities Committee has examined some of these problems and says the government needs to ""start actively analysing and assessing the equality impact of every policy"". Its chair Ms Nokes said: ""Government policies have repeatedly skewed towards men - and it keeps happening."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said although ministers had not ""deliberately designed policies to be sexist,"" there had been ""institutional thoughtlessness"" about their particular impact on women. The Conservative MP - wholost her job as immigration ministerwhen Boris Johnson entered Downing Street - also said the opinions of female cabinet ministers were ""not being played into debates and decisions"". She told the programme there was a ""very blokey mentality at the top"" of government, which had suffered from ""the predominance of single-sex education round the cabinet table"". The report notes that during the pandemic, women spent more time on caring duties than men, yet ""furlough was not clearly articulated as a right for those with caring responsibilities"". On sick pay, the report cites evidence that women were less likely to qualify for statutory sick pay, in part due to caring responsibilities, which meant their wages were too low to be eligible for the support, Making over 20 recommendations, the committee said the government should: Change the law to allow employees to request flexible working arrangements when they start a job rather than waiting 26 weeks as currently mandated by law Maintain increases in support including the Â£20 rise in Universal Credit Extend redundancy protection to cover pregnant women and new mothers Review the availability of sick pay Conduct an equality assessment of the support measures introduced during the pandemic Reinstate gender pay gap reporting which was cancelled in March 2020 due to the pandemic Review childcare provision to provide support not only for working parents but those who are job-seeking or retraining. The MPs also urged the Women and Equalities Minister Liz Truss to be ""much more ambitious"" in getting other government departments to consider inequality when designing policies. Responding to the report, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, called for a ""gendered response to the crisis"". She added: ""The unequal impact of coronavirus on women is huge - women are more likely to work in low-paid sectors, to work in sectors which are currently shutdown such as retail and hospitality, and have taken on more caring responsibilities. ""The government cannot continue to deny and dismiss the reality of gender inequality across society."" Joeli Brearley, CEO and founder of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said ""policy decisions have repeatedly ignored the specific needs of women"", adding: ""We are currently witnessing a generational roll back in maternal employment that will take us decades to repair."" British Chambers of Commerce co-executive director Claire Walker said that a national focus was needed to help parents and carers. ""Employers value the skills women bring to the workplace and the evidence shows that businesses with a diverse and inclusive workforce perform better."" She added: ""Economic growth will depend on access to high quality, affordable childcare."" A government spokesperson said it had spent over Â£200bn on schemes ""safeguarding people's jobs"" including the Self Employment Income Scheme helping the 1.7 million self-employed women in the UK. ""Covid-19 is prompting a culture shift with more people than ever before working flexibly, and the government wants to harness that as we recover. ""By doing so, we could see more equal sharing of care work by parents, and more flexibility from employers, enabling us to unleash the potential of everyone across the country.""

It was written by Ella Wills, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Meierhans and George Wright, and edited by Sarah Collerton and Holly Wallis. We'll be back with more live coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Hereâs what you need to know this evening:  Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) - a group of scientists which advise government - have classed a variant first identified in Bristol - the Kent variant with a mutation - as a ""variant of concern"". Itâs not surprising that officials are adding this new
version of coronavirus to their ""variants of concern"" list. Targeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21
that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England. This new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant ""plus"". It has the same
N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that
scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra
mutation called E484K. E484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen
in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern. A cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the
E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus
rather than the Kent one. Inevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make
sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus. Experts are confident that the vaccines being used today
will still save lives and stop severe illness from Covid. As we've reported today, a series of measures are to come into force on Monday to prevent new variants of the coronavirus from being imported into the UK. Some travellers will be required to quarantine in hotels, at the cost of up to Â£1,750 for accommodation, food and tests. The changes will be applied differently across the UK - in Scotland everyone arriving from abroad will be affected, while in England and Wales hotel quarantine will be mandatory only for passengers who have recently travelled to a country hit by a new variant. The health secretary also confirmed that all international arrivals would need to take two PCR tests on days two and eight of their quarantine. Those who violate the rules will face fines and potentially up to 10 years in prison. The travel and tourism industries have said they understand why the measures are necessary, but have called on the government to do more to support firms and protect jobs. A spokeswoman for travel trade organisation Abta said that requiring passengers to pay for multiple tests once leisure travel is restarted would have ""serious cost implications"" and ""hurt demand"". She also urged ministers to ""develop a roadmap to reopen travel"". Mayeni JonesBBC News, Lagos Nigeriaâs Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says it has closed an unnamed test centre in the capital Abuja that was issuing fake Covid-19 certificates to travellers. Director general of the NCDC, Chikwe Ihekweazu, said they had found evidence that the lab was collecting samples and money from unsuspecting travellers, but failing to test them. They issued certificates claiming they had tested negative for the virus, enabling them to travel. Mr Ihekweazu added that a full list of accredited labs was available on the NCDCâs website and encouraged members of the public to only get tested at centres on the list. He said they were working on a platform where every lab in Nigeria could publish their test results which could then be easily verified by airlines or other countries wishing to check whether a result was genuine. He did not specify when this platform would be ready. Authorities in Nigeria recently suspended flights from the Emirates airline because the carrier wanted passengers from Nigeria to take a rapid Covid-19 test four hours before flying, in addition to the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Hotel chain Premier Inn has said it is investigating an allegation that staff broke Covid-19 lockdown rulesby having a party at one of its hotels. A photo showing 10 people lined up in a restaurant area has beenpublished in a newspaper,externalin Wales. The Daily Post said it understood the photo was taken at a leaving party at the Premier Inn in Holyhead, on Anglesey, on 29 January. The company said its Welsh hotels are shut in line with government guidance. Premier Inn said it had ""clear safety procedures in place for our team members to follow"". Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. The Scottish government said it would be ""block booking"" 1,300 rooms at six hotels near the country's airports. The some Â£1,750 cost of the stay will have to be borne by passengers themselves. A similar scheme will operate in other parts of the UK, but unlike Scotland, only flightsfrom countries on a ""red list"" will be covered. No hotels have yet confirmed whether rooms have been booked. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said there were approximately 1,600 Scottish arrivals in the last week of January, and numbers fell to 730 in the first week of February. He said: ""The number of travellers coming to Scotland directly is reducing and I expect these restrictions to reduce arrivals yet further. ""These measures will be backed with criminal offences as usual. The stronger approach we are taking are necessary and appropriate."" A tiger at Chessington zoo Animals are at risk of dying unless the government changes its Covid-19 funding for zoos, a charity has warned. The Zoo Animals Fund was created by the government to help zoos facing financial trouble in the pandemic with Â£100m available. In a letter to the prime minister, the British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums (Biaza) says the fund has ""failed to provide"" adequate support. It claims many zoos are unable to access the money. A spokeswoman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told Radio 1 Newsbeat the government understood challenges faced by zoos and aquariums. ""That is why we have set up the Zoo Animals Fund on top of the other support available - to ensure that those facing severe financial difficulties can continue to provide the best possible care for their animals."" Zoos are currently shut in this lockdown. Further Covid testing is being deployed in Lambeth, south London, where the South African variant has been found. The surge testing and genomic sequencing will be carried out in the SE27 0, SE27 9 and SW16 2 postcodes. People living within these areas are being urged to take a Covid-19 test this week, whether they are showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms should book a test in the usual way while others should visit their council website. Meanwhile the surge testing carried out in Woking is now complete and further data will be provided in due course, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Mass testing - or surge testing - is taking place across various parts of England to help stop the spread of new, more infectious strains of Covid-19. The South Africa variant and a new mutation of the Kent variant are those currently being targeted. More than 10,000 tests are being deployed in Manchester, after cases of the Kent variantwere found in two unconnected households. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris The French lunch hour - famous as a bastion of the French way of life - is under threat. The government says itâs planning to pass a new decree allowing workers to eat at their desks, a practice officially banned in the countryâs labour law.  But is this concession to changing times all down to coronavirus? Like many cultural ideals, the leisurely and elaborate French lunch-break is often defended more in theory than in practice. Even before Covid, the daily queues outside sandwich shops were just as daunting as the waiters straightening tables on cafÃ© terraces. In fact, several polls suggest that a majority of French workers have been eating their lunch in the office for years. But, long under siege, the concept of the pause-dÃ©jÃ©uner is now under attack from Covid as well. With restaurants and cafes closed - except for take-aways or deliveries - and workplace canteens rife with new restrictions, many people have little option but to eat their lunch at their desks - or even, according to one report, eating in isolation in their cars. The idea that eating at your desk was officially banned has been greeted with surprise - even derision - here.   Eye-rolling at Franceâs impenetrable labour laws is another workplace tradition, and thereâs comfort in hanging on to at least some of them. The first doses of Sinopharm vaccines arrived late on Sunday Peru has started its Covid vaccination campaign after the first consignment of 300,000 Sinopharm vaccines arrived on Sunday. The South American country is in the midst of a second wave of the pandemic. With the hospitals close to full capacity, the authorities have decided that medical staff should be among the first to be vaccinated. On Tuesday morning local time, Josef Vallejos, the chief of the intensive care unit at a hospital in Lima, received the first jab. Members of the military, security guards and election workers will also be given priority ahead of the general election scheduled for 11 April. Peru has had almost 1.2 million confirmed cases and more than 42,000 people have died. Earlier, the health secretary announcedtougher border measures in Englandto tackle the spread of new variants of the coronavirus - such asthe one originally found in South Africa. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, says 170 cases of the South African variant have been identified so far, including 18 that are not linked to travel. Our health editor, Michelle Roberts, saysthere's no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illnessfor most people - but there are concerns it can spread more readily than the original strain and vaccines may not work quite as well against it. More on that fact-finding mission to China. Dr Peter Daszak, who is part of the WHO team looking into the origins of Covid-19, said ""the supply chains to Huanan Seafood Market were extensive"". Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan was linked to early cases of coronavirus and was quickly closed by the authorities. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Focus needs to shift to Huanan market supply chains' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online As we've been reporting, a team of investigators led by the World Health Organization (WHO) has spent four weekslooking into the origins of Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It was unlikely that the group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Covid-19 restrictions will not be fully lifted in Northern Ireland until 70 to 80% of people have been vaccinated, the chief medical officer says. So far, about 22% of adults have received at least a first dose of a vaccine, Dr Michael McBride told a media briefing. If the rate of case numbers keeps falling, ""we will hopefully be able to do some things this summer like we did last summer"", he says. Over time new variants such as those which have emerged in South Africa and Brazil could be detected in NI, however, he says ""they may not become the dominant strain"". Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, says arrangements are being made for clinically vulnerable 16 to 18-year-olds to receive the Pfizer vaccinewithin weeks. Here are some graphs to show today's coronavirus figures. Although deaths are still high, they are coming down - and so are case numbers compared to last Tuesday.

"Family sue Robinhood trading app over son's deathThe parents of Alex Kearns, 20, say he thought he had lost $730,000 when he took his own life.","Dan and Dorothy Kearns say their son thought he had caused ""impending financial disaster"" The parents of a man who killed himself last year have filed a lawsuit against trading app Robinhood over his death. The lawsuit, first reported by CBS News, said 20-year-old Alex Kearns mistakenly believed he owed $730,000 (Â£530,000) when he took his own life. Dan and Dorothy Kearns say their son was unable to get help or support from customer services before he died. Robinhood said in a statement to the BBC they were ""devastated"" by Alex's death and had made improvements. The app, which allows anyone to buy and trade stocks, says on its website that it is ""on a mission to democratise finance"" and is currently running an advertising campaign under the slogan of ""We are all investors"". It recently made headlines for limiting sales of some shares to users after US retailer GameStop saw its stock surge. Elon Musk grills Robinhood boss GameStop: What is it and why was it trending? 'I didn't know I'd lose money so fast' Speaking to CBS,the parents of Alex Kearns say he began using Robinhood just before he graduated high school,external. Mr and Mrs Kearns say they did not know the app had also approved him to buy and sell options - a risky financial instrument - despite a lack of financial experience. They say their son realised on 11 June 2020 that his account had been restricted by Robinhood amid what appeared to be a negative balance of more than $700,000 on his account. CBS reports the student received an automated email at 03:26 early the next morning asking him to take ""immediate action"" to pay more than $170,000 within days. The family accuse the company of having no ""meaningful customer support"" when he needed it The family say the 20-year-old emailed customer service several times asking for support and help understanding the figures on his trading account, but only received stock response messages saying they would get back to him. ""They provide no mechanism through a telephone call, through live email service, to get live answers to questions,"" a lawyer for the family told CBS. His parents were told by police later that day, on 12 June, that Alex had died. ""He thought he blew up his life. He thought he screwed up beyond repair,"" Mr Kearns said in the interview, in which he said his son had ""just needed a little help"". His parents say an email from Robinhood, received the day after his death, clarified that trading restrictions had been lifted and the trade resolved. The lawsuit, filed in California state court, said the loss had been covered by other options in his account and accuses Robinhood's ""misleading communications"" of leading to ""panic and confusion"". Some officials have called for greater regulation of trading apps The wrongful death lawsuit accuses Robinhood of unfair business practices and negligent infliction of emotional distress, US media report. In a statement to the BBC, Robinhood said they have made improvements to their ""options offering"" since June including how they display buying power and providing more educational materials and revised experience requirements for users. ""In early December, we also added live voice support for customers with an open options position or recent expiration, and plan to expand to other use cases,"" a spokesperson said. ""We also changed our protocol to escalate customers who email us for help with exercise and early assignment. ""We remain committed to making Robinhood a place to learn and invest responsibly,"" they added. Where to get help From Canada or US: If you're in an emergency, please call 911.

It was written by Ella Wills, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Meierhans and George Wright, and edited by Sarah Collerton and Holly Wallis. We'll be back with more live coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Hereâs what you need to know this evening:  Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) - a group of scientists which advise government - have classed a variant first identified in Bristol - the Kent variant with a mutation - as a ""variant of concern"". Itâs not surprising that officials are adding this new
version of coronavirus to their ""variants of concern"" list. Targeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21
that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England. This new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant ""plus"". It has the same
N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that
scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra
mutation called E484K. E484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen
in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern. A cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the
E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus
rather than the Kent one. Inevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make
sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus. Experts are confident that the vaccines being used today
will still save lives and stop severe illness from Covid. As we've reported today, a series of measures are to come into force on Monday to prevent new variants of the coronavirus from being imported into the UK. Some travellers will be required to quarantine in hotels, at the cost of up to Â£1,750 for accommodation, food and tests. The changes will be applied differently across the UK - in Scotland everyone arriving from abroad will be affected, while in England and Wales hotel quarantine will be mandatory only for passengers who have recently travelled to a country hit by a new variant. The health secretary also confirmed that all international arrivals would need to take two PCR tests on days two and eight of their quarantine. Those who violate the rules will face fines and potentially up to 10 years in prison. The travel and tourism industries have said they understand why the measures are necessary, but have called on the government to do more to support firms and protect jobs. A spokeswoman for travel trade organisation Abta said that requiring passengers to pay for multiple tests once leisure travel is restarted would have ""serious cost implications"" and ""hurt demand"". She also urged ministers to ""develop a roadmap to reopen travel"". Mayeni JonesBBC News, Lagos Nigeriaâs Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says it has closed an unnamed test centre in the capital Abuja that was issuing fake Covid-19 certificates to travellers. Director general of the NCDC, Chikwe Ihekweazu, said they had found evidence that the lab was collecting samples and money from unsuspecting travellers, but failing to test them. They issued certificates claiming they had tested negative for the virus, enabling them to travel. Mr Ihekweazu added that a full list of accredited labs was available on the NCDCâs website and encouraged members of the public to only get tested at centres on the list. He said they were working on a platform where every lab in Nigeria could publish their test results which could then be easily verified by airlines or other countries wishing to check whether a result was genuine. He did not specify when this platform would be ready. Authorities in Nigeria recently suspended flights from the Emirates airline because the carrier wanted passengers from Nigeria to take a rapid Covid-19 test four hours before flying, in addition to the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Hotel chain Premier Inn has said it is investigating an allegation that staff broke Covid-19 lockdown rulesby having a party at one of its hotels. A photo showing 10 people lined up in a restaurant area has beenpublished in a newspaper,externalin Wales. The Daily Post said it understood the photo was taken at a leaving party at the Premier Inn in Holyhead, on Anglesey, on 29 January. The company said its Welsh hotels are shut in line with government guidance. Premier Inn said it had ""clear safety procedures in place for our team members to follow"". Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. The Scottish government said it would be ""block booking"" 1,300 rooms at six hotels near the country's airports. The some Â£1,750 cost of the stay will have to be borne by passengers themselves. A similar scheme will operate in other parts of the UK, but unlike Scotland, only flightsfrom countries on a ""red list"" will be covered. No hotels have yet confirmed whether rooms have been booked. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said there were approximately 1,600 Scottish arrivals in the last week of January, and numbers fell to 730 in the first week of February. He said: ""The number of travellers coming to Scotland directly is reducing and I expect these restrictions to reduce arrivals yet further. ""These measures will be backed with criminal offences as usual. The stronger approach we are taking are necessary and appropriate."" A tiger at Chessington zoo Animals are at risk of dying unless the government changes its Covid-19 funding for zoos, a charity has warned. The Zoo Animals Fund was created by the government to help zoos facing financial trouble in the pandemic with Â£100m available. In a letter to the prime minister, the British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums (Biaza) says the fund has ""failed to provide"" adequate support. It claims many zoos are unable to access the money. A spokeswoman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told Radio 1 Newsbeat the government understood challenges faced by zoos and aquariums. ""That is why we have set up the Zoo Animals Fund on top of the other support available - to ensure that those facing severe financial difficulties can continue to provide the best possible care for their animals."" Zoos are currently shut in this lockdown. Further Covid testing is being deployed in Lambeth, south London, where the South African variant has been found. The surge testing and genomic sequencing will be carried out in the SE27 0, SE27 9 and SW16 2 postcodes. People living within these areas are being urged to take a Covid-19 test this week, whether they are showing symptoms or not. People with symptoms should book a test in the usual way while others should visit their council website. Meanwhile the surge testing carried out in Woking is now complete and further data will be provided in due course, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Mass testing - or surge testing - is taking place across various parts of England to help stop the spread of new, more infectious strains of Covid-19. The South Africa variant and a new mutation of the Kent variant are those currently being targeted. More than 10,000 tests are being deployed in Manchester, after cases of the Kent variantwere found in two unconnected households. Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Paris The French lunch hour - famous as a bastion of the French way of life - is under threat. The government says itâs planning to pass a new decree allowing workers to eat at their desks, a practice officially banned in the countryâs labour law.  But is this concession to changing times all down to coronavirus? Like many cultural ideals, the leisurely and elaborate French lunch-break is often defended more in theory than in practice. Even before Covid, the daily queues outside sandwich shops were just as daunting as the waiters straightening tables on cafÃ© terraces. In fact, several polls suggest that a majority of French workers have been eating their lunch in the office for years. But, long under siege, the concept of the pause-dÃ©jÃ©uner is now under attack from Covid as well. With restaurants and cafes closed - except for take-aways or deliveries - and workplace canteens rife with new restrictions, many people have little option but to eat their lunch at their desks - or even, according to one report, eating in isolation in their cars. The idea that eating at your desk was officially banned has been greeted with surprise - even derision - here.   Eye-rolling at Franceâs impenetrable labour laws is another workplace tradition, and thereâs comfort in hanging on to at least some of them. The first doses of Sinopharm vaccines arrived late on Sunday Peru has started its Covid vaccination campaign after the first consignment of 300,000 Sinopharm vaccines arrived on Sunday. The South American country is in the midst of a second wave of the pandemic. With the hospitals close to full capacity, the authorities have decided that medical staff should be among the first to be vaccinated. On Tuesday morning local time, Josef Vallejos, the chief of the intensive care unit at a hospital in Lima, received the first jab. Members of the military, security guards and election workers will also be given priority ahead of the general election scheduled for 11 April. Peru has had almost 1.2 million confirmed cases and more than 42,000 people have died. Earlier, the health secretary announcedtougher border measures in Englandto tackle the spread of new variants of the coronavirus - such asthe one originally found in South Africa. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, says 170 cases of the South African variant have been identified so far, including 18 that are not linked to travel. Our health editor, Michelle Roberts, saysthere's no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illnessfor most people - but there are concerns it can spread more readily than the original strain and vaccines may not work quite as well against it. More on that fact-finding mission to China. Dr Peter Daszak, who is part of the WHO team looking into the origins of Covid-19, said ""the supply chains to Huanan Seafood Market were extensive"". Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan was linked to early cases of coronavirus and was quickly closed by the authorities. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Focus needs to shift to Huanan market supply chains' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online As we've been reporting, a team of investigators led by the World Health Organization (WHO) has spent four weekslooking into the origins of Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It was unlikely that the group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Covid-19 restrictions will not be fully lifted in Northern Ireland until 70 to 80% of people have been vaccinated, the chief medical officer says. So far, about 22% of adults have received at least a first dose of a vaccine, Dr Michael McBride told a media briefing. If the rate of case numbers keeps falling, ""we will hopefully be able to do some things this summer like we did last summer"", he says. Over time new variants such as those which have emerged in South Africa and Brazil could be detected in NI, however, he says ""they may not become the dominant strain"". Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, says arrangements are being made for clinically vulnerable 16 to 18-year-olds to receive the Pfizer vaccinewithin weeks. Here are some graphs to show today's coronavirus figures. Although deaths are still high, they are coming down - and so are case numbers compared to last Tuesday. We can see that if the rate of vaccinations keeps going the way it is, the government will surpass its goal of reaching 15m people by mid-February.

Even before Covid, the daily queues outside sandwich shops were just as daunting as the waiters straightening tables on cafÃ© terraces. In fact, several polls suggest that a majority of French workers have been eating their lunch in the office for years. But, long under siege, the concept of the pause-dÃ©jÃ©uner is now under attack from Covid as well. With restaurants and cafes closed - except for take-aways or deliveries - and workplace canteens rife with new restrictions, many people have little option but to eat their lunch at their desks - or even, according to one report, eating in isolation in their cars. The idea that eating at your desk was officially banned has been greeted with surprise - even derision - here.   Eye-rolling at Franceâs impenetrable labour laws is another workplace tradition, and thereâs comfort in hanging on to at least some of them. The first doses of Sinopharm vaccines arrived late on Sunday Peru has started its Covid vaccination campaign after the first consignment of 300,000 Sinopharm vaccines arrived on Sunday. The South American country is in the midst of a second wave of the pandemic. With the hospitals close to full capacity, the authorities have decided that medical staff should be among the first to be vaccinated. On Tuesday morning local time, Josef Vallejos, the chief of the intensive care unit at a hospital in Lima, received the first jab. Members of the military, security guards and election workers will also be given priority ahead of the general election scheduled for 11 April. Peru has had almost 1.2 million confirmed cases and more than 42,000 people have died. Earlier, the health secretary announcedtougher border measures in Englandto tackle the spread of new variants of the coronavirus - such asthe one originally found in South Africa. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, says 170 cases of the South African variant have been identified so far, including 18 that are not linked to travel. Our health editor, Michelle Roberts, saysthere's no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illnessfor most people - but there are concerns it can spread more readily than the original strain and vaccines may not work quite as well against it. More on that fact-finding mission to China. Dr Peter Daszak, who is part of the WHO team looking into the origins of Covid-19, said ""the supply chains to Huanan Seafood Market were extensive"". Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan was linked to early cases of coronavirus and was quickly closed by the authorities. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Focus needs to shift to Huanan market supply chains' Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online As we've been reporting, a team of investigators led by the World Health Organization (WHO) has spent four weekslooking into the origins of Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It was unlikely that the group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. Covid-19 restrictions will not be fully lifted in Northern Ireland until 70 to 80% of people have been vaccinated, the chief medical officer says. So far, about 22% of adults have received at least a first dose of a vaccine, Dr Michael McBride told a media briefing. If the rate of case numbers keeps falling, ""we will hopefully be able to do some things this summer like we did last summer"", he says. Over time new variants such as those which have emerged in South Africa and Brazil could be detected in NI, however, he says ""they may not become the dominant strain"". Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, says arrangements are being made for clinically vulnerable 16 to 18-year-olds to receive the Pfizer vaccinewithin weeks. Here are some graphs to show today's coronavirus figures. Although deaths are still high, they are coming down - and so are case numbers compared to last Tuesday. We can see that if the rate of vaccinations keeps going the way it is, the government will surpass its goal of reaching 15m people by mid-February. Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg South Africa's decision to pause its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine aftera study showed ""disappointing"" resultsagainst its new Covid-19 variant has left the nation in shock. An small preliminary trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases. One and half million doses of the jab had been bought for healthcare workers and they were due to start getting their vaccinations this week. Frontline workers have been left feeling anxious. Siviwe Gwarube, head of health for the main opposition Democratic Alliance, said the setback left them vulnerable to a third wave. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. ""I had a lot of hope that the vaccine would change the situation we're in as a country,"" a young male medic, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC. ""A lot of people are losing jobs. I'm a medical student and we are really exposed to Covid-19. It was a blow for me when I heard that the efficacy of the vaccine was lower.""

politician makes a series of false claims about Covid-19 vaccines and the
coronavirus pandemic has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. Andre Banda Kani - who is the
chairman of the Nouveau Mouvement Populaire (NMP), a minor political party in
Cameroon - repeats baseless conspiracy theories that Western coronavirus
vaccines cause genetic changes and contain âmicrochipsâ. The BBC hasdebunked
these claims in detail here. Kani falsely alleges that vaccination campaigns for Covid-19 are part of a âglobalistâ plot to reduce the world's population, led by influential figures like Bill Gates. Weâve written previously about how the Microsoft founder becamea popular target of coronavirus conspiracies. The video has now been removed from Facebook, but others containing false claims about vaccines are still online. More than two million people have died with Covid-19. Scientists and health experts say that vaccines are the best way of reducing deaths and protecting people against the virus.

"Government's Covid help 'skewed towards men' - MPsGender inequalities in the economy have been ignored in the pandemic, a Commons committee says.","This video can not be played Sharon Luca says she has ""the brunt of everything"" as she tries to juggle work and home-schooling Government policies have ""repeatedly skewed towards men"", a committee of MPs has said in a report on the impact of coronavirus on men and women. Committee chair Caroline Nokes said the government had ""repeatedly failed to consider"" the labour market and caring inequalities faced by women. The report makes 20 recommendations including making it easier for staff to get flexible working arrangements. The government said it had spent over Â£200bn on job support schemes. ""Throughout the pandemic this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods, and will continue to do so,"" a spokesperson said. 'I had to give up my job to home school my son' Covid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' Will women have to work harder after the pandemic? Sharon Luca from Warwickshire works from home, running a clothing business and a charity raising money to help parents of stillborn children. Her husband also works full time and so cannot help with homeschooling. Because she is helping her son do school work, Sharon says she has ""barely had anytime to focus on my business or the charity"". This has meant losing ""a big chunk"" of her earnings she says, adding: ""My income is my only independence."" Sharon thinks women are bearing the brunt of homeschooling. ""I know a lot of mums who work from home or have small businesses like myself and all of them are saying that they've been affected by homeschooling. ""They really don't have the time now to put in the energy to earn a living from their small business - homeschooling overtook everything."" During the pandemic, Clare has struggled to find work that will accommodate her child care responsibilities Clare Jeffries, a single mother from Banbury, was made redundant from her job in HR during the pandemic and now can't find a role that's flexible enough to accommodate childcare  - despite lots of searching. She worries this is a problem that largely impacts on those with caring responsibility and ""disproportionately affects women"". She says ""inclusion is a choice"" and that employers ""need to think about the choices they're making"". ""Things like flexible working need to be a right for everybody."" She also wants the government to fund more childcare ""so that we can actually get back into work easier"". The Women and Equalities Committee has examined some of these problems and says the government needs to ""start actively analysing and assessing the equality impact of every policy"". Its chair Ms Nokes said: ""Government policies have repeatedly skewed towards men - and it keeps happening."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said although ministers had not ""deliberately designed policies to be sexist,"" there had been ""institutional thoughtlessness"" about their particular impact on women. The Conservative MP - wholost her job as immigration ministerwhen Boris Johnson entered Downing Street - also said the opinions of female cabinet ministers were ""not being played into debates and decisions"". She told the programme there was a ""very blokey mentality at the top"" of government, which had suffered from ""the predominance of single-sex education round the cabinet table"". The report notes that during the pandemic, women spent more time on caring duties than men, yet ""furlough was not clearly articulated as a right for those with caring responsibilities"". On sick pay, the report cites evidence that women were less likely to qualify for statutory sick pay, in part due to caring responsibilities, which meant their wages were too low to be eligible for the support, Making over 20 recommendations, the committee said the government should: Change the law to allow employees to request flexible working arrangements when they start a job rather than waiting 26 weeks as currently mandated by law Maintain increases in support including the Â£20 rise in Universal Credit Extend redundancy protection to cover pregnant women and new mothers Review the availability of sick pay Conduct an equality assessment of the support measures introduced during the pandemic Reinstate gender pay gap reporting which was cancelled in March 2020 due to the pandemic Review childcare provision to provide support not only for working parents but those who are job-seeking or retraining. The MPs also urged the Women and Equalities Minister Liz Truss to be ""much more ambitious"" in getting other government departments to consider inequality when designing policies. Responding to the report, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, called for a ""gendered response to the crisis"". She added: ""The unequal impact of coronavirus on women is huge - women are more likely to work in low-paid sectors, to work in sectors which are currently shutdown such as retail and hospitality, and have taken on more caring responsibilities. ""The government cannot continue to deny and dismiss the reality of gender inequality across society."" Joeli Brearley, CEO and founder of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said ""policy decisions have repeatedly ignored the specific needs of women"", adding: ""We are currently witnessing a generational roll back in maternal employment that will take us decades to repair."" British Chambers of Commerce co-executive director Claire Walker said that a national focus was needed to help parents and carers. ""Employers value the skills women bring to the workplace and the evidence shows that businesses with a diverse and inclusive workforce perform better."" She added: ""Economic growth will depend on access to high quality, affordable childcare."" A government spokesperson said it had spent over Â£200bn on schemes ""safeguarding people's jobs"" including the Self Employment Income Scheme helping the 1.7 million self-employed women in the UK. ""Covid-19 is prompting a culture shift with more people than ever before working flexibly, and the government wants to harness that as we recover. ""By doing so, we could see more equal sharing of care work by parents, and more flexibility from employers, enabling us to unleash the potential of everyone across the country.""

Covid surge tests as variant cases confirmed,"Four cases of the Kent variant of the virus have been discovered in Manchester Surge testing for coronavirus is to be introduced in parts of Manchester after four cases of a new mutation of the Kent variant of Covid were confirmed. More than 10,000 tests are planned after cases of the E484K mutation were found in two unconnected households. Testing will take place in the Fallowfield, Hulme, Moss Side and Whalley Range districts, with extra testing centres opening. Manchester City Council said volunteers would go house-to-house offering tests. The council said it was working with Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace and everyone in the designated areas would be given a PCR swab test with results coming back within days. The surge testing will begin on Tuesday, targeting people who do not have symptoms but live or work within the testing boundary area. Surge testing is the rollout of additional community testing of people who do not have any coronavirus symptoms. It aims to help scientists and public health officials learn more about mutated Covid-19 variants. It will also help reduce the spread of infection by finding asymptomatic cases and prompting people to self-isolate. David Regan, Director of Public Health, Manchester City Council, said: ""We all know that the virus will change over time and it's important that we investigate new strains to understand how they might spread. ""This is exactly what we're doing with the intensive testing in parts of Manchester, with local testing units and people going door-to-door to offer people tests. ""There is no evidence that this variant will be resistant to the vaccines or causes a more severe illness, and it is not yet known if the strain can be passed more easily between people, but it is really important that everyone who lives in the boundary area and is over the age of 16 plays their part and gets a test."" Councillor Bev Craig, the council's executive member for adult health and well-being, said: ""It's understandable that some residents in the area may be concerned by all this, but we need to remember that it's very normal for viruses to mutate. ""We are following the public health approach to react to the new variant and we will be working... to ensure as many people as possible know how to get a test so we can understand more about this version of the virus.""

Family sue Robinhood trading app over son's death,"Dan and Dorothy Kearns say their son thought he had caused ""impending financial disaster"" The parents of a man who killed himself last year have filed a lawsuit against trading app Robinhood over his death. The lawsuit, first reported by CBS News, said 20-year-old Alex Kearns mistakenly believed he owed $730,000 (Â£530,000) when he took his own life. Dan and Dorothy Kearns say their son was unable to get help or support from customer services before he died. Robinhood said in a statement to the BBC they were ""devastated"" by Alex's death and had made improvements. The app, which allows anyone to buy and trade stocks, says on its website that it is ""on a mission to democratise finance"" and is currently running an advertising campaign under the slogan of ""We are all investors"". It recently made headlines for limiting sales of some shares to users after US retailer GameStop saw its stock surge. Elon Musk grills Robinhood boss GameStop: What is it and why was it trending? 'I didn't know I'd lose money so fast' Speaking to CBS,the parents of Alex Kearns say he began using Robinhood just before he graduated high school,external. Mr and Mrs Kearns say they did not know the app had also approved him to buy and sell options - a risky financial instrument - despite a lack of financial experience. They say their son realised on 11 June 2020 that his account had been restricted by Robinhood amid what appeared to be a negative balance of more than $700,000 on his account. CBS reports the student received an automated email at 03:26 early the next morning asking him to take ""immediate action"" to pay more than $170,000 within days. The family accuse the company of having no ""meaningful customer support"" when he needed it The family say the 20-year-old emailed customer service several times asking for support and help understanding the figures on his trading account, but only received stock response messages saying they would get back to him. ""They provide no mechanism through a telephone call, through live email service, to get live answers to questions,"" a lawyer for the family told CBS. His parents were told by police later that day, on 12 June, that Alex had died. ""He thought he blew up his life. He thought he screwed up beyond repair,"" Mr Kearns said in the interview, in which he said his son had ""just needed a little help"". His parents say an email from Robinhood, received the day after his death, clarified that trading restrictions had been lifted and the trade resolved. The lawsuit, filed in California state court, said the loss had been covered by other options in his account and accuses Robinhood's ""misleading communications"" of leading to ""panic and confusion"". Some officials have called for greater regulation of trading apps The wrongful death lawsuit accuses Robinhood of unfair business practices and negligent infliction of emotional distress, US media report. In a statement to the BBC, Robinhood said they have made improvements to their ""options offering"" since June including how they display buying power and providing more educational materials and revised experience requirements for users. ""In early December, we also added live voice support for customers with an open options position or recent expiration, and plan to expand to other use cases,"" a spokesperson said. ""We also changed our protocol to escalate customers who email us for help with exercise and early assignment. ""We remain committed to making Robinhood a place to learn and invest responsibly,"" they added. Where to get help From Canada or US: If you're in an emergency, please call 911.

"NI motorists 'turned back' at Irish borderPeople crossing the Irish border without ""a reasonable excuse"" can be fined â¬100 (Â£88) from Monday.EuropeComments","This video can not be played A number of Gardai (Irish police) checkpoints were operating along the border on Monday People driving from NI into the Republic of Ireland are being turned back at the border if they do not have an essential reason for travel. NI residents face fines from Monday if they are caught crossing the border without ""a reasonable excuse"". The unprecedented step has been taken by the Irish government in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Anyone engaged in cross-border travel in breach of Ireland's Covid-19 restrictions will be fined â¬100 (Â£88). A number of Garda (Irish police) checkpoints were operational along the border from 07:00 local time. At a checkpoint near Emyvale in County Monaghan, Insp Adrian Durcan said some people had ""turned back"" when requested. ""We have engaged with a few people who have not had essential reasons and on the advice of the guards, they have turned back,"" he said. ""I think it was three so far this morning."" A checkpoint was set up near Emyvale on the Tyrone-Monaghan border Insp Durcan said fines would be issued to those not complying with the regulations. ""They will receive the fine and have 28 days to pay the fine, failure to pay that fine will result in a court appearance,"" he said. ""If they don't pay it we will issue a summons in respect of the offence and we will follow through on that summons."" Confusion in border village over new Covid rules Northern Ireland residents who have to cross the border for essential work or essential purposes, such as seeking medical treatment, will be exempt from fines. Public health guidance in NI says people ""should not travel in or out of Northern Ireland except where it is essential to do so"". Irish police have new enforcement powers which include the right to fine people engaged in non-essential travel The new rules are the latest in a series of decisions aimed at reducing travel to and within the Republic of Ireland, but it is the first time that people from Northern Ireland will face financial penalties for non-essential cross-border travel. The Republic of Ireland is currently in the highest level of lockdown, known as ""level five"" in the government's five-stage plan for managing Covid-19. Level five measures include a strict travel ban which means residents in the Republic of Ireland are temporarily prohibited from going more than 5km (3 miles) away from their home. There areexceptions to the 5km limit,externalfor people who have to travel further for essential work; medical reasons; caring responsibilities; and other essential purposes such as shopping for necessities like food. Since January 2021, gardaÃ­ have new enforcement powers which include the right to fine people engaged in non-essential travel. Another checkpoint on Monday - this time near Drogheda Until now, Ireland's travel restrictions did not apply to people living in Northern Ireland, although Garda checkpoints a short distance from the border during earlier lockdowns did cause sometailbacks for cross-border traffic. The new cross-border fines follow recent amendments to the Irish government's Covid-19 health legislation. The regulations now state that ""any other person who is not ordinarily resident in the state shall not travel within a relevant geographical location without reasonable excuse"". GardaÃ­ said if they stop a car with a driver and two adults who should not be crossing the border, all three will receive a â¬100 fine.  Cyclists and pedestrians will also be liable for fines. ""Travelling to an airport or port to take a holiday abroad is not an essential journey,"" they also warned. Any adult who is detected travelling to an Irish airport or port for a non-essential trip or holiday abroad currently faces a â¬500 fine. A Garda spokeswoman confirmed holidaymakers from Northern Ireland who are stopped by gardaÃ on their way to an airport will be liable for both that â¬500 fine and the â¬100 cross-border fine.

Newspapers concerned over government's FOI process,"Current and former editors of Britain's leading newspapers have expressed concern over the government's handling of Freedom of Information requests. In an open letter, they have called for an investigation into a Cabinet Office unit - the Clearing House. It is alleged to have profiled journalists and blocked FOI requests. The government says it ""remains fully committed to its transparency agenda"", having ""routinely"" disclosed information ""beyond its obligations"". The letter marks a rare show of unity by Britain's press, and comes after the website openDemocracy in Novemberpublished a report,externalshowing response rates to FOI requests were at their lowest level since the Freedom of Information Act became law 20 years ago. The Act was meant to give the public much greater access to information held by the authorities. What changes will 2021 bring for the media? The report also alleges that although the government is not meant to know who has made a request, when it is sent to a unit in the Cabinet Office, known as the Clearing House, this often is not the case. Now the editors, and several former editors, of the Times, Sunday Times, Guardian, Financial Times, Telegraph and Daily Mirror, have signed a strongly worded letter. It calls for an investigation into the Clearing House, new measures to speed up Freedom of Information, and a bolstering of the Information Commissioner's Office, which oversees the process. Separately, openDemocracy is working with law firm Leigh Day on a legal bid to force the Cabinet Office to reveal full details of how the Clearing House operates. John Witherow, editor of the Times, described the alleged current process as a ""disgrace"", and said it was ""a fundamental right of a free people to be able to see and scrutinise the decisions made on their behalf"". Guardian News and Media's editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said the government's handling of FOI's was ""at odds with its global commitments to press freedom"", as she called for a ""clear commitment"" to greater transparency and a well-funded information commissioner. In a statement the government said a small Cabinet Office team ""helps ensure a consistent approach to requests for information"". ""This is especially important for complex FOI requests where we must balance the need to make information available with our legal duty to protect sensitive information and national security,"" it said. The statement said it had released ""more proactive publications than ever before"", but it said the coronavirus pandemic ""has had an impact on how quickly public authorities are able to respond to FOI requests"". Perhaps one of the best known revelations was the scandal over MPs' expenses that erupted in 2009 following a series of Freedom of Information Act requests.

Urgent reset needed on NI trade rules - Gove,"The EU's threat to restrict vaccine exports to Northern Ireland has opened a ""Pandora's Box"" regarding post-Brexit arrangements, Michael Gove has said. He told MPs an urgent ""reset"" was needed to the Northern Ireland protocol governing checks on GB-NI trade. The agreement was ""not working"" and NI businesses and families were suffering too much ""disruption and interference"". While the UK did not want to ""ditch"" it, it ""reserved the right"" to do what it must to protect Northern Ireland. Unionist parties in Northern Ireland have called for the protocol - which came into force on 1 January - to be scrapped, saying it has created a border down the Irish Sea and threatened NI's place within the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Cheese wholesaler 'gives up on Ireland' The protocol was designed to avoid checks along the border between Northern Ireland - which unlike the rest of the UK is continuing to follow many of the EU's rules - and the Republic of Ireland, a member of the EU. But after checks were introduced on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain, some exporters have scaled back deliveries or stopped fulfilling orders altogether, blaming the additional paperwork and costs involved. And following last month's vaccine row, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border appeared in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland, while some staff involved in inspecting goods were stood down over security fears. Cabinet Office minister Mr Gove said the EU's threat to invoke Article 16 of the protocol to control shipments of vaccines from the continent to Northern Ireland - amid concerns of a shortage in Europe - had been a mistake. The European Commission, he said, owed its members an explanation why it didn't follow the dispute mechanism procedures in the protocol and consult with other member states, particularly Ireland, before acting. Asked by Tory MP David Jones whether the ""bad blood"" between the two sides would cause long-term damage, Mr Gove said it would be ""better"" if the EU revoked the regulation in place allowing it to invoke Article 16 in future. ""The Pandora's Box has been opened and that is concerning,"" he told the European Scrutiny Committee. ""One of the consequences of opening that Pandora's Box has been the unfortunate effects we referred to on the ground in Northern Ireland."" Asked by a number of Conservative MPs whether the EU's actions were a reasonable cause for the UK to seek to suspend the protocol or to axe it entirely, Mr Gove said while it was not functioning smoothly, it could be ""made to work"". While he said progress in the Joint EU-UK Committee on the protocol's implementation had not been as fast as he had liked, he hoped for better in talks with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in London on Thursday. ""There are disruptions and difficulties faced by Northern Ireland citizens in their daily lives,"" he said. ""They can be resolved within the context of the protocol. We don't need to ditch it. ""But as the prime minister has spelt out, if we can't make progress in resolving those issues, then the UK government has to reserve its rights.""
