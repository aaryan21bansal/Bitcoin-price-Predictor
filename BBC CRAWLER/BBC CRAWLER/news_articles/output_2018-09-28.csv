Quake-triggered tsunami hits Indonesia,"This video can not be played Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down More than 380 people have been confirmed dead after a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit an Indonesian city on Friday. Waves up to 3m (10ft) high swept through Palu on Sulawesi island. Video on social media shows people screaming and fleeing in panic and a mosque among the buildings damaged. Strong aftershocks rocked the city on Saturday. Thousands of homes have collapsed, along with hospitals, hotels and a shopping centre. Rescue efforts are under way, though hampered by a major power cut. The main road to Palu has been blocked due to a landslide, and a key bridge is out of action. Indonesia's disaster agency said at least 384 people had been killed, but the number is expected to rise. At least 540 have been injured, and 29 are listed as missing. Locals check bodybags in the streets of Palu as they search for lost relatives ""Many bodies were found along the shoreline because of the tsunami, but the numbers are still unknown,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told Reuters. ""When the threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,"" he told a news briefing. ""The tsunami didn't come by itself - it dragged cars, logs, houses - it hit everything on land."" In pictures: Indonesia earthquake and tsunami Some survived by climbing 6m (18ft) trees to escape the huge waves, the spokesman said. Homes, hotels, and shopping centres have collapsed in the ""extensive"" damage, officials said A less powerful quake earlier on Friday had killed at least one person and injured at least 10 in the smaller fishing town of Donggala. In Palu, hundreds of people had been preparing for a beach festival that was due to start on Friday night. The city's main hospital was damaged in the quake, and TV footage showed dozens of injured people being treated outside in makeshift medical tents. Medical teams are treating patients in the open air At least 384 people have been killed in the quake Palu and Donggala are home to more than 600,000 people. President Joko Widodo said troops were en route to the area to reinforce rescue teams and help retrieve bodies. The main airport in Palu has been closed since the tsunami hit. A minister said the runway had been damaged but that it was hoped helicopters would still be able to land. The country's military is sending cargo planes of relief aid from the capital, Jakarta. Officials are urging locals not to enter their homes and to sleep away from buildings, due to the risk of aftershocks. Relief aid is packed into a military plane bound for Palu Indonesia's disaster agency said some people scaled trees to escape the huge waves The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just before 18:00 on Friday (10:00 GMT), the US Geological Survey said. A tsunami warning was issued, but lifted within the hour. Indonesia's meteorological agency has been criticised for its response, but officials said the waves struck while the warning was in place. Are earthquake warnings effective? Dramatic video of the tsunami hitting Palu shows the high waves sweeping away several buildings and then the large tilted mosque in the town, about 80km from the quake's epicentre. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency. A 2004 tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra killed 226,000 across the Indian Ocean, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Government would back World Cup 2030 bid,"Prime Minister Theresa May watched England play France at the Stade de France in June 2017 The government says it would back a joint bid to host the 2030 Fifa World Cup in the UK and Ireland. The football associations of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland are considering putting forward a proposal to stage the tournament. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The decision on whether to bid is for the football associations to make. ""If they decide to go forward, they can count on this government's full support."" The football associations of England and Wales released statements on Friday confirming the five national governing bodies are ""in discussions about the feasibility of bidding to be the European candidate"" to host the event. The last major men's football tournament played in the UK was the 1996 European Championship, which England hosted 30 years after staging its only World Cup. Wembley will host seven games - including the final and semi-finals - of Euro 2020, and the FA has made a bid to host the European Women's Championship in 2021. Recent and future World Cup hosts 2006:Germany 2018:Russia 2010:South Africa 2022: Qatar 2014:Brazil 2026:US, Canada and Mexico England failed with a bid - fronted by former captain David Beckham, Prince William and former Prime Minister David Cameron - to host the 2018 World Cup, which went to Russia. England felt aggrieved by that bidding process but it is thought the FA has been encouraged by the greater transparency around the recent vote for the 2026 World Cup, which was won by a joint United States, Canada and Mexico bid. However, there is expected to be a strong joint bid from Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, with 2030 marking the 100-year anniversary of the first World Cup in Uruguay. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor A joint British and Irish bid to host the 2030 World Cup is still far from certain to materialise - but it may just have become more likely. The football associations of England Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland are still in the early stages of talks over whether to proceed, and a year-long feasibility study must be completed before any decision is taken. But the government's declaration of support - which was never in doubt but which was timed to kick-start the Tory party conference - is still an important step in the process. With Brexit looming, the government is keen to build on Britain's reputation as a host of major sporting events, and believes a joint bid would have a strong chance of staging football's biggest tournament for the first time since 1966. However, after England's Â£21m bid to host the 2018 World Cup ended in humiliating failure at the hands of Fifa eight years ago - and was then heavily criticised in a report by Fifa investor Michael Garcia for having flirted with breaking the rules - some will question whether another attempt is a wise use of money, and the cost of staging the tournament if a bid is successful. Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina have already said they will make up a joint South American bid and Spain could also provide opposition. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin has suggested he would support a British bid, and the FA has been working hard to shed the arrogant image that seems to have cost England votes in the past. It has also gained confidence from Fifa reforms that have made the voting process more transparent.

Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge,"This video can not be played Johnson refuses to rule out challenging PM Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused to rule out challenging Theresa May for the Tory leadership as he warned of ""political and economic disaster"" if she stuck by her Brexit strategy. Asked four times by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg to rule out a challenge, the ex-foreign secretary said: ""My job is to speak up for what I believe in."" Mrs May would stay in office ""as long as she feels it necessary,"" he said. But, he added, her Chequers plan was ""simply intolerable"" and must go. ""My duty now is to make the case for freedom again,"" added the Tory backbencher, who was a leading figure in the campaign to get Britain out of the EU. A government source said Mr Johnson was ""regurgitating ideas"", not coming up with any new answers. Johnson sets out 'better Brexit plan' What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? European Research Group Tories won't back PM's plan Mr Johnson quit the cabinet in July in protest at Mrs May's plan for future economic co-operation with the EU, which he says will curb the UK's sovereignty and betray the 2016 referendum vote. His latest attack on Mrs May's policy, which would see the UK sign up to a common rule book for trade in goods, comes two days before the start of the Conservative Party conference. In an article for the Daily Telegraph on Friday,external, Mr Johnson claimed the Chequers plan was ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"" for the UK and it was not too late for Mrs May to back a ""super Canada"" deal, which is favoured by many Tory Brexiteers. Speaking to the BBC's political editor, in his first interview since quitting the cabinet, he rejected suggestions he was simply trying to make life difficult for the prime minister, describing Theresa May as a ""remarkable person"". ""As she said to us herself and she said to the country...she will go for as long as she feels it necessary."" He urged Mrs May to ""get back"" to the principles he said she had initially set out in Brexit negotiations before, in his words, being ""blown off course"" by the 2017 general election. Asked to rule out a leadership challenge if this did not happen, he replied: ""My job is to speak up for what I believe in and the vision that I've set out today and I believe in it very very sincerely. ""I'm going to keep going for as long as it takes."" He added: ""The most important thing for me is to avert what I think would be a political and economic disaster for this country. To come out of the EU but still to be run by the EU - what is the point of that?"" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg It is no secret that he still wants and believes he has a shot at Number 10. And having turned down interviews for several months after his departure from government, speaking out today on the eve of the Conservative conference outwardly appears designed to stir as much trouble as possible. Mr Johnson is adamant, of course, that what he is really involved in is trying to change Number 10's policy, rather than trying to shove Theresa May out. Read Laura's blog The Chequers plan was ""unacceptable"" to the British public, he said, and it was ""pie in the sky"" to suggest, as some have done, that it could be modified after the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March, 2019. ""It will do lasting damage to the credibility of this country around the world. People will say the UK is a greater power, a great economy. Why are they so passive and so supine as to remain in the orbit of Brussels."" Asked whether he was prepared to actually vote down a deal based on Chequers if it came to it in Parliament, and potentially see the UK leaving without a deal, he said: ""You will have to see."" But he added: ""At the moment, I cannot see how I can support Chequers, I have to be honest."" In response, a government source said: ""Boris was a member of the Cabinet that agreedthe December Joint Reportand praised the PM for doing so. ""The truth is that reneging on those things would simply guarantee no deal."" And Tory MP Sir Alan Duncan - a junior minister in Mr Johnson's old department - said his former boss was addicted to media attention. ""Publicity is his cocaine. He needs a regular fix,"" the foreign office ministertold The Spectator,external. But, he added, Mr Johnson's power as an ""electoral asset"" was ""now waning"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: I'll speak up for what I believe in The UK and EU are seeking to negotiate the terms of exit, as well as an outline agreement on future cooperation by the middle of November at the latest. But the European Parliament's representative in Brexit talks warned the UK it will not approve a relationship with the UK where EU nationals were discriminated against by nationality or type of job. Referring to the cabinet's recent decision that EU nationals would not be privileged in the UK's new immigration regime, Guy Verhoftsadt said the system for EU citizens coming to the UK after Brexit would likely be reciprocated for British citizens moving in the other direction. Meanwhile, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has ruled out standing as a candidate to become the next head of the European Commission, saying he was committed to seeing the talks through ""right to the end"".

Baguette death: Pret labels 'inadequate',"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight Pret a Mangerâs allergy labelling was inadequate, the coroner in the case of a girl who died after eating a baguette from the food chain has said. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15,went into cardiac arrest on a flightafter buying a sandwich at Heathrow Airport in 2016. She was ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging, the coroner found. Natasha's family said food labelling laws ""played Russian roulette with our daughter's life"". Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, Natasha's father, said the inquest should ""serve as a watershed moment to make meaningful change and save lives"". Coroner Dr Sean Cummings said he would be reporting to the government over whether large businesses should be able to benefit from regulations that allow reduced food labelling for products made in shops. Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"". Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? Pret taking risks, say allergy sufferers Natasha, from Fulham, west London, ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from a Pret shop at about 07:00 BST in Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport on 17 July 2016, West London Coroner's Court heard. She began to feel ill during the British Airways flight, and suffered a cardiac arrest. She died later the same day. The inquest heard the baguette contained sesame - which Natasha was allergic to - but the ingredient was not listed on the packaging. This video can not be played Video shows Natasha Ednan-Laperouse minutes before her fatal allergic reaction Dr Cummings said he would be writing to Pret about its practices of collecting information on allergic reactions and responding to serious concerns. ""I was left with the impression that Pret had not addressed the fact that monitoring food allergy in a business selling more than 200 million items year was something to be taken very seriously indeed,"" Dr Cummings said. The inquest heard Pret did not label ""artisan"" baguettes as containing sesame seeds despite six allergic reaction cases in the year before Natasha died. The family's lawyer Jill Paterson, from Leigh Day, said: ""The law as it stands currently treats multinational companies in the same way as a local sandwich shop. This cannot be right."" Girl's plea before Pret baguette death Defibrillator not used on Pret girl Pret baguette allergy cases before death Under currentfood regulations,externalnon pre-packaged fresh food made on the premises does not need to be individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information. This video can not be played The family of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse made an emotional statement after the inquest into her death Despite her father administering two EpiPen injections, Natasha died in a hospital in Nice within hours of eating the sandwich. ""Natasha said that she still couldn't breathe and desperately looked at me, she said 'Daddy, help me, I can't breathe',"" Mr Ednan-Laperouse said in a statement. The court heard the EpiPens - used to treat severe allergic reactions - administered by Natasha's father had a 16mm needle ""which may be insufficient for adrenalin to reach the muscle"". Consultant allergist Dr Alexandra Croom had told the inquest it would be ""impossible to tell"" if a longer needle would have improved Natasha's treatment, as some forms of shock are resistant to adrenaline. At the inquest's conclusion Dr Cummings said he would be making the following reports: To Pret A Manger about collecting information on allergic reactions and responding to serious concerns To the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and to the manufacturers of the Epipen about the apparently inadequate length of the needle and the dosage of adrenaline within the device To Environment Secretary Michael Gove about whether large food business operators should benefit from current regulations. UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain In a statement ahead of this week's hearing, Natasha's parents said she loved horse-riding and ice-skating, and wanted to pursue a career in law. She had just finished school for the summer and was on her way to Nice for a four-day ""special treat"" with her best friend, Bethany, and her father. She had been ""so excited"" about what was going to be ""her best summer ever"", they added. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""This is a deeply upsetting situation and my heart goes out to the family of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse. ""We are currently reviewing our approach to food labelling to give consumers more information. We await the findings of the inquest and stand ready to take appropriate action."" Pret chief executive Clive Schlee said: ""We cannot begin to comprehend the pain the family have felt, and the grief they will continue to feel. ""We've listened to everything the coroner and Natasha's family have said this week and we will learn from it."" Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death?

Rose McGowan apologises to Asia Argento,"Rose McGowan admitted getting her facts wrong about Asia Argento Rose McGowan has apologised for a statement she made in August about fellow actress Asia Argento.

Argento denied any sexual contact with Bennettafter he accused her of sexually assaulting him when he was 17. McGowan and Argento were among the first people to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape in October 2017. Argento was seen with McGowan (right) at a march in Rome earlier this year But the actresses have recently been at loggerheads. McGowan's original statement alleged that Bennett had sent explicit text messages to Argento at the age of 12, rather than 17. McGowan said she had ""misunderstood the messages that Asia exchanged with my partner"". On 17 September, Argento gave McGowan 24 hours to apologise for the comments and said she would instruct lawyers to ""seek substantial damages for deception, fraud, coercion and libel"" if she did not reply.

Secret life of rare antelope revealed,"The lowland bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus eurycerus) was spotted on camera traps The world's largest forest antelope has been caught on camera in Uganda for the first time. The elusive striped antelope, known as the lowland bongo, was snapped in dense forest near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Scientists say there could be more new discoveries in the remote, unexplored, lowland rainforest. The forest-dwelling antelope is classed as Near Threatened on theextinction list,external, due to habitat loss and hunting. Populations in central and western Africa have declined to about 30,000 individuals. Chimpanzees were seen in the forest Another forest antelope, the bushbuck, was also photographed The bongo was spotted using motion-sensor cameras in Semuliki National Park, home to one of Africa's most ancient forests, which harbours hundreds of different birds and mammals. It was identified during a survey of mammals across the park. More than 30 mammal species were spotted among 18,000 pictures, including elephants, chimps, buffalos and leopards. ""We were amazed that such a large, striking animal could go undetected for so long, but bongo are a notoriously shy and elusive species,"" said Stuart Nixon of Chester Zoo's Africa Field Programme, which carried out the study alongside the Uganda Wildlife Authority. ""It could be that bongo and other species are moving between Virunga National Park in DRC and Uganda, showing just how important it is to protect the rainforests, which still connect the two countries."" The bongo has a red-chestnut coat and large horns World's largest forest antelope Feeds on leaves, bushes, vines, bark, grasses, roots, cereals, shrubs and fruit Bongos are timid and easily frightened, mainly living alone Adult males will occasionally meet and fight with their horns Source:African Wildlife Foundation The researchers think there may be other rare animal species in the forest, which are yet to be discovered. ""There are very few places on the map that are true wildernesses,"" said Scott Wilson, head of field programmes at Chester Zoo. ""It's nice to know there are still places to be explored and species to be found."" There are no lowland bongos kept in zoos, so efforts must focus on protecting the animal in the wild. The species is rare throughout the forests of western and central Africa, with populations declining due to habitat destruction and hunting for meat, mainly through using snares. ""As thrilled as we are with this discovery, much more work is needed to learn more about this newly found species in Uganda and elsewhere across its range,"" said Stuart Nixon.

'Use EpiPens past normal expiry date',"People with severe allergies have been told they can use their EpiPens past their normal expiry date, amid a continuing shortage of the devices. The medicines regulator said it had agreed to extend the use-by date of some 0.3mg EpiPens by four months. It comes as parents told the BBC their children's supplies were due to expire in a few days, and they had been unable to get replacements. The government says it is working with EpiPen's makers to resolve the issue. EpiPens are the most common adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs) and are prescribed to people with potentially serious allergies, such as to nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fruits. People are recommended to keep two of the devices with them at all times for cases of anaphylaxis - a severe and sometimes life-threatening reaction often caused by allergies - as one is not always enough. They can only be used once and usually have an expiry date that lasts for a minimum of 12 months. There have been shortages of EpiPens in the UK and other countries for months. There has also been a shortage of the alternative AAIs prescribed in the UK - Jext and Emerade - amid a surge in demand for them. In response to the shortages, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it had agreed to a request by Mylan, the company behind EpiPen, to extend the expiry date of some batches of the 0.3mg version of the device. The MHRA said it made the decision after it was given evidence that showed the shelf life of the 0.3mg pen was 20 months from the date it was manufactured. It said the devices would work ""just as effectively"" during the extended expiry period. Click here to see which batches have been extended,external But the extension does not apply to the 0.15mg version, given to children under 30kg. EpiPens should not be used if the solution is discoloured, brown, there are solid particles, or signs of leakage or damage. Other AAIs should never be used after their expiry date without first checking with your medical practitioner. Lynne Riles said she had been trying to get an EpiPen prescription for her seven-year-old daughter for the past six weeks. ""The pens we have now expire at the end of September, and I just feel at my wits' end."" Sal Smith said her four-year-old's EpiPens were also due to expire at the end of the month, after she had tried for four weeks to get more. ""Still no sign of them... I'm getting worried now."" Nuts, shellfish and eggs are among the foods that can trigger allergies food - such as peanuts, milk/dairy foods, egg, wheat, fish and seafood, sesame and soya insect stings - from bees and wasps medication - such as antibiotics and ibuprofen latex - rubber gloves, balloons, swimming caps Q&A: What is anaphylaxis? Mylan has no stock of the 0.15mg pens left, the Department of Health and Social Care said inguidance to healthcare professionals,external. More of these pens are due in October but this is not expected to meet normal demand, the department said. Emma Cummings, whose 10-year-old son Loui has severe allergies, said if supply problems continued and she had no AAIs left that were in date, she would be forced to keep her son indoors, as he is at risk from airborne allergens. ""Loui wouldn't be allowed out of the four walls of our own house, where I can categorically state that there is nothing in the house to trigger any allergies for him. ""That will restrict his education, his after-school activities, but you would. ""Parents such as ourselves, with a child like Loui, would have no choice."" The DHSC guidance said that if people were left with nothing but expired AAIs they should keep them - until they get replacements - and be prepared to use them. While AAIs lose their potency and become less effective after their expiry date, they are not harmful, and it is better to use an expired AAI than none at all, it said. It said at present it was believed that ""careful management"" of existing supplies would prevent the need for using expired pens. Health minister Lord O'Shaughnessy told the BBC: ""We are doing everything we can to ensure patients continue to access the medications they need, and we have issued detailed guidance to healthcare professionals."" Mylan,externalsaid Pfizer (which manufactures the drug) was ""working hard"" to increase production, and supply would stabilise between October and December this year.

Tesla shares sink on fraud investigation,"This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Tesla shares have sunk after US regulators took legal action against co-founder Elon Musk for alleged securities fraud. On Thursday the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over claims made last month by Mr Musk that he had funding to take the company private. The billionaire boss of the electric carmaker called the action unjustified. But the filing was a potentially serious blow for the company, which was already under financial strain. Mr Musk has led the electric carmaker as chief executive since 2008, presiding over its rise into a company with a market value that rivals Ford and General Motors. His celebrity status and reputation for entrepreneurial vision attracted investors and legions of fans - even though the firm has consistently lost money and struggled to hit manufacturing targets. Tesla's shares closed 13.9% lower. During the trading session on Friday, shares fell by 15%. Now the SEC is seeking to bar Mr Musk from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company. The move would strip him of his role at Tesla and could make it difficult for the firm to raise money at a critical moment for the company, which has been spending heavily to increase production of its latest car. On Friday, the shares opened 10% lower as Wall Street investors reacted to the news. ""The mere possibility that Musk could be removed as chief executive (or entirely from Telsa) is likely to cast an overhang on the stock,"" analysts for AllianceBernstein wrote. Tesla's Elon Musk accused of fraud Will Elon Musk be forced to leave Tesla? Read the SEC's claims against Elon Musk here,external The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk Mr Musk stunned the business world in August when he announced on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla off the stock market and into private ownership. He wrote he had ""funding secured"" for the proposal, which would value Tesla at $420 per share. This video can not be played Tesla's Elon Musk 'mislead investors' SEC alleges In a complaint filed in New York, the SEC said those claims were ""false and misleading"". ""In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,"" the regulator said. Mr Musk has opted to fight the claims, reportedly rejecting opportunities for settlement. On Thursday, the Tesla chief said that he acted in the ""best interests of truth, transparency and investors"". ""Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way,"" he said in a statement. Tesla's board of directors said in a statement that they were ""fully confident in Elon, his integrity and his leadership of the company"". The SEC has a strong case when it comes to proving that Mr Musk's tweets - which triggered a temporary spike in the firm's share price - were reckless, said Adam C Pritchard, a professor of securities law at the University of Michigan Law School. But he says it may be more difficult to convince a court that the claims merit a lifetime bar from acting as director or officer of a public company, given how critical Mr Musk has been to Tesla's success and ability to raise money. ""If I'm the judge, I'm thinking - do I want to blow up this company just because he's a jackass?"" Mr Pritchard added. He says he expects the two sides to eventually negotiate a settlement. Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said Mr Musk is behind much of Tesla's appeal for car buyers and investors. But, she added, his behaviour in recent months has not done the firm ""any favours"". Mr Musk is credited with pushing the car industry toward electric vehicles This spring, Mr Musk alarmed investors with jokes about Tesla's bankruptcy and abrupt dismissal of questions from financial analysts during earnings calls. Elon Musk unveils first tourist for SpaceX 'Moon loop' Elon Musk sued for libel by British Thai cave rescuer Then in July, Mr Musk drew widespread criticism after accusing a British cave diver involved in the rescue of Thai teenagers from a flooded cave of being a child abuser. The diver later filed a defamation suit. He also drew attention after an emotional interview with theNew York Times,external, in which he said he worked ""120-hour weeks"" and took sedatives. And earlier this month, he smoked marijuana live on the web during a podcast with comedian Joe Rogan. ""The disappointing part of all this is it's self-inflicted,"" Ms Lindland said. ""I could see investors potentially being reassured if a strong, experienced stable management team were to come in and replace him."" Still, she said she would want Mr Musk to remain in an advisory role, lending his vision to the firm. ""It's obviously a very big deal...but it doesn't mean it's the death of Tesla,"" she said.

Government would back World Cup 2030 bidThe government says it would back a joint bid to host the 2030 Fifa World Cup tournament in the UK and Ireland.BBC Sport,"Prime Minister Theresa May watched England play France at the Stade de France in June 2017 The government says it would back a joint bid to host the 2030 Fifa World Cup in the UK and Ireland. The football associations of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland are considering putting forward a proposal to stage the tournament. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The decision on whether to bid is for the football associations to make. ""If they decide to go forward, they can count on this government's full support."" The football associations of England and Wales released statements on Friday confirming the five national governing bodies are ""in discussions about the feasibility of bidding to be the European candidate"" to host the event. The last major men's football tournament played in the UK was the 1996 European Championship, which England hosted 30 years after staging its only World Cup. Wembley will host seven games - including the final and semi-finals - of Euro 2020, and the FA has made a bid to host the European Women's Championship in 2021. Recent and future World Cup hosts 2006:Germany 2018:Russia 2010:South Africa 2022: Qatar 2014:Brazil 2026:US, Canada and Mexico England failed with a bid - fronted by former captain David Beckham, Prince William and former Prime Minister David Cameron - to host the 2018 World Cup, which went to Russia. England felt aggrieved by that bidding process but it is thought the FA has been encouraged by the greater transparency around the recent vote for the 2026 World Cup, which was won by a joint United States, Canada and Mexico bid. However, there is expected to be a strong joint bid from Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, with 2030 marking the 100-year anniversary of the first World Cup in Uruguay. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor A joint British and Irish bid to host the 2030 World Cup is still far from certain to materialise - but it may just have become more likely. The football associations of England Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland are still in the early stages of talks over whether to proceed, and a year-long feasibility study must be completed before any decision is taken. But the government's declaration of support - which was never in doubt but which was timed to kick-start the Tory party conference - is still an important step in the process. With Brexit looming, the government is keen to build on Britain's reputation as a host of major sporting events, and believes a joint bid would have a strong chance of staging football's biggest tournament for the first time since 1966. However, after England's Â£21m bid to host the 2018 World Cup ended in humiliating failure at the hands of Fifa eight years ago - and was then heavily criticised in a report by Fifa investor Michael Garcia for having flirted with breaking the rules - some will question whether another attempt is a wise use of money, and the cost of staging the tournament if a bid is successful. Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina have already said they will make up a joint South American bid and Spain could also provide opposition. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin has suggested he would support a British bid, and the FA has been working hard to shed the arrogant image that seems to have cost England votes in the past. It has also gained confidence from Fifa reforms that have made the voting process more transparent.

Why are people still not wearing seat belts?What could be behind new figures showing a rise in the proportion of car crash fatalities not wearing seat belts?UK,"Figures showing that more than one in four car occupants who were killed in crashes in Britain last year were not wearing a seat belt have been described as ""shocking"" by both road safety campaigners and the government. TheDepartment for Transport data,externalshows the proportion of deaths has reached its highest level since records first started being kept in 2013. But what could lie behind the rise - and can attitudes be changed? Britain remains one of the safest places to drive in Europe. And following steep falls between the late 1970s and 2000s, the number of road deaths has remained fairly constant. The latest figures show that of the 787 drivers or passengers who died in 2017, 27% were not wearing seat belts, compared with 20% in 2016. A 2014 survey found 91% of rear seat passengers in England and Scotland wore seat belts - compared with 98% of drivers and 97% of front-seat passengers. But the government's road safety campaign Think! cites research which shows younger drivers and passengers are less cautious - with those aged 17-34 having the lowest seat belt-wearing habits combined with the highest accident rate. Yet despite warnings that people are twice as likely to die in a car accident if they do not buckle up, some are still willing to take the risk. According to the Department for Transport, adults who do not wear a seat belt include those who occasionally forget as well as others who actively choose not to wear one. Some people told researchers they found seat belts uncomfortable or inconvenient to wear. Others said it depended on the type of journey. For example, they would wear one on a long or unfamiliar route or if they were on a motorway. According to the road safety charity Brake, government ""inaction"" on road safety is breeding ""an environment of complacency"" among drivers and passengers. Pete Williams, the RAC's road safety spokesman, says the rise in crash victims who were not wearing seat belts warrants further investigation. He said a decline in roads policing over the last 10 years may have encouraged people to feel they can get away with illegal driving behaviour. ""It is surprising that anyone these days would get into a car without belting up,"" he said. ""Drivers generally may also feel more cocooned and less at risk because of the level of safety features in their cars such as air bags, automatic braking and side-impact protection."" He said there was an absence of high-profile road safety messages in the media. Mr Williams added: ""We have generations of drivers who have grown up without seeing the 'clunk-click' messages that many of us frequently saw on our screens and made putting on a seat belt second nature."" The DfT maintains it is always looking at ways of making roads safer and said this year's Think! campaign is aiming to teach young people the ""importance of wearing a seat belt"". Its data shows theproportion of fatalities not wearing a seat belt,externalvaried between 19% and 22% in the years 2013 and 2016, although not all police forces reported figures. Brake cites examples of research papers which argue that audible seat belt reminders have the ""proven potential"" to increase the seat belt wearing rate. A2006 European Transport Safety Council report,externalfound front seat reminders can be provided at minimal cost because the same sensors are used in airbag systems - but rear-seat systems are more costly. However, regulations requiring car manufacturers to put seat belt reminder systems in all front and rear seats on new vehicles are set to come in force from September 2019. Use of a seat belt by drivers and front seat passengers in cars was made compulsory in the UK in January 1983 Rear seat belt use was made compulsory for children in 1989 and adults in 1991 Drivers and passengers caught without wearing a seat belt could be hit with an on-the-spot Fixed Penalty Notice of Â£100, rising to a fine of Â£500 if the case goes to court The driver is responsible for ensuring each child passenger aged up to age 14 wears a seat belt and could be fined for each child without a seat belt Source: Department for Transport Bid to tackle drivers' 'biggest bugbear' Learner drivers now allowed on motorways Modern headlights 'blinding drivers' Rural roads 'should feature in L-test' New drivers found texting to lose licence Second-hand tyres 'put lives at risk' New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Sentencing her at Isleworth Crown Court on Friday, Judge Robin Johnson told her: ""You knew exactly what these funds were for and the importance of them for the residents. ""The scale of your dishonesty in this fraud beggars belief."" McDonagh, who stole the money over a 10-month period, spent Â£32,000 of it on gambling, racking up around Â£16,000 in losses. Trips to Paris and Iceland were bought with pre-paid credit cards, as well as purchases in high street shops. Prosecuting barrister Benjamin Holt said on Thursday that the money was spent on ""frivolous items, for example Â£48 at Ann Summers"". After she was arrested on 1 August she continued to use another remaining credit card to spend more money â¢Â£534 on various visits to a hair and beauty salon in Sidcup â¢Â£199.69 on a booking for two at the Delaunay restaurant in central London â¢Â£185 on a pair of Ralph Lauren glasses from Vision Express â¢Â£113.63 at the Hippodrome casino in Leicester Square â¢Â£109.91 at a Burger and Lobster restaurant â¢Â£100 at The Bottle House Inn in Kent â¢Â£99 on a green dress from Hobbs â¢Â£74.99 on food from Selfridges â¢Â£55 on shoes from ECCO â¢Â£48 at an Anne Summers shop â¢Â£26.20 on a taxi â¢Â£19.20 on the Thames Clipper â¢Â£8.90 at Cineworld â¢A handbag from John Lewis â¢Flights to Paris, Reykjavik, Los Angeles and Dubai - one occasion she listed a holiday as a two-week respite break for a genuine victim â¢Â£333.60 loaded on to an Oyster card but not used On Thursday, one of her victims Edward Daffarn, a survivor of the fire, told the court about the impact of the fraud on his community. He said: ""It is like pouring salt on wounds of bereaved residents."" McDonagh, from Abbey Wood, was hired by the west London council in October 2017 to assist with the distribution of money to survivors of the fire, which was meant to be spent by them on accommodation and other essential items. She took money using pre-paid credit cards intended for five victims of the fire. The card in Mr Daffarn's name was topped up 17 times and more than Â£50,000 passed through the account. The credit card in a victim's name was topped up 17 times and more than Â£50,000 passed through the account After she was arrested on 1 August she continued to use another credit card to spend more money. While working for the NHS between 2015 and 2016, McDonagh transferred Â£35,000 from the Medway NHS Foundation, based in Kent, to herself.

Ex-IRA man pens Northern Bank heist novel,"The story is told in the words of ""Ructions O'Hare"", who is described as ""no small-time, two-bit thief"" A former IRA man who was jailed for robbing a bank has written a novel about the 2004 Northern Bank heist, which was blamed on the IRA. Four days before Christmas 2004, a gang stole Â£26.5m from the Belfast city centre Northern Bank branch. They took two families hostage in Belfast and County Down, forcing two bank employees to bring the money to them. Richard O'Rawe's debut novel Northern Heist is loosely based on the robbery. The story is told in the words of ""Ructions O'Hare"", who is described as ""no small-time, two-bit thief"". You can hear more from Richard O'Raweon BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme at 12:40 BST. ""When Ructions put together a crack team to rob the National Bank in Belfast in November 2004, even he didn't realise he was about to carry off one of the biggest bank heists in British and Irish history,"" says the blurb for the book. ""And he'll be damned if the Provos are getting a slice of it."" Only one person has been convicted in connection to the Northern Bank raid -for money laundering- and the case remains unsolved. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) denies being responsible for the Northern Bank heist The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the British and Irish governments all said that the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was responsible, although the group denied it. ""Do I think the IRA did it?  Yes,"" said Mr O'Rawe told the BBC's Talkback programme. ""I don't think any other organisation out there was capable of it"". Presenter William Crawley started the interview by asking the author what he had done with the money. ""Well, the island that I bought in the Indian Ocean was quite expensive,"" Mr O'Rawe joked. ""You've no idea how much superyachts are these days and those tedious round-the-world cruises."" He told the programme the Northern Bank robbery was just one of several so-called tiger kidnappings - where employees are essentially forced to rob their own banks - which influenced his novel. The former IRA bank robber was asked how much of the book was true. ""Very little of it,"" he replied. ""It all came out of my mind.  I had to sit and construct this whole thing, how they got rid of the vehicles and everything else."" He added: ""Ructions O'Hare planned this, so I had to be Ructions O'Hare and I had to try and think like Ructions O'Hare - how I am going to pull this off?"" Mr O'Rawe served time in the Maze Prison The author denied that he was profiting from his criminal past. ""There's no real money in writing books,"" he said, explaining that he was still owed money from his last book about Guildford Four member Gerry Conlon, a childhood friend. Richard O'Rawe was the IRA's second-in-command in the Maze Prison at the time of the 1981 Hunger Strikes. In 2005 he alleged in Blanketmen - his book on his time as a prisoner - that the IRA leadership allowed some hunger strikers to die despite there being a considerable offer on the table from the British government. This claim was denied by Sinn FÃ©in. Mr O'Rawe told Talkback that although he would not now describe himself as a friend of Gerry Adams, he felt ""no great animosity"" towards the former Sinn FÃ©in leader. ""Gerry Adams, in my view, was one of the principal architects of the peace process,"" he said. ""He brought us out of armed struggle... along with John Hume, and he should be commended for that, absolutely.""

Through the eyes of a survivor,"This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her Reactions to the testimony by Dr Christine Blasey Ford have split. Some see her as a hero, others as a political pawn. What writer Liz Spikol saw was a fellow sexual assault survivor describing the worst day of her life. I was raped at 17. Most days now, I only think about it once or twice. But some days are harder. Days like yesterday, when Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, testified in Washington, DC. As it happened: Supreme Court nominee and accuser testify Key takeaways from the day's testimony I was at work, in an ice-cold conference room, sitting alone, watching Ford on one screen while I worked on another. I could barely breathe watching as she struggled to maintain her composure in an antagonistic environment where she was expected to re-live one of the hardest days of her life. While Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley dithered about procedure, and Democrats indulged in personal grandstanding that ate up precious minutes, I was watchingher. It pained me to see her obvious anxiety. The way she'd tilt her head sometimes like it was too heavy for her neck. The way she eked out a smile and was carefully solicitous, like a good girl should be. Maybe other people saw a woman answering questions. I saw struggle, pain, a tightrope walk. I know that walk, too. This video can not be played Alumni of Ford's school: 'We believe her' To give you some context, I was a happy kid before it happened. I grew up in a two-parent home in my beloved hometown of Philadelphia, went to schools I loved, won a slew of academic awards and spoke at my high school graduation. I went to the prom with my extremely nice long-time boyfriend, who lived around the corner. I got into my first-choice college and was headed there with my best friend. We were about to begin the rest of our lives. Then I went to the Dominican Republic for a language-immersion programme and moved in with a local family. A few weeks after I got there, one of the men in the house raped me. Afterwards, he was apologetic. ""You raped me,"" I said to him. ""I know,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."" Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words #BelieveWomen v #BackBrett Still, I was overwhelmed with shame and a feeling that I had done something terrible, something unforgivable. I felt dirty and broken. I told only one person, a fellow American classmate. He wanted to tell our teachers but I swore him to secrecy. I didn't want them to know I was so bad. What followed was a spiral of shame and nightmares and hallucinations and rages. When I returned to the US, the PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) got worse. My parents didn't understand what happened. They'd put their somewhat goofy, chatty, cheerful child on a plane and got back a sullen teenager who barely spoke. Rachel Mitchell asks questions on behalf of the Republican senators I spent my 20s in and out of psychiatric hospitals, on dozens of medications. My mental illness came to define me. I was unable to work, and living off of Social Security disability. Slowly, gradually, I crawled out of my hole. It took years of work but I did eventually recover. I live a full life now, with gainful employment and a very cute dog. But the trauma is still with me in so many ways. The rape changed my life entirely. It's the stone in your shoe you can never remove. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out Although I wrote a column for 10 years about mental health, I've only recently spoken publicly about the event that triggered my years in the wilderness. I wrote about it once in 2003 and then, after #MeToo, I felt emboldened and obliged to come forward again. It has seemed a matter of urgency to explain why women don't always report immediately. I'm trying to get out there so people understand the survivor perspective better. 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse Has a feminist movement divided women? What has #MeToo actually changed? But like any survivor of trauma, speaking about the experience is not easy to do. When I talk about my rape publicly, I have to do something I did when I was being attacked - dissociate. I leave my body, thinking I'll come back later when there's less danger. I hear a voice saying the words, and I know they're my words, but it's not safe, it's not safe. When I come back, it feels as if I'm being punished for my disclosures just as I thought I would be when I was 17 and afraid to tell. After I talk about it, I spend days in a kind of limbo, here and not-here, crying one minute, laughing the next. I lie in bed, thinking, ""I'm broken. Why am I still broken?"" So yes, re-living traumatic experience comes at a price. Veterans, survivors of natural disasters and mass shootings, victims of childhood sexual abuse - anyone who speaks out about what happened knows that price. Christine Blasey Ford knows this too - or if she didn't, she knows it now. I hope she has a good support system. Author Liz Spikol The circus going on around her seemed especially ridiculous knowing the kind of pain she was in, the effort she was making. The GOP had flown in a token woman to ask Blasey Ford questions, a gesture that proved, once again, that the all-male rank of Republicans see women as symbols rather than human beings. Meanwhile, every second that went by while some politician thanked Blasey Ford - so that he'd have a clip for his next campaign ad - she was hurting. When I watched Senator Richard Blumenthal's chin quiver as he proclaimed himself thankful, I just felt angry. The male prerogative of it all:We approve. We thank you. And now we're going to keep talking and signalling our solidarity for minute after minute while you sit there dying. If either side really valued her contribution and respected her pain, they would have let her get the hell out of there and go home. Sitting upright in that room was a huge accomplishment. Waiting through all the partisan blather was heroic. A moment of reckoning for American women Kavanaugh hearing divides US media Yesterday was an incomparably hard day for me and for so many women who watched the proceedings not as outsiders, but as participants. We were up there with her, feeling the seconds tick by as if our lives were at stake. We'll need a few days to recover. Go easy on us. Go easy on her. It is a bumpy road we travel, and the potholes are treacherous. Author Liz Spikol isa Philadelphia-based writer and editor.

Five things you missed,"Judge Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the US Supreme Court by President Donald Trump in July It was an emotional day of testimony in which the balance of power on America's highest court was at stake. On Thursday, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh told the Senate that he was the victim of an ""orchestrated political hit"" and denied allegations of sexual misconduct. It followed testimony from Doctor Christine Blasey Ford who said she was ""100%"" sure he had sexually assaulted her 36 years ago. The hearing gripped much of the country, but with so many questions and a wave of media coverage in response it can be difficult to keep track of all the developments. Here are some key moments you may have missed. Dr Ford claims Judge Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her at a party in 1982. The incident allegedly happened at a gathering of teenagers at a house, when Judge Kavanaugh and his friend were both drunk. Mr Kavanaugh shared his high school calendar with the Senate committee as supporting evidence that he did not attend a party or drink on weekdays during that time. ""If the party... happened in the summer of 1982 on a weekend night, my calendar shows all but definitively that I was not there,"" he told the hearing. But one entry - on Thursday 1 July - indicates that he may have drunk beer at a social event. It reads 'Go to Timmy's for Skis', which Mr Kavanaugh said likely meant beers. The judge shared five pages of his 1982 calendar to show he was not at a party as Prof Ford alleges As well as his calendar, Mr Kavanaugh's high school yearbook came under close scrutiny. He was asked about the use of the phrase ""Devil's triangle"" which he said was a type of drinking game. But some people were sceptical, instead believing the term was a sexual reference.

The Senate Judiciary Committee also sought clarification on the meaning of the word ""boof"", with some suggesting that too was a sexual term. ""That refers to flatulence,"" Mr Kavanaugh told the hearing to some muffled laughter. ""We were 16."" Senator Lindsey Graham derided the hearing as a ""sham"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham was forthright in his assessment of proceedings. ""This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics,"" he declared furiously. He then took aim at the Democrats: ""What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020."" His comments were noticed by the White House, with Press Secretary Sarah Sanders praising his ""decency and courage"". But many Democrats stood firm and expressed their continued support for Dr Ford, including Senator Elizabeth Warren who later tweeted ""We believe her."" The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Key takeaways from a dramatic hearing Moment of reckoning for American women This video can not be played 'Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me yelling' Dr Ford's testimony had an instant effect, prompting a number of victims of sexual violence to share their experiences. As her hearing unfolded, people inspired by the research psychologist phoned in to the TV network C-SPAN to recount their own trauma. Brenda, 76, spoke emotionally about being assaulted as a child. ""You get confused, and you don't understand it,"" she said, according to the New Yorker magazine. ""But you never forget what happened to you."" The flurry of individual stories had echoes ofthe hashtag #WhyIDidntReport, which has been used by women to share why they did not talk about sexual violence. This video can not be played ""I like beer"": Kavanaugh defends his high school drinking during testimony Dr Ford has claimed Mr Kavanaugh was drunk when the alleged incident happened, which meant there were a number of questions about his drinking habits. ""What do you consider to be too many beers?"" Republican prosecutor Rachel Mitchell said. ""I don't know. You know... whatever the chart says, a blood-alcohol chart,"" he responded. He also said that he was legally allowed to drink beer while at school in Maryland. In fact, the state's drinking age increased to 21 when he was 17.

Danish police conduct major manhunt,"Authorities shut down transport links to and from Denmark's largest island Three people involved in a ""serious crime"" and travelling in a Swedish-registered car are being hunted by Danish police. A statement saysthe three are riding in a black Volvo V90,external, registration ZBP 546, and should not be approached. ""Witnesses who see the vehicle should contact the police immediately,"" the statement said. Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reports there has been a kidnapping, although police have not given further details. Authorities briefly closed off transport links to and from Denmark's largest island Zealand in their search, but later reopened them. The Great Belt Bridge, to the island of Funen, was wholly closed to cars, while ferries and trains were also affected.

Johnson sets out 'better Brexit plan',"Boris Johnson left the government over Mrs May's Chequers plan Boris Johnson has set out his own plan for Brexit, arguing that the UK should ""chuck Chequers"" and negotiate a ""Super Canada"" free trade deal instead. The ex-foreign secretary, who quit over Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan, called her strategy ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"". He said his vision would not lead to a hard Irish border, with any checks carried out away from the crossing. But environment secretary Michael Gove urged the party to unite behind the PM. And ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve, who backs a new referendum on Brexit, told the Evening Standard up to 40 Tory MPs were prepared to vote against any Canada-style deal if Mrs May ultimately opted for it. What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? European Research Group Tories won't back PM's plan BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar said Mr Johnson's 5,000 word article, published two days before the start of the Conservative Party conference, was a reminder that the PM's plan had very little support in the party and it was going to be a difficult week for her in Birmingham. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The two sides are seeking to negotiate the terms of exit, as well as an outline agreement on future cooperation. Parliament is to vote on any withdrawal deal. In anarticle for the Telegraph,externalentitled ""a better plan for Brexit"", Mr Johnson wrote there had been a ""collective failure of government, and a collapse of will by the British establishment, to deliver on the mandate of the people"". Manufacturers say their complex cross-border supply chains are being put at risk He said the Chequers proposals - which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods - represented ""the intellectual error of believing we can be half-in, half-out"" of the EU. UK firms would be exposed to EU regulations that could disadvantage them, and free trade deals would be made more difficult. This, he said, was a ""democratic disaster"" and would ""cheat the electorate"" if implemented. He proposed a looser free trade agreement, ""at least as deep as the one the EU has recently concluded with Canada"". Canada's deal with the EU, signed in 2016, removes the vast majority of customs duties on EU exports to Canada and Canadian exports to the EU. Mr Johnson said a Super Canada deal would involve: ""Zero tariffs and zero quotas"" on all imports and exports Mutual recognition agreements covering UK and EU regulations to ensure ""conformity of goods with each other's standards"" Technological solutions to keep supply chains operating smoothly A deal covering goods as well as services Mr Johnson argued that it should be ""relatively straightforward"" to negotiate membership of the EU's aviation area while there should be a process for recognising each other's rules and regulatory standards and a dispute mechanism system in which neither side's institutions had power over the other. He also said cooperation between the UK and EU would be closer on areas such as security and defence. By BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris Any kind of free trade deal based on the Canada model - super or otherwise - would make the UK more distant economically from the EU. It would be a cleaner break, but it would also create more friction in trade, including border checks where there are currently none. Goods coming from Canada into the EU market can be subject to a variety of checks - to make sure customs declarations are filled in correctly, to check product standards or VAT payments and to ensure the safety of food and animal imports. New technology can help make things run more smoothly, but it's the prospect of the UK having to go through the same processes, for the huge volume of trade done with its European neighbours, which makes many businesses nervous. On the issue of Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said any ""extra procedures"" could be carried out away from the border with Ireland. Conservative Brexiteers welcomed the intervention, saying it was the right way forward for the UK. But No 10 emphasised there would be no withdrawal deal without a legally binding ""backstop"" on Northern Ireland, something it said Mr Johnson accepted when he backed December's stage one agreement. This video can not be played WATCH: Lord Howard backs Canada-style deal And Mr Gove, who worked alongside Mr Johnson in the 2016 Leave campaign, said he continued to believe Mrs May had the right formula for leaving the EU. ""I agree with the prime minister,"" he said. ""I think the prime minister is doing a great job. I think it is really important that we unite as a party."" But Labour said the Conservatives had ""run out of ideas"" and were consumed by ""internal warfare"" while the Lib Dems labelled the article a ""half-baked, sloppy rant"". This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said a Canada-style deal would require billions to be spent on new technology and infrastructure in the UK and the continent, which would take years to bed in. ""As a result, it would put thousands of manufacturing jobs and hundreds of billions of pounds of exports at risk and, at worst, could destroy much of Britain's manufacturing base,"" said its chief executive Stephen Phipson. ""Having been to Canada I know a customs model built around this is naÃ¯ve and unrealistic as a short-term solution."" Mrs May set out her proposals on the key issue of future trade with the EU after a Chequers summit in July. It has been fiercely criticised by some Brexiteers, who say her plans for a ""common rulebook"" on goods would compromise the UK's sovereignty. Up to 40 Tory Brexiteers have said they will oppose her plan if it comes to a vote in Parliament. Mrs May has dismissed previous suggestions that checks could be carried out away from the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, insisting that any system of checks was ""still a hard border"".

The eternal life of the instant noodle," At the age of 12, Coss Marte began dealing drugs in New York City. At 15, he was sent to prison for a year. That’s when he began to learn how things worked behind bars. “This guy next to me was serving 12 years,” says Coss. “We started cooking together.” That was the first of three stints in prison - including New York’s famously brutal Rikers Island prison. Each time, Coss existed on “prison burritos”, a regular makeshift snack for US inmates. “Instant noodles, potato chips, Cheezits. If you get lucky, you steal an onion from the mess hall,” he says. “You shuffle it up, you throw in a little bit of ketchup, mayonnaise maybe. I’ve had people tell me it tastes like Taco Bell.” Basic instant noodles are the cheapest thing on sale in most prison stores, where three packs cost about a dollar. They’ve replaced cigarettes as the most traded item inside American prisons. They’re so important, inmates use them as money. As Coss was learning the ropes in prison, another young man living on the other side of the globe was also figuring out how to rely on instant noodles. Back in 2004, Kieran “Danger” Dooley was 20 years old and training to be a teacher in Dunedin, in southern New Zealand. But he was harbouring a dream to be a movie director. And one night he saw a film that gave him an idea. “It was Supersize Me,” he says. “I latched on to it and I thought, ‘Well, you know, old Morgan Spurlock, he’s a bit of a legend as far as I’m concerned.’ And I thought I’ll make the sacrifice. I can give this a shot too.” In his documentary, Morgan Spurlock eats nothing but McDonald’s for a month. He records the drastic physical and psychological impact it has on him. Danger Dooley chose the obvious student equivalent with his student film, Noodle Me. Listen toThe Eternal Life of the Instant Noodle, from BBC Radio 4, on the BBC iPlayer. “I couldn’t really afford McDonald’s every day or Kentucky Fried Chicken or Burger King or whatever,” he says. Instant noodles were an inevitable choice. Sixty years after their invention, they have become the default food for anyone short on money, or time, or a kitchen. They even pop up in disaster zones and on long-haul flights. Last year, across the globe, more than 100 billion servings of instant noodles were eaten. That’s more than 13 servings for every person on the planet. In the birthplace of instant noodles, Japan, they’ve been voted - repeatedly - Japan’s most successful invention, ahead of high-speed trains, laptops and karaoke. Instant noodle sales have certainly fallen in Japan since the invention’s heyday in the 1970s and 80s, and now occupy around 5% of all global sales. But don’t let that number fool you, Japan is still the world’s third-biggest consumer of instant noodles, after China and Indonesia, with more than 5.5 billion servings being eaten a year. But perhaps the story behind instant ramen is more important to Japan than actually buying and eating the product. It’s believed that the dried noodles sitting in many university dorms can trace their culinary ancestry back to an early form of ramen noodles brought over to Japan by Chinese chefs in the 1880s. Japanese women eating noodles circa 1905 Traditional ramen noodles are, in their most basic form, wheat noodles served in a soupy broth with some slices of meat or tofu on top. Over the decades, that simple recipe has been adapted and expanded over and over again, giving imaginative chefs the ability to show off their skills by making complex broths, perfectly textured noodles and an ever-expanding variety of toppings. The original ramen was eaten by Japanese labourers by the bowlful. World War Two changed everything. Large tracts of Japan were decimated by bombing. When the war came to a close in 1945, the surviving population was starving. Enter our unlikely hero - a failed businessman named Momofuku Ando. Ando, as he’s affectionately known, had earned and lost fortunes, first in his native Taiwan and then in Japan. He made millions in industrial parts during the war, then lost it. At one point, he went to prison for fraud. He then headed a bank, which collapsed. But Ando was persistent. He wanted to rebuild his reputation and his fortune. A decade after the war had ended, contacts in Japan’s ministry of agriculture told him they were eager to figure out how to push Japanese people to eat more American wheat flour - the key component of US aid at the time. That’s when, so the story goes, Ando remembered something he’d seen at the end of the war - queues of exhausted people waiting patiently in long lines for bowls of steaming ramen noodle soup. What was needed, Ando thought, was a modern, speedy version of that working-class comfort food. A food that, conveniently, used lots of American wheat flour. Instant Chikin noodles - an egg is optional And so, at the age of 48, Ando transformed himself into a food inventor. He disappeared into a wooden shed in his back garden every day for a year. When he emerged, he’d invented a product that looks almost identical to rectangular bricks of instant noodles that are stacked on supermarket shelves around the world. You can see faithful recreations of that shed if you visit Japan’s three - yes, three - instant noodle museums. The one we visited, in the coastal city of Yokohama, is the biggest and newest. It is owned by the food company Nissin, which was founded by Ando. The red, square block of a building is all clean, straight lines. Inside there are shiny floorboards and pristine white walls - it looks like a modern art museum. Apparently, it’s a hot place for first dates. Visitors are quickly led into the “instant noodle history cube”, a brightly lit room lined with thousands of instant noodle products, starting with Ando’s original block of Chikin Ramen. At the end, there are even luxury instant noodles - in convenience stores in Japan, you can buy noodles from famous Michelin-starred ramen shops. Cup Noodle Museum, Yokahama In between the two extremes sit some of the thousands of instant noodles on sale across the globe. The cube is a mind-boggling showcase of what food inventors can do. Instant noodles were born in Japan, but marketers go to pains to make them seem local, wherever they're eaten. Some countries like the basil and olive flavour. Others prefer cheesy curry or creamy seafood. In Mexico, noodles are eaten with salsa and slices of lime. Nissin's Kasura Suzuki beams as we examine the packaging. “We launch over 300 products yearly,” she says, “just in Japan, for our company. But only 1% remain in the market. The products have a really short life cycle because consumers are always looking for something new. So we have to be very inventive.” Most of the museum’s visitors are Japanese, but then Raquel Scott, a teacher from San Francisco, appears bubbling with enthusiasm. “I grew up on cup noodles,” she says. “Especially in college, needing a cheap meal. So I thought it would be fun to come here. What other better food to have a museum for than the cup noodle?” There is no obvious mention of environmental concerns - such as the styrofoam cup used for cup noodles - in the Yokohama museum. To embrace the mindset of this museum, you’ll need to swallow any lingering doubts about the wonders of instant noodles and their contribution to human civilisation. Kasura guides me to the last room in the museum. “Here we have Space Ramen, which is the final invention that our founder Momofuku Ando created,” she explains. “This product was developed especially for astronauts to eat during space travel.” I hesitate, but she doesn’t blink. You’re saying that at the age of 95, Momofuku Ando was responsible for this invention? “Yes,” comes her immediate response. “He wanted to go beyond the atmosphere and take his invention to outer space.” Momofuku Ando and his instant noodles for astronauts The museum staff and its visitors ooze a sense of national pride. Ando was actually born in Taiwan, but it was in Japan that his invention came to life. Instant noodles came along at a turning point in Japan’s history, accompanying its rise from a struggling nation to a modern economic powerhouse. They came of age when Japanese households were filling up with new home appliances, such as kettles. Television commercials from that age showed the effervescent commercials promoting convenient new foods. Today, a whole culture of appreciation has grown around instant noodles in Japan. At the heart of the movement sits a shy, unassuming man named Toshio Yamamoto. He’s better known to his fans as Ton Tan Tin – a name he gave himself because he liked the sound of it. He’s the world’s most prolific instant (ramen) noodle reviewer. “Oh I love instant ramen very much,” he smiles. “I’ve been eating ramen since I was 10 years old. I’m pretty much made of ramen.” Toshio Yamamoto holding a few examples from his noodle collection Yamamoto once worked as an engineer, but his noodle reviews became so popular that he was able to quit and devote himself to testing instant ramen. Companies send him their newest offerings for testing and followers send him boxes of instant noodles from overseas. He’s reviewed more than 6,200 kinds of instant noodles. You can check out Ton Tan Tin online. Each video is almost identical - you see the package of the product he’s going to review, you watch it being prepared, and then you watch the noodles’ score out of five. The entire process is oddly mesmerising. But you’ll never actually see Ton Tan Tin on screen - just his hands. In person, he’s a slightly awkward man. He shuffles around his suburban house in Japanese slippers. “I haven’t found ramen that’s five stars yet. I’m still on the journey to find that,” he explains. “The noodles will need to be perfect. The soup will need to have great quality and the condiments perfectly balanced, with a nice harmony.” On a large computer screen, he begins to click through all of his reviews. Most scores hover around three out of five. Suddenly, a shockingly low score pops up - a 0.1 out of five stars. “Those noodles were really thick and ‘guagua’,” he says. “It was a really bad texture in my mouth. And the soup is really thick. It’s a very kind of artificial flavour. And the condiments you chew but they just keep staying in your mouth. They were very difficult to swallow.” The product in question? One of the UK’s top sellers - Cup Noodle Chicken and Mushroom flavour. Millions of British university students survive on this, I tell him. I also tell him I would like to be here on the day that he eats that perfect five. I’d love to see the look on his face. He smiles and closes his eyes a little bit, as if imagining what those noodles would taste like. “I would share my happiness with everybody,” he sighs. If Japan is the county that gave birth to the instant noodle, China’s the country where it came of age. Out of the 100 billion servings of instant noodles consumed last year, 38 billion were eaten in mainland China. But in China, there’s none of the romance that's associated with instant noodles in Japan - there are no museums dedicated to them here. Ton Tan Tin would be shocked. Inside a bustling railway station in central Beijing, travellers are preparing for long journeys ahead. In a cavernous waiting room, weary-looking people are clutching thin plastic bags, mostly holding a few containers of instant noodles. “It’s garbage food,” complains one young woman. She’s eating a pot as she waits to board her train. “Everybody knows it’s bad for your health. I don’t like eating it, it’s simply for convenience.” In the centre of the train, tucked into a cosy compartment, we meet Huan Zhuo Ming and Wang Li, a friendly couple in their50s. It’ll be three in the morning when they reach their hometown. They are visiting their elderly parents for China’s tomb-sweeping public holiday. The train has just left the station and Huan Zhuo Ming is already tucking into his supper. “There’s nothing else to eat. Of course, it's instant noodles,” Wang Li patiently explains as her husband enjoys the spicy beef flavour - a favourite in China. Huan Zhuo Ming and Wang Li A convenient hot water tap sits at the end of every train carriage, and a queue of like-minded folk are filling up their cup noodles as we chat. Huan Zhuo Ming is a security guard in Beijing and Wang Li works as a cleaner. They’ve been married for decades but they don’t live together anymore. Instead, they each stay in dormitories provided by their employers. Their daughter, who’s a nurse, lives in a third dormitory. Three family members, all scattered across the city. But, when asked about their living conditions, they shrug. They don’t question their scattered existence. It’s passengers like these who’ve helped make China richer. They’re migrant workers who left their homes in the countryside to work in the country’s factories and major cities. China’s astonishing economic growth clocked 9.5% a year for three decades, the World Bank says. It’s the fastest growth in economic history - but it’s also growth that hinged on the makeshift lifestyle of migrant workers and the sacrifices they’ve endured. Imagine you’re a bottom-of-the-ladder worker in China, sleeping in a dormitory bunk bed every night and eating canteen food every day. What do you eat if you want a filling snack? Instant noodles filled that gap. But the instant noodle lifestyle is becoming a thing of the past. Sales peaked at more than 50 billion servings a year in 2010 - just after the Chinese economy clocked record gains. But instant noodle sales have been dropping every year since - down 16% last year, alone. “Every food is a product of its own time,” says Professor Meng Suhe. She’s the grande dame of the noodle industry. Behind a pair of thick glasses, she’s witnessed the arc in noodle consumption and how it followed China’s own path over the past 40 years. “Each rise and drop in instant noodle sales has reflected distinct times in China’s modern history,” she says. Professor Meng Suhe The government’s numbers show that half of workers lived in dormitories in 2011. Five years later, only 13% of factory workers did so. Sixty percent had moved into rented housing - places with kitchens allowing them to cook what they want, so there’s less need for instant noodles. Now, China’s workers are starting to reject noodles as they crave their mum’s cooking, Professor Meng says. “Also, Chinese people are starting to crave less processed food.” But noodle makers shouldn’t pack up yet. Lots of millennials haven’t learned how to cook, sighs Professor Meng, and they’re dependent on convenience foods and deliveries. Coss Marte strides through the streets of New York’s Lower East Side with total confidence. “I used to sell drugs on this corner,” he says breezily as we walk across the street to a grocery store. He grabs items off the shelves. Doritos, instant noodles - the processed food favourites he used to rely on in prison. He pauses, staring at the packs of noodles. “This really is survival food in prison.” Michael Gibson-Light has heard this many times before. He stumbled across the importance of instant noodles when he was researching prison jobs. His resulting research on instant noodles made headlines when it emerged last year. He’s the one who declared something that US prisoners have known for ages - in the past few years, instant noodles have come to replace cigarettes as the most traded item in US prisons. “It was totally taken for granted by the prisoner population,” he says. “I was surprised since all you ever really see on TV and movies, or read about in research about prisons is that cigarettes are the de facto currency.” That’s notable because it’s such a huge population. The US has more known prisoners than any other country in the world 2.2 million at the last count. And the change - from cigarettes to instant noodles - boils down to money. Prison budgets have been slashed and most prisons feed inmates the minimum number of calories per day. Many offer just two meals a day on weekends. Prison food has been the subject of recent state Supreme Court lawsuits, with prisoners arguing that prison food is inedible. “So, the food is even worse and there’s less of it,” Gibson-Light explains. “If you’re in prison and you want or need more food than you can get from the chow line, then you have to buy it yourself. The costs of nutrition have shifted to the prisoners themselves. Instant noodles are a go-to because they're cheap.” But it goes further. Noodles function as currency. Over time, they became so valuable that people started using them to trade with. It didn't take long for them to essentially replace tobacco products as the new black market currency, explains former prisoner Chandra Bozelko. “They’re easily stored and they’re non-perishable, so they can be kept for a very long time,” she says. Noodles have replaced cigarettes as the most traded item in US prisons Chandra served six years in prison in Connecticut for identity theft. The press called her the “Connecticut Princess” - an Ivy League graduate who was convicted of stealing credit card information and forging signatures to buy thousands of dollars worth of goods online. Now she’s out, and part of her case is on appeal, she writes about prison life, including why instant noodles are so valuable on the inside. “You might have a certain book from the outside that I want to read. You might say, ‘I’ll give you 10 soups - 10 packages of ramen noodles - in exchange for that book,’ or to even borrow that book. I’m sure it’s been used for payment for sexual acts.” Noodles can ease social interactions inside a prison, Chandra says. “It can be used as a gratuity. So a lot of times there’s a laundry worker who washes people’s clothes, and even though you’re not required to do that, they might hand over a package of noodles when the laundry worker gives an inmate back her clothes, when they’re folded and dried.” Coss Marte preparing a 'prison burrito' It’s the same story for the men. Coss Marte says things can get violent when instant noodle debts aren’t repaid. “There are all types of hustling inside the system. People juggle. Juggle means you get, like, a 200% mark-up. If you give someone two ramen noodle soups, you get four [more] ramen noodle soups back within a week. “I've seen people get cut and stabbed for ramen noodle. And it’s not about the 30 cents it’s worth. It’s about the principle. It’s currency in the system.” Edible currency, that is. Chandra says she’ll never eat instant noodles again, but for Coss Marte, it’s a different story. He serves up his prison burrito and I give it a try. Warm and starchy, it’s full of flavour. Synthetic flavour - fake cheese and ketchup, mostly - but it’s easy to see why this would pass as comfort food inside a prison. In fact, prisoners turn noodles into all sorts of things, from tortillas to pizza bases. “I’ll make this once a year,” he explains, after eating a forkful of the burrito. “Maybe I’m watching a prison show or something and it’s like, ugh, memories.” Burritos are mostly off the menu because Coss is in shape now. He’s come a long way from prison, and runs his own gym. “I was eating all this junk food every day,” he says, gesturing towards the instant noodles. “The doctors told me my cholesterol levels were so bad I could die of a heart attack in five years. I was sentenced to seven years. That motivated me.” On his self-assigned exercise regime, he lost 70lb in just a few months. He didn’t want to die in prison, he explains. Coss Marte runs a prison-themed workout gym “The [prison] cemetery doesn’t say your name, just a number. I didn’t want to die in the system. I’ve seen people die in there. It’s pretty sad. Most of the time family don’t show up.” There’s now a big push to make the food served in prisons healthier. And globally, the trend’s the same. Noodle makers in China and Japan told us that they’re under pressure from consumers to overhaul their products, to subtract salt and add nutrients. But what happens if you eat only instant noodles? What would it do to your body? Kieran “Danger” Dooley can tell us - he’s the person who forced himself to exist only on noodles for a month as part of a student film project. After 30 days, Danger lost 11kg. Normally an easy-going guy, he experienced unusual mood swings. “I would go up and down, up and down. I wouldn’t say depression. It was more of a meh! I just couldn’t be bothered,” he explains. “I couldn’t be bothered making the noodles. I’d just stare at them for 10 minutes and think, 'Why the hell did I do this?’” Danger made it through the month, with one sneaky trip to a pub to drink three pints of beer. The silver lining was that he won the top prize in his university documentary competition. And what did a month of eating square packets of noodles teach him? “Man can’t live on noodles alone. Well, they probably could but it wouldn’t be an existence worth living.” Tell that to those who still revere Momofuku Ando. In the instant noodle museum in Yokohama, there’s a cardboard cut-out of him. He is surrounded by, and equated with, famous historical figures - Marie Curie, Beethoven, Galileo, Einstein. But does the creator of instant noodles deserve a place of honour among the world’s greatest figures? Here’s one thing we can say - instant noodles are the world’s true convenience food, the hot food that’s always waiting there, in the background, for those who are short on money or time. As long as there are people living in dormitories, or shopping in convenience stores, or concocting meals in prisons - the instant noodle will live on. Built with Shorthand"
Head teachers' polite protest over funding,"""Relentlessly reasonable"" is an unusual rally cry - but this was no ordinary demonstration. Hundreds of head teachers - the men in smart suits, the women in business wear - came to Westminster to make their point about school funding in England. Ripples of applause filled Parliament Square - their meeting point and the scene of many a demonstration over the decades. ""Don't be chaining yourselves to the railings now ladies,"" someone joked. It was clear that these protesters, passionate though they may be, would not have dreamt of it. The gathering had more of an air of a collegiate conference than a demonstration. ""We're all a long way out of our comfort zone,"" one head teacher said. ""We asked each other on the bus if anyone had ever been to a protest before and nobody had,"" another added a little sheepishly. The participants may have felt cheerful, and maybe little awkward, but the mood was nonetheless serious. One head teacher from Suffolk told how she had been bitten by a pupil this week. ""It wasn't his fault. It was because of a situation outside of school, and his emotional support had been cut two weeks earlier because of the cuts."" She could not give her name in case the pupil was identified, but she added: ""We have children who are distressed and angry and we can't help them."" Another Suffolk head teacher, Kelly Head from Springfield Infants School, said: ""It's head teachers here protesting because there's no one left. ""We are using people left, right and centre to cover all sorts of jobs in schools. There's no one left."" The organisers of this grassroots protest highlightInstitute of Fiscal Studies' claim that per pupil funding has fallen 8% in real terms since 2010. Their budgets have been squeezed by unfunded pay rises, national insurance payments, other cost pressures and rising pupil numbers. Others point to problems with England's new funding formula, which had been introduced to even out the amount which different local authorities receive per pupil. Tony Markham, head teacher of Herne Junior School in Petersfield, Hampshire, told how his budget will be Â£250,000 in deficit by 2020-21. The county has one of the lowest per pupil funding rates in the country, despite the new formula. Ella Palmer, head of a school in Alton, Hampshire, said her school had been using money from its capital budget to fund laptops. But these were now 14 years old, and the capital funding had been cut from Â£25,000 to Â£5,000 a year. Another Hampshire head, Joe Ayres, said: ""There just isn't enough money to do what we need to do."" Ms Head added: ""It's heart-breaking because the decisions we are beginning to have to make are about reducing social care and mental health support."" The government insists school funds will rise to a record Â£43.5bn by 2020 and that a new funding formula is bringing bring more cash to schools. National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) leader Paul Whiteman said head teachers were not really ""the marching type"" and if they were protesting, something must be ""seriously wrong"". This is the latest push in a campaign by school leaders to highlight the dangers of budget shortfalls and the different funding levels between schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has recognised that funding is one of the biggest concerns in his brief. A Department for Education spokesman said: ""There is more money going into schools than ever before, rising to a record Â£43.5bn by 2020 - 50% more in real terms per pupil than in 2000. ""Every school attracts more funding per pupil through the National Funding Formula, high needs funding has risen to over Â£6bn this year, and the 3.5% pay rise we announced for classroom teachers on the main pay range is backed by Â£508m government funding. ""We know that we are asking schools to do more, which is why we are helping them to reduce the Â£10bn spent each year on non-staffing costs, providing government-backed deals for things like printers and energy suppliers that are helping to save millions of pounds."" But Stockport head teacher, Jim Nicholson, said he was fed up with hearing this government line. ""We have seen how our colleagues are having to lay off staff and our vulnerable pupils are not getting support. ""We'd all rather be back in school teaching. But we've had enough,"" he added. The head teachers taking part in the protest are from areas including: Blackpool â¢ Bolton â¢ Brighton and Hove â¢ Buckinghamshire â¢ Cambridgeshire â¢ Cheshire â¢ Cornwall â¢ Cumbria â¢ Derbyshire â¢ Devon â¢ Dorset â¢ Dudley, West Midlands â¢ East Sussex â¢ Essex â¢ Gloucestershire â¢ Greenwich â¢ Hampshire â¢ Hertfordshire â¢ Kent â¢ Kingston-upon-Thames â¢ Lancashire â¢ Liverpool â¢ London â¢ Norfolk â¢ Northampton â¢ Oxfordshire â¢ Peterborough â¢ Poole â¢ Portsmouth â¢ Richmond â¢ Rotherham â¢ Sheffield â¢ Slough â¢ Solihull, West Midlands â¢ Somerset â¢ Southend â¢ Southampton â¢ Staffordshire â¢ Suffolk â¢ Surrey â¢ Thurrock â¢ Walsall â¢ Warrington â¢ West Berkshire â¢ West Sussex â¢ Wigan â¢ Wiltshire â¢ Wokingham, Berkshire â¢ Wolverhampton â¢ Worcestershire The school with 300 holes in the roof Is social mobility really about school cash?

A moment of reckoning for American women,"Christine Blasey Ford swears in at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 27, 2018 Even beforeChristine Blasey Ford accusedSupreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nomination was said to be about women. Appointing Mr Kavanaugh would tip the court's balance in favour of Republicans. This sparked real fear amongst progressive women thatlandmark Roe v Wade decision,externalthat granted the right to abortion could be overturned. In 2016 the potential for the first majority conservative line-up on the court in decades brought reluctant Trump voters to the ballot box. Once Mr Kavanaugh denied Ms Ford's allegations, the hearings became a test of how far the Me Too movement has changed America. The BBC spoke to women before and after the extraordinary hearing to find out whether this is really about women's rights. Did listening to Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh change their minds about who and what to believe? Already suspicious of Mr Kavanaugh's social values, progressive women's opposition escalated when sexual assault claims emerged. Julia Peters, 33, has been attending protests in Washington DC for a week. ""This isn't someone we can elect out. He will be in there for a lifetime, and we know he doesn't stand for our values,"" she said at Capitol Hill before the hearings began. Julia Peters, 33, travelled from New York City to protest in Washington Grace Perret, a college junior, is from New Orleans, Louisiana,one of the four US states with a ""trigger law"",externalthat mean abortion would be banned automatically if Roe v Wade was overturned. ""This would have devastating implications for poor women especially, who likely cannot afford to travel"" to other states to seek abortions, she explained. The promise ""we believe women"" is core for Julia: ""We are here to let Christine Blasey Ford know we believe her."" Key takeaways from the hearing #BelieveWomen v #BackBrett Why US top court is so much more political than UK's How new US Supreme Court could impact abortion laws There is anger at how quickly some on the right dismissed Dr Ford's allegations, which have caused great distress to her family. ""The attempts by so many on the right to paint this as a co-ordinated political smear campaign is incredibly damaging to the anti-rape culture movement and to survivors everywhere,"" commented Ms Perret. But conservative women are deeply concerned about what they see as an abuse of the confirmation process. Rachel Gill, 22, went to Capitol Hill on Thursday to show her support for Mr Kavanaugh because she believes in the ""principle of innocent until proven guilty"". ""I absolutely do support women who have come forward to talk about these experiences, but I also think there needs to be proof if you're going to take someone to court. Rachel Gill, 22, recently graduated and is worried about debasement of the process of confirming a Supreme Court justice ""I'm here because I want to hear the truth, and if there is any truth to these accusations,"" she explained. Talk of a smear campaign against Mr Kavanaugh is common as some conservative women fear the assault allegations are being weaponised by Democrats who want to prevent Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation. Nancy Wilson, a grandmother of 11, travelled to Washington from Fairfax County, Virginia, with two friends. Wearing ""I Stand With Brett"" T-shirts, they explained they believe women are being misused. They want Mr Kavanaugh on the court because he's a ""constitutionalist judge"". ""The process is being abused. It's become a circus. Sex should not be inserted into politics like this. Someone came along at the 11th hour with an accusation about something that happened 35 years ago,"" Nancy explained. On Thursday the world finally heard from Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh, in tearful testimonies that took strikingly different tones. #KavanaughHearings trended all day on social media, prompting survivors of sexual violence to tell their own stories, includinga 76-year-old woman who called the TV network C-Span about her experience of rape,external. Lucy Melchor (left) watched the hearings after rally for Christine Blasey Ford on Capitol Hill After protesting outside the Senate, Chicago-born Lucy Melchor, 36, watched the hearings. ""I thought Ms Ford's testimony was heartbreaking and compelling. It just reinforced that I believe her,"" she said. ""When asked who committed the assault, she replied without skipping a beat. And I thought, she is there under oath, with her family life having been destroyed. What has she got to gain from this? Her motive seemed pure and clear."" In contrast, she felt Mr Kavanaugh's testimony turned the attention away from a woman's claims of sexual assault to his anger about the political process. ""I was really upset by the level of vitriol that he brought to this. It took the focus away from her and put it on politics. That was so difficult to see,"" she said. But where progressives found Ms Ford powerfully believable, conservative women felt exactly the same about Mr Kavanaugh. Ann Trible (left), Nancy Wilson (centre), and Kay Lucien (right) travelled from Virginia to show their support for Brett Kavanaugh ""I think they both believe what they are saying. I believe that Ms Ford probably was assaulted but not by Mr Kavanaugh. My heart really does go out to Dr Ford,"" Rachel Gill explained. Kay Lucien, one of the grandmothers who joined rallies on Capitol Hill, called Mr Kavanaugh's comments ""compelling"" and ""passionate."" Like the judge, Mrs Lucien has a strong religious faith. ""I found it so moving that Mr Kavanaugh's child would offer to pray for a woman who has brought so much pain to her family,"" she explained after the hearing. While she feels sympathy for Dr Ford, she says her confidence in Mr Kavanaugh's suitability for the court increased. ""I would be pleased if the balance of the Supreme Court court changed in favour of conservatives - we've seen our country slide in the other direction and we would like to move it back a little bit. ""I would worry less about losing some rights, such as religious rights and gun rights and a lot of things that seem to be attacked constantly in recent years,"" she added. The hearings are also a moment of reckoning for women's rights in America. Democrat Ms Melchor commented, ""It's now almost a year since the Me Too movement, and if the cards fall onto the side of not believing her story, it's really detrimental for the women who have been assaulted and will be assaulted in the future. It creates fear for them that they won't be believed in the future and that's what upset them the most.""

"Adam Price replaces Wood as Plaid leaderAdam Price wins the Plaid Cymru leadership contest, defeating Rhun ap Iorwerth and Leanne Wood.Wales politicsComments","This video can not be played Adam Price: ""We've got to fire up the national imagination"" Adam Price has won the Plaid Cymru leadership contest, taking nearly 50 per cent of the vote. The assembly member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr defeated Rhun ap Iorwerth and former leader Leanne Wood in a ballot of party members. Despite leading the party for six years, Ms Wood came last. In his victory address at the Novotel in Cardiff, Mr Price said: ""This election shows we are ready to lead again. Our time has come."" He told party members: ""Our message must be simple. Yes, Wales can."" The AM is the first openly gay assembly party leader in the history of the institution and leads the third largest group in the Senedd, behind Labour and the Tories. Who is Adam Price? Two challenge Wood for Plaid leadership Plaid's pivotal moment All change for Welsh party leaders? Mr Price, who has vowed to put independence at the core of his party's message, said: ""There will be no second class travellers on our journey to a prosperous, self-confident and independent Wales."" ""We must become the hope of those without hope."" Mr Price paid tribute to former leader Leanne Wood. ""She has inspired thousands with her drive, her resilience and her unending commitment to the causes that she and we hold dear,"" he said. Former leader Leanne Wood, who took the helm of Plaid Cymru in 2012, came third The leadership election began in the summer after Ynys Mon AM Mr ap Iorwerth and Mr Price challenged Ms Wood for her job. The Rhondda AM, who became leader in 2012, left the count in Cardiff declining to give interviews. She later tweeted her congratulations to Mr Price. Following the result Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Now it's about coming together under the new leadership of Adam Price to take forward that joint vision that we have of a new Wales, a new more confident Wales, out to the public and build towards the next assembly election."" Adam Price took 49.7% of first preference votes (2,863), while Rhun ap Iorwerth took 28% (1,613) and Leanne Wood 22.3% (1,286). After no candidate reached 50%, Ms Wood was knocked out and a second count began with the second preference votes of her supporters redistributed. This gave Mr Price 618 more votes and Mr ap Iorwerth 348. In the final totals, Mr Price beat Mr ap Iorwerth by 3,481 votes to 1,961. By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor It's a bit of a shock to be honest. Not because of who won - Adam Price was widely expected to take this - but because of the way the incumbent Leanne Wood lost. It's a strange one, because she always polls as one of the most popular politicians in Wales. She has UK recognition factor after taking part in general election TV debates, and yet somehow she has struggled to convert that popularity into widespread electoral success for Plaid Cymru. Adam Price, a former MP, is perhaps best known for his attempt to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war in 2004. Now in the assembly, he's a charismatic speaker, a big campaigner and a man of big ideas. The pressure on him now will be to deliver on them. Leader of the Conservative group in the assembly, Paul Davies, was one of the first to congratulate Mr Price on his victory, and said he looked forward to working with him in Cardiff Bay. ""I hope that Adam realises that Plaid members have now signalled a new direction. This is a clear instruction to end Welsh Labour rule and that they should no longer prop them up,"" Mr Davies said. During the campaign candidates were questioned over whether they would work with the Conservatives in government. Leanne Wood said Mr Price and Rhun ap Iorwerth would ""quite possibly"" strike a deal with the Conservatives, butMr Price rejected the idea of a coalition with the party. Adam Price told BBC Radio Cymru he did not want to enter a coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour. ""No to both unionist parties. Both have let the people of Wales down,"" he said. Following the result Plaid Cymru's official Twitter account posted a video montage of Mr Price with dramatic music. It was deleted after the video was widely mocked on the social media network. Adam Price is the first openly gay assembly leader Born in Carmarthen to a miner's family in 1968. Educated at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman and Cardiff University Served as MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr from 2001 to 2010 Awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study at Harvard University during his break from politics Elected to the Welsh Assembly in 2016 Welsh Labour leadership contest underway 'Independence best path out of poverty' Plaid Cymru MPs call for change in leader Plaid nuclear accord must change - Wood Two challenge Wood for Plaid leadership Plaid's pivotal moment Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15,went into cardiac arrest on a flightafter buying a sandwich at Heathrow Airport in 2016. She was ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging, the coroner found. Natasha's family said food labelling laws ""played Russian roulette with our daughter's life"". Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, Natasha's father, said the inquest should ""serve as a watershed moment to make meaningful change and save lives"". Coroner Dr Sean Cummings said he would be reporting to the government over whether large businesses should be able to benefit from regulations that allow reduced food labelling for products made in shops. Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"". Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? Pret taking risks, say allergy sufferers Natasha, from Fulham, west London, ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from a Pret shop at about 07:00 BST in Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport on 17 July 2016, West London Coroner's Court heard. She began to feel ill during the British Airways flight, and suffered a cardiac arrest. She died later the same day. The inquest heard the baguette contained sesame - which Natasha was allergic to - but the ingredient was not listed on the packaging. This video can not be played Video shows Natasha Ednan-Laperouse minutes before her fatal allergic reaction Dr Cummings said he would be writing to Pret about its practices of collecting information on allergic reactions and responding to serious concerns. ""I was left with the impression that Pret had not addressed the fact that monitoring food allergy in a business selling more than 200 million items year was something to be taken very seriously indeed,"" Dr Cummings said. The inquest heard Pret did not label ""artisan"" baguettes as containing sesame seeds despite six allergic reaction cases in the year before Natasha died. The family's lawyer Jill Paterson, from Leigh Day, said: ""The law as it stands currently treats multinational companies in the same way as a local sandwich shop. This cannot be right."" Girl's plea before Pret baguette death Defibrillator not used on Pret girl Pret baguette allergy cases before death Under currentfood regulations,externalnon pre-packaged fresh food made on the premises does not need to be individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information. This video can not be played The family of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse made an emotional statement after the inquest into her death Despite her father administering two EpiPen injections, Natasha died in a hospital in Nice within hours of eating the sandwich. ""Natasha said that she still couldn't breathe and desperately looked at me, she said 'Daddy, help me, I can't breathe',"" Mr Ednan-Laperouse said in a statement. The court heard the EpiPens - used to treat severe allergic reactions - administered by Natasha's father had a 16mm needle ""which may be insufficient for adrenalin to reach the muscle"". Consultant allergist Dr Alexandra Croom had told the inquest it would be ""impossible to tell"" if a longer needle would have improved Natasha's treatment, as some forms of shock are resistant to adrenaline. At the inquest's conclusion Dr Cummings said he would be making the following reports: To Pret A Manger about collecting information on allergic reactions and responding to serious concerns To the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and to the manufacturers of the Epipen about the apparently inadequate length of the needle and the dosage of adrenaline within the device To Environment Secretary Michael Gove about whether large food business operators should benefit from current regulations. UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain In a statement ahead of this week's hearing, Natasha's parents said she loved horse-riding and ice-skating, and wanted to pursue a career in law. She had just finished school for the summer and was on her way to Nice for a four-day ""special treat"" with her best friend, Bethany, and her father. She had been ""so excited"" about what was going to be ""her best summer ever"", they added. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""This is a deeply upsetting situation and my heart goes out to the family of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse. ""We are currently reviewing our approach to food labelling to give consumers more information. We await the findings of the inquest and stand ready to take appropriate action.""

Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death?,"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died after eating the baguette bought from Pret at Heathrow Airport The inquest into the death of a girl who suffered a fatal reaction to sesame in a Pret a Manger baguette has shone a light on food allergen labelling. As the hearing concludes, experts say lessons need to be learned from the teenager's death. For people with food allergies, eating out can be a distressing experience. There is the fear factor of leaving the allergen-free comfort zone of a person's own kitchen, and often a feeling of embarrassment; of not wanting to ask too many questions of waiting staff, or to call attention to one's dietary needs. To combat those concerns, a new law aimed at making things easier for people with allergies to eat out safely was introduced in 2014. But experts say it doesn't go far enough. UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain Under current guidelines, takeaways and restaurants are only required to let customers know if any of the 14 most dangerous allergens - including peanuts, eggs and milk - are ingredients in their food. However, freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food does not have to be individually labelled, according to the UK'sFood Regulations 2014,external. The Pret baguette Natasha Ednan-Laperouse bought falls into this grey area. The 15-year-old, from Fulham,reacted to sesame in the sandwich she bought at Heathrow Airportin July 2016. Natasha's brother, father and mother attended the inquest at West London Coroner's Court Coroner Dr Sean Cummings recorded a narrative conclusion at West London Coroner's Court - finding that the teenager was ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging. He said the labelling was ""inadequate"" and he would be writing to the government about reduced food labelling on products made in shops. Sesame is one of the 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products Law student Amelia Zekavica, 20, who said she had suffered an allergic reaction to sesame in a Pret sandwich in the past, said businesses should do more. She said: ""The food industry needs to list all of the ingredients on the packaging. I think everything should be included. ""It's very serious. You shouldn't have to check and ask for an ingredients book or list, it should be labelled. ""The industry should understand that there are people out there who have allergies. People can die."" Sesame is one of the 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products, according toEU Regulations,external However, the EU rules say individual member states are responsible for deciding on how information about non pre-packaged food is provided to the customer The UK'sFood Regulations 2014,externalallow freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food to not be individually labelled Pret confirmed at the time of Natasha's death products would not have been individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information, and that this was within regulations However, Pret said there were signs in the fridge and at till points telling consumers with allergies to speak to a manager for advice or to seeits allergen guide,external Allergy blogger Nathalie Newman, who runs theIntolerant Gourmand site,external, backed Ms Zekavica's call. ""Labelling food is absolutely crucial, as in the severest form of allergies it can be the difference between life and death. ""Lessons have to be learned from this; we have the top 14 allergies for a reason and businesses should take responsibility for labelling."" Nathalie Newman has called for lessons to be learned David Pickering, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said the law was designed to ""reduce burdens on smaller businesses"" but suggested it may need to change. ""Big chains probably have a formulaic approach to making sandwiches, which is totally different to a local shop where they can make it up as they go along and it's potentially not as controlled,"" he said. ""[Businesses] can simply comply with the legislation - as Pret said they had in this case - but should also look to go further, to find better ways to communicate with people who have allergies. ""If businesses are complying and these situations still occur, then maybe the law needs to be looked at again."" Providing a safe eating experience for allergy sufferers should be paramount, according to Holly Shaw from Allergy UK. She said: ""Cases [like Natasha's] show that at the very severe end of the scale, lives can be lost if people come across something they're allergic to."" Data highlighted by the FSA, Allergy UK and the Anaphylaxis Campaign,externalsuggests children and young adults are ""disproportionately more prone to die from an allergic reaction than adults"". The FSA has launched a new campaign - easy to ASK - to encourage young people to ask food businesses about allergens when eating out. Its chairman Heather Hancock said: ""Living with a food allergy or intolerance is not easy and can have fatal consequences. ""It's crucial that [young people] feel confident to speak up and ask for allergen information, and that the people around them make that easier."" Ultimately, there is an onus on both businesses and customers with allergies to take responsibility, according to Ms Shaw. She said: ""We're at a place now where there's still work to be done, but allergy awareness is far more increased. ""Effective communication is really important for food business operators, who also need to make sure the [allergen] information they provide is accurate. ""It is important that allergen labelling is consistent. ""But people [with allergies] also have a responsibility to ask questions as well to make sure they are aware.""

'People can die' - allergy sufferers speak out,"Amelia Zekavica was hospitalised after eating a Pret sandwich Allergy sufferers hospitalised after eating Pret a Manger sandwiches have demanded change to the company's labelling. The coroner leading an inquest into the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse has alsodescribed the allergy labelling at Pret as ""inadequate"". Ms Ednan-Laperouse, 15, who was allergic to sesame seeds, died after eating a baguette from the food chain after being ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the pack, the coroner found. One allergy sufferer, who says she was hospitalised in 2017 after eating an unlabelled sandwich, said the company was ""taking unnecessary risks"". ""Other vendors have labels. Why wouldn't they?"" she said. Pret a Manger chief executive Clive Schlee promised ""meaningful change"" in the wake of the coroner's findings. Pret inquest: Labelling 'inadequate' in baguette death Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette allergy death? Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after suffering an allergic reaction Beatrice, whose real identity the BBC has agreed not to disclose, was in hospital for 12 hours when she suffered an allergic reaction after eating a cheese sandwich from Pret. Like Ms Ednan-Laperouse, she is allergic to sesame seeds. ""Unbeknown to me [the sandwich] contained sesame seeds,"" she told the BBC. ""They weren't visible or labelled."" She was at work when she felt the reaction coming on. ""I took anti-histamines and went straight to hospital. I told staff there I would go into anaphylactic shock in 10 minutes,"" she said. ""It was the worst I've ever had. I was held upside down, put on oxygen and had more shots than I've ever had in my life."" After posting a photo from her hospital bed detailing the incident on social media, Beatrice was contacted by the company's ""apologetic"" managing director. She told him: ""You need to stick labels on your food before you kill someone."" The executive offered her a voucher, she says, but Beatrice was more interested in the labelling. ""I didn't do it to get money. I wanted to see a change,"" she told the BBC. She was told that a pilot was coming up in December 2017 or early 2018, in which stickers would be added to all packaging. ""They're taking unnecessary risks. It's not a viable business model when your company ends up in the media when someone eats your sandwich and dies."" Amelia Zekavica, a law student aged 20, is allergic to nuts, pulses, sesame seeds and ""almost anything furry"" she told the BBC. She described how when she was 18 years old, she fell ill within five minutes of eating a Chicken Caesar sandwich from Pret. ""I was quite scared. It's so terrifying when you have these kinds of allergies. It's like your own body is just killing itself."" Her mother made her vomit and gave her some anti-histamine tablets to get the swelling down from her lips and throat. At home, Amelia rested while her mother called the store to ask about the ingredients. Her father Milan recalled what happened next: ""Pret were no help whatsoever. They told my wife everything was online. ""We went on their website and found there was sesame in the Caesar dressing but this was not indicated on the packaging or in store."" Amelia became progressively unwell and spent four hours in A&E. ""Luckily she shook it off,"" said Milan. This is not the first time Amelia has had a bad allergic reaction. ""I'm always very careful. Each reaction is different and they can get progressively worse. ""When my mum and dad told me about the girl who'd died, it really struck a chord. The food industry should understand that there are people out there who have allergies. ""People can die. This is not stressed enough. Celiac awareness is stressed a lot - it's also bad but they don't die from it. ""The food industry needs to list all of the ingredients on the packaging. You shouldn't have to check online or ask for an ingredients book. Everything should be labelled."" A spokesperson for Pret a Manger said: ""We are very sorry for Amelia's experience and we would like to invite her and her family to get back in touch so we can give them the apology they deserve."" Mr Schlee, who joined Pret as CEO in 2003, said the company was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"". ""We cannot begin to comprehend the pain the family have felt and the grief they will continue to feel. ""We've listened to everything the coroner and Natasha's family have said this week and we will learn from it. ""All of us at Pret want meaningful change to come from this tragedy. We will ensure it does.""

Tesla shares sink on fraud investigationInvestors take fright after the US financial regulator accuses Elon Musk of securities fraud.Business,"This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Tesla shares have sunk after US regulators took legal action against co-founder Elon Musk for alleged securities fraud. On Thursday the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over claims made last month by Mr Musk that he had funding to take the company private. The billionaire boss of the electric carmaker called the action unjustified. But the filing was a potentially serious blow for the company, which was already under financial strain. Mr Musk has led the electric carmaker as chief executive since 2008, presiding over its rise into a company with a market value that rivals Ford and General Motors. His celebrity status and reputation for entrepreneurial vision attracted investors and legions of fans - even though the firm has consistently lost money and struggled to hit manufacturing targets. Tesla's shares closed 13.9% lower. During the trading session on Friday, shares fell by 15%. Now the SEC is seeking to bar Mr Musk from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company. The move would strip him of his role at Tesla and could make it difficult for the firm to raise money at a critical moment for the company, which has been spending heavily to increase production of its latest car. On Friday, the shares opened 10% lower as Wall Street investors reacted to the news. ""The mere possibility that Musk could be removed as chief executive (or entirely from Telsa) is likely to cast an overhang on the stock,"" analysts for AllianceBernstein wrote. Tesla's Elon Musk accused of fraud Will Elon Musk be forced to leave Tesla? Read the SEC's claims against Elon Musk here,external The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk Mr Musk stunned the business world in August when he announced on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla off the stock market and into private ownership. He wrote he had ""funding secured"" for the proposal, which would value Tesla at $420 per share. This video can not be played Tesla's Elon Musk 'mislead investors' SEC alleges In a complaint filed in New York, the SEC said those claims were ""false and misleading"". ""In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,"" the regulator said. Mr Musk has opted to fight the claims, reportedly rejecting opportunities for settlement. On Thursday, the Tesla chief said that he acted in the ""best interests of truth, transparency and investors"". ""Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way,"" he said in a statement. Tesla's board of directors said in a statement that they were ""fully confident in Elon, his integrity and his leadership of the company"". The SEC has a strong case when it comes to proving that Mr Musk's tweets - which triggered a temporary spike in the firm's share price - were reckless, said Adam C Pritchard, a professor of securities law at the University of Michigan Law School. But he says it may be more difficult to convince a court that the claims merit a lifetime bar from acting as director or officer of a public company, given how critical Mr Musk has been to Tesla's success and ability to raise money. ""If I'm the judge, I'm thinking - do I want to blow up this company just because he's a jackass?"" Mr Pritchard added. He says he expects the two sides to eventually negotiate a settlement. Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said Mr Musk is behind much of Tesla's appeal for car buyers and investors. But, she added, his behaviour in recent months has not done the firm ""any favours"". Mr Musk is credited with pushing the car industry toward electric vehicles This spring, Mr Musk alarmed investors with jokes about Tesla's bankruptcy and abrupt dismissal of questions from financial analysts during earnings calls. Elon Musk unveils first tourist for SpaceX 'Moon loop' Elon Musk sued for libel by British Thai cave rescuer Then in July, Mr Musk drew widespread criticism after accusing a British cave diver involved in the rescue of Thai teenagers from a flooded cave of being a child abuser. The diver later filed a defamation suit. He also drew attention after an emotional interview with theNew York Times,external, in which he said he worked ""120-hour weeks"" and took sedatives. And earlier this month, he smoked marijuana live on the web during a podcast with comedian Joe Rogan. ""The disappointing part of all this is it's self-inflicted,"" Ms Lindland said. ""I could see investors potentially being reassured if a strong, experienced stable management team were to come in and replace him."" Still, she said she would want Mr Musk to remain in an advisory role, lending his vision to the firm. ""It's obviously a very big deal...but it doesn't mean it's the death of Tesla,"" she said.

TSB and HSBC hit by computer glitch,"TSB says its systems are almost back to normal after some customers were unable to access online accounts. Earlier, HSBC was also hit by problems with its mobile banking app, but now says all operations are back online. TSB said: ""We're sorry for any issues our customers experienced. These services are now recovering back to normal levels."" It is the latest in a string of IT outages for the industry, including the recent high-profile meltdown at TSB. TSB said users of its smartphone app and internet banking had been having difficulty logging in since about 07:40 on Friday. About the same time, HSBC said about 50% of mobile users were having trouble connecting to its app. TSB said: ""Our cards, branch and telephone services continue to operate as normal"". An HSBC spokesman said: ""An earlier issue where some customers were unable to log on to the HSBC mobile banking app has been resolved and users of the app should be able to log on as usual. ""We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue, and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused."" Last week, RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank reported problems with customers unable to access their bank accounts online. Customers were locked out for about five hours. Earlier this year, TSB's huge IT meltdown led to weeks of pain for customers and the eventualresignation of chief executive Paul Pester. TSB customers, many still recovering from the previous outages, were quick to vent their anger on Twitter. ""Well done @TSB on having yet another issue with online banking. Top service,"" said one frustrated customer. Said another: ""So sick of the shocking online banking service currently being provided. Yet again can not access my money.""

First US Supreme Court nomination vote dueThe Senate committee vote follows dramatic testimony over an alleged sex assault by Brett Kavanaugh.,"The first vote by a Senate committee is due over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. It follows Thursday's testimony by Mr Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault. Dr Ford, close to tears, described the alleged 1982 attack in detail, saying it had ""drastically"" affected her life. Judge Kavanaugh angrily denied he had assaulted her or anyone. President Donald Trump has urged the full Senate to approve his nominee. LIVE: Committee to vote on Kavanaugh Key takeaways from a dramatic hearing Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor That vote is expected next week. Republicans currently have a majority of 51-49 in the Senate, but a number of senators on both sides are said to be undecided. Judge Kavanaugh's appointment would tilt the balance in favour of conservatives for years to come. For this reason, Republicans accuse the Democrats of seeking to delay the confirmation until after the mid-term elections in November when they hope to win enough seats to stop it altogether. Democrats counter by accusing Republicans of trying to ""railroad"" the process. Why US top court is so much more political than UK's The Supreme Court plays a vital role in US political life - appointed for life, its nine members have the final say on US law. This includes highly contentious social issues, such as abortion, and challenges to government policy. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who was believed to be wavering, issued a statement shortly before the committee began sitting on Friday morning stating that he would back Judge Kavanaugh. This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake is challenged by a sexual assault survivor On his way to the committee room following the release of the statement, he was berated by two women who said they were victims of sexual violence and urged him to change his mind. As the committee began, the bitter political divide was clear as an attempt by Democrats to call a further witness - Mark Judge, who Dr Ford said was present during the alleged sexual assault - was defeated by the 11 Republicans voting against the 10 Democrats. A subsequent motion to move to a vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination was passed despite vocal Democratic objections. Some Democratic senators refused to vote on that and walked out of the hearing. In a letter after Thursday's hearing,Robert Carlson, head of the American Bar Association - the body representing US lawyers and students of law - urged a delay of the vote,externalto enable the FBI to check the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. The association had previously supported Judge Kavanaugh for the role. Thursday's hearing, which lasted for nine hours, brought an outpouring of support for Dr Ford - a university professor - from the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her Prior to Thursday, no-one had heard from the 51-year-old publicly since the allegations arose. Moment of reckoning for American women #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford ""I am here today not because I want to be,"" Dr Ford said. ""I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."" She alleged he and his friend Mark Judge had locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in a Washington DC suburb in the summer of 1982, when she was 15 and Judge Kavanaugh was 17. Dr Ford said Brett Kavanaugh had tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her. Both men were ""drunkenly laughing"", she said. She added: ""Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details."" Under questioning by a Democratic senator, she said her most vivid memory was ""the laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense... They were laughing with each other - two friends having a really good time with one another"". In an answer to a question from another Democrat about claims of mistaken identity, Dr Ford said she was ""100%"" certain that Judge Kavanaugh had assaulted her. The 53-year-old federal judge took a combative approach but occasionally became emotional. This video can not be played ""I like beer"": Kavanaugh defends his high school drinking during testimony ""This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,"" he told the committee. ""The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy. ""Since my nomination in July there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation."" Who is Brett Kavanaugh? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words He insisted he would not be ""intimidated"" into withdrawing from the process. ""You may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit. Never."" Judge Kavanaugh said he did not doubt that Prof Ford had been assaulted, but insisted: ""I've never sexually assaulted Dr Ford - or anyone."" He admitted he had drunk beer while at high school, but said he had never got so drunk as to forget events. He added that his calendars for 1982 - which he had kept - showed he had not attended a party at the location Prof Ford had described. The Democratic senators on the committee have called on President Trump to ""immediately withdraw"" Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Moments after the hearing ended, however, President Trump tweeted that he was standing by his nominee and said he found Judge Kavanaugh's testimony ""powerful, honest and riveting"". Kavanaugh hearing divides US media Mr Trump has repeatedly defended the judge's character, saying he is ""one of the highest quality people"" he has ever met. Allow Twitter content?

Head teachers march on Downing Street,"""Relentlessly reasonable"" is an unusual rally cry - but this was no ordinary demonstration. Hundreds of head teachers - the men in smart suits, the women in business wear - came to Westminster to make their point about school funding in England. Ripples of applause filled Parliament Square - their meeting point and the scene of many a demonstration over the decades. ""Don't be chaining yourselves to the railings now ladies,"" someone joked. It was clear that these protesters, passionate though they may be, would not have dreamt of it. The gathering had more of an air of a collegiate conference than a demonstration. ""We're all a long way out of our comfort zone,"" one head teacher said. ""We asked each other on the bus if anyone had ever been to a protest before and nobody had,"" another added a little sheepishly. The participants may have felt cheerful, and maybe little awkward, but the mood was nonetheless serious. One head teacher from Suffolk told how she had been bitten by a pupil this week. ""It wasn't his fault. It was because of a situation outside of school, and his emotional support had been cut two weeks earlier because of the cuts."" She could not give her name in case the pupil was identified, but she added: ""We have children who are distressed and angry and we can't help them."" Another Suffolk head teacher, Kelly Head from Springfield Infants School, said: ""It's head teachers here protesting because there's no one left. ""We are using people left, right and centre to cover all sorts of jobs in schools. There's no one left."" The organisers of this grassroots protest highlightInstitute of Fiscal Studies' claim that per pupil funding has fallen 8% in real terms since 2010. Their budgets have been squeezed by unfunded pay rises, national insurance payments, other cost pressures and rising pupil numbers. Others point to problems with England's new funding formula, which had been introduced to even out the amount which different local authorities receive per pupil. Tony Markham, head teacher of Herne Junior School in Petersfield, Hampshire, told how his budget will be Â£250,000 in deficit by 2020-21. The county has one of the lowest per pupil funding rates in the country, despite the new formula. Ella Palmer, head of a school in Alton, Hampshire, said her school had been using money from its capital budget to fund laptops. But these were now 14 years old, and the capital funding had been cut from Â£25,000 to Â£5,000 a year. Another Hampshire head, Joe Ayres, said: ""There just isn't enough money to do what we need to do."" Ms Head added: ""It's heart-breaking because the decisions we are beginning to have to make are about reducing social care and mental health support."" The government insists school funds will rise to a record Â£43.5bn by 2020 and that a new funding formula is bringing bring more cash to schools. National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) leader Paul Whiteman said head teachers were not really ""the marching type"" and if they were protesting, something must be ""seriously wrong"". This is the latest push in a campaign by school leaders to highlight the dangers of budget shortfalls and the different funding levels between schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has recognised that funding is one of the biggest concerns in his brief. A Department for Education spokesman said: ""There is more money going into schools than ever before, rising to a record Â£43.5bn by 2020 - 50% more in real terms per pupil than in 2000. ""Every school attracts more funding per pupil through the National Funding Formula, high needs funding has risen to over Â£6bn this year, and the 3.5% pay rise we announced for classroom teachers on the main pay range is backed by Â£508m government funding. ""We know that we are asking schools to do more, which is why we are helping them to reduce the Â£10bn spent each year on non-staffing costs, providing government-backed deals for things like printers and energy suppliers that are helping to save millions of pounds."" But Stockport head teacher, Jim Nicholson, said he was fed up with hearing this government line. ""We have seen how our colleagues are having to lay off staff and our vulnerable pupils are not getting support. ""We'd all rather be back in school teaching. But we've had enough,"" he added. The head teachers taking part in the protest are from areas including: Blackpool â¢ Bolton â¢ Brighton and Hove â¢ Buckinghamshire â¢ Cambridgeshire â¢ Cheshire â¢ Cornwall â¢ Cumbria â¢ Derbyshire â¢ Devon â¢ Dorset â¢ Dudley, West Midlands â¢ East Sussex â¢ Essex â¢ Gloucestershire â¢ Greenwich â¢ Hampshire â¢ Hertfordshire â¢ Kent â¢ Kingston-upon-Thames â¢ Lancashire â¢ Liverpool â¢ London â¢ Norfolk â¢ Northampton â¢ Oxfordshire â¢ Peterborough â¢ Poole â¢ Portsmouth â¢ Richmond â¢ Rotherham â¢ Sheffield â¢ Slough â¢ Solihull, West Midlands â¢ Somerset â¢ Southend â¢ Southampton â¢ Staffordshire â¢ Suffolk â¢ Surrey â¢ Thurrock â¢ Walsall â¢ Warrington â¢ West Berkshire â¢ West Sussex â¢ Wigan â¢ Wiltshire â¢ Wokingham, Berkshire â¢ Wolverhampton â¢ Worcestershire The school with 300 holes in the roof Is social mobility really about school cash?

Grenfell fund fraud council boss jailed,"Jenny McDonagh stole the money while working in finance for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the health service A fraudster who stole tens of thousands of pounds from the NHS and a Grenfell Tower victim fund has been jailed for five-and-a-half years. Jenny McDonagh stole cash while working in finance for the health service and Kensington and Chelsea council. She holidayed in Dubai and Los Angeles and funded a casino trip using Â£62,000 meant for the fire's survivors. McDonagh, 39,previously pleaded guiltyto fraud, theft and concealing criminal property charges. Sentencing her at Isleworth Crown Court on Friday, Judge Robin Johnson told her: ""You knew exactly what these funds were for and the importance of them for the residents. ""The scale of your dishonesty in this fraud beggars belief."" McDonagh, who stole the money over a 10-month period, spent Â£32,000 of it on gambling, racking up around Â£16,000 in losses. Trips to Paris and Iceland were bought with pre-paid credit cards, as well as purchases in high street shops. Prosecuting barrister Benjamin Holt said on Thursday that the money was spent on ""frivolous items, for example Â£48 at Ann Summers"". After she was arrested on 1 August she continued to use another remaining credit card to spend more money â¢Â£534 on various visits to a hair and beauty salon in Sidcup â¢Â£199.69 on a booking for two at the Delaunay restaurant in central London â¢Â£185 on a pair of Ralph Lauren glasses from Vision Express â¢Â£113.63 at the Hippodrome casino in Leicester Square â¢Â£109.91 at a Burger and Lobster restaurant â¢Â£100 at The Bottle House Inn in Kent â¢Â£99 on a green dress from Hobbs â¢Â£74.99 on food from Selfridges â¢Â£55 on shoes from ECCO â¢Â£48 at an Anne Summers shop â¢Â£26.20 on a taxi â¢Â£19.20 on the Thames Clipper â¢Â£8.90 at Cineworld â¢A handbag from John Lewis â¢Flights to Paris, Reykjavik, Los Angeles and Dubai - one occasion she listed a holiday as a two-week respite break for a genuine victim â¢Â£333.60 loaded on to an Oyster card but not used On Thursday, one of her victims Edward Daffarn, a survivor of the fire, told the court about the impact of the fraud on his community. He said: ""It is like pouring salt on wounds of bereaved residents."" McDonagh, from Abbey Wood, was hired by the west London council in October 2017 to assist with the distribution of money to survivors of the fire, which was meant to be spent by them on accommodation and other essential items. She took money using pre-paid credit cards intended for five victims of the fire. The card in Mr Daffarn's name was topped up 17 times and more than Â£50,000 passed through the account. The credit card in a victim's name was topped up 17 times and more than Â£50,000 passed through the account After she was arrested on 1 August she continued to use another credit card to spend more money.

"BeyoncÃÂ© named music's most powerful womanThe superstar is joined by Taylor Swift, Cardi B and Nicola Benedetti on a Woman's Hour power list.Entertainment & Arts","The star was celebrated for her activism, feminism, business acumen and empowering lyrics She says she's a ""black Bill Gates in the making"" who ""ain't never seen a ceiling in my whole damn life"". So it's hardly surprising that BeyoncÃ© has been named music's most powerful woman by BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. The superstar came first in a list of the industry's 40 most influential women, thanks to her feminism, activism and empowering musical messages. Taylor Swift, Adele and Dua Lipa were also included on the power list, which was unveiled as part ofBBC Music Day. This video can not be played Why the judges chose the top 10 The top 40 didn't just recognise big-sellers and global stars, making room for the unsung heroes who work behind the scenes to champion women. Third place went to Vanessa Reed who, as CEO of the PRS Foundation, has persuaded more than 100 festivals to sign up to a 50:50 gender balance on their line-ups by 2022. The top 10 also includes Marin Alsop, who became the first female conductor to lead the Last Night of the Proms in 2013, and Chi-chi Nwanoku, who founded Europe's first professional majority black and minority ethnic orchestra, Chineke! Gender diversity in the music industry is notoriously poor, especially in technical jobs like engineering and production. And even with artists like Cardi B, Adele and Dua Lipa devouring the charts, recent research shows that men account for 78% of hit singles. Woman's Hour said it hoped publishing the power list would lead to better representation. ""It's a celebration of 40 incredible women but hopefully it doesn't stop there,"" said broadcaster Tina Daheley, who led the panel of judges. ""A lot of the people on the list are coming on to the programme, and I think that's where the conversation will start."" BeyoncÃ© Taylor Swift Vanessa Reed (PRS Foundation) Adele Stacey Tang (MD of RCA Records) Gillian Moore (Director of music at Southbank Centre) Rebecca Allen (President of Decca Records) Marin Alsop Chi-chi Nwanoku Maggie Crowe (Director of events at BPI) Read the full list on the Woman's Hour site 'How we're breaking barriers for women in music' Daheley said the top 40 was whittled down from a longlist of 100 names, with judges looking for women ""who've had an impact over the last 12 months"". BeyoncÃ© ""absolutely deserves to be number one"", she added. ""She's one of those people who's absolutely in charge of her own destiny and she's using that platform in a way that makes a difference: empowering black people in America, addressing injustice head-on and championing women. ""It's not just the lyrics and activism in her music which, you could cynically say, sells music,"" she continues. ""She puts her money where her mouth is and she's contributed to Black Lives Matter and the people affected by Hurricane Katrina."" Taylor Swift persuaded Apple to reverse a policy that said artists would not get paid for music streamed by users taking advantage of a three-month trial period Taylor Swift was praised by the panel for standing up to streaming companies like Apple and Spotify over royalties, and forsuccessfully winning a sexual assault case against a US ex-radio DJ, over an incident in 2013. ""When I see young girls and how she empowers them to be strong women, I see how much she's influenced them and her impact on these girls who will be the activists of the future,"" said judge Jasmine Dotiwala, a music TV producer and columnist. Daheley was also keen to highlight figures like Fiona Stewart who, at the age of 18, was a single mum living in homeless shelters - but now runs the Green Man Festival. ""Her story's incredible - but it's also her attitude to music festivals. She refuses corporate sponsorship and she won't have a VIP area. She's very impressive. She's lower down the list, but still being celebrated."" The list also includes Sarah Stennett, the CEO of First Access Entertainment, which manages Rita Ora, Ray BLK and Bebe Rexha The list also includes Rebecca Allen, president of Decca Records, Chi-chi Nwanoku of the Chineke orchestra, and Grace Ladoja, founder of Metallic Inc and Skepta's manager ""I never thought consciously of my gender as something that limited me in any way until this year,"" Stennett told BBC News. ""I was just too busy trying to push forward and survive in the cut-throat environment of the male-dominated entertainment business. ""It took an essay my daughter wrote on the effects women face from subconscious patriarchal oppression for me to finally stop and realise that it was that oppression itself which was part of my relentless drive not to fail and which has, in fact, helped me achieve a level of success that has enabled me to be part of this list. ""I hope that any success achieved will help other women close the gap on the gender imbalance in business."" Woman's Hour publishes its Power List annually, focusing on a different theme each time. As well as Daheley and Dotiwala, this year's panel included novelist Jessica Duchen, record producer Catherine Marks and musician Kate Nash.

"Pret taking risks, say allergy sufferers","Amelia Zekavica was hospitalised after eating a Pret sandwich Allergy sufferers hospitalised after eating Pret a Manger sandwiches have demanded change to the company's labelling. The coroner leading an inquest into the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse has alsodescribed the allergy labelling at Pret as ""inadequate"". Ms Ednan-Laperouse, 15, who was allergic to sesame seeds, died after eating a baguette from the food chain after being ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the pack, the coroner found. One allergy sufferer, who says she was hospitalised in 2017 after eating an unlabelled sandwich, said the company was ""taking unnecessary risks"". ""Other vendors have labels. Why wouldn't they?"" she said. Pret a Manger chief executive Clive Schlee promised ""meaningful change"" in the wake of the coroner's findings. Pret inquest: Labelling 'inadequate' in baguette death Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette allergy death? Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after suffering an allergic reaction Beatrice, whose real identity the BBC has agreed not to disclose, was in hospital for 12 hours when she suffered an allergic reaction after eating a cheese sandwich from Pret. Like Ms Ednan-Laperouse, she is allergic to sesame seeds. ""Unbeknown to me [the sandwich] contained sesame seeds,"" she told the BBC. ""They weren't visible or labelled."" She was at work when she felt the reaction coming on. ""I took anti-histamines and went straight to hospital. I told staff there I would go into anaphylactic shock in 10 minutes,"" she said. ""It was the worst I've ever had. I was held upside down, put on oxygen and had more shots than I've ever had in my life."" After posting a photo from her hospital bed detailing the incident on social media, Beatrice was contacted by the company's ""apologetic"" managing director. She told him: ""You need to stick labels on your food before you kill someone."" The executive offered her a voucher, she says, but Beatrice was more interested in the labelling. ""I didn't do it to get money. I wanted to see a change,"" she told the BBC. She was told that a pilot was coming up in December 2017 or early 2018, in which stickers would be added to all packaging. ""They're taking unnecessary risks. It's not a viable business model when your company ends up in the media when someone eats your sandwich and dies."" Amelia Zekavica, a law student aged 20, is allergic to nuts, pulses, sesame seeds and ""almost anything furry"" she told the BBC. She described how when she was 18 years old, she fell ill within five minutes of eating a Chicken Caesar sandwich from Pret. ""I was quite scared. It's so terrifying when you have these kinds of allergies. It's like your own body is just killing itself."" Her mother made her vomit and gave her some anti-histamine tablets to get the swelling down from her lips and throat. At home, Amelia rested while her mother called the store to ask about the ingredients. Her father Milan recalled what happened next: ""Pret were no help whatsoever. They told my wife everything was online. ""We went on their website and found there was sesame in the Caesar dressing but this was not indicated on the packaging or in store."" Amelia became progressively unwell and spent four hours in A&E. ""Luckily she shook it off,"" said Milan. This is not the first time Amelia has had a bad allergic reaction. ""I'm always very careful. Each reaction is different and they can get progressively worse. ""When my mum and dad told me about the girl who'd died, it really struck a chord. The food industry should understand that there are people out there who have allergies. ""People can die. This is not stressed enough. Celiac awareness is stressed a lot - it's also bad but they don't die from it. ""The food industry needs to list all of the ingredients on the packaging. You shouldn't have to check online or ask for an ingredients book. Everything should be labelled."" A spokesperson for Pret a Manger said: ""We are very sorry for Amelia's experience and we would like to invite her and her family to get back in touch so we can give them the apology they deserve."" Mr Schlee, who joined Pret as CEO in 2003, said the company was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"". ""We cannot begin to comprehend the pain the family have felt and the grief they will continue to feel. ""We've listened to everything the coroner and Natasha's family have said this week and we will learn from it. ""All of us at Pret want meaningful change to come from this tragedy. We will ensure it does.""

Strictly's Joe Sugg had 'joke act' worries,"Joe Sugg admits he was worried that he was this year's Strictly Come Dancing's novelty act. ""I was thefourth person to be announced,"" he tells Newsbeat during rehearsals. ""I remember thinking they were going to announce the joke act of the year at some point. ""It got to the end and there wasn't one so I thought maybe it was me."" Last yearhe said it was ""smart""for YouTubers to ""explore different avenues"" away from the online world.

""Obviously I'm going to get criticised, and I'm used to that,"" he says. ""I get criticised on a daily basis for just how I live my life which is a lot more personal than me trying to learn a new skill, but I'm going to take it on the chin.

Joe says his main aim is getting past week three as that's how far his partner Dianne Buswell got last year It's the first time Strictly has featured a vlogger  but it's clear TV networks are starting to use them more and more in order to attract younger audiences.

Council boss jailed for Grenfell fraud,"Jenny McDonagh stole the money while working in finance for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the health service A fraudster who stole tens of thousands of pounds from the NHS and a Grenfell Tower victim fund has been jailed for five-and-a-half years. Jenny McDonagh stole cash while working in finance for the health service and Kensington and Chelsea council. She holidayed in Dubai and Los Angeles and funded a casino trip using Â£62,000 meant for the fire's survivors. McDonagh, 39,previously pleaded guiltyto fraud, theft and concealing criminal property charges. Sentencing her at Isleworth Crown Court on Friday, Judge Robin Johnson told her: ""You knew exactly what these funds were for and the importance of them for the residents. ""The scale of your dishonesty in this fraud beggars belief."" McDonagh, who stole the money over a 10-month period, spent Â£32,000 of it on gambling, racking up around Â£16,000 in losses. Trips to Paris and Iceland were bought with pre-paid credit cards, as well as purchases in high street shops. Prosecuting barrister Benjamin Holt said on Thursday that the money was spent on ""frivolous items, for example Â£48 at Ann Summers"". After she was arrested on 1 August she continued to use another remaining credit card to spend more money â¢Â£534 on various visits to a hair and beauty salon in Sidcup â¢Â£199.69 on a booking for two at the Delaunay restaurant in central London â¢Â£185 on a pair of Ralph Lauren glasses from Vision Express â¢Â£113.63 at the Hippodrome casino in Leicester Square â¢Â£109.91 at a Burger and Lobster restaurant â¢Â£100 at The Bottle House Inn in Kent â¢Â£99 on a green dress from Hobbs â¢Â£74.99 on food from Selfridges â¢Â£55 on shoes from ECCO â¢Â£48 at an Anne Summers shop â¢Â£26.20 on a taxi â¢Â£19.20 on the Thames Clipper â¢Â£8.90 at Cineworld â¢A handbag from John Lewis â¢Flights to Paris, Reykjavik, Los Angeles and Dubai - one occasion she listed a holiday as a two-week respite break for a genuine victim â¢Â£333.60 loaded on to an Oyster card but not used On Thursday, one of her victims Edward Daffarn, a survivor of the fire, told the court about the impact of the fraud on his community. He said: ""It is like pouring salt on wounds of bereaved residents."" McDonagh, from Abbey Wood, was hired by the west London council in October 2017 to assist with the distribution of money to survivors of the fire, which was meant to be spent by them on accommodation and other essential items. She took money using pre-paid credit cards intended for five victims of the fire. The card in Mr Daffarn's name was topped up 17 times and more than Â£50,000 passed through the account.

"India women can enter prominent templeThe Sabarimala Hindu temple traditionally barred women of a ""menstruating age"" from entering.India","Sabarimala authorities say they don't want women to ""distract"" the temple deity India's Supreme Court has said women can no longer be barred from entering the Sabarimala temple, considered to be one of the holiest for Hindus. The temple in Kerala barred women of a ""menstruating age"" - defined as between the ages of 10 and 50 - from entering. Menstruating women are not allowed to participate in religious rituals or enter temples, as they are considered ""unclean"" in Hinduism. The ruling came after a petition argued the custom violated gender equality. While most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple is unusual in that it is one of a few temples that does not allow women in the broad age group to enter at all. Millions of devotees visit Sabarimala every year. In the judgment Chief Justice Dipak Misra said that ""religion is for one dignity and identity"", adding that ""the right to practise religion is available to both men and women"". Enough is enough: India women fight to enter temples Sabarimala temple: India court questions women entry ban The impending retirement of Justice Misra has seen a flurry of historic liberal rulings from the court in recent days, including the striking down of colonial-era laws that criminalised adultery and gay sex. Justice Misra, who will retire on Tuesday, was heading a five-judge bench which gave a 4-1 verdict. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and many temples impose restrictions on women's entry The BBC's Soutik Biswas says such a stream of judgements leading up to a judge's retirement in the top court is not unusual. ""But what it also underlines is that the 25 judges of the court are some of the most overworked in the world - one study found that a single Supreme Court judge, during his tenure over four to six years, hears some 6,000 cases alone,"" our correspondent adds. Adultery no longer a crime in India Historic India ruling legalises gay sex Indu Malhotra, the only woman judge on the bench, dissented with the majority verdict. ""Issues of deep religious sentiments should not be ordinarily interfered by the court... Notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion,"" she said in her dissenting opinion. Analysis by Geeta Pandey, BBC News For centuries, temples and shrines have cited tradition to keep women out and their managements, dominated mostly by patriarchal men, have used menstruation to keep female devotees away. But in recent years, they have faced an unprecedented challenge from women's groups. Friday's order, which accepts womens' right to worship at Sabarimala, is expected to help remove some of the stigma associated with periods. The order has not come as a surprise - Chief Justice Dipak Misra had previously questioned the validity of the practice, saying that since God does not discriminate between genders, who are we to do that? Also, in the past two years, courts have unlocked the gates of Shani Shingnapur temple and Haji Ali mosque for women. Three years ago, the Sabarimala temple chief said he would allow women to enter the shrine only after a scanner was invented to detect if they were ""pure""- meaning they weren't menstruating. Today, the judges have told him that we won't be needing that scanner anymore. The state government of Kerala had opposed the entry of women when the case was first taken up in 2016. However it changed its stance in a recent hearing to support the petitioners instead. At a hearing in July, petitioners argued that this custom violated equality guaranteed under India's constitution. They added that it was prejudiced against women and their right to worship. But supporters of the ban argued that the practice had been in effect for centuries, and there was no need to change it now. The campaign to repeal the ban on women entering the temple gathered momentum in 2016 after a protest by female students. #HappyToBleed campaign received a lot of responses, especially from young urban Indian women One of the protesters also started a #HappyToBleed campaign on Facebook against ""sexist attitudes"", which received support from different parts of the country. Nikita Azad, who started the campaign, told the BBC this is a historic judgement. ""It will have a large impact since the Supreme Court has destigmatised menstruation and upheld equality over religion,"" she said. This is the third religious site in India where women have gained the right to enter through judicial intervention. Courts directed authorities of the Hindu temple Shani Shingapur and the Muslim Haji Ali shrine, both in the western state of Maharashtra, to allow women inside. Sabarimala is one of the most prominent Hindu temples in the country. Millions of devotees from all over the world visit the temple to seek blessings. To enter the temple, pilgrims have to climb 18 holy steps. According to the temple's website, the act of crossing these 18 steps is so sacred that no pilgrim can climb them without undertaking a rigorous 41-day fast. Devotees are also supposed to follow specific rituals before they enter the shrine. Some of them include pilgrims wearing only black or blue and not being allowed to shave until the completion of their pilgrimage. As part of the ritual, they also smear sandalwood paste on their foreheads. The Sabarimala temple is considered to be one of the holiest for Hindus Why are Indian women 'Happy to Bleed'?

Music website offers dementia lifeline,"Music's ability to soothe the symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer's has been known for years. Now, a new BBC website aims to help by connecting dementia patients with the songs they love. Eventually, it's hoped the site will build a database of music that's effective at triggering memories. ""Music can have such a powerful effect,"" said Snow Patrol star Gary Lightbody, whose father suffers from dementia. ""It fires all sorts of things in the brain much more immediately than anything else can, whether it be pictures or old home movies or conversations. ""Music can somehow take you to a place of your youth, or an important part of your life you may not otherwise have access to."" Beyond that,music therapy has been shown to alleviate depression,external, anxiety, hallucinations and mobility problems in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's. This video can not be played How music therapy can help the brain Yet research shows only 5% of care homes in the UK provide good quality music programmes. That equates to ""30 seconds per week per person with dementia"", according to research from the International Longevity Centre. That's one of the reasons why the charity Playlist for Life has collaborated with the BBC onthe Music Memories website,external. The site - which launched on Friday as part ofBBC Music Day- allows people to browse more than 1,800 songs, classical works and TV theme tunes from the last 100 years, creating a playlist of personally meaningful music. Those playlists can then be shared - along with some basic information about the user's age, gender and place of birth - allowing carers to identify songs that could help others with a similar background. TV themes, such as The Wombles, can have just as powerful an effect on memory as hit songs ""The example we often give is that there's a famous Scottish lullaby calledAlly Bally Bee,external,"" said Sarah Metcalfe from Playlist for Life. ""Most people in Glasgow have it on their playlist because it takes them back to their mum singing to them and feeling safe and loved. ""But if you're Glaswegian and you end up in a care home in Reading, the chances are nobody knows Ally Bally Bee. They've never even heard of it. ""And if we can begin to connect up what people like in different parts of the country, we can actually begin to help reach people."" Other BBC Music Day highlights Kylie Minogue's railway announcementsare being played at major stations around the UK, while Amy Macdonald has performed at Glasgow Central station and Blossoms played at Manchester Piccadilly Jarvis Cocker and Happy Mondays star Bez took part in a special edition ofBargain Hunt on BBC One Radio 4's Woman's Hourhas announced its Women in Music Power List The Wombats will customise one of their hits for pre-schoolerson CBBC at 17:00, while George Ezra will read a bedtime storyon the channel at 18:50 Live coverage of the day's events A psychological phenomenon known as the ""memory bump"" means the music we hear between the ages of 10 and 30, when we become independent, carries more emotional resonance than any other. ""So if you've got a relative with dementia, even if they can't communicate with you any more, you can think back to when they would have been 10 to 30 years old, and use that as a key to unlock the kinds of music they might really enjoy, and it might have a lot of benefits for them,"" said Sally Bowell from the International Longevity Centre. ""The science checks out,"" Lightbody told the BBC. ""The songs of my dad's youth would be from the '50s, and when something comes on from that period he perks up a hell of a lot. ""You put on some Frank Sinatra and he loves it."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The benefits of music therapy in addressing dementia are still being explored, but there have already been some powerful results. At the Lillyburn Care Home near Glasgow, a music programme designed by Playlist For Life has led to a 60% reduction in the use of anti-psychotic medication. The number of people living with dementia in the UK expected to rise to 1.1 million by 2025. ""Music therapy is addressing some of the toughest questions about how we, as a health service and as a care system, are going to look after people with this horrible condition,"" Metcalfe told the BBC. ""The national dementia strategy has a priority of trying to reduce the use of anti-psychotics, and this is a really practical alternative. ""It's not going to work in every situation. But we see, time and again, it's a way of reaching somebody before you need to resort to using really powerful medication.""

Adam Price wins Plaid leadership contest,"This video can not be played Adam Price: ""We've got to fire up the national imagination"" Adam Price has won the Plaid Cymru leadership contest, taking nearly 50 per cent of the vote. The assembly member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr defeated Rhun ap Iorwerth and former leader Leanne Wood in a ballot of party members. Despite leading the party for six years, Ms Wood came last. In his victory address at the Novotel in Cardiff, Mr Price said: ""This election shows we are ready to lead again. Our time has come."" He told party members: ""Our message must be simple. Yes, Wales can."" The AM is the first openly gay assembly party leader in the history of the institution and leads the third largest group in the Senedd, behind Labour and the Tories. Who is Adam Price? Two challenge Wood for Plaid leadership Plaid's pivotal moment All change for Welsh party leaders? Mr Price, who has vowed to put independence at the core of his party's message, said: ""There will be no second class travellers on our journey to a prosperous, self-confident and independent Wales."" ""We must become the hope of those without hope."" Mr Price paid tribute to former leader Leanne Wood. ""She has inspired thousands with her drive, her resilience and her unending commitment to the causes that she and we hold dear,"" he said. Former leader Leanne Wood, who took the helm of Plaid Cymru in 2012, came third The leadership election began in the summer after Ynys Mon AM Mr ap Iorwerth and Mr Price challenged Ms Wood for her job. The Rhondda AM, who became leader in 2012, left the count in Cardiff declining to give interviews. She later tweeted her congratulations to Mr Price. Following the result Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Now it's about coming together under the new leadership of Adam Price to take forward that joint vision that we have of a new Wales, a new more confident Wales, out to the public and build towards the next assembly election."" Adam Price took 49.7% of first preference votes (2,863), while Rhun ap Iorwerth took 28% (1,613) and Leanne Wood 22.3% (1,286). After no candidate reached 50%, Ms Wood was knocked out and a second count began with the second preference votes of her supporters redistributed. This gave Mr Price 618 more votes and Mr ap Iorwerth 348. In the final totals, Mr Price beat Mr ap Iorwerth by 3,481 votes to 1,961. By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor It's a bit of a shock to be honest. Not because of who won - Adam Price was widely expected to take this - but because of the way the incumbent Leanne Wood lost. It's a strange one, because she always polls as one of the most popular politicians in Wales. She has UK recognition factor after taking part in general election TV debates, and yet somehow she has struggled to convert that popularity into widespread electoral success for Plaid Cymru. Adam Price, a former MP, is perhaps best known for his attempt to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war in 2004. Now in the assembly, he's a charismatic speaker, a big campaigner and a man of big ideas. The pressure on him now will be to deliver on them. Leader of the Conservative group in the assembly, Paul Davies, was one of the first to congratulate Mr Price on his victory, and said he looked forward to working with him in Cardiff Bay. ""I hope that Adam realises that Plaid members have now signalled a new direction. This is a clear instruction to end Welsh Labour rule and that they should no longer prop them up,"" Mr Davies said. During the campaign candidates were questioned over whether they would work with the Conservatives in government. Leanne Wood said Mr Price and Rhun ap Iorwerth would ""quite possibly"" strike a deal with the Conservatives, butMr Price rejected the idea of a coalition with the party. Adam Price told BBC Radio Cymru he did not want to enter a coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour. ""No to both unionist parties. Both have let the people of Wales down,"" he said. Following the result Plaid Cymru's official Twitter account posted a video montage of Mr Price with dramatic music. It was deleted after the video was widely mocked on the social media network. Adam Price is the first openly gay assembly leader Born in Carmarthen to a miner's family in 1968. Educated at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman and Cardiff University Served as MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr from 2001 to 2010 Awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study at Harvard University during his break from politics Elected to the Welsh Assembly in 2016 Welsh Labour leadership contest underway 'Independence best path out of poverty' Plaid Cymru MPs call for change in leader Plaid nuclear accord must change - Wood Two challenge Wood for Plaid leadership Plaid's pivotal moment Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Bez rule break causes Bargain Hunt reshoot,"This video can not be played The rule break was only discovered after filming had finished A special edition of Bargain Hunt featuring Happy Mondays and Pulp had to be reshot after one of them was found to have broken the rules. The two bands went head to head on the show as part ofBBC Music Dayon Friday. But the rule break was only discovered after filming had finished which meant that the end of the show needed to be recorded again. What happened wasaired at 12:15 BST on BBC One. The show saw Pulp front man Jarvis Cocker and the band's keyboard player Candida Doyle go up against Happy Mondays rockers Bez and Rowetta to find hidden gems at an antiques fair in Kent. And despite all appearing to go well while filming, trouble soon emerged. The show's rule book does not allow family and friends to take part in the auctions but Bez's girlfriend bid and won his team's two auction items, a mirror and a music turntable, securing them an Â£8 profit which was enough to give them victory. Despite losing Â£95 on their auction items, Cocker's team was given the win when the infringement came to light. Bez, who handed back the Â£8 profit, said: ""It was a genuine error. My girlfriend thought she was helping out."" Lady Gaga gets overwhelmed at Oscars buzz What you should never say to a comedian Happy Mondays' Bez and Rowetta Idah went up against Pulp's Candida Doyle and Jarvis Cocker The show's executive producer Paul Tucker, whose production team is based in Cardiff, said: ""We have rules and regulations on Bargain Hunt and we have to make sure they abide by them. ""It was picked up by a runner and we verified there were clearly misdemeanours going on. ""It was a genuine rule that was broken and we had to reshoot the end."" Mr Tucker added: ""They are rock and rollers and they live on the edge as they did in the 80s. ""It's not a surprise but in the end it was quite amusing.""

BeyoncÃ© named music's most powerful woman,"The star was celebrated for her activism, feminism, business acumen and empowering lyrics She says she's a ""black Bill Gates in the making"" who ""ain't never seen a ceiling in my whole damn life"". So it's hardly surprising that BeyoncÃ© has been named music's most powerful woman by BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. The superstar came first in a list of the industry's 40 most influential women, thanks to her feminism, activism and empowering musical messages. Taylor Swift, Adele and Dua Lipa were also included on the power list, which was unveiled as part ofBBC Music Day. This video can not be played Why the judges chose the top 10 The top 40 didn't just recognise big-sellers and global stars, making room for the unsung heroes who work behind the scenes to champion women. Third place went to Vanessa Reed who, as CEO of the PRS Foundation, has persuaded more than 100 festivals to sign up to a 50:50 gender balance on their line-ups by 2022. The top 10 also includes Marin Alsop, who became the first female conductor to lead the Last Night of the Proms in 2013, and Chi-chi Nwanoku, who founded Europe's first professional majority black and minority ethnic orchestra, Chineke! Gender diversity in the music industry is notoriously poor, especially in technical jobs like engineering and production. And even with artists like Cardi B, Adele and Dua Lipa devouring the charts, recent research shows that men account for 78% of hit singles. Woman's Hour said it hoped publishing the power list would lead to better representation. ""It's a celebration of 40 incredible women but hopefully it doesn't stop there,"" said broadcaster Tina Daheley, who led the panel of judges. ""A lot of the people on the list are coming on to the programme, and I think that's where the conversation will start."" BeyoncÃ© Taylor Swift Vanessa Reed (PRS Foundation) Adele Stacey Tang (MD of RCA Records) Gillian Moore (Director of music at Southbank Centre) Rebecca Allen (President of Decca Records) Marin Alsop Chi-chi Nwanoku Maggie Crowe (Director of events at BPI) Read the full list on the Woman's Hour site 'How we're breaking barriers for women in music' Daheley said the top 40 was whittled down from a longlist of 100 names, with judges looking for women ""who've had an impact over the last 12 months"". BeyoncÃ© ""absolutely deserves to be number one"", she added. ""She's one of those people who's absolutely in charge of her own destiny and she's using that platform in a way that makes a difference: empowering black people in America, addressing injustice head-on and championing women. ""It's not just the lyrics and activism in her music which, you could cynically say, sells music,"" she continues. ""She puts her money where her mouth is and she's contributed to Black Lives Matter and the people affected by Hurricane Katrina."" Taylor Swift persuaded Apple to reverse a policy that said artists would not get paid for music streamed by users taking advantage of a three-month trial period Taylor Swift was praised by the panel for standing up to streaming companies like Apple and Spotify over royalties, and forsuccessfully winning a sexual assault case against a US ex-radio DJ, over an incident in 2013. ""When I see young girls and how she empowers them to be strong women, I see how much she's influenced them and her impact on these girls who will be the activists of the future,"" said judge Jasmine Dotiwala, a music TV producer and columnist. Daheley was also keen to highlight figures like Fiona Stewart who, at the age of 18, was a single mum living in homeless shelters - but now runs the Green Man Festival. ""Her story's incredible - but it's also her attitude to music festivals. She refuses corporate sponsorship and she won't have a VIP area. She's very impressive. She's lower down the list, but still being celebrated."" The list also includes Sarah Stennett, the CEO of First Access Entertainment, which manages Rita Ora, Ray BLK and Bebe Rexha The list also includes Rebecca Allen, president of Decca Records, Chi-chi Nwanoku of the Chineke orchestra, and Grace Ladoja, founder of Metallic Inc and Skepta's manager ""I never thought consciously of my gender as something that limited me in any way until this year,"" Stennett told BBC News. ""I was just too busy trying to push forward and survive in the cut-throat environment of the male-dominated entertainment business. ""It took an essay my daughter wrote on the effects women face from subconscious patriarchal oppression for me to finally stop and realise that it was that oppression itself which was part of my relentless drive not to fail and which has, in fact, helped me achieve a level of success that has enabled me to be part of this list. ""I hope that any success achieved will help other women close the gap on the gender imbalance in business."" Woman's Hour publishes its Power List annually, focusing on a different theme each time. As well as Daheley and Dotiwala, this year's panel included novelist Jessica Duchen, record producer Catherine Marks and musician Kate Nash.

Disabled train users app 'life-changing',"Paralympian Wafula-Strike has campaigned for better accessibility for disabled people on trains A ""life-changing"" app that can track disabled rail users in real-time will be rolled out nationwide. The app will update station staff on where a passenger is at any point, useful in the event of a delay, change of platform or missed train. Four rail companies are using an early version, with the full one to be available across Britain next autumn. Paralympian Anne Wafula-Strike said the app would ""empower disabled people to travel without any fear"". Currently when passengers with mobility problems book assistance, a print-out is given to station staff in the morning. This video can not be played Emily Yates trialled the app when it was still being developed in December But when a change occurs there is no way to update the paper list, which can lead to staff being in the wrong place and causing some passengers requiring help to go without assistance at all. The app, developed by Transreport for the railway industry, will allow users to create a profile, amend and cancel bookings and give staff live information to accommodate short-notice changes. The app will allow passengers to book assistance and change their arrangements Mrs Wafula-Strike, from Essex, who won compensation after wetting herself on a train when the disabled toilet was not working, called the app ""true inclusion"". She said: ""Although passenger assistance usually works, I've had awful experiences when it has failed, so it's great to see the rail industry addressing this and planning to change and improve for the benefit of disabled people."" Sarah Ward has been using a trial of the app since May Disabled comedian Tanyalee Davis, from Norfolk, previously said she was ""harassed and humiliated"" for using a disabled space for her mobility scooter and called for an app of a similar type to be implemented. She said: ""We'll have more flexibility and spontaneity, but most importantly it'll help ease our anxiety because we can keep in contact in real-time with the people who are assisting us. ""If it works well, it will be life-changing."" Second train mishap for disabled comic Disabled doctor 'stranded' on train 'No room' for Paralympic champion on train Sarah Ward, from Shrewsbury, has been using a trial of the app since May and said it allowed her to be ""much more flexible"" with her travel. Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the railway, added: ""We want everyone who has requested assistance to get the help they need, which is why we're investing in this pioneering technology that has the needs of our customers at its heart."" Comedian Tanyalee Davis has previously described problems disabled rail users can face Alan Benson, chairman of Transport for All, said he was ""pleased"" the rail industry was improving the service it offered to disabled passengers. He added: ""Our team still hears regularly from disabled people sharing stories of rail passenger assistance going wrong. ""This app, as part of a wider overall passenger assist, can really improve the journey experience of disabled and older passengers."" West Midlands Railway, London Northwestern Railway, Greater Anglia, and South Western Railway are currently trialling different parts of the app before the full roll-out across England, Wales and Scotland.

""In truth and in fact Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,"" it said. The SEC statement said that, according to Mr Musk, he calculated the $420 price per share based on a 20% premium over that day's closing share price because he thought 20% was a ""standard premium"" when taking companies private transactions. This calculation resulted in a price of $419, and Mr Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number's significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend, the Canadian indie singer Grimes, ""would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price"". The 7 August tweets took even people within the company by surprise. ""Was this text legit?"" the firm's head of investor relations wrote to Mr Musk's chief of staff, the complaint says. Tesla shares soared after Mr Musk's announcement, before retreating amid questions and doubts. Weeks later, Mr Musk backed away from the plan, citing investor feedback. The SEC, which is also seeking financial penalties, said his claims created ""significant confusion"" in the stock market and harmed investors. This video can not be played Tesla's Elon Musk 'mislead investors' SEC alleges ""Taking care to provide truthful and accurate information is among a CEO's most critical obligations,"" said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division. ""That standard applies with equal force when the communications are made via social media or another non-traditional form."" The SEC complaint sent shares of the firm down by more than 10% in after-hours trade. Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco: Whatever the state of mind Elon Musk was in when he announced he had ""funding secured"", it could end up costing almost everything he holds dear. It would be nobody's fault but his own. Wall Street veterans - and indeed, anyone with a modicum of knowledge of how the financial markets work - predicted this very scenario the moment those tweets were posted. Mr Musk is famously an unconventional chief executive, but when it comes to the financial markets, you can't flout the rules without serious consequences. It's clear, from emails contained in the SEC's filing, that staff at Tesla were caught completely off guard. His head of investor relations asked if the tweets were ""legit"". The Nasdaq, confused, halted trading. It all makes Mr Musk unfit to run a public company, the SEC says. All this because of a tweet sent because Mr Musk thought his girlfriend ""would find it funny"". Mr Musk is credited with pushing the car industry toward electric vehicles Mr Musk, who co-founded Tesla and has served as chief executive since 2008, is a divisive figure in the business world, who has inspired passionate fans and critics. Supporters credit Mr Musk, also the head of the rocket company SpaceX, with pushing the car industry to produce electric cars. Elon Musk unveils first tourist for SpaceX 'Moon loop' Elon Musk sued for libel by British Thai cave rescuer But his critics - including many who have made investments predicting the firm's stock will fall - argue that Tesla has consistently lost money and struggled to increase its output, repeatedly missing its own targets. The financial pressure facing Tesla has mounted this year, as it boosts spending to increase production of its newest car. In recent months, Mr Musk's own behaviour has also been in the spotlight. In July, he drew widespread criticism after accusing a British cave diver involved in the rescue of Thai teenagers from a flooded cave of being a child abuser. The diver later filed a defamation suit. He also drew attention after an emotional interview with the New York Times, in which he said he worked ""120-hour weeks"" and took sedatives. And earlier this month, he smoked marijuana live on the web during a podcast with comedian Joe Rogan.

Moment of reckoning for US women,"Christine Blasey Ford swears in at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 27, 2018 Even beforeChristine Blasey Ford accusedSupreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nomination was said to be about women. Appointing Mr Kavanaugh would tip the court's balance in favour of Republicans. This sparked real fear amongst progressive women thatlandmark Roe v Wade decision,externalthat granted the right to abortion could be overturned. In 2016 the potential for the first majority conservative line-up on the court in decades brought reluctant Trump voters to the ballot box. Once Mr Kavanaugh denied Ms Ford's allegations, the hearings became a test of how far the Me Too movement has changed America. The BBC spoke to women before and after the extraordinary hearing to find out whether this is really about women's rights. Did listening to Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh change their minds about who and what to believe? Already suspicious of Mr Kavanaugh's social values, progressive women's opposition escalated when sexual assault claims emerged. Julia Peters, 33, has been attending protests in Washington DC for a week. ""This isn't someone we can elect out. He will be in there for a lifetime, and we know he doesn't stand for our values,"" she said at Capitol Hill before the hearings began. Julia Peters, 33, travelled from New York City to protest in Washington Grace Perret, a college junior, is from New Orleans, Louisiana,one of the four US states with a ""trigger law"",externalthat mean abortion would be banned automatically if Roe v Wade was overturned. ""This would have devastating implications for poor women especially, who likely cannot afford to travel"" to other states to seek abortions, she explained. The promise ""we believe women"" is core for Julia: ""We are here to let Christine Blasey Ford know we believe her."" Key takeaways from the hearing #BelieveWomen v #BackBrett Why US top court is so much more political than UK's How new US Supreme Court could impact abortion laws There is anger at how quickly some on the right dismissed Dr Ford's allegations, which have caused great distress to her family. ""The attempts by so many on the right to paint this as a co-ordinated political smear campaign is incredibly damaging to the anti-rape culture movement and to survivors everywhere,"" commented Ms Perret. But conservative women are deeply concerned about what they see as an abuse of the confirmation process. Rachel Gill, 22, went to Capitol Hill on Thursday to show her support for Mr Kavanaugh because she believes in the ""principle of innocent until proven guilty"". ""I absolutely do support women who have come forward to talk about these experiences, but I also think there needs to be proof if you're going to take someone to court. Rachel Gill, 22, recently graduated and is worried about debasement of the process of confirming a Supreme Court justice ""I'm here because I want to hear the truth, and if there is any truth to these accusations,"" she explained. Talk of a smear campaign against Mr Kavanaugh is common as some conservative women fear the assault allegations are being weaponised by Democrats who want to prevent Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation. Nancy Wilson, a grandmother of 11, travelled to Washington from Fairfax County, Virginia, with two friends. Wearing ""I Stand With Brett"" T-shirts, they explained they believe women are being misused. They want Mr Kavanaugh on the court because he's a ""constitutionalist judge"". ""The process is being abused. It's become a circus. Sex should not be inserted into politics like this. Someone came along at the 11th hour with an accusation about something that happened 35 years ago,"" Nancy explained. On Thursday the world finally heard from Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh, in tearful testimonies that took strikingly different tones. #KavanaughHearings trended all day on social media, prompting survivors of sexual violence to tell their own stories, includinga 76-year-old woman who called the TV network C-Span about her experience of rape,external. Lucy Melchor (left) watched the hearings after rally for Christine Blasey Ford on Capitol Hill After protesting outside the Senate, Chicago-born Lucy Melchor, 36, watched the hearings. ""I thought Ms Ford's testimony was heartbreaking and compelling. It just reinforced that I believe her,"" she said. ""When asked who committed the assault, she replied without skipping a beat. And I thought, she is there under oath, with her family life having been destroyed. What has she got to gain from this? Her motive seemed pure and clear."" In contrast, she felt Mr Kavanaugh's testimony turned the attention away from a woman's claims of sexual assault to his anger about the political process. ""I was really upset by the level of vitriol that he brought to this. It took the focus away from her and put it on politics. That was so difficult to see,"" she said. But where progressives found Ms Ford powerfully believable, conservative women felt exactly the same about Mr Kavanaugh. Ann Trible (left), Nancy Wilson (centre), and Kay Lucien (right) travelled from Virginia to show their support for Brett Kavanaugh ""I think they both believe what they are saying. I believe that Ms Ford probably was assaulted but not by Mr Kavanaugh. My heart really does go out to Dr Ford,"" Rachel Gill explained. Kay Lucien, one of the grandmothers who joined rallies on Capitol Hill, called Mr Kavanaugh's comments ""compelling"" and ""passionate."" Like the judge, Mrs Lucien has a strong religious faith. ""I found it so moving that Mr Kavanaugh's child would offer to pray for a woman who has brought so much pain to her family,"" she explained after the hearing. While she feels sympathy for Dr Ford, she says her confidence in Mr Kavanaugh's suitability for the court increased. ""I would be pleased if the balance of the Supreme Court court changed in favour of conservatives - we've seen our country slide in the other direction and we would like to move it back a little bit. ""I would worry less about losing some rights, such as religious rights and gun rights and a lot of things that seem to be attacked constantly in recent years,"" she added. The hearings are also a moment of reckoning for women's rights in America. Democrat Ms Melchor commented, ""It's now almost a year since the Me Too movement, and if the cards fall onto the side of not believing her story, it's really detrimental for the women who have been assaulted and will be assaulted in the future. It creates fear for them that they won't be believed in the future and that's what upset them the most.""

Derek Hatton rejoins Labour,"Mr Hatton was refused entry to the party three years ago Derek Hatton has applied to rejoin the Labour Party, 33 years after being expelled by then-leader Neil Kinnock. The 70-year-old former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, was booted out for belonging to Militant Tendency. During a bitter war with both Margaret Thatcher's government and the Labour leadership, he set an illegal budget and sent redundancy notices out by taxi to thousands of council workers. The Labour Party looks likely to accept the application. A source said any objection by the local party must be based on the rules and not on the basis of ""we don't like him"". Mr Hatton said he had no plans to run for public office and was inspired by Jeremy Corbyn's leadership to reapply for membership. He told the BBC it was too early to say how he might take part in the party but added: ""I will attend meetings."" Announcing his return in the Liverpool Echo,external, he said he spent much of the last 33 years at odds with the Labour leadership, particular at Tony Blair's decision to invade Iraq. However, he said he had remained committed to the party throughout the period and that the recent Labour conference had prompted him to rejoin. Derek Hatton was expelled in 1986 He wrote: ""In all my time I have never witnessed such passion, such energy and such powerful socialist leadership. And strangely that power is despite a kinder, gentler form of politics. ""Many people, myself included, probably never thought we would witness an unswerving socialist like Jeremy Corbyn at the helm,"" he said. But his return to the party fold has received a mixed reaction from Liverpool Labour councillors. Clare McIntyre,,externalwho represents Wavertree ward, described the period when Mr Hatton in power as ""awful"". ButJoann Kushner,external, who represents Croxteth said he was ""welcome"" and part of the city's ""phenomenal political history"". Mr Hatton hinted two years ago in a BBC interview that Mr Corbyn's leadership might tempt him back. Over the years the former firefighter has been a property developer, broadcaster and after-dinner speaker. The party hadrejected his application to joinin 2015. The Militant Tendency, which emerged from a Trotskyite group called the Revolutionary Socialist League, held key positions in the Liverpool Labour Party as it battled the Conservative Thatcher government in the 1980s. Its slogan ""It's better to break the law than break the poor"" led to the council setting a budget in 1985 which exceeded its income by Â£30m and led to political turmoil in the city. The slogan was cited by Labour frontbencher Dawn Butler this week on the eve of the party conference in Liverpool.

Head teachers to march on Downing Street,"""Relentlessly reasonable"" is an unusual rally cry - but this was no ordinary demonstration. Hundreds of head teachers - the men in smart suits, the women in business wear - came to Westminster to make their point about school funding in England. Ripples of applause filled Parliament Square - their meeting point and the scene of many a demonstration over the decades. ""Don't be chaining yourselves to the railings now ladies,"" someone joked. It was clear that these protesters, passionate though they may be, would not have dreamt of it. The gathering had more of an air of a collegiate conference than a demonstration. ""We're all a long way out of our comfort zone,"" one head teacher said. ""We asked each other on the bus if anyone had ever been to a protest before and nobody had,"" another added a little sheepishly. The participants may have felt cheerful, and maybe little awkward, but the mood was nonetheless serious. One head teacher from Suffolk told how she had been bitten by a pupil this week. ""It wasn't his fault. It was because of a situation outside of school, and his emotional support had been cut two weeks earlier because of the cuts."" She could not give her name in case the pupil was identified, but she added: ""We have children who are distressed and angry and we can't help them."" Another Suffolk head teacher, Kelly Head from Springfield Infants School, said: ""It's head teachers here protesting because there's no one left. ""We are using people left, right and centre to cover all sorts of jobs in schools. There's no one left."" The organisers of this grassroots protest highlightInstitute of Fiscal Studies' claim that per pupil funding has fallen 8% in real terms since 2010. Their budgets have been squeezed by unfunded pay rises, national insurance payments, other cost pressures and rising pupil numbers. Others point to problems with England's new funding formula, which had been introduced to even out the amount which different local authorities receive per pupil. Tony Markham, head teacher of Herne Junior School in Petersfield, Hampshire, told how his budget will be Â£250,000 in deficit by 2020-21. The county has one of the lowest per pupil funding rates in the country, despite the new formula. Ella Palmer, head of a school in Alton, Hampshire, said her school had been using money from its capital budget to fund laptops. But these were now 14 years old, and the capital funding had been cut from Â£25,000 to Â£5,000 a year. Another Hampshire head, Joe Ayres, said: ""There just isn't enough money to do what we need to do."" Ms Head added: ""It's heart-breaking because the decisions we are beginning to have to make are about reducing social care and mental health support."" The government insists school funds will rise to a record Â£43.5bn by 2020 and that a new funding formula is bringing bring more cash to schools. National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) leader Paul Whiteman said head teachers were not really ""the marching type"" and if they were protesting, something must be ""seriously wrong"". This is the latest push in a campaign by school leaders to highlight the dangers of budget shortfalls and the different funding levels between schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has recognised that funding is one of the biggest concerns in his brief. A Department for Education spokesman said: ""There is more money going into schools than ever before, rising to a record Â£43.5bn by 2020 - 50% more in real terms per pupil than in 2000. ""Every school attracts more funding per pupil through the National Funding Formula, high needs funding has risen to over Â£6bn this year, and the 3.5% pay rise we announced for classroom teachers on the main pay range is backed by Â£508m government funding. ""We know that we are asking schools to do more, which is why we are helping them to reduce the Â£10bn spent each year on non-staffing costs, providing government-backed deals for things like printers and energy suppliers that are helping to save millions of pounds."" But Stockport head teacher, Jim Nicholson, said he was fed up with hearing this government line. ""We have seen how our colleagues are having to lay off staff and our vulnerable pupils are not getting support. ""We'd all rather be back in school teaching. But we've had enough,"" he added. The head teachers taking part in the protest are from areas including: Blackpool â¢ Bolton â¢ Brighton and Hove â¢ Buckinghamshire â¢ Cambridgeshire â¢ Cheshire â¢ Cornwall â¢ Cumbria â¢ Derbyshire â¢ Devon â¢ Dorset â¢ Dudley, West Midlands â¢ East Sussex â¢ Essex â¢ Gloucestershire â¢ Greenwich â¢ Hampshire â¢ Hertfordshire â¢ Kent â¢ Kingston-upon-Thames â¢ Lancashire â¢ Liverpool â¢ London â¢ Norfolk â¢ Northampton â¢ Oxfordshire â¢ Peterborough â¢ Poole â¢ Portsmouth â¢ Richmond â¢ Rotherham â¢ Sheffield â¢ Slough â¢ Solihull, West Midlands â¢ Somerset â¢ Southend â¢ Southampton â¢ Staffordshire â¢ Suffolk â¢ Surrey â¢ Thurrock â¢ Walsall â¢ Warrington â¢ West Berkshire â¢ West Sussex â¢ Wigan â¢ Wiltshire â¢ Wokingham, Berkshire â¢ Wolverhampton â¢ Worcestershire The school with 300 holes in the roof Is social mobility really about school cash?

TSB and HSBC banks hit by computer glitch,"TSB says its systems are almost back to normal after some customers were unable to access online accounts. Earlier, HSBC was also hit by problems with its mobile banking app, but now says all operations are back online. TSB said: ""We're sorry for any issues our customers experienced. These services are now recovering back to normal levels."" It is the latest in a string of IT outages for the industry, including the recent high-profile meltdown at TSB. TSB said users of its smartphone app and internet banking had been having difficulty logging in since about 07:40 on Friday. About the same time, HSBC said about 50% of mobile users were having trouble connecting to its app. TSB said: ""Our cards, branch and telephone services continue to operate as normal"". An HSBC spokesman said: ""An earlier issue where some customers were unable to log on to the HSBC mobile banking app has been resolved and users of the app should be able to log on as usual. ""We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue, and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused."" Last week, RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank reported problems with customers unable to access their bank accounts online. Customers were locked out for about five hours. Earlier this year, TSB's huge IT meltdown led to weeks of pain for customers and the eventualresignation of chief executive Paul Pester. TSB customers, many still recovering from the previous outages, were quick to vent their anger on Twitter. ""Well done @TSB on having yet another issue with online banking. Top service,"" said one frustrated customer. Said another: ""So sick of the shocking online banking service currently being provided. Yet again can not access my money.""

Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe,"The accusation that loyal customers are being ""ripped off"" for mobile, broadband, savings, home insurance and mortgage deals is to be investigated by the competition body. It follows a super-complaint from Citizens Advice, which says customers who stick with their supplier are losing a total of Â£4.1bn a year. That amounts to an average of Â£877 per person, the charity said. It added that elderly and vulnerable people are disproportionately affected. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it would now ""carefully consider the concerns"" that Citizens Advice had raised. At the same time the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) hasannounced,externalthat it will investigate whether loyal customers are paying too much for home and car insurance. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""It's completely unacceptable that consumers are still being ripped off for being loyal to companies they rely on every single day. ""As a result of this super-complaint, the CMA should come up with concrete measures to end this systematic scam."" The charity said that while the new price cap in the energy market would cut bills for loyal customers by Â£75 on average, its analysis found ""excessive prices for loyal customers can be just as high - if not more so - in other markets"". Citizens Advice said problems had been detected in five particular areas: savings accounts mortgages household insurance mobile phone contracts broadband contracts It said it knew of a couple in their nineties who were paying Â£1,000 a year too much for their home insurance. They had been with the same company for six years. Banking industry group UK Finance said it would ""carefully consider the issues raised by Citizens Advice"". Eric Leenders, managing director of personal finance for the body said: ""We would always encourage customers to shop around and find a deal that best suits their needs and we will continue working with the regulators to make this as easy as possible, including through standard terms and price comparison tools."" Loyal customers pay Â£75 extra for insurance Insurers promise action for loyal customers Earlier this week, thetelecoms regulator Ofcom announced actionto stop loyal customers paying too much for their mobile phone contracts. The insurance industry says three out of four people do shop around The insurance industry has also promised to make changes, after admitting that long-standing customers sometimes pay more than new ones. It wants all insurance firms to look at customers who have been with them for more than five years. ""In a competitive free market, where three out of four people shop around, there is no easy fix available, and these measures will take time to bed in,"" said Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers. Announcing its own study into the insurance market, the FCA said it had already been concerned about the issue for some time. ""We expect firms to look after the interests of all customers and treat them fairly, whether they are new or long-standing,"" said Andrew Bailiey, the FCA's chief executive. ""It is important to get the balance right, so that existing customers do not miss out on the benefits of competition and innovation, including when they purchase or renew their general insurance products."" This is only the fourth super-complaint that Citizens Advice has made since 2002, when the legislation came in. The CMA now has 90 days to come up with ideas for dealing with the issue. Possible outcomes could involve new laws, enforcement by regulators, or a full market investigation. ""Our response will set out the CMA's views on this important issue and any next steps we think are needed to make sure businesses don't take unfair advantage of their long-standing customers,"" said Daniel Gordon, senior director at the CMA.

"Disabled train users app 'life-changing'A Paralympian says the app will ""empower disabled people to travel without any fear"".England","Paralympian Wafula-Strike has campaigned for better accessibility for disabled people on trains A ""life-changing"" app that can track disabled rail users in real-time will be rolled out nationwide. The app will update station staff on where a passenger is at any point, useful in the event of a delay, change of platform or missed train. Four rail companies are using an early version, with the full one to be available across Britain next autumn. Paralympian Anne Wafula-Strike said the app would ""empower disabled people to travel without any fear"". Currently when passengers with mobility problems book assistance, a print-out is given to station staff in the morning. This video can not be played Emily Yates trialled the app when it was still being developed in December But when a change occurs there is no way to update the paper list, which can lead to staff being in the wrong place and causing some passengers requiring help to go without assistance at all. The app, developed by Transreport for the railway industry, will allow users to create a profile, amend and cancel bookings and give staff live information to accommodate short-notice changes. The app will allow passengers to book assistance and change their arrangements Mrs Wafula-Strike, from Essex, who won compensation after wetting herself on a train when the disabled toilet was not working, called the app ""true inclusion"". She said: ""Although passenger assistance usually works, I've had awful experiences when it has failed, so it's great to see the rail industry addressing this and planning to change and improve for the benefit of disabled people."" Sarah Ward has been using a trial of the app since May Disabled comedian Tanyalee Davis, from Norfolk, previously said she was ""harassed and humiliated"" for using a disabled space for her mobility scooter and called for an app of a similar type to be implemented. She said: ""We'll have more flexibility and spontaneity, but most importantly it'll help ease our anxiety because we can keep in contact in real-time with the people who are assisting us. ""If it works well, it will be life-changing."" Second train mishap for disabled comic Disabled doctor 'stranded' on train 'No room' for Paralympic champion on train Sarah Ward, from Shrewsbury, has been using a trial of the app since May and said it allowed her to be ""much more flexible"" with her travel. Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the railway, added: ""We want everyone who has requested assistance to get the help they need, which is why we're investing in this pioneering technology that has the needs of our customers at its heart."" Comedian Tanyalee Davis has previously described problems disabled rail users can face Alan Benson, chairman of Transport for All, said he was ""pleased"" the rail industry was improving the service it offered to disabled passengers. He added: ""Our team still hears regularly from disabled people sharing stories of rail passenger assistance going wrong. ""This app, as part of a wider overall passenger assist, can really improve the journey experience of disabled and older passengers."" West Midlands Railway, London Northwestern Railway, Greater Anglia, and South Western Railway are currently trialling different parts of the app before the full roll-out across England, Wales and Scotland.

Bez and Pulp force Bargain Hunt reshoot,"This video can not be played The rule break was only discovered after filming had finished A special edition of Bargain Hunt featuring Happy Mondays and Pulp had to be reshot after one of them was found to have broken the rules. The two bands went head to head on the show as part ofBBC Music Dayon Friday. But the rule break was only discovered after filming had finished which meant that the end of the show needed to be recorded again. What happened wasaired at 12:15 BST on BBC One. The show saw Pulp front man Jarvis Cocker and the band's keyboard player Candida Doyle go up against Happy Mondays rockers Bez and Rowetta to find hidden gems at an antiques fair in Kent. And despite all appearing to go well while filming, trouble soon emerged. The show's rule book does not allow family and friends to take part in the auctions but Bez's girlfriend bid and won his team's two auction items, a mirror and a music turntable, securing them an Â£8 profit which was enough to give them victory. Despite losing Â£95 on their auction items, Cocker's team was given the win when the infringement came to light. Bez, who handed back the Â£8 profit, said: ""It was a genuine error. My girlfriend thought she was helping out."" Lady Gaga gets overwhelmed at Oscars buzz What you should never say to a comedian Happy Mondays' Bez and Rowetta Idah went up against Pulp's Candida Doyle and Jarvis Cocker The show's executive producer Paul Tucker, whose production team is based in Cardiff, said: ""We have rules and regulations on Bargain Hunt and we have to make sure they abide by them. ""It was picked up by a runner and we verified there were clearly misdemeanours going on. ""It was a genuine rule that was broken and we had to reshoot the end."" Mr Tucker added: ""They are rock and rollers and they live on the edge as they did in the 80s. ""It's not a surprise but in the end it was quite amusing.""

Call to listen out for Tawny owl's 'twit-twoo',"The Tawny owl is recognised by its classic twit-twoo call Bird lovers are being urged to give up 20 minutes every week to listen out for the ""twit-twoo"" call of the Tawny owl, amid concerns over its numbers. The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) is asking people to listen for the distinctive hoot from their garden, a local park or woodland, once every week for the next six months. ""You can even do it from the comfort of your bed,"" said BTO's Claire Boothby. Light pollution and urbanisation are thought to be impacting populations. The conservation status of the Tawny owl recently changed from green to amber, signalling a growing concern for the species. Researchers hope theTawny Owl Calling survey,external, which runs from 30 September to 31 March, will help them understand if, and where, the bird may be in decline. They say it is not essential that members of the public listen every single week, insisting that all data will be useful - even in locations where an owl call cannot be heard as this indicates where the species is missing. ""Anyone can take part, and the more people that do, the better picture scientists at BTO will have of our Tawny owl,"" Ms Boothby said. The Tawny owl is typically found in mixed woodland, but also large urban parks and even suburban gardens. The nocturnal bird usually remains in the same territory and maintains a monogamous relationship. The twit-twoo motif isa combination of the female call, described as a ""kewick"" sound, and the male's response- a long, wavering hoot. There are currently thought to be about 50,000 breeding pairs in the UK.

Placenta complications 'need earlier diagnosis',"Amanda Holden (left) and Kim Kardashian both experienced placenta complications while pregnant Expectant mothers should be told that the risk of placenta complications rises after a caesarean or fertility treatment, according to top doctors. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)guidelines,externalsaid early diagnosis of conditions placenta praevia and placenta accreta was vital. They added doctors should discuss with women the safest way to give birth. The conditions can lead to heavy bleeding and sometimes put mother and baby's lives at risk. TV personality Kim Kardashian developed placenta accreta when pregnant with her daughter North West. TV presenter Amanda Holden suffered from the rare placenta praevia-accreta when expecting her youngest daughter Hollie. Placenta praevia happens when the placenta attaches in the lower part of the uterus (womb), sometimes completely covering the cervix (neck of the womb). Placenta accreta is a rare but serious condition when the placenta is stuck to the muscle of the womb and/or to nearby structures such as the bladder. Both conditions can cause heavy bleeding, particularly towards the end of the pregnancy, because the placenta is low down in the uterus. This can sometimes require blood transfusions and lead to the loss of the uterus. Birth trauma: Women urged to 'raise your voices' 'Women spend more time planning holiday than pregnancy' The RCOG has producedan online leaflet with information,externalfor women who may develop or have these conditions. It says the rates of placenta praevia and placenta accreta have increased and are likely to continue to increase as a result of rising rates of caesarean births and the use of assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF. This is because potential scars in the uterus created by caesareans and fertility treatment mean any subsequent pregnancies are more likely to implant in the scar, causing problems with the placenta. The highest rates of complication for both mother and baby occur when these placenta complications are only diagnosed at delivery, the RCOG said. And it encouraged more scans and specialised care to help reduce any risks. Prof Eric Jauniaux, lead author of the guidelines, said: ""We hope this updated guidance will support healthcare professionals during discussions with women and their partners who may be considering assisted reproduction, particularly IVF, or an elective caesarean birth. ""These are both risk factors that can increase risk of developing these serious complications of the placenta."" Prof Jauniaux, professor of obstetric and foetal medicine at University College London, said the guidelines should also help doctors to diagnose the complications early and discuss the safest way for women to give birth. Dr Geeta Kumar, chair of the RCOG patient information committee, said: ""It is important for women to be aware of these complications of the placenta, but they should be reassured that these are very rare and specialist care is available. ""Early diagnosis is key to reduce harms associated with placenta praevia and accreta to ensure the safest possible outcome for mother and baby."" The placenta develops together with the baby in the uterus during pregnancy. It attaches to the wall of the uterus and provides a connection between mother and baby. Oxygen and nutrients pass from the woman's blood through the placenta and into the baby's blood. The placenta is delivered shortly after a baby is born, and is sometimes called the afterbirth. It is more common if a woman has had previous caesareans, fertility treatment or if they smoke. If you have placenta praevia, your baby will probably need to be born by caesarean. One in 200 women have the condition at the end of their pregnancy. It is a complication which affects between one in 300 and one in 2,000 pregnancies. This is more common if a woman has previously had a caesarean. It may cause heavy bleeding at the time of birth. Vasa praevia is a very rare condition affecting between one in 1,200 and one in 5,000 pregnancies. It is where blood vessels travelling from your baby to your placenta, unprotected by placental tissue or the umbilical cord, pass near to the cervix. If these blood vessels tear, this can be very dangerous for your baby.

Strikes force Ryanair to cancel 250 flights,"Tens of thousands of Ryanair passengers across Europe are suffering disruption as strikes cancel 250 flights. Unions claim this is the biggest day of action yet against a series of complaints about conditions by Ryanair workers in a raft of countries. Ryanair say 35,000 passengers have been affected. But it added 90% of flights would operate as normal. Some 20 flights to and from Ryanair's biggest European hub, Stansted, have been cancelled. The travel editor of the Independent, Simon Calder, said these were mostly to and from Germany. He also said eight Manchester services - to and from Barcelona, Berlin, Faro and Malaga - have been grounded, as well as flights from Birmingham to Lanzarote and East Midlands to Malaga. Ryanair said the action was taking place in six of its 37 markets and that most of its 400,000 passengers would not be affected. It called the action ""regrettable and unjustified"" and apologised to customers. Action had been planned across a range of countries by pilots and cabin crew earlier this week. On Thursday, this was boosted by German pilots, who said they would join those in the Netherlands and Belgium by taking action. Cabin crews in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain have also stopped work. Unions want staff to be given contracts in the countries where they live, rather than under Irish law. They say employing staff under Irish law inconveniences workers and affects their ability to access social security benefits. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has called the strikes ""unnecessary"" Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the company had written to unions offering to move all staff to local contracts, which made the strike action ""unnecessary"". However, the Dutch pilots union said it had only verbally offered its members local contracts and had refused to put the offer in writing. Joost Van Doesburg, of the VNV union, said his members also wanted pensions in line with Dutch standards, and firmer guarantees on sick pay. The German pilots' union said it could not rule out further strikes. Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent Meet with Michael O'Leary and beyond the bullish facade, this multi-faceted dispute is more complex and potentially damaging than he is willing to let on. The roots of today's row stretch back to autumn last year when Ryanair 400,000 Ryanair passengers had their flights cancelled. The airline did not have enough pilots to honour its schedule. It was in Mr O'Leary's words ""a mess of our own making"". The subsequent decision to start recognising pilot and cabin crew unions around Europe was a multinational can-of-worms. Some deals with some unions in some countries have been done. But overall there is plenty to resolve and incendiary language, on both sides, is the flavour of the day. Ryanair this week signed deals with cabin crew unions in Italy to provide employment contracts under Italian law and agreed to arbitration with the union representing its German pilots. The European Commission said Ryanair employees should have contracts in the countries where they live rather than in Ireland, where its planes are registered. Watchdog calls on Ryanair to compensate customers One in six flights cancelled as pilots walk out EU social affairs commissioner Marianne Thyssen told Mr O'Leary at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that EU rules on employment of air crews were based on where workers left in the morning and returned in the evening - and not where aircraft were registered. ""Respecting EU law is not something over which workers should have to negotiate, nor is it something which can be done differently from country to country,"" Ms Thyssen said. ""The internal market is not a jungle - it has clear rules on fair labour mobility and worker protection. This is not an academic debate, but about concrete social rights of workers."" Stranded Ryanair passengers queue for hotel vouchers and new tickets Passengers whose flights have been cancelled were contacted by email and text message on Tuesday to advise them of their options. ""We sincerely apologise to those customers affected by these unnecessary strikes on Friday which we have done our utmost to avoid,"" Ryanair said. It hasrejected calls by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority to compensate passengerswhose flights have been cancelled, claiming they were caused by ""competitor airline crew, unions and lobby groups"" and were therefore ""extraordinary circumstances"". However, Coby Benson, a lawyer specialising in flight delay compensation at Bott and Co, said Ryanair's arguments did not comply with the precedent set in April by a case in Germany. Last month, Ryanair pilots across Europe staged a co-ordinated 24-hour strike to push their demands for better pay and conditions, plunging tens of thousands of passengers into transport chaos at the height of the summer holiday season. In July, strikes by cockpit and cabin crew disrupted 600 flights in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, affecting 100,000 travellers. Another indication of the company's rethink on contracts came on Thursday when it announced two new bases in France. They will be the first in the country since it closed Marseille in early 2011 after being sued for employing French workers on Irish contracts. It will also open another base at Bordeaux for summer 2019 and had another four under consideration. Two aircraft will be based at both Marseille and Bordeaux and will offer a total of 64 routes and handle 3.5 million passengers a year.

Home remedies 'no deterrent' against slugs,"Slugs can be unwelcome guests Home remedies used to deter slugs and snails from prized plants appear to have no scientific basis. Using the likes of grit or egg shells to guard against slug attack did not reduce damage to lettuces in trials. Five popular methods were tested over the summer by the Royal Horticultural Society. Entomologist and lead researcher Dr Hayley Jones said gardeners could be wasting their time and money on home remedies for slug control. ""I'm not ruling them out yet, but it's not looking good,"" she said. ""There's still no evidence that they work."" The study showed copper tape, sharp grit, pine bark, wool pellets or egg shells did not ward off slugs and snails. There are more than 40 types of slug in the UK However, a layer of wool pellets or pine bark had benefits as a fertiliser and mulch, yielding a bigger crop. And planting lettuces in pots rather than on the ground reduced slug damage, but also yield. What's the advice? It's thought sprinkling sharp grit and egg shells on plants as a barrier to deter slugs is ineffective, because the gastropods are covered in thick mucus, which acts as a protective shield. Dr Jones said she was not surprised that home remedies appear ineffective, given that there are lots of slug species, with different biological properties. ""With the likes of egg shells, barks and mulch so far proving no discernable deterrent to slugs and snails we would suggest proven formulas like nematode biological control if the damage is just too much to bear,"" she said. Egg shells and copper tape did not ward off slugs and snails Slugs and snails belong to a group called gastropods There are more than 40 species of slug currently found in the UK, with only a small number of these considered pests Not all slugs feed on vegetation; some eat fungi and a small number are carnivorous, feeding on the likes of earthworms Slugs are preyed upon by the likes of hedgehogs, birds and toads Symptoms of slug or snail attack include holes in leaves, stems, flowers and potato tubers; while seedlings can be killed They can cause damage throughout the year, but seedlings and new growth on herbaceous plants in spring are most at risk. Deroceras reticulatum - aka the grey garden slug Commercially available microscopic nematodes watered into the soil can infect slugs with bacteria that kill them. Non-chemical methods suggested by theRHS,externalinclude going out in the evening to hand-pick slugs then release them away from gardens. One home remedy that has yet to be tested is beer. Some have advocated putting out a saucer of beer to tempt slugs to an early end. The RHS plans to test the effectiveness of beer traps in the future. What did the experiment show? More than 100 lettuce plants were grown in pots and raised beds for six weeks. They were examined weekly for signs of damage and, at the end of the experiment, all the lettuces were harvested, weighed, and examined for signs of damage. Scientific trials at the RHS research facility in Wisley, Surrey Lettuces planted in the ground were found to be more susceptible to slug attack, with 5.7% eaten on average compared with 0.2% of those in pots. The home remedies had no benefits in terms of the amount of slug and snail damage. However, when the lettuces were dried and weighed, a layer of wool pellets or pine bark yielded a 50% bigger crop. The two main gastropods identified in the experiment were the grey field slug and the common garden snail. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Trump nominee vows he'll never give up,"The first vote by a Senate committee is due over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. It follows Thursday's testimony by Mr Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault. Dr Ford, close to tears, described the alleged 1982 attack in detail, saying it had ""drastically"" affected her life. Judge Kavanaugh angrily denied he had assaulted her or anyone. President Donald Trump has urged the full Senate to approve his nominee. LIVE: Committee to vote on Kavanaugh Key takeaways from a dramatic hearing Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor That vote is expected next week. Republicans currently have a majority of 51-49 in the Senate, but a number of senators on both sides are said to be undecided. Judge Kavanaugh's appointment would tilt the balance in favour of conservatives for years to come. For this reason, Republicans accuse the Democrats of seeking to delay the confirmation until after the mid-term elections in November when they hope to win enough seats to stop it altogether. Democrats counter by accusing Republicans of trying to ""railroad"" the process. Why US top court is so much more political than UK's The Supreme Court plays a vital role in US political life - appointed for life, its nine members have the final say on US law. This includes highly contentious social issues, such as abortion, and challenges to government policy. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who was believed to be wavering, issued a statement shortly before the committee began sitting on Friday morning stating that he would back Judge Kavanaugh. This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake is challenged by a sexual assault survivor On his way to the committee room following the release of the statement, he was berated by two women who said they were victims of sexual violence and urged him to change his mind. As the committee began, the bitter political divide was clear as an attempt by Democrats to call a further witness - Mark Judge, who Dr Ford said was present during the alleged sexual assault - was defeated by the 11 Republicans voting against the 10 Democrats. A subsequent motion to move to a vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination was passed despite vocal Democratic objections. Some Democratic senators refused to vote on that and walked out of the hearing. In a letter after Thursday's hearing,Robert Carlson, head of the American Bar Association - the body representing US lawyers and students of law - urged a delay of the vote,externalto enable the FBI to check the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. The association had previously supported Judge Kavanaugh for the role.

She alleged he and his friend Mark Judge had locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in a Washington DC suburb in the summer of 1982, when she was 15 and Judge Kavanaugh was 17. Dr Ford said Brett Kavanaugh had tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her. Both men were ""drunkenly laughing"", she said. She added: ""Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details."" Under questioning by a Democratic senator, she said her most vivid memory was ""the laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense... They were laughing with each other - two friends having a really good time with one another"". In an answer to a question from another Democrat about claims of mistaken identity, Dr Ford said she was ""100%"" certain that Judge Kavanaugh had assaulted her.

He admitted he had drunk beer while at high school, but said he had never got so drunk as to forget events. He added that his calendars for 1982 - which he had kept - showed he had not attended a party at the location Prof Ford had described.

Italy's populists agree new budget,"""We did it!"" - Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio celebrates as the government pushes through a budget backing his reform plans Italy's populist government has come to an agreement over spending as it tries to ""end poverty"" with its first budget. The ruling Five Star and League parties said late on Thursday that they had agreed to set the budget deficit at 2.4% of GDP. They will press ahead with a minimum income for the unemployed. The decision defies Brussels' demand for Italy to rein in its debt. It is also a defeat for technocrat economy minister Giovanni Tria, who was pushing for lower spending. Mr Tria had sought to limit the budget deficit to below 2% of GDP, to avoid adding to Italy's â¬2.3tn ($2.7tn; Â£2tn) debt. But his political colleagues were determined to free up more money to fulfil election promises, which include a basic income, tax cuts and scrapping planned higher retirement ages. Amid reports that Italy's president had urged Mr Tria not to resign, the budget decision prompted strong criticism from EU Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. The overnight news hit Italian borrowing costs - with the yield on 10-year government bonds rising above 3%. Meanwhile, the Milan stock exchange fell more than 2% on Friday morning, with several banks seeing a decline of at least 5%. All eyes were on the ""spread"" - the gap between Italian and German bond yields - which was at its widest for three weeks. The budget decision is well short of the EU's deficit limit of 3% of GDP. But Italy, the third-biggest economy in the eurozone, had promised to cut its debt decisively. The debt stands at 131% of national output, second only to Greece. Before the populist parties came to power this year, the centre-left government was aiming for a 0.8% budget deficit with a view to balancing its books by 2020. By appointing a technocrat as finance minister, the League and Five Star had sought to reassure both the financial markets and Brussels. The 2.4% budget deficit is set for 2019 and the following two years as well. The budget will have to be submitted to the European Commission by mid-October. Mr Moscovici said the European Commission had ""no interest"" in triggering a crisis with Italy but added: ""We don't have any interest either in Italy flouting the rules and not reducing its debt, which remains explosive"". Servicing such a large debt meant that every euro spent on it was ""one euro less on roads, one euro less on education and one euro less on social justice"". League leader Matteo Salvini has questioned why Italy should be shackled by European limits, hampering what he sees as vital reform projects. Italy populists take power: What comes next? What exactly is populism? They swept to power pledging a series of tax cuts, new social welfare policies and better pensions - all expensive programmes. A minimum basic income for the unemployed is set to cost â¬10bn alone. A lone voice? Italy's economy minister is at odds with his government on how much there is to spend ""We, in a decisive manner, with this budget law, will have abolished poverty,"" Luigi Di Maio, deputy prime minister and leader of the Five Star party, said ahead of Thursday's crunch meeting. The plans must be approved by the parliament in October. Luigi Di Maio, left, and Matteo Salvini, far right, brought their parties to power Amongthe ambitious plans at election timewere: A guaranteed basic income for poor families of about â¬780 a month Tax reform for rates of just 15% and 20%, down from 23%-43%, which could cost up to â¬50bn Abolishing plans to raise retirement age over several years, and setting minimum pensions Mr Tria, who has to implement the budget, is an independent economist. He was appointed as part of the complicated negotiations to form the government (in which the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is also an independent). He believes the debt ratio should be far below the EU 3% limit - initially proposing just 1.6%, which would have somewhat crippled the government's big spending plans.

"Blade 'found in Sainsbury's Lego cards'Mother ""disgusted"" as her three-year-old child finds a knife blade in his pack.Kent","The blade Kirsty Thorne says her son found in the Lego card pack A mother has told the BBC of her ""absolute disgust"" at discovering the blade of a knife in a pack of children's Lego cards from Sainsbury's. Kirsty Thorne, from Kent, was shocked when her three-year-old son showed her the blade he found when the pack was opened. Lego cards are a range of collectable cards available from the supermarket chain. Sainsbury's says it appears to be an ""isolated and unusual incident"". Ms Thorne had hoped to treat her sons by buying them a couple of Lego book albums and card packs while on her visit to her local Sainsbury's in Ashurst, Kent. ""It didn't look like it had been tampered with so when I got home I just put the card packs on the table,"" Ms Thorne told the BBC. ""They were all playing at the table going through the cards and that's when my son brought it to my attention. ""It looked like the blade had been placed in the pack before it was sealed. It was the perfect size to fit in that packet."" Ms Thorne was relieved her children had escaped without injury. ""My youngest had been opening the packs in his mouth,"" she explained. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said, ""We are aware of an issue with a pack of Lego cards. This appears to be an isolated and unusual incident which we are investigating with our supplier.""

Russia warned over chemical weapon use,"The two suspects told Russia's RT they were tourists who wanted to see the cathedral spire The UK has warned Russia that it will pay a ""high price"" if it continues to use chemical weapons following the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that it was not acceptable ""to instruct military intelligence officers to use chemical weapons on British soil"". Mr Hunt told the BBC that, after nuclear weapons, there was ""nothing more horrible than chemical ones"". Russia denies the poisoning in March. In the nerve agent attack, ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with Novichok in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury. Both Mr Skripal and his daughter survived, but Dawn Sturgess - a local woman not connected to the original attack -died in July after being exposed to the same substance. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: ""There is nothing more horrible, more lethal, more deadly"" Speaking on a visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the foreign secretary said: ""We've had chemical weapons used on the streets of Salisbury and chemical weapons used in Syria under Russian patronage and, for the sake of humanity, we need to make sure that we do not turn the clock back on this. ""That is why it is very important that Russia understands the international community is totally resolved on this and anyone who uses chemical weapons needs to know the price will always be too high."" Last month, UK investigators identified two suspects who had links to Russian's military intelligence service, known as the GRU. The two men appeared on Russia's state-run international broadcaster RT and insisted they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury to see its ""famous cathedral and its 123m spire"". Bellingcat released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) On Wednesday,investigative website Bellingcat,externalreported that one of them was a military officer who served in Chechnya and Ukraine and was made a ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" in 2014. The honour, bestowed on Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga in a secret ceremony, is typically handed out by Russia's president Vladimir Putin. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Hunt said counter-action was being taken against Russian military intelligence. He said it was always going to be possible for a large state like Russia to find a way of issuing fake passports to get such people into Britain but everything possible was being done to prevent abuse of the visa system and visa checks. Addressing world leaders at the UN on Wednesday, Theresa May criticised Russia for its ""desperate fabrication"" over the poisoning. The prime minister accused Russia of ""flagrantly breach[ing] international norms"" citing ""the reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of Britain by agents of the Russian GRU"". What is the GRU? What happened to the Skripals? The website behind the Skripal revelation Russia continues to dismiss and ridicule all suggestions it was involved in the attack and says no investigation in which it is not actively involved will ever be credible or fair. Writing on Facebook, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described the Colonel Chepiga allegations as groundless. Komsomolskaya Pravda,external, a pro-Kremlin tabloid, published an online article listing ""three reasons"" why Chepiga was not involved in the Skripal poisoning, adding that he was not a Russian secret services operative.

Johnson sets out alternative Brexit plan,"Boris Johnson left the government over Mrs May's Chequers plan Boris Johnson has set out his own plan for Brexit, arguing that the UK should ""chuck Chequers"" and negotiate a ""Super Canada"" free trade deal instead. The ex-foreign secretary, who quit over Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan, called her strategy ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"". He said his vision would not lead to a hard Irish border, with any checks carried out away from the crossing. But environment secretary Michael Gove urged the party to unite behind the PM. And ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve, who backs a new referendum on Brexit, told the Evening Standard up to 40 Tory MPs were prepared to vote against any Canada-style deal if Mrs May ultimately opted for it. What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? European Research Group Tories won't back PM's plan BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar said Mr Johnson's 5,000 word article, published two days before the start of the Conservative Party conference, was a reminder that the PM's plan had very little support in the party and it was going to be a difficult week for her in Birmingham. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The two sides are seeking to negotiate the terms of exit, as well as an outline agreement on future cooperation. Parliament is to vote on any withdrawal deal. In anarticle for the Telegraph,externalentitled ""a better plan for Brexit"", Mr Johnson wrote there had been a ""collective failure of government, and a collapse of will by the British establishment, to deliver on the mandate of the people"". Manufacturers say their complex cross-border supply chains are being put at risk He said the Chequers proposals - which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods - represented ""the intellectual error of believing we can be half-in, half-out"" of the EU. UK firms would be exposed to EU regulations that could disadvantage them, and free trade deals would be made more difficult. This, he said, was a ""democratic disaster"" and would ""cheat the electorate"" if implemented. He proposed a looser free trade agreement, ""at least as deep as the one the EU has recently concluded with Canada"". Canada's deal with the EU, signed in 2016, removes the vast majority of customs duties on EU exports to Canada and Canadian exports to the EU. Mr Johnson said a Super Canada deal would involve: ""Zero tariffs and zero quotas"" on all imports and exports Mutual recognition agreements covering UK and EU regulations to ensure ""conformity of goods with each other's standards"" Technological solutions to keep supply chains operating smoothly A deal covering goods as well as services Mr Johnson argued that it should be ""relatively straightforward"" to negotiate membership of the EU's aviation area while there should be a process for recognising each other's rules and regulatory standards and a dispute mechanism system in which neither side's institutions had power over the other. He also said cooperation between the UK and EU would be closer on areas such as security and defence. By BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris Any kind of free trade deal based on the Canada model - super or otherwise - would make the UK more distant economically from the EU. It would be a cleaner break, but it would also create more friction in trade, including border checks where there are currently none. Goods coming from Canada into the EU market can be subject to a variety of checks - to make sure customs declarations are filled in correctly, to check product standards or VAT payments and to ensure the safety of food and animal imports. New technology can help make things run more smoothly, but it's the prospect of the UK having to go through the same processes, for the huge volume of trade done with its European neighbours, which makes many businesses nervous. On the issue of Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said any ""extra procedures"" could be carried out away from the border with Ireland. Conservative Brexiteers welcomed the intervention, saying it was the right way forward for the UK. But No 10 emphasised there would be no withdrawal deal without a legally binding ""backstop"" on Northern Ireland, something it said Mr Johnson accepted when he backed December's stage one agreement. This video can not be played WATCH: Lord Howard backs Canada-style deal And Mr Gove, who worked alongside Mr Johnson in the 2016 Leave campaign, said he continued to believe Mrs May had the right formula for leaving the EU. ""I agree with the prime minister,"" he said. ""I think the prime minister is doing a great job. I think it is really important that we unite as a party."" But Labour said the Conservatives had ""run out of ideas"" and were consumed by ""internal warfare"" while the Lib Dems labelled the article a ""half-baked, sloppy rant"". This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said a Canada-style deal would require billions to be spent on new technology and infrastructure in the UK and the continent, which would take years to bed in. ""As a result, it would put thousands of manufacturing jobs and hundreds of billions of pounds of exports at risk and, at worst, could destroy much of Britain's manufacturing base,"" said its chief executive Stephen Phipson. ""Having been to Canada I know a customs model built around this is naÃ¯ve and unrealistic as a short-term solution."" Mrs May set out her proposals on the key issue of future trade with the EU after a Chequers summit in July. It has been fiercely criticised by some Brexiteers, who say her plans for a ""common rulebook"" on goods would compromise the UK's sovereignty. Up to 40 Tory Brexiteers have said they will oppose her plan if it comes to a vote in Parliament. Mrs May has dismissed previous suggestions that checks could be carried out away from the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, insisting that any system of checks was ""still a hard border"".
