Tugendhat backs Truss in Tory leadership contest,"Liz Truss has been backed by two senior Conservatives in the last 24 hours, including Defence Secretary Ben Wallace Former Tory leadership contender Tom Tugendhat has become the latest senior Conservative to back Liz Truss in the contest. Mr Tugendhat, who was knocked out in fifth place, said the foreign secretary could unite the Conservative Party. Writing in The Times,external, he said Ms Truss's international experience also persuaded him to endorse her. Ms Truss and former chancellor Rishi Sunak are the final candidates in the contest to replace Boris Johnson. Mr Tugendhat's endorsement of Ms Truss, who is now seen as the frontrunner in the contest, follows that of Defence Secretary Ben Wallace on Thursday. Defence Secretary Wallace endorses Truss for PM How the new PM will be picked Who are the Tories that will choose the next PM? Mr Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said he had spent time listening to the candidates' arguments and it was Ms Truss who ""convinced"" him she was ready to become prime minister. He wrote: ""From China to Ukraine, the world around us is getting more challenging and the cost of failure abroad is being felt hard at home. ""Rising fuel prices, pushing families across our country into difficulty, are bringing the pain home. We know we need answers - now. That's where allies come in. As foreign secretary, Liz is starting with a huge advantage. She can make our voice count."" Mr Tugendhat, a senior figure in the One Nation group of centrist Tory MPs, said Ms Truss has ""support from across the party, and the country"". ""We need a leader to unite the Conservative Party. It's clear that Liz can do that."" He also criticised Mr Sunak's tightening of fiscal policy, saying it is ""not right"" that the tax burden should be rising when people are heading into winter with ""dread"". ""I couldn't support the National Insurance rise in September and want to see tax cuts today. I back Liz's plan for the economy, founded on true Conservative principles of low tax, a lean state and bold supply side reform."" Tom Tugendhat was knocked out of the race, placing fifth Meanwhile, Ms Truss has unveiled her plans for housing, including helping renters get mortgages. Ms Truss will pledge that, if she becomes prime minister, she would ensure rent payments are included in mortgage affordability assessments. Government figures estimate,externalover 50% of renters can afford the monthly cost of a mortgage, but only 6% can get access to a typical first-time buyer mortgage. Ms Truss is also promising to scrap the government's target of building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. The target appeared in the Conservative's 2019 manifesto, but plans to hit the figure by forcing councils to accept new housing developments were ditched following a backlash from Tory MPs. Ms Truss says she wants to ""put power back in local councillors' hands who know far better than Whitehall what their communities want"". Earlier, Mr Sunak denied his proposals to tighten fiscal policy would lead to a recession and claimed Ms Truss's planned tax cuts would create a ""sugar rush boom"". The Tory leadership hopeful was grilled on the economy, immigration, and his wife's tax status by veteran political journalist Andrew Neil, with whom Ms Truss has so far declined to sit down. Neil challenged the former chancellor over his plans to tighten fiscal policy at a time when ""the global economy grinds to a halt, as monetary policy has been tightening"", suggesting he would ""ensure a recession"". Mr Sunak said: ""I think it's absolutely the right thing to do to not put fuel on the fire of the inflation problem that we already have. ""What we should do is focus on long-term growth because that's what we need, sustainable growth, not a sugar rush boom that will make us feel better for months, but then it runs out of control, let inflation get set into the system, let the Bank of England have to react with even higher interest rates."" Mr Sunak is set to say that his government would ""safeguard our shared cultural, historical and philosophical heritage"" Separately, Mr Sunak has said he wants to preserve gendered words such as ""woman"" or ""mother"" by clarifying the definition of biological sex in the 2010 Equality Act, and challenge self-identifying gender under this law. Mr Sunak said he also wanted to look at age-appropriate sex and relationships education, so that pupils are ""shielded from inappropriate material"". And he promised to protect free speech by amending the Public Sector Equality Duty, which requires public bodies to consider discrimination. In a speech he will deliver in West Sussex later, Mr Sunak is expected to say his government would ""safeguard our shared cultural, historical and philosophical heritage"".

RFL & RFU ban trans women from female-only categories,"The Rugby Football League and Rugby Football Union have banned transgender women from competing in female-only forms of their games. The RFL's board approved its new policy which will come into effect in August. The RFU's council voted on Friday to pass its new policy for the 2022-23 season, with ""33 in favour, 26 against and two abstaining"". About 30 protestors gathered at the RFU's headquarters at Twickenham Stadium before the vote. The RFL's new ""Gender Participation Policy"" applies to contact rugby league from under-12s and above, while the RFU's guidance is for under-12s and above. There are currently six transgender women playing senior rugby union. The RFU, the governing body of the union code in England,had previously recommended a ban. On Friday, the council passed policy which will ""only permit players in the female category if the sex originally recorded at birth is female"". ""The RFU Council has determined that until such time as new further peer-reviewed science is available, a precautionary approach is appropriate to ensure fair competition and safety of all competitors,"" a statement said. This followsWorld Rugby's stance- which in 2020 became the first international sports federation to say transgender women cannot compete at the elite and international level of the women's game. A group of protestors were at Twickenham on Friday to share their support for the trans community before the vote. The RFU began a two-year review into its current policy in autumn 2020, which included a game-wide survey that received over 11,000 responses, considered scientific evidence and sought guidance from other sporting bodies. ""This science provides the basis of the new gender participation policy that concludes the inclusion of trans people originally recorded male at birth in female contact rugby cannot be balanced against considerations of safety and fairness,"" the RFU said. It added that is had been ""a complex and difficult decision and the policy change was not taken lightly or without thorough and full research and consultation"". RFU president Jeff Blackett said: ""We know that many will be disappointed by this decision, however it has been based on all the scientific evidence available. ""Our game can be strengthened by everyone who is involved; be it in coaching, refereeing, administration or supporting and playing non-contact forms of the game."" The RFU said there were discussions of evaluating a case-by-case system but said: ""In light of the research findings and work of World Rugby and the UK Sports Councils, and given the difficulties in identifying a credible test to assess physiological variables, this is no longer a viable option at this time and does not necessarily ensure inclusion."" The RFU added: ""In the male category, players whose sex recorded at birth is female may play if they provide their written consent and a risk assessment is carried out."" The governing body has also contacted the transgender women players who are registered to play in England ""to offer its support in continuing to encourage them to participate in the sport"". The RFU also said it will be conducting more research: ""RFU is committed to working with World Rugby and UK Sports Councils to ensure further research is conducted and to reviewing the policy on a regular basis."" Listen to The Sports Desk podcast: Sport's transgender conundrum Q&A: Transgender women in sport - key questions answered What do the scientists say? Thegoverning body of English rugby league said,externalonly players who were assigned female at birth can play in a female-only category in contact sport from under-12s and above. This follows the recent ban on ""male-to-female [transwomen] players"" fromwomen's international rugby league. The RFL added there will be another review of its policy carried out ""by November 2024"" and said: ""[We are] committed to providing and supporting opportunities for everyone to be actively involved in the sport. ""However, it is important that the playing opportunities provided are safe and fair for all participants. ""This means that, when determining the eligibility criteria, a precautionary approach needs to be adopted in respect of contact variations of rugby league, so that safety and fairness are considered alongside the principle of inclusion."" There will also be certain eligibility requirements for male categories ""to ensure that transgender people wishing to play male contact rugby league have the appropriate experience and competence to participate safely"". Touch, tag, X-League, learning disability rugby league and wheelchair rugby remain mixed gendered. England and Saracens player Poppy Cleall, who has changed her profile picture to the trans flag,wrote on Twitter,externalreferencing the RFU's decision: ""From one of the most inclusive sports to one of the least in 7 votes."" England World Cup winner Danielle Watermantweeted about the decision:,external""In my opinion this is right for the game at the moment, as it is supported by science/current research on the safety of players. ""You may agree or disagree with my view, but either way, everyone should be entitled to share their opinion without the fear of judgment or hate!"" Mermaids, a charity supporting transgender children and young people,wrote that,externalit was a ""a dark day for rugby"" adding: ""Our thoughts are with all those affected by today's announcements, and who are now facing a future on the sidelines of a sport which should be for everyone."" York RI Ladies Rugby Union team tweeted that the RFU were ""on the wrong side of history"". The Rugby Players Association said it voted in favour of the RFU's policy but ""acknowledges the multitude of views, and emotions, associated with trans participation in rugby, particularly in the women's game"". It added it was ""committed to our current and future obligation to promote the safety of our members, and all players, and the fairness of rugby"" but also ""committed to staying informed on all future research and progress on the subject that may cause re-evaluation of this position"". In June, swimming's world governing body Finavoted to stop transgender athletesfrom competing in women's elite races if they have gone through any part of the process of male puberty. A few weeks later, British Triathlon become the first British sporting body toestablish a new 'open' categoryin which transgender athletes can compete. Cycling's governing body, the UCI, recentlytoughened its ruleson transgender eligibility. In June, UK culture secretary Nadine Dorriesmet with the heads of UK sporting bodiesand told them that ""elite and competitive women's sport must be reserved for people born of the female sex"".

UK Covid cases have peaked and are now dropping,"Covid infections are on the way down in the UK, dropping by more than half a million in a week, according toOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures.,external An estimated 3.2 million people had the virus in the week up to 20 July, compared to 3.8 million the week before. Hospital cases are also decreasing. Admissions in England of people with Covid stood at 16.3 per 100,000 people in the seven days to July 24, down from 18.2 the previous week. There is still lots of Covid around to catch, even though the rates are declining, experts warn. In the latest ONS report, for the week ending 20 July, the estimated Covid rates were: One in 20 in England - down from one in 17 the week before One in 19 in Wales - down from one in 17 One in 16 in Northern Ireland - up from one in 20 (although experts say the trend is uncertain) One in 19 in Scotland - down from one in 15 Many of the recent cases have been caused by fast-spreading sub-variants of Omicron, called BA.4 and BA.5. People are still able to become infected even if they have had Covid before. But vaccines are still doing a good job of helping protect people from getting very sick with the virus. Everyone aged 50 and over in the UK will be offered anotherCovid booster vaccine this autumn. The ONS data is collated by testing thousands of people from UK households - whether  or not they have symptoms - to estimate how much virus is around. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, from the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""We are now seeing decreases in Covid case rates and hospitalisations. Whilst this is encouraging, Covid has not gone away and we really want to see further declines in the coming weeks and months. ""People aged 75 and over remain at particular risk of severe disease if they are not up to date with their vaccinations. ""We urge anyone who is not up to date with their jabs to come forward to give themselves the best possible protection."" Sarah Crofts, from the ONS, said: ""Our most recent data suggest that we may now be over the peak of the latest wave of infections across the UK, although rates still remain among the highest seen during the course of the pandemic. ""We have seen welcome decreases among most parts of the UK and in all age groups. With summer holidays starting and more people travelling, we will continue to closely monitor the data.""

Plastic bag usage down 20% since 10p charge,"Plastic bag usage has decreased significantly in England Single-use plastic bag use in England has fallen by 20% after a 10p charge was brought in last year, the government has said. The price was increased from the 5p charge introduced in 2015. The average person now buys around three single-use carrier bags a year, down from 140 in 2014, government figures say. But environmentalists claim say this is the tip of the iceberg in the plastic problem. Plastic pollution is a huge global challenge with particles found everywhere from human blood to the Arctic. Charges for single-use plastic bags were introduced to discourage unnecessary use. Since 2015, usage has decreased by 97% in England,according to figures,externalfrom Defra, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Most supermarkets now only offer 'bags for life' which are not included in the figures. Environmental charity Greenpeace says the use of these are on the rise. It told BBC News that the figures don't reflect the scale of the problem. Plastic waste rises as 1.5bn 'bags for life' sold, research finds Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Single-use bags and plastic wet wipes face ban in Wales ""When the government congratulates themselves on the single-use plastic bag charge, what they fail to mention is the enormous increase in the purchasing of so-called 'bags for life',"" says Megan Corton Scott, political campaigner for Greenpeace UK. She says Greenpeace research shows that households used almost 57 bags for life in 2019. That adds up to more than 1.5 billion bags for life issued by supermarkets, she says. ""Because these bags for life are thicker and more durable, they have a far greater environmental impact both in production and how they break down, and the shift to bags for life saw supermarkets increase the amount of plastic they use,"" she adds. A studyby the Environment Agency,externalconcluded that plastic bags for life needed to be used at least four times to ensure they contributed less to climate change than the lighter, single-use bags. Campaigners have called for retailers to increase the prices of bags for life as more shoppers now treat them as disposable. The Green Alliance saysthey should be 70p,externaleach. The Co-op supermarket ditched thin polythene bags in favour of compostable carrier bags in April 2021 and called for ajoined-up approach,externalbetween retailers. Flexible plastics such as those that make up bags for life can be recycledat nearly 5,000 retailers,externalacross the UK, mostly in large supermarkets. Globally, packaging is the largest source of plastic waste. In the UK, over 2.2 million tonnes of plastic packaging enter the consumer market each year. Much of this is used in the food sector. A Greenpeace reportlast month suggested,externalthat 83% of plastic waste was from food and drink packaging. Anew tax on plastic packaging,externalwas introduced in the UK in April 2022.

Plastic bag usage down 20% since 10p chargeBut environmentalists say the government must go much further to tackle the plastic problem.Science & Environment,"Plastic bag usage has decreased significantly in England Single-use plastic bag use in England has fallen by 20% after a 10p charge was brought in last year, the government has said. The price was increased from the 5p charge introduced in 2015. The average person now buys around three single-use carrier bags a year, down from 140 in 2014, government figures say. But environmentalists claim say this is the tip of the iceberg in the plastic problem. Plastic pollution is a huge global challenge with particles found everywhere from human blood to the Arctic. Charges for single-use plastic bags were introduced to discourage unnecessary use. Since 2015, usage has decreased by 97% in England,according to figures,externalfrom Defra, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Most supermarkets now only offer 'bags for life' which are not included in the figures. Environmental charity Greenpeace says the use of these are on the rise. It told BBC News that the figures don't reflect the scale of the problem. Plastic waste rises as 1.5bn 'bags for life' sold, research finds Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Single-use bags and plastic wet wipes face ban in Wales ""When the government congratulates themselves on the single-use plastic bag charge, what they fail to mention is the enormous increase in the purchasing of so-called 'bags for life',"" says Megan Corton Scott, political campaigner for Greenpeace UK. She says Greenpeace research shows that households used almost 57 bags for life in 2019. That adds up to more than 1.5 billion bags for life issued by supermarkets, she says. ""Because these bags for life are thicker and more durable, they have a far greater environmental impact both in production and how they break down, and the shift to bags for life saw supermarkets increase the amount of plastic they use,"" she adds. A studyby the Environment Agency,externalconcluded that plastic bags for life needed to be used at least four times to ensure they contributed less to climate change than the lighter, single-use bags. Campaigners have called for retailers to increase the prices of bags for life as more shoppers now treat them as disposable. The Green Alliance saysthey should be 70p,externaleach. The Co-op supermarket ditched thin polythene bags in favour of compostable carrier bags in April 2021 and called for ajoined-up approach,externalbetween retailers. Flexible plastics such as those that make up bags for life can be recycledat nearly 5,000 retailers,externalacross the UK, mostly in large supermarkets. Globally, packaging is the largest source of plastic waste. In the UK, over 2.2 million tonnes of plastic packaging enter the consumer market each year. Much of this is used in the food sector. A Greenpeace reportlast month suggested,externalthat 83% of plastic waste was from food and drink packaging. Anew tax on plastic packaging,externalwas introduced in the UK in April 2022. The government have already banned the plastic microbeads in personal care products and have restricted plastic straws and cotton buds and are looking into banning single use plastic cutlery and plates.

RFL & RFU ban trans women from female-only categoriesThe Rugby Football League (RFL) and Rugby Football Union (RFU) ban transgender women from competing in female-only forms of their games.,"The Rugby Football League and Rugby Football Union have banned transgender women from competing in female-only forms of their games. The RFL's board approved its new policy which will come into effect in August. The RFU's council voted on Friday to pass its new policy for the 2022-23 season, with ""33 in favour, 26 against and two abstaining"". About 30 protestors gathered at the RFU's headquarters at Twickenham Stadium before the vote. The RFL's new ""Gender Participation Policy"" applies to contact rugby league from under-12s and above, while the RFU's guidance is for under-12s and above. There are currently six transgender women playing senior rugby union. The RFU, the governing body of the union code in England,had previously recommended a ban. On Friday, the council passed policy which will ""only permit players in the female category if the sex originally recorded at birth is female"". ""The RFU Council has determined that until such time as new further peer-reviewed science is available, a precautionary approach is appropriate to ensure fair competition and safety of all competitors,"" a statement said. This followsWorld Rugby's stance- which in 2020 became the first international sports federation to say transgender women cannot compete at the elite and international level of the women's game. A group of protestors were at Twickenham on Friday to share their support for the trans community before the vote. The RFU began a two-year review into its current policy in autumn 2020, which included a game-wide survey that received over 11,000 responses, considered scientific evidence and sought guidance from other sporting bodies. ""This science provides the basis of the new gender participation policy that concludes the inclusion of trans people originally recorded male at birth in female contact rugby cannot be balanced against considerations of safety and fairness,"" the RFU said. It added that is had been ""a complex and difficult decision and the policy change was not taken lightly or without thorough and full research and consultation"". RFU president Jeff Blackett said: ""We know that many will be disappointed by this decision, however it has been based on all the scientific evidence available. ""Our game can be strengthened by everyone who is involved; be it in coaching, refereeing, administration or supporting and playing non-contact forms of the game."" The RFU said there were discussions of evaluating a case-by-case system but said: ""In light of the research findings and work of World Rugby and the UK Sports Councils, and given the difficulties in identifying a credible test to assess physiological variables, this is no longer a viable option at this time and does not necessarily ensure inclusion."" The RFU added: ""In the male category, players whose sex recorded at birth is female may play if they provide their written consent and a risk assessment is carried out."" The governing body has also contacted the transgender women players who are registered to play in England ""to offer its support in continuing to encourage them to participate in the sport"". The RFU also said it will be conducting more research: ""RFU is committed to working with World Rugby and UK Sports Councils to ensure further research is conducted and to reviewing the policy on a regular basis."" Listen to The Sports Desk podcast: Sport's transgender conundrum Q&A: Transgender women in sport - key questions answered What do the scientists say? Thegoverning body of English rugby league said,externalonly players who were assigned female at birth can play in a female-only category in contact sport from under-12s and above. This follows the recent ban on ""male-to-female [transwomen] players"" fromwomen's international rugby league. The RFL added there will be another review of its policy carried out ""by November 2024"" and said: ""[We are] committed to providing and supporting opportunities for everyone to be actively involved in the sport. ""However, it is important that the playing opportunities provided are safe and fair for all participants. ""This means that, when determining the eligibility criteria, a precautionary approach needs to be adopted in respect of contact variations of rugby league, so that safety and fairness are considered alongside the principle of inclusion."" There will also be certain eligibility requirements for male categories ""to ensure that transgender people wishing to play male contact rugby league have the appropriate experience and competence to participate safely"". Touch, tag, X-League, learning disability rugby league and wheelchair rugby remain mixed gendered. England and Saracens player Poppy Cleall, who has changed her profile picture to the trans flag,wrote on Twitter,externalreferencing the RFU's decision: ""From one of the most inclusive sports to one of the least in 7 votes."" England World Cup winner Danielle Watermantweeted about the decision:,external""In my opinion this is right for the game at the moment, as it is supported by science/current research on the safety of players. ""You may agree or disagree with my view, but either way, everyone should be entitled to share their opinion without the fear of judgment or hate!"" Mermaids, a charity supporting transgender children and young people,wrote that,externalit was a ""a dark day for rugby"" adding: ""Our thoughts are with all those affected by today's announcements, and who are now facing a future on the sidelines of a sport which should be for everyone."" York RI Ladies Rugby Union team tweeted that the RFU were ""on the wrong side of history"". The Rugby Players Association said it voted in favour of the RFU's policy but ""acknowledges the multitude of views, and emotions, associated with trans participation in rugby, particularly in the women's game"". It added it was ""committed to our current and future obligation to promote the safety of our members, and all players, and the fairness of rugby"" but also ""committed to staying informed on all future research and progress on the subject that may cause re-evaluation of this position"".

Weather forecasters abused over heatwave coverageMeteorologists from the BBC and elsewhere faced abuse as they reported on the UK's record heat.,"BBC forecaster Matt Taylor said: ""The weather is very emotive. It gets people so worked up"" Weather forecasters faced unprecedented levels of trolling during this month's extreme heat in the UK, according to leading figures in the industry. The BBC's team received hundreds of abusive tweets or emails questioning their reports and telling them to ""get a grip"", astemperatures hit 40C. BBC meteorologist Matt Taylor said he had never experienced anything like it in nearly 25 years working in weather. The Royal Meteorological Society condemned the trolling. Most of the abuse seems to have been prompted as links were made between the heatwave and climate change. The UK saw record high temperatures on 19 July, with 40C exceeded for the first time. Dozens of locations saw temperatures above the previous UK record of 38.7C and 15 fire services declared a state of emergency because of a surge in blazes. The Met Office estimated the heatwave had been made 10 times more likely because of climate change. The BBC's Matt Taylor said: ""It's a more abusive tone than I've ever received. I switched off a bit from it all as it became too depressing to read some of the responses."" Fires blaze after UK passes 40C for first time Trains cancelled and delayed after heatwave damage UK sea level rise accelerating - Met Office Met Office and Royal Meteorological Society forecasters were also targeted. Members of the latter body faced ""public ridicule, accusations of lying or suggestions of being blackmailed"", said Royal Meteorological Society chief executive Professor Liz Bentley. ""Anecdotally, abusive comments increase when the message about climate change is intrinsic to the story,"" she said. Met Office lead meteorologist Alex Deakin said ""it's scary in some ways"", adding: ""I find it more frustrating and offensive for my colleagues - some of the great minds in climate science.

Other tweets accused the Met Office and the BBC of spreading ""alarmism"" and ""hysteria"", telling both to ""stop scaremongering"". Hundreds of people have also shared theirexperiences of the 1976 heatwave on social media, with many making the false suggestion that this month's heatwave was ""no different"". The peak temperature in 1976 was 35.9C, more than four degrees lower than the 40.3C recorded on 19 July. Nine out of 10 of the hottest days ever recorded in the UK have been since 1990, according to the Met Office. The hottest day from 1976 ranks as 13th in the list of the hottest UK days on record.

The BBC's team received hundreds of abusive tweets or emails questioning their reports and telling them to ""get a grip"", astemperatures hit 40C. BBC meteorologist Matt Taylor said he had never experienced anything like it in nearly 25 years working in weather. The Royal Meteorological Society condemned the trolling. Most of the abuse seems to have been prompted as links were made between the heatwave and climate change. The UK saw record high temperatures on 19 July, with 40C exceeded for the first time. Dozens of locations saw temperatures above the previous UK record of 38.7C and 15 fire services declared a state of emergency because of a surge in blazes. The Met Office estimated the heatwave had been made 10 times more likely because of climate change. The BBC's Matt Taylor said: ""It's a more abusive tone than I've ever received. I switched off a bit from it all as it became too depressing to read some of the responses."" Fires blaze after UK passes 40C for first time Trains cancelled and delayed after heatwave damage UK sea level rise accelerating - Met Office Met Office and Royal Meteorological Society forecasters were also targeted. Members of the latter body faced ""public ridicule, accusations of lying or suggestions of being blackmailed"", said Royal Meteorological Society chief executive Professor Liz Bentley. ""Anecdotally, abusive comments increase when the message about climate change is intrinsic to the story,"" she said. Met Office lead meteorologist Alex Deakin said ""it's scary in some ways"", adding: ""I find it more frustrating and offensive for my colleagues - some of the great minds in climate science. Show a bit of respect and do a bit more research rather than just believe Bob down the pub or Tony on YouTube."" Abusive tweets accusing BBC Weather's team of 'scaremongering' peaked during the heatwave Tweets aimed at BBC Weather and its presenters featured personal insults and messages such as ""it's just summer"" - many described advice on how to stay cool as pandering to the ""woke-brigade"" or for ""snowflakes"". Other tweets accused the Met Office and the BBC of spreading ""alarmism"" and ""hysteria"", telling both to ""stop scaremongering"". Hundreds of people have also shared theirexperiences of the 1976 heatwave on social media, with many making the false suggestion that this month's heatwave was ""no different"". The peak temperature in 1976 was 35.9C, more than four degrees lower than the 40.3C recorded on 19 July. Nine out of 10 of the hottest days ever recorded in the UK have been since 1990, according to the Met Office. The hottest day from 1976 ranks as 13th in the list of the hottest UK days on record. Periods of intense heat do occur within natural weather patterns, but they are becomingmore frequent around the world, more intense and are lasting longer as a result of human-induced climate change.

How Covid conspiracists are shifting to climate denial A really simple guide to climate change BBC meteorologist Tomasz Schafernaker said: ""What frustrates me most is when I'm accused of twisting the truth. As meteorologists, we report facts. There is no conspiracy."" Jennifer Bartram, BBC North East's weather forecaster, linked the level of abuse with what she saw as high-level climate disinformation circulating. ""I've noticed abuse getting nastier and more personal, and it's pretty demoralising when you're trying to do your job."" Matt Taylor said covering the heatwave was ""really emotional"" and it felt ""like a real turning point in public attitude and realisation to what has happened to our climate."" He added: ""The weather is very emotive. It gets people so worked up. What's good for some is bad for others and vice versa. ""Our climate has changed, so our reporting and response also has to change. All we're trying to do is bring people the facts.""

Beach body ad used my image without asking - model,"Spain's body-positive campaign received coverage from lots of media outlets A British model says her image was used in a Spanish campaign promoting body positivity without her permission. The equality ministry's advert was praised for featuringdiverse women of different shapes and sizesrelaxing on a beach. But Nyome Nicholas-Williams, from London, says a photo from her Instagram feed was used without her knowledge. The artist behind the image has apologised to Nyome, but she's not yet heard from the Spanish government. Nyome, 30, tells BBC Newsbeat an image from her social media feed was adapted for the poster released by the Institute for Women earlier this week. It features an illustration of five women - including one who has had a mastectomy - on a beach underneath the slogan ""summer is ours too"". Nyome wears a gold bikini in the image, and can be seen sitting on the sand, with her head turned towards the viewer. She says one of her 78,000 followers alerted her after the campaign waswidely reported by the world's media,external. ""I was really taken aback because I had never seen it before,"" Nyome says. ""It isn't a stock photo, it's a picture that I've taken on my Instagram. ""It's rude and it's disrespectful."" Nyome says her photo (right) was used as the basis for the Spanish illustration After posting a complaint about it on her account, she was contacted by the illustrator who created the final poster in messages seen by the BBC. ""They said they used my image because they were running low on time,"" she says, adding that they apologised and ""said they'd compensate me"". ""I feel it's very reactive rather than proactive,"" she says. ""I'm annoyed because if they'd asked me in the beginning, I could have made a decision, I probably would have said yes"". Nyome finds it ""very ironic and wild"" that the Women's Institute failed to get consent from her to use her image. ""They should know better,"" she says. Nyome says she has experienced unauthorised use of her pictures before Nyome says she doesn't know the other women in the poster or whether they were asked to give their consent, but she hopes that the woman shown with a mastectomy was asked and ""would be happy to have that image our there like that"". She says her pictures have been copied before, and in 2020 she had a battle with a different illustrator who used her image on phone cases, bags and mugs. ""And I had no idea about it,"" she says.

UK Covid cases have peaked and are now droppingAbout 3.2 million are thought to have the virus - a drop of more than half a million on the previous week.HealthComments,"Covid infections are on the way down in the UK, dropping by more than half a million in a week, according toOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures.,external An estimated 3.2 million people had the virus in the week up to 20 July, compared to 3.8 million the week before. Hospital cases are also decreasing. Admissions in England of people with Covid stood at 16.3 per 100,000 people in the seven days to July 24, down from 18.2 the previous week. There is still lots of Covid around to catch, even though the rates are declining, experts warn. In the latest ONS report, for the week ending 20 July, the estimated Covid rates were: One in 20 in England - down from one in 17 the week before One in 19 in Wales - down from one in 17 One in 16 in Northern Ireland - up from one in 20 (although experts say the trend is uncertain) One in 19 in Scotland - down from one in 15 Many of the recent cases have been caused by fast-spreading sub-variants of Omicron, called BA.4 and BA.5. People are still able to become infected even if they have had Covid before. But vaccines are still doing a good job of helping protect people from getting very sick with the virus. Everyone aged 50 and over in the UK will be offered anotherCovid booster vaccine this autumn. The ONS data is collated by testing thousands of people from UK households - whether  or not they have symptoms - to estimate how much virus is around. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, from the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""We are now seeing decreases in Covid case rates and hospitalisations. Whilst this is encouraging, Covid has not gone away and we really want to see further declines in the coming weeks and months. ""People aged 75 and over remain at particular risk of severe disease if they are not up to date with their vaccinations. ""We urge anyone who is not up to date with their jabs to come forward to give themselves the best possible protection."" Sarah Crofts, from the ONS, said: ""Our most recent data suggest that we may now be over the peak of the latest wave of infections across the UK, although rates still remain among the highest seen during the course of the pandemic. ""We have seen welcome decreases among most parts of the UK and in all age groups. With summer holidays starting and more people travelling, we will continue to closely monitor the data.""

Infected blood victims set for Â£400m compensation,"Richard Warwick was infected with HIV and two forms of hepatitis as a young boy More than 4,000 surviving victims of the contaminated blood scandal should receive provisional compensation of Â£100,000 each, ajudge has said,external. The chairman of the infected blood public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, said there was a compelling case to make the payments quickly. At least 2,400 people died after contracting HIV or hepatitis C through NHS treatments in the 1970s and 80s. The government has said it would urgently consider any recommendations. Butgiving evidence in 2021, then health secretary Matt Hancock said ""of course"" compensation would be paid to victims and their families if the public inquiry formally called for it. Currently, victims and families get an annual financial support payment but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. Groups representing victims say this recommendation is a major step forward towards an official admission of responsibility for what has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Hunt calls blood scandal a failing of democracy Major calls blood scandal 'incredibly bad luck' Clarke defends flawed blood products advice Thousands of NHS patients with haemophilia and other blood disorders became seriously ill afterbeing given a new treatment called factor VIII or IX from the mid-1970s onwards. At the time the medication was imported from the US where it was made from the pooled blood plasma of thousands of paid donors, including some in high-risk groups, such as prisoners. If a single donor was infected with a blood-borne virus such as hepatitis or HIV then the whole batch of medication could be contaminated. An unknown number of UK patients were also exposed to hepatitis B or C though a blood transfusion after childbirth or hospital surgery. Richard Warwick, who was infected with HIV and two forms of hepatitis as a young boy in 1978 after being given contaminated treatment, said compensation was long overdue. ""It's the affirmation that wrong was done to done to our community,"" he said. ""Finally, after all this time, it's recognition of the harm that's been done to us and a way of compensating victims that will enable them to get on with their lives."" This video can not be played Video statements were played at the start of the public inquiry in September 2018 Over the years, the government has put in place a number of schemes offering victims financial support without any admission of liability but, unlike in the Republic of Ireland and some other countries, compensation has never been paid to individuals or families affected. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian said individuals who currently qualify for financial support, including some bereaved partners of those killed, should now be offered interim compensation of Â£100,000 each. The idea would be to fund immediate bills and care needs, with final recommendations on compensation for a wider group of people expected when the inquiry concludes next year. An independent study commissioned by the government,published last month,external, said victims should eventually be compensated for physical and social injury, the stigma of the disease, the impact on family and work life, and the cost of care. It recommended that partners, children, siblings and parents of those who had been infected should be eligible for payments too. If the inquiry and then the government accept those proposals then it is possible a final bill could be more than a billion pounds. Kate Burt from The Haemophilia Society said: ""Today's recommendations leave no room for doubt: many of those infected or bereaved are ill and dying and need compensation now."" A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise how important this will be for people infected and affected across the UK, and can confirm that the Government will consider Sir Brian's report and the recommendations of Sir Robert Francis QC with the utmost urgency, and will respond as soon as possible.""

10 things we learned at the Wagatha Christie trial,"Coleen Rooney was sued by Rebekah Vardy for alleging she leaked private stories to the Sun ""Wagatha Christie"", ""Wags at war"", the ""Wag World Cup"". Call it what you like, the libel case between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy had plenty to keep observers gripped: lost evidence, tears and Wayne Rooney coming off the bench and into the witness box. The pair rose to tabloid fame as ""Wags"" - wives and girlfriends of England footballers - but fell out spectacularly after Mrs Rooney, the wife of former England captain Wayne, said she had conducted a sting operation to find out who had leaked stories about her to The Sun. ""It's.......... Rebekah Vardy's account,"" she claimed. Mrs Vardy, who is married to ex-England striker Jamie, denied personally leaking stories and sued Mrs Rooney for defamation. Here are some nuggets we discovered during the ensuing two-week High Court trial. The social media reveal that rocked the pop culture world in 2019 started off as a humble handwritten note, the court heard last week. Mrs Rooney said she initially wrote the post longhand (she was seen scribbling in a leopard print notebook throughout the trial too) before typing it out and sending it to her brother, who helped publish it on her social media accounts. The original note has sadly been lost. Such an innocent stock phrase, yet one that can seemingly get you into trouble. When Mrs Vardy began one of her answers in such fashion under cross examination from Mrs Rooney's barrister David Sherborne, he retorted: ""I would hope you're honest, because you're sitting in a witness box."" Mrs Rooney fell foul of the same thing herself on multiple occasions, saying sorry for having started her answers, under oath, with the phrase ""to be honest"". David Sherborne is Mrs Rooney's barrister Due to ""a series of unfortunate events"", as Mrs Rooney's barrister sarcastically put it, WhatsApp messages between Mrs Vardy's agent Caroline Watt and journalists, which could have helped Mrs Rooney's case, were not available. Ms Watt accidentally dropped her phone in the North Sea while on a boat trip in Scotland, the court heard. The theatrical Mr Sherborne noted it was ""a shame"" that the phone was ""lying at the bottom of the sea in Davy Jones' locker"". To which Mrs Vardy, sitting in the witness box, replied: ""Who is Davy Jones?"" The judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, explained: ""It just means the bottom of the sea."" Perhaps the barrister learned the nautical phrase from one of his previous libel claimant clients, Johnny Depp - aka Captain Jack Sparrow. Mr Sherborne himself didn't know who SAS TV personality Ant Middleton was when his name cropped up elsewhere in proceedings, while the judge and Mrs Vardy's barrister Hugh Tomlinson appeared to struggle to grasp how Instagram works. Excerpts from an interview Mrs Vardy gave to the Daily Mail, published the day after Mrs Rooney's online allegation, were read to the court. In the interview, she said: ""Arguing with Coleen Rooney would be like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it's still going to [poop] in your hair."" However, she told the court she ""wasn't thinking straight"" when giving the interview. Mrs Rooney, for her part, called her ex-associate ""fame hungry"". What will the impact of the Wagatha case be? Catch up on what else happened during the trial Hear more on the BBC Sounds podcast It'sâ¦ Wagatha Christie The Secret Wag, an anonymously-written column in The Sun gossiping about footballers, came up a lot, with Mrs Rooney saying she believed Mrs Vardy had been a source, which she denied. While casting doubt on the validity of the column, Mrs Vardy's barrister appeared to let slip how he likes to unwind after work. ""Mrs Rooney thinks the Secret Wag column is a real-life version of Lady Whistledown in [Netflix series] Bridgerton, rather than a journalistic invention,"" Mr Tomlinson said. Jamie Vardy accompanied his wife at court on Tuesday Mrs Vardy appeared to concede that, in a WhatsApp message that was read to the court, her agent had admitted leaking a story from Mrs Rooney's private Instagram account about an alleged car crash. After Mrs Rooney posted that someone she trusted was betraying her, Ms Watt wrote to Mrs Vardy: ""It wasn't someone she trusted. It was me."" Asked why she didn't challenge her agent about that, Mrs Vardy said she had been too distracted because she was bathing her children while watching fellow TV personality Gemma Collins' infamous ""faceplant"" on Dancing On Ice. Mrs Vardy had to leave the witness box in tears several times during what she called an ""intimidating"" almost three-day cross examination. Ms Watt did not give evidence after a consultant forensic psychiatrist decided she was not fit to do so. Cameras are not allowed in courtrooms in England (hence the use of court sketches), so all the paparazzi could do was to wait outside early each morning to get shots of the key players arriving. Mrs Vardy hid her eyes behind big sunglasses most days and dressed in glamorous outfits by top designers, while Mrs Rooney wore high street garments, donning the same pantsuit twice. She also wore a surgical boot, just as husband Wayne did when he broke his metatarsal before the 2006 World Cup - the tournament when the ""Wags"" first burst onto the scene. A courtroom sketch of Mrs Vardy's barrister Hugh Tomlinson Mr Tomlinson argued that Mrs Rooney had ""no evidence"" to link his client to alleged leaks. Though Mrs Rooney told the court: ""I believe that Mrs Vardy knew that this was happening, whether it was Mrs Vardy herself or it was someone she's given permission to."" Mrs Vardy's barrister replied that having belief was not the same as having proof. ""You might believe that Derby County will win the Premiership in two years' time. It's not evidence that they are going to."" He presumably did not know it is impossible for Derby to win the Premier League in two years given the club's recent relegation to the third tier. Sitting a few feet to his right, their manager - Mrs Rooney's husband Wayne - looked on into the middle distance. The footballer-turned-manager was with his wife throughout the trial, holding her bag and opening doors, but he looked away as she told the court they had split up for a period. His ex-international team-mate Jamie Vardy - who scored four goals for Leicester City while the case was going on - made his High Court debut on day six, arriving hand-in-hand with his wife. The football stars seemed to acknowledge one another at first, unlike their other halves. Mr Vardy's first trip to court came on the day Mr Rooney testified that then-England manager Roy Hodgson had asked him to have a word with Mr Vardy about his wife being an unwanted distraction around Euro 2016. Mr Rooney recalled the chat in detail, saying he had a coffee while Mr Vardy drank an energy drink. However, Mr Vardy said outside the hearing that no such conversation took place. Or not great length, if you believe what you read in Mrs Vardy's unflattering kiss-and-tell story about the singer. The News of the World article from 2004 was dredged up again in court. Mrs Vardy said the article was ""shameful"" and the now-defunct tabloid had ""misrepresented"" a lot of things she had said. She said she had since messaged Mr Andre and his partner privately. After coverage of the case brought the article back under the microscope, Mr Andre responded online, saying he was glad she had acknowledged she had written it ""because her ex-husband forced her to do it"". He said he had been the ""butt of all jokes for years"", pointing out there would be ""absolute outrage"" if he had written something unflattering about her body. The trial has now ended, and Mrs Justice Steyn is expected to deliver her judgement in the coming weeks/months. What will the impact of the Wagatha case be?

The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal,"Ade Goodyear was among the pupils at Treloar's College treated with contaminated blood A public inquiry has begun hearing from former students after more than 120 pupils at a school for disabled children were caught up in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. From 1974 to 1987, those children were offered treatment for haemophilia at Treloar's College. At least 72 died after being given a drug contaminated with HIV and viral hepatitis. ""We've lost so many friends from Treloar's and it's absolutely heartbreaking,"" Richard Warwick, a pupil at the Hampshire school in the late 1970s who was later diagnosed with HIV, told the BBC ahead of the hearing. The inquiry into the use of infected blood began taking evidence from people connected to the school on Monday. Former headmaster, Alec Macpherson, is one of those due to answer questions. ""It caused those boys a lot of anxiety and a lot of upset,"" he told the BBC. ""It put a rage inside them - why me, why has this happened to me, why have I got this dreadful disease?"" Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood The secret in my blood Liz Hooper: The woman who lost two husbands to the scandal Lord Mayor's Treloar's College was a boarding school for physically disabled children with a specialist NHS haemophilia centre on site, run by a dedicated medical team. Treloar's College By the mid 1970s, a new treatment for haemophilia, known as factor VIII/IX, became available for the first time. It meant those with a serious form of the blood disorder could live a normal life without the risk of a bleed. The NHS was not self-sufficient in the blood plasma used to make the drug so it was imported from overseas, most notably the US. Batches were widely contaminated with hepatitis A, B, C and later HIV, infecting thousands of haemophiliacs across the UK. Ade Goodyear joined Treloar's in 1980 at the age of 10. He described life as ""wonderful"" with supportive teachers, nurses and good friends. Like dozens of other boys at the school, he was given factor VIII to help control his bleeding. Ade Goodyear received treatment for haemophilia, along with his two older brothers ""With one of my very first shots, I got hepatitis and was placed in isolation for two weeks,"" he said. In 1985 he was taken into a small office with a group of boys to be told he had tested positive for HIV - then a newly discovered virus with no known treatment and a short life expectancy. ""The doctor was upset and pointed at us and said, you have it, and you haven't. And I was back in science by 1.50pm. I didn't even get the afternoon off,"" he said. ""A friend of mine picked up a pot plant and threw it against the wall of the haemophilia centre. It was a beautiful summer's day and I remember thinking, how many more sunrises like this am I going to see?"" Ade's two older brothers died after treatment with factor VIII - Jason from Aids in 1997 and Gary from health problems linked to hepatitis C in 2015. For pupils like Ade and Richard it meant living with the stigma of what was then a little-known disease. Students were followed by newspaper reporters outside the school gates and shouted questions about their HIV status. Just 32 of the 122 haemophiliacs who attended the school from 1974 to 1987 are still alive today. Most died after contracting HIV or viral hepatitis. It's hoped the public inquiry will be able to answer questions about what happened at Treloar's and the NHS haemophiliac centre run from the site. Ex-pupils Stephen Nicholls and Richard Warwick wear ties with the colours they use to support those who died - red for HIV, yellow for hepatitis, black for death Families want to know why they were not told about the potential risks of Factor VIII earlier and why it took many years until the drug was heat treated to kill viruses and other contaminants. ""What happened at the school comes back to haunt us every day,"" said Stephen Nicholls, a former pupil who was infected with hepatitis C after his treatment. ""We will never forget the Treloar's story and those memories of what happened here."" It is a rare genetic condition in which the blood does not clot properly. It mostly affects men. People with the condition produce lower amounts of the essential blood-clotting protein known as factor VIII and IX. Former students are giving evidence this week, some anonymously, along with the parents of children who lost their lives. The haemophilia centre on the site was run by NHS doctors and nurses and not staff directly employed by the school, which still cares for physically disabled children today. ""Although no-one has at any point suggested that Treloar's was at fault, it is a tragic part of our past,"" the school said in a statement. ""It was, and still is, a very difficult time for our affected alumni, their families and staff who were here at the point. ""We are completely supportive of the campaign for truth, answers and justice by our former pupils."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Ukraine's shadow army,"Ukrainian resistance fighters use drones to spot targets for the military As Ukraine's military steps up its strikes on Kherson, hinting at a new offensive to recapture the region, there is another force working alongside. They are Ukraine's shadow army, a network of agents and informers who operate behind enemy lines. Our journey to meet the resistance fighters takes us through a landscape of sunflower yellow and sky blue to Mykolaiv. The first major town on Ukrainian-controlled territory west of Kherson, it has become the partisans' headquarters on the southern front. Driving through military checkpoints, we pass giant billboards showing a faceless, hooded figure alongside a warning: ""Kherson: The partisans see everything."" The image is designed to make the region's Russian occupiers nervous and boost the morale of those trapped under their rule. A billboard warns collaborators ""Kherson: The partisans see everything."" ""The resistance is not one group, it's total resistance,"" the man standing in front of me insists, his voice slightly muffled by a black mask he's pulled up from his neck so I can't see his face as we film him, in a room I can't describe so that neither can be found. I'll call him Sasha. Shortly before this war, Ukraine bolstered its Special Forces in part to build and manage a resistance movement. It even published a PDF booklet on how to be a good partisan, with instructions on such subversive acts as slashing the tyres of the occupier, adding sugar to petrol tanks or refusing to follow orders at work. ""Be grumpy,"" is one suggestion. But Sasha's team of informers have a more active role: tracking Russian troop movements inside Kherson. ""Say yesterday we saw a new target, then we send that to the military and in a day or two it's gone,"" he says, as we scroll through some of the many videos he's sent from the neighbouring region each day. One is from a man who drove past a military base and filmed Russian vehicles, another is from CCTV footage as Russian trucks pass by, daubed with their giant Z war-marks. Sasha describes his ""agents"" as Ukrainians ""who have not lost hope in victory and want our country to be freed"". ""Of course they're afraid,"" he says. ""But serving their country is more important."" Working alongside Sasha are a team who fly drones into Kherson to spot targets for the military. Civilians, not soldiers, all are volunteers and they fundraise on social media to pay for their expensive kit. The man in charge cultivated decorative plants before the war, but Serhii tells me he joined the fight to free the south after seeing the bodies of civilians executed in Bucha during the Russian occupation there. ""I couldn't just stay at home after that,"" he says. ""I didn't know what else I could do or think of, while this war is going on."" The task he chose instead is extremely dangerous. His team of four get shelled by the Russians every single time they go out, though no-one has been killed. ""I know to some extent it's a matter of chance,"" Serhii shrugs, and breaks into a soft smile. ""But at least if it happens to me, then I will know it was for a cause."" Serhii joined the resistance in the south after the massacre in Bucha The partisans are fighting to prevent Russia's hold over Kherson becoming permanent: to block a referendum that Moscow appears to be planning to stage. Russia has already introduced the rouble and its own mobile phone networks to the region and is pumping its propaganda from state-run TV channels into Ukrainian homes. Local journalists have either fled, or gone to ground. The acting head of the region, Dmytro Butrii, now exiled to Mykolaiv and a small back office protected by sandbags, insists that a vote on joining Russia would be a sham, a ""total fake"" and unrecognised by any ""civilised"" government. These days, that wouldn't matter much to Moscow. For Russia, the region is strategic: it's the source of water for Crimea, which it annexed illegally in 2014, and the last section of a much-discussed 'land bridge', or stretch of territory that links Russia-proper to the peninsula. The exiled head of the region, Dmytro Butrii, says a referendum would be a sham Some locals have switched sides to help the Russians. So Sasha's team are building a database of those ""collaborators"", using information from the inside. ""It's so that no one can claim later that they were with the resistance,"" he explains. But it's also for intimidation. Partisans are encouraged to stick threatening posters outside the collaborators' homes with designs that include the person's face and a coffin, or a ""Wanted"" poster offering big rewards for their death. The activists then photograph the results to send to Sasha. ""There's a lot of graffiti. People write things like 'stuff your referendum' as well as sticking up their posters,"" Sasha describes his latest reports from Kherson. ""It shows how many people are not afraid: in a city with military patrols everywhere, they manage to print leaflets then walk round with glue when they could be stopped at any moment and things would end very badly."" There has been a spate of assassination attempts against those who've joined the Russians. A blogger was shot, an official in the Russian-installed administration was killed and others have been injured in car bombs. The most prominent figures to switch sides now wear body armour as a matter of course. The men I meet all say they have nothing to do with the attacks, but they have no sympathy either. ""Other than the word traitor and scum, I have no other words for them,"" Sasha shrugs. ""They're our enemy."" Vladimir Putin still claims his invasion of Ukraine is a ""liberation"" operation but in Kherson, his troops rule through force and fear. Since Russian forces occupied the region in March, hundreds of people have been detained, many of them tortured. Some have disappeared, unheard of for weeks. Others have been discovered dead or returned to their relatives from Russian custody in body bags. Sources inside the city describe soldiers patrolling the streets and buses stopped at random for everyone inside to be checked. The slightest hint of support for Ukrainian rule, as little as a message or photo on your phone, can get you arrested. Every time Oleh smiles in the mirror, the gaps in place of his teeth are a reminder of the beatings he endured by his Russian interrogators. He tells me they also broke seven ribs - three still haven't mended. His name is not really Oleh, but he's asked me not to reveal his identity. A member of the resistance, he witnessed the torture of another prisoner, Denys Mironov, who then died in Russian custody. Denys Mironov Oleh talks in chilling detail about what happened after 27 March when he and Denys were snatched from the street: he describes constant beatings in the first hours involving electric shock, suffocation and death threats. He's sure his interrogators were from the FSB security service. At some point, his spirits fell so low that he contemplated ending his life, even attacking a guard so they would shoot him. ""They were looking for Nazis, so they beat me because I was bald. They reckoned they'd caught a damn Nazi,"" he answers, when I ask what information his captors had wanted. ""When they stripped me, they saw I had Simpsons underpants so they said I was an American agent and punished me for that."" A month earlier, when the Russians invaded, Oleh and Denys had joined the territorial defence, Ukraine's volunteer army. But much of the military melted away with the first explosions and Kherson's remaining forces were quickly overwhelmed. So the men became partisans, working against the Russians from the inside. ""We got information on where their forces were based, and when they were on the move, and we passed that on to the military,"" Oleh explains, adding that he was involved in a lot more activity that he can't talk about. Another partisan I met described helping Ukrainian forces escape in boats across the Dnipro when they were surrounded - and stealing weapons from the Russians. ""I'll tell you the rest when we win,"" he laughs when I press him for more. Denys, a 43-year-old with a wife and son - and a fruit and veg business before the war - began driving a bread van around Kherson, handing out food and scouting for intelligence as he went. He and Oleh were also collecting weapons, preparing to join the battle to liberate Kherson as soon as Ukraine launched the counter-offensive that everyone expected. Instead, the two men were detained and tortured. I asked Russia's FSB to explain what happened to these men and others. They didn't respond. It was the middle of the first night before Oleh saw Denys again, and by then he could barely walk and was struggling for breath. Even so, the guards beat him some more. ""They hit him in the groin, then the face, then two men with batons took down his trousers and started to beat him near his kidneys,"" Oleh says, recalling how the tape holding a bag over his own head had worked loose enough for him to see. ""It was clear his lungs had been punctured and he'd been really badly hurt,"" he says. ""But if he'd been helped in time, his death could have been avoided. It's awful."" On 18 April the men were transferred to a facility in Crimea and the next day, Denys was finally taken to a military hospital where Oleh was sure he would recover. The first Denys Mironov's family knew of his death was over a month later, when he was returned to Ukraine as part of a body swap. Many people left Kherson for safety soon after the Russians seized control. The government in Kyiv recently urged others to evacuate, warning that a military operation to retake the region was imminent. But getting out isn't easy. Russian officials limit the number of vehicles crossing the frontline and only permit one route into Ukrainian-controlled areas, the road that heads north to Zaporizhzhia. Multiple military checkpoints on the way make it a no-go for Ukrainian men of fighting age. Even women and children face waiting weeks for places on free evacuation buses, or an exorbitant fee for a place in a private car. But hundreds still flee each day, tumbling off buses or unfolding themselves from crowded, stuffy cars just before dusk into a supermarket car park that doubles as a reception area for those forced into exile in their own country. The adults look exhausted, the children's smiles are timid, as if they're not quite sure whether they're safe yet. Steam gushes from beneath the bonnet of a blue Lada like it's about to explode. After security checks, volunteers offer food and clothes and, for some, there are tearful reunions with waiting relatives. People fleeing Russian-occupied territory arrive in Zaporizhzhia We can't travel into Kherson now it's occupied, but the mood in this crowd reveals plenty about life there. Even on Ukrainian-controlled soil, people are wary of what they say. ""Will the Russians see this?"" some of the new arrivals want to know before I film or even record them speaking. Others shake their heads as I approach, and turn away from my microphone. ""It's tough there, the Russians are everywhere,"" Alexandra tells me, bouncing baby Nastya on her knee in the back of a car. Inside the aid tent an older woman is standing with two carrier bags at her feet looking lost and lonely. Struggling with tears, Svitlana tells me she's fled Kherson because her nerves are in shreds but her husband has refused to come with her. ""He said he's waiting for the Ukrainian army to come and liberate us,"" she says. As night begins to fall, and more vehicles pull in, a man admits that his own family are running from more than the missiles. ""We know people are disappearing, it's true,"" he tells me, without giving his name. ""In Kherson, you don't go out in the evening."" A resistance poster reads: Zaporizhzhia, land of death to the occupiers The danger from shelling has increased in recent days, on both sides of the southern frontline. In Mykolaiv the days usually start with explosions from 4am: down south, the Russian launch sites are so close that the warning siren only goes off after the first missile hits. One morning, sheltering in our hotel basement, I counted at least 20 explosions in the city, some close enough to shake the building. Once the curfew lifted, we found a nearby school in ruins, the playground swings blanketed in the thick grey dust of the collapsed sports hall. The ruined regional administration building in Mykolaiv But Ukrainian attacks have also increased, both in number and impact, as more powerful weapons supplied by the West have made it to the region and are making a difference. Residents in Kherson city have recorded multiple strikes on Russian ammunition depots. Bridges across the Dnipro, including the Antonivskiy, have also been hit multiple times, disrupting Russian supply lines. Thepush to retake Khersoncould be approaching. Sasha believes many of those who have remained in the city are ready to stay and fight; those I've spoken to say support for Russian rule is minimal and the searches, detentions and beatings in recent months have shrunk that still further. ""When the army starts to invade, then people will be ready and will help,"" Sasha says. After his own brutal experience in Russian custody, Oleh is already back on the southern front to fight for his hometown, alongside Ukraine's partisan army. ""They can take the land, but they can't take the people,"" is how he puts it. ""The Russians will never be safe in Kherson, because the people didn't want them there. They don't like them. They won't accept them."" Photographs by Sarah Rainsford.

Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood,"The government has confirmed it has set aside Â£11.8bn to compensate victims of the infected blood scandal. More than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. A public inquiry described the scale of the scandal as ""horrifying"", and accused doctors, the government and NHS of repeatedly failing patients. Two main groups of NHS patients were affected by what has been called the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Firstly, haemophiliacs - and those with similar disorders -who have a rare genetic condition which means their blood does not clot properly.,external People with haemophilia A have a shortage of a clotting agent called Factor VIII, while people with haemophilia B do not have enough Factor IX. In the 1970s, a new treatment using donated human blood plasma was developed to replace these clotting agents. But whole batches were contaminated with deadly viruses. After being given the infected treatments, about 1,250 people in the UK with bleeding disorders developed both HIV and hepatitis C,including 380 children. This video can not be played Colin Smith, who died aged seven, was one of 380 children now thought to have been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products. About two-thirds later died of Aids-related illnesses. Some unintentionally gave HIV to their partners. Another 2,400 to 5,000 people developed hepatitis C on its own, which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is difficult to know the exact number of people infected with hepatitis C, partly because it can take decades for symptoms to appear. A second group of patients were given contaminated blood transfusions after childbirth, surgery or other medical treatment between 1970 and 1991. The inquiry estimates between 80 and 100 of these people were infected with HIV, and about 27,000 with hepatitis C. In total, it is thought about 2,900 people have died. The victims, families and what happened I lost mum, dad and sister to HIV in blood scandal The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal Announcing its findings in May 2024,the inquiry said victims had been failed ""not once, but repeatedly"",and that the risk of viral infections in blood products had been known since 1948. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said there had been a lack of openness from the authorities and elements of ""downright deception"", including the destruction of documents. He said half-truths were also told, so people did not know about the risk of their treatment, the availability of alternatives, or even whether they were infected. ""This disaster was not an accident,"" said Sir Brian. ""The infections happened because those in authority - doctors, the blood services and successive governments - did not put patient safety first."" The report said,external: too little was done to stop importing blood products from abroad, which used blood from high-risk donors such as prisoners and drug addicts in the UK, blood donations were accepted from high-risk groups such as prisoners until 1986 blood products were not heat-treated to eliminate HIV until the end of 1985, although the risks were known in 1982 there was too little testing to reduce the risk of hepatitis, from the 1970s onwards Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the Â£11.8bn total compensation figure during the Budget on 30 October. The government had previously said that thefirst compensation payments would be made to victimsbefore the end of 2024. Family members and loved ones of those infected will also be entitled to compensation from 2025. Payments will be exempt from tax, and will not affect benefits. The final amounts for individuals are being assessed against five criteria: harm caused, social impact from stigma and isolation, impact on autonomy and private life, care costs and financial loss. Outlining the compensation scheme after the inquiry reported in May 2024, the then-Conservative governmentsuggested how much people might receive,external: a person infected with HIV could expect to get compensation of between Â£2.2m and Â£2.6m those with a chronic hepatitis C infection, defined as lasting more than six months, could expect to receive between Â£665,000 and Â£810,000 the partner of someone infected with HIV who is still alive today could expect to receive about Â£110,000, while a child could get Â£55,000 Annual payments will be available for relatives who had been financially dependent on the loved one who died. In cases wherepeople who would be entitled to compensation have themselves died,the money will go to their estate. In late 2022, followingadvice from the inquiry,the Conservative government made interim payments of Â£100,000 each to about 4,000 surviving victims and bereaved partners. In June 2024, a second interim payment of Â£210,000 was paid to those infected. In October 2024 the government said more relatives of those who died could also apply for Â£100,000 interim payments if the money had not already been claimed. In the 1970s, the UK was struggling to meet the demand for blood-clotting treatments, so imported supplies from the US. But much of the blood was bought from high-risk donors such as prison inmates and drug-users. Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from tens of thousands of donors. If just one was carrying a virus, the entire batch could be contaminated. UK blood donations were not routinely screened for hepatitis C until 1991, 18 months after the virus was first identified. Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, was infected with hepatitis C through a transfusion after the birth of her daughter in 1983 By the mid-1970s, there were repeated warnings that imported US Factor VIII carried a greater risk of infection. However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies. Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk. BBC News has also uncovered evidencechildren were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments- often, without their family's consent. As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no ""conclusive proof"" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a linerobustly defended by former health minister Ken Clarkewhen he appeared before the inquiry. This video can not be played Carolyn Challis: ""I got through two life-threatening rounds of cancer only to be given another life-threatening illness"" Many other countries were affected, although some - including Finland - used older treatments until much later rather than switch to Factor VIII,which minimised HIV infections.,external Delivering the findings of the inquiry, Sir Brian criticised UK government claims in the 1990s that screening for hepatitis C began as soon as the technology was available. He said that 23 other countries - including Japan, Finland and Spain - introduced the screening before the UK. In the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions in out-of-court settlements. Politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence in countries including France and Japan. In his evidence to the inquiry, former health secretary Andy Burnham suggested there maybe grounds for charges of corporate manslaughter,externalin the UK.

Instagram U-turns on TikTok-style revamp,"Instagram says it is pausing a rollout of new features on its app following backlash online from users, influencers and celebrities. Among the new features was an increase in recommended video content, in a similar style to rival app TikTok. The display and feeds were criticised as people felt they were not seeing photos from friends and family as much. Meta, Instagram's parent company, said it wanted to ""take the time"" to get the changes right. The revamp of Instagram towards more video content is believed to have been ignited by the soaring popularity of competitor TikTok - where users post and watch more video as opposed to static photographs. According to data from digital analytics company Sensor Tower, the TikTok app has now been downloaded more than three billion times around the world - the first app not owned by Meta to reach this landmark. Instagram boss Adam Mosseri told The Verge,externalthat the test version of the revamped app would be phased out within weeks. ""I'm glad we took a risk - if we're not failing every once in a while, we're not thinking big enough or bold enough,"" he said. ""But we definitely need to take a big step back and regroup. [When] we've learned a lot, then we come back with some sort of new idea or iteration. So we're going to work through that."" Mr Mosseri had previously posted a video explaining the move towards video, saying that full-screen videos would be promoted over photographs. But after some backlash, he followed it up with a series of tweets saying he wanted to ""continue supporting photos"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

How do I get cost-of-living payments?,"Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February. However, the payments have not tackled the extent of the financial problems many people face, a group of MPs says. It is available to households who receive these benefits,external: universal credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance income support working tax credit child tax credit pension credit The final instalment of Â£299 follows two others last year, of Â£301 and Â£300. To qualify, people need to have claimed a benefits payment between 13 November 2023 and 12 December 2023. Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit. Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, orreport it here,external. The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL. The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits have the reference HMRC COLS. Cost of living payments do not affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive. Households thatreceive the winter fuel payment,external- which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between Â£150 and Â£300 during the winter. Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits. A Â£150 payment was also made to up to six million people receiving disability benefits, between 20 June and 4 July. All cost of living payments go straight into recipients' bank accounts.

There was particular concern for some larger families. The report said the payments have had an important impact, but the system was relatively unsophisticated, meaning some of those in need slipped through the net.

What is Europe doing on energy bills?,"Energy bills have been rising for households across Europe as prices have been driven up by worries about gas and oil supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Individual countries, and the European Union (EU), have announced support schemes for consumers. Here's what they're doing: In 2021, the EU imported 40% of its gas from Russia - so many of its member states are exposed to high energy prices. In response, the EU is introducing: A cap on gas prices if they exceed â¬180 per megawatt hour for three days running, from February 2022. A ""solidarity levy"" - a windfall tax - on excess profits made by oil, gas, coal and refinery companies in 2022. A cap on the revenues of electricity companies which produce energy from wind, solar and nuclear. These revenues have risen as the price of electricity from these sources is linked to soaring gas prices - the cap is expected to raise â¬140 billion (Â£121bn). A mandatory reduction of electricity consumption in peak hours by 5% across the EU, until March 2023. A voluntary reduction of 10% of overall electricity consumption - individual countries will decide how to to this. In October, the German parliament approved a ""defensive shield"" package worth â¬200bn (Â£175bn). It includesa cap on gas and electricity prices for households and some businessesfrom early next year. The government will pay December's monthly gas bill for all households and small-to-medium businesses. In September and October, all taxpayers received a one-off energy payment â¬300. There has been extra help for people on benefits. Public transport tickets are being subsidised. Germany is trying tocut energy consumption,externalby: Heating public buildings to a maximum of 19C, with exceptions for places like hospitals Turning off hot water for washing hands in public buildings Lighting limits for buildings, monuments and advertising A windfall tax on energy companies will be applied from December 2022 to the end of June 2023. In January, the government forced the state-owned energy provider, ÃlectricitÃ© de France (EDF), to cap price rises at 4% for a year. It says it will cap rises in gas and electricity at 15% for 2023, as part of a â¬45bn (Â£39bn) scheme to support households and businesses. France had already announced a one-off â¬100 (Â£84) payment last year to 5.8 million households receiving energy vouchers. The government plans to reduce energy consumption by 10% by: Capping indoor temperatures at 19C for public buildings Cutting the temperature of public sports facilities by 2C and in public swimming pools by 1C Paying civil servants an extra â¬2.88 per day to work from home, if this allows government buildings to close Speed limits on ski lifts and producing less artificial snow The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in the 2023 budget. France is cutting the temperature in public swimming polls by 1C Italy is expecting to spend about â¬49.5bn (Â£42bn). Its measures include a â¬200 (Â£169) one-off payment to people earning â¬35,000 (Â£29,600) a year or less, and a 20% tax credit for all energy-intensive companies experiencing a 30% rise in prices. The Italian government is also trying to reduce gas consumption by: Asking people to turn central heating down by 1C and turn it off for an extra hour every day Limiting heating in public buildings, with exceptions for hospitals, nurseries and some industries The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in 2023. Since November, electricity and gas prices for households have been capped at January 2022 levels - up to a certain amount of consumption. Any extra use will be charged at market rates. The government is also offering a discount of â¬190 on energy bills in November and December to all households. There is a one-off energy allowance of â¬1,300 to those on lower incomes. VAT on energy bills and tax on petrol and diesel have also been cut. The Dutch government is also introducing: a higher minimum wage lower income tax higher benefits and allowances (such as child benefit, student grants and tax credits) It is expecting to spend â¬15.5bn (Â£13.5bn) on these measures. The Dutch government isadvising households and business,externalto cut consumption, including by turning down heating by 1C. The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies. Spain has cut VAT on energy bills and reduced tax on electricity. Spain and Portugal have introduced a price cap for gas - which will last for one year and aims to halve gas bills for 40% of customers in the two countries. There is also a one-off payment of â¬200 euros for people in Spain who earn less than â¬14,000 a year and are not already receiving benefits. Spain's measures are expected to cost about â¬27bn (Â£23bn). The government has an energy-saving plan which includes limiting air conditioning in public buildings and shops in the summer and keeping heating to 19C in the winter. It wants shops to close their doors when the heating is on and says they should switch off lights after 22:00. The government is introducing a windfall tax on energy companies and banks over the next two years. It has announced plans for an energy price support package for households, worth 26.8bn zlotys (Â£4.8bn). It incudes freezing energy prices for 2023 at this year's level, with a limit of 2,000 kWh per year for most households. There will be higher thresholds for households with people with disabilities and for families with three or more children. The government has abolished VAT on food, gas and fertilizer and reduced it on petrol, diesel and energy bills. There is also a new mandatory 10% electricity saving for national and local government public administrations. Households that reduce electricity use by 10% in 2023 compared with 2022, will be rewarded with an additional discount. Norway has set a maximum price that households should pay for their energy - anything over this, the government will pay 80% of the bill. A new package of loans and subsidies for businesses was announced in September. This will cover companies that spend more than 3% of revenue on power costs. The government has also proposed new taxes on onshore wind and hydropower energy, to redistribute some of the huge increase in profits over the past year. The UK government has brought in a cap on the price of a unit of energy until April 2023, which will mean the typical household bill for gas and electricity will be Â£2,500 a year. This is being extended to April 2024, but typical bills will be capped at Â£3,000 a year. There will be more support for those on benefits and for pensions households. How does the energy price cap work? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies? Energy advice: Sunak to expand tips campaign to lower bills The government brought in a windfall tax on UK oil and gas firms' profits which is expected to raise Â£5bn a year. This is being increased and extended. Previously, the government introduced anenergy bill discount of Â£400for every household with some extra support for people on benefits. The UK government launched a public information campaign on how to save energy in November, which was later than other countries in Europe.

LiveLiveVardy loses libel case against Rooney in Wagatha trial3 minutes ago,"Rebekah Vardy loses her High Court libel case against Coleen Rooney, in the so-called Wagatha Christie trial She says she is ""extremely sad and disappointed at the decision that the judge has reached"" but does not intend to appeal against the ruling Meanwhile, Rooney says she's pleased the judge ruled in her favour - but that the case should never have gone to trial Vardy sued Rooney for libel after Rooney accused her of leaking her private information to The Sun Vardy denied this, saying she had suffered ""public abuse on a massive scale"" as a result of Rooney's claims But in her ruling, the judge says it is likely Vardy's agent Caroline Watt passed information to The Sun with Vardy's help Edited by Flora Drury We're closing our live coverage now, thanks for joining us. Our page was brought to you by Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Jack Burgess, George Wright, Sam Hancock and Aoife Walsh. Flora Drury and Jeremy Gahagan were editors. So, the ""Wagatha Christie"" libel trial has come to its conclusion, with Rebekah Vardy losing her libel case against Coleen Rooney. But what did the judge actually say - and how did the two women react? Here is a quick catch up of some of the key details: There were some well-known names who came up in the trial. Peter Andre's anatomy was discussed at great length. Or not great length, if you believe what you read in Rebekah Vardy's unflattering kiss-and-tell story about the singer. The News of the World article from 2004 was dredged up again in court. Vardy said the article was ""shameful"" and the now-defunct tabloid had ""misrepresented"" a lot of things she had said. She said she had since messaged Andre and his partner privately. After coverage of the case brought the article back under the microscope, Andre responded online, saying he was glad she had acknowledged she had written it ""because her ex-husband forced her to do it"". The trial judgement accepted that Vardy regretted giving the interview and acknowledged that her words could have been twisted. However, it said there was potential relevance in the fact the interview was given to journalist Jane
Atkinson, who Vardy later spoke to for articles in The Sun in 2017 and 2019. ""Ms Rooney relies on evidence of Ms Vardyâs
relationships with journalists from The Sun as supportive of her case,"" it said. Another TV personality who cropped up in the trial wasGemma Collins. Vardy appeared to concede that, in a WhatsApp message that was read to the court, her agent had admitted leaking a story from Coleen Rooney's private Instagram account about an alleged car crash. After Rooney posted that someone she trusted was betraying her, Watt wrote to Vardy: ""It wasn't someone she trusted. It was me."" Asked why she didn't challenge her agent about that, Vardy said she had been too distracted because she was bathing her children while watching Collins' infamous ""faceplant"" on Dancing On Ice. Although Coleen Rooney successfully defended the libel claim brought against her by Rebekah Vardy, one part of her argument was rejected by the court. Rooney defended the publication of her social media post accusing Vardy of leaking the stories on the basis it was true - and in the public interest. But while the High Court ruled in Rooney's favour, finding the accusation she made was ""substantially true"", it said her ""belief that publication was in the public interest
was not reasonable"". Explaining the decision, thecourt's judgement,externalsaid to successfully defend herself on the grounds of public interest, Rooney would have had to give Vardy an opportunity to respond to the allegation. ""It is no answer to that point that Ms Rooney anticipated that
Ms Vardy would deny the allegation,"" the court added. For a few years now you mightâve been trying to figure out who
coined the term Wagatha Christie. Itâsâ¦ Phoebe Roberts. Back in October 2019, Phoebe was a new mum in London. Holding her three-month-old baby in one arm while scrolling
on her phone with the other, she spotted Coleen Rooneyâs tweet about her online
detective work. ""It was this amazing story with the dot dot dot
ending,"" says Phoebe. ""It had a lot of drama in it. So, I was just like, this
is a detective novel or something, and that's when I came up with Wagatha
Christie.â Her joke was a play on the term Wag and Agatha Christie, who was famous for her detective novels. But although it's made newspaper headlines - and become a nickname for the court case - it didnât lead to a job with the tabloids for Phoebe â
sheâs now living in Belgium as a film curator. ""It is probably my one good joke I've ever made, so I'm
glad I got to share it around,"" she laughs. Phoebe has never made a penny from her online gag, but has
enjoyed finding how far it has travelled. ""When my friends see it around they text me, so I think
you can get it on a phone case, on socks. It's in a lot of strange places now,""
she says. Lizo MzimbaBBC News correspondent Rebekah Vardy seen in a courtroom sketch during the trial I was sitting in Court 13 at the Royal Courts of Justice when Rebekah
Vardy and Coleen Rooney were questioned in the witness box. While both
have spent years in the public eye, giving evidence under oath in a high-profile
trial at the High Court is probably an incredibly intense and difficult
experience. At times, Vardy seemed nervous and edgy. By contrast, Rooney did seem much more relaxed and comfortable. Although it should be
said that the issues Vardy was being questioned on - leaking information and betraying trust - can
be seen as being of a different magnitude to the questions put to Rooney
about the robustness of her ""sting operation"". The judge was fairly unequivocal in her assessment, saying she found it ""necessary to treat Ms Vardyâs evidence with very
considerable caution"" and ""significant parts of Ms Vardyâs evidence were
not credible"". By contrast, she said: ""Ms Rooney was an
honest and reliable witness."" Match of the Day's Gary Lineker has been on the ball with a different type of commentary this afternoon. The ex-England footballer has scored a brace of Twitter jokes so far today - one more and it'll be a hat-trick. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Victoria BourneBBC News It was finally judgement day in the Wagatha Christie case - but here at the Royal Courts of Justice it
felt rather.... quiet. Gone were the dozens of paparazzi, the women at
the centre of the argument, their footballer husbands and expensive legal teams
as, unlike in sentencing a criminal case, today's result was delivered online. During the trial, photographers had to have sharp elbows to get
the prized shots of either Rebekah Vardy or Coleen Rooney arriving at
court.  While they weren't here
today, television news required pictures from outside to help tell the story. As it approached midday, a group of journalists huddled
together in the shadows of the High Court all frantically checking their phones
and laptops. It was at precisely 12:01pm an email landed in my inbox with
Mrs Justice Steyn's 75-page judgement, however not everyone received it and my
BBC colleagues, as well as other broadcasters, were all vying to see the
outcome. Such is the interest of the case, a documentary camera crew was
there to record the moment that we all discovered Rebekah Vardy's case had
been dismissed. Moments later, correspondents sprang into action to share the
news many had been waiting for. Rebekah Vardy has just spoken out after losing her libel case against Coleen Rooney, saying she does not intend to appeal against the ruling. ""The case is over,"" she says in a statement. She also issues plea to people who have been ""abusing me and my family"" to stop. ""As I explained in my evidence I, my family and even my unborn baby, were subjected to disgusting messages and vile abuse following Coleen's Post and these have continued even during the course of the trial."" Rebekah Vardy Vardy says she is ""extremely sad and disappointed at the decision that the judge has reached"", adding that it is not the result that she had expected and does not believe is just. ""I brought this action to vindicate my reputation and am devastated by the judge's finding,"" she says. ""The judge accepted that publication of Coleen's post was not in the 'public interest' and she also rejected her claim that I was the 'Secret Wag'. But as for the rest of her judgement, she got it wrong and this is something I cannot accept."" Colin PatersonBBC News This is what it
came down to: At midday some of Britainâs finest legal minds gathered around an
iPad outside the High Court shouting ""is it there yet? Is it there yet?"" At two minutes past the hour, an email arrived from the Judicial
Official and a massive 290-point document detailing Mrs Justice Steyn's judgement was opened. Suddenly the media lawyer Jonathan Coad and the BBCâs
legal correspondent Dominic Casciani were trying to flick to the bottom to see
the outcome. Iâd not seen fingers moving that quickly outside of a game of
Subbuteo. And there it was, point 290: ""For the reasons
that I have given, the claim is dismissed."" ""Rebekah Vardy
has lost!"" they shouted in unison. A quick read of
the summary revealed things could not have gone much worse for Rebekah
Vardy today. Her evidence was described as ""not credible"". The judge said it was likely that she had deliberately deleted a WhatsApp chat was her ex-agent
Caroline Watt. I thought back to
that moment in May of Vardy's fourth day giving evidence in the
High Court, when Rooneyâs barrister David Sherborne accused Vardy of lying under oath. I was in court sitting no more than five feet from
her and saw her react by putting her head in her hands and heard her
sobbing. Repeatedly. The court was stopped to give her time to recover. At the time
I thought she looked like she was thinking: ""Why on earth have I brought this
court?"" And boy will she
be thinking that today. Natasha JohanssonExecutive producer of the It's... Wagatha Christie podcast The saga sparked the podcast series It's... Wagatha Christie on BBC Sounds When Coleen Rooney revealed her unexpected sleuthing skills with a now famous tweet concluding ""itâsâ¦â¦â¦.. Rebekah Vardyâs
account"", it captured the Twittersphere's imagination. Some Twitter users jokingly asked Rooney if she would consider negotiating Brexit. And the courtroom has had
no shortage of tweeted-about moments. But itâs worth remembering the impact social media trolling has had on Vardy and her family. She described it as ""public abuse on a
massive scaleâ and the judge also said some of what she faced was ""vile"". If you're feeling out of the loop, we covered all the twists and turns on our podcastIt'sâ¦ Wagatha Christie, hosted by Abi Clarke. Subscribe now on BBC Sounds and you'll get notified when we drop another episode poring over the judgement later today. The so-called Wagatha Christie trial has ""captured everybody's imagination"", says Antonia Foster, a partner at the defamation specialist law firm Carter-Ruck. ""I havenât known anything like this,"" she tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""When you step back from it, itâs perhaps not the most serious of disputes, but it certainly commanded a considerable number of column inches."" The case has raised issues about social media and libel laws, and how posting an allegation about someone online compares to publishing one in print. ""As this case has proven, you very much can sue on
allegations published on social media,"" she says. ""I suspect that despite the fact that Coleen
Rooney is the victor today, she probably didnât anticipate that posting would
cause the lengthy trial that it has done."" Shortly after the judgement, Rooney said she felt the case should never have reached court. As we've been hearing, the judge says Rebekah Vardy knew about the disclosure of several of Coleen Rooney's private Instagram posts to the Sun newspaper. It's likely her agent, Caroline Watt, undertook the direct act of passing the information to a Sun journalist, the judgement says. Let's take a closer look at some of posts in question: The car crash post Rooney posted a close-up photo of the side of
a car, showing that it had been crashed into, with the words  above ""RIP half a Honda"". In court, Vardy didn't accept that she told her agent about the post, but the judge didn't accept that, citing earlier text messages exchanged between the pair. The pyjamas post Rooney posted a photo of her husband and their three sons sitting up in bed wearing matching spotted pyjamas. The next day, a headline in the Sun read âWayne Rooney is back at home â and in bed with Coleen â as she shares snaps with pals celebrating Halloween togetherâ. The gender selection post Rooney posted a photo of the back of a plane seat, saying: ""Letâs go and see what this gender selection is all about."" The post was fabricated. An article was later published in the Sun with the headline ""Coleen Rooney travelled to Mexico to
look into Â£8k âgender selectionâ treatment in desperate bid to have baby girl"". The flooded basement post Rooney uploaded a photo of a bottle of wine with the caption: ""Needed after today [grimacing face
emoji]â¦flood in the basement of our new houseâ¦when it seemed to be going so well.â The judgement says there was ""compelling evidence"" that the fabricated post was only visible to Vardy's account. A headline in the Sun later read ""Wayne and Coleen Rooneyâs
Â£20million âMorrisons mansionâ flooded during Storm Lorenzo"". In the last few minutes, we've heard from Coleen Rooney who says she's pleased the judge ruled in her favour - but that the case should never have gone to trial. Rooney says she made ""every effort"" to avoid a ""drawn out and public court case"". Her friend and TV personality Lizzie Cundy says Rooney repeatedly ""reached out to Rebekah [Vardy] to try to come and solve this in some way"" - but to no avail. ""This is three years ago [now],"" she tells Sky News. ""A lot has gone on since then - the pandemic, there's a war in Europe, the high cost of living... and Coleen really didn't want this to go to court."" The entire ordeal was ""such a waste of money"", she adds. Cundy claims that she herself offered to get together with the pair and ""sort this out"" over a ""few Proseccos and some nuts"". And now, she adds, ""maybe Rebekah's thinking 'I should've listened'"". The footballer-turned-managerWayne Rooneywas with his wife throughout the trial, holding her bag and opening doors, but he looked away as she told the court they had split up for a period. His ex-international team-mateJamie Vardy- who scored four goals for Leicester City while the case was going on - made his High Court debut on day six, arriving hand-in-hand with his wife. The football stars seemed to acknowledge one another at first, unlike their other halves. Jamie Vardy's first trip to court came on the day Wayne Rooney testified that then-England manager Roy Hodgson had asked him to have a word with Vardy about his wife being an unwanted distraction around Euro 2016. Wayne recalled the chat in detail, saying he had a coffee while Jamie drank an energy drink. However, Vardy said outside the hearing that no such conversation had taken place. Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent Not only does Mrs Justice Steyn say that Vardy's evidence was ""manifestly inconsistent with the contemporaneous documentary evidence, evasive
or implausible"", as we've been reporting she concluded that the loss of some of her WhatsApp messages with Caroline Watt wasn't an accident, as was claimed in court. The finding that Vardy likely deleted her WhatsApp chat with Watt, her former agent, and that Watt deliberately dropped her phone in the sea is highly significant. It's an assessment that evidence was destroyed, and one that a judge does not make lightly. We've watched the drama between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy play out on social media right from the beginning. So as the Wagatha Christie case closes, it seems fitting to let the people of Twitter who have been following the case have their say: Allow Twitter content?

Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent There's a reason why the London libel courts are busy - if you win, you win big. That's because the stakes are often so high - public figures defending public reputations - and such high-risk work comes at a cost from specialist expert lawyers. Rebekah Vardy's loss means she gets no damages - but Rooney's side are now entitled to send her a whopping bill. In principle they can ask for every penny of her costs - but very often a judge will limit that. So how much? Libel lawyers tell me that Vardy's bill could be north of Â£2m ($2.4m). Given her husband, Jamie Vardy, earns top football wages, it won't mean they'll be on soup and bread - but it is still going to sting. In a statement issued to the PA news agency, Coleen Rooney said: ""Naturally, I am pleased that the judge has found in my favour with her judgement today. ""It was not a case I ever sought or wanted. I never believed it should have gone to court at such expense in times of hardship for so many people when the money could have been far better spent helping others. ""Both before and after my social media posts in October 2019, I made every effort to avoid the need for such a drawn out and public court case. All my attempts to do so were knocked back by Mrs (Rebekah) Vardy. ""This left me with no alternative but to go through with the case to defend myself and to end the repeated leaking of my private information to The Sun. ""These leaks from my private Instagram account began in 2017. They continued for almost two years, intruding on my privacy and that of my family. Although I bear Mrs Vardy no ill-will, today's judgment makes clear that I was right in what I said in my posts of October 2019. ""Finally, I would like to thank all of my legal team, my family, friends and everyone who supported me, including the public, through this difficult and stressful time."" We've been hearing from media lawyer Jonathan Coad, who says the case has been ""an absolute disaster"" for Rebekah Vardy. ""What makes it even more tragic is that four times Coleen really tried to settle this case"", he tells the BBC News channel. Vardy suffered ""terrible brand damage"" during the cross-examination by Coleen Rooney's lawyer, David Sherborne, he says. ""More damaging, though, is that she's
effectively been branded a liar,"" he adds, explaining that Vardy denied
leaking stories under oath. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
UK Covid cases have peaked and are now droppingAbout 3.2 million are thought to have the virus - a drop of more than half a million on the previous week.Health,"Covid infections are on the way down in the UK, dropping by more than half a million in a week, according toOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures.,external An estimated 3.2 million people had the virus in the week up to 20 July, compared to 3.8 million the week before. Hospital cases are also decreasing. Admissions in England of people with Covid stood at 16.3 per 100,000 people in the seven days to July 24, down from 18.2 the previous week. There is still lots of Covid around to catch, even though the rates are declining, experts warn. In the latest ONS report, for the week ending 20 July, the estimated Covid rates were: One in 20 in England - down from one in 17 the week before One in 19 in Wales - down from one in 17 One in 16 in Northern Ireland - up from one in 20 (although experts say the trend is uncertain) One in 19 in Scotland - down from one in 15 Many of the recent cases have been caused by fast-spreading sub-variants of Omicron, called BA.4 and BA.5. People are still able to become infected even if they have had Covid before. But vaccines are still doing a good job of helping protect people from getting very sick with the virus. Everyone aged 50 and over in the UK will be offered anotherCovid booster vaccine this autumn. The ONS data is collated by testing thousands of people from UK households - whether  or not they have symptoms - to estimate how much virus is around. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, from the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""We are now seeing decreases in Covid case rates and hospitalisations. Whilst this is encouraging, Covid has not gone away and we really want to see further declines in the coming weeks and months. ""People aged 75 and over remain at particular risk of severe disease if they are not up to date with their vaccinations. ""We urge anyone who is not up to date with their jabs to come forward to give themselves the best possible protection."" Sarah Crofts, from the ONS, said: ""Our most recent data suggest that we may now be over the peak of the latest wave of infections across the UK, although rates still remain among the highest seen during the course of the pandemic. ""We have seen welcome decreases among most parts of the UK and in all age groups. With summer holidays starting and more people travelling, we will continue to closely monitor the data.""

"Cash for 1,000 homes to replace temporary housing","Thousands of people are stuck in temporary accomodation The Welsh government has promised 1,000 new homes to help people stuck waiting for accommodation. The Â£62m social housing scheme includes bringing unused properties back into use quickly, converting buildings, manufacturing ""modular"" homes and might involve turning offices into homes. The homes will not have to meet the usual standards for new social housing. Plaid Cymru said the plan was ""nowhere near enough"" to match the urgent demand for social housing. Ministers say they will ""actively consider"" converting offices into accommodation if high quality plans for doing so are put forward. In April, 7,999 people were in temporary accommodation, with about a quarter in hotels and B&Bs. Housing charity Shelter Cymru said the figure includes 2,000 children, and that some temporary accommodation is of such extremely poor quality that parents are feeding their families without the use of a kitchen. The number of people in temporary accommodation has risen from 3,566 in August 2020. Landlords fear crisis for renters over housing law Wales set to build 20,000 low-carbon social homes Building of new council homes ramped up This figure includes people housed because of the ""everyone-in"" policy to accommodate homeless people at the start of the pandemic. Councils and social housing providers are bidding for the cash, and it is hoped the Welsh government programme will be completed within the next 18 months. Almost half will be long-term homes, while the rest will be temporary accommodation that could be used as an alternative to B&Bs and hotels. While they will need to follow guidance for properties to be fit for human habitation, social housing providers will not have to meet the standards the Welsh government sets for new social housing. That could mean homes being smaller or the Welsh government even considering shared accommodation. But the homes would still be expected to provide good enough space, insulation and daylight. Of the Â£62m, roughly Â£12m is being spent on bringing 400 homes back to use which are already owned by social housing providers but need significant work. A further Â£12m will be spent on modular homes which are built in a factory. Some existing properties could be remodelled, while others could be demolished and rebuilt. This video can not be played The Welsh government restarted council house building in 2019 Plaid's spokeman for housing, Mabon ap Gwynfor, is concerned the plans did not go far enough. The party said figures from 2020-21 showed 13,161 households were assessed as homeless that year. Mr ap Gwynfor said: ""This investment is to be welcomed insofar as it goes, but it's nowhere near enough to match the urgent and immediate demand. ""We need to see much more ambition from the Welsh government if we are to ensure that those in temporary accommodation get the housing they need."" He added: ""I'm also extremely concerned that, with the significant cost of living increase due to come in in the autumn and winter that those numbers will only go up, with much more demand for urgent housing."" Conservative housing spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders welcomed the new funding but believed there had been a ""missed opportunity"" to seriously tackle homelessness as we moved out of the pandemic. ""Over the course of the pandemic, temporary accommodation was made available for people struggling with homelessness and now we are back to square one,"" she said. ""Labour ministers should have ensured that more was done to move people that were housed over the course of the pandemic into full time accommodation."" Ruth Power, chief executive of housing charity Shelter Cymru, welcomed the Welsh government scheme. She said the charity is seeing more people ""who have been stuck in temporary accommodation for months on end, sometimes waiting a year or more for a place to call home"". ""Some of the accommodation is extremely poor quality, leaving some parents struggling to feed their families without a kitchen, and just a kettle or a microwave to prepare food. ""Living like this, and sharing basic facilities with strangers, takes a massive toll on people's health and on family life, and the numbers keep climbing month by month."" The scheme is separate to the Welsh government's target for20,000 new low-carbon social homes for rent by 2026. Welsh government Climate Change Minister Julie James said: ""We have successfully helped thousands of people into temporary accommodation over the last two-and-a-half years but many more are still going to our local authorities for urgent help. ""Our ambition is for everyone to have a safe, suitable, permanent home but our housing system is under significant pressure, that's why we are building more social homes. ""Where people are in hotel or B&B-based temporary accommodation, in particular, it can be difficult for them to move on with their lives. We need more high-quality interim accommodation options - places they can call their own - to allow people to get on with their lives, while we support them to find a permanent home.""

LiveLiveWagatha Christie: Judgement due in Vardy and Rooney case7 minutes ago,"Rebekah Vardy loses her High Court libel case against Coleen Rooney, in the so-called Wagatha Christie trial She says she is ""extremely sad and disappointed at the decision that the judge has reached"" but does not intend to appeal against the ruling Meanwhile, Rooney says she's pleased the judge ruled in her favour - but that the case should never have gone to trial Vardy sued Rooney for libel after Rooney accused her of leaking her private information to The Sun Vardy denied this, saying she had suffered ""public abuse on a massive scale"" as a result of Rooney's claims But in her ruling, the judge says it is likely Vardy's agent Caroline Watt passed information to The Sun with Vardy's help Edited by Flora Drury We're closing our live coverage now, thanks for joining us. Our page was brought to you by Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Jack Burgess, George Wright, Sam Hancock and Aoife Walsh. Flora Drury and Jeremy Gahagan were editors. So, the ""Wagatha Christie"" libel trial has come to its conclusion, with Rebekah Vardy losing her libel case against Coleen Rooney. But what did the judge actually say - and how did the two women react? Here is a quick catch up of some of the key details: There were some well-known names who came up in the trial. Peter Andre's anatomy was discussed at great length. Or not great length, if you believe what you read in Rebekah Vardy's unflattering kiss-and-tell story about the singer. The News of the World article from 2004 was dredged up again in court. Vardy said the article was ""shameful"" and the now-defunct tabloid had ""misrepresented"" a lot of things she had said. She said she had since messaged Andre and his partner privately. After coverage of the case brought the article back under the microscope, Andre responded online, saying he was glad she had acknowledged she had written it ""because her ex-husband forced her to do it"". The trial judgement accepted that Vardy regretted giving the interview and acknowledged that her words could have been twisted. However, it said there was potential relevance in the fact the interview was given to journalist Jane
Atkinson, who Vardy later spoke to for articles in The Sun in 2017 and 2019. ""Ms Rooney relies on evidence of Ms Vardyâs
relationships with journalists from The Sun as supportive of her case,"" it said. Another TV personality who cropped up in the trial wasGemma Collins. Vardy appeared to concede that, in a WhatsApp message that was read to the court, her agent had admitted leaking a story from Coleen Rooney's private Instagram account about an alleged car crash. After Rooney posted that someone she trusted was betraying her, Watt wrote to Vardy: ""It wasn't someone she trusted. It was me."" Asked why she didn't challenge her agent about that, Vardy said she had been too distracted because she was bathing her children while watching Collins' infamous ""faceplant"" on Dancing On Ice. Although Coleen Rooney successfully defended the libel claim brought against her by Rebekah Vardy, one part of her argument was rejected by the court. Rooney defended the publication of her social media post accusing Vardy of leaking the stories on the basis it was true - and in the public interest. But while the High Court ruled in Rooney's favour, finding the accusation she made was ""substantially true"", it said her ""belief that publication was in the public interest
was not reasonable"". Explaining the decision, thecourt's judgement,externalsaid to successfully defend herself on the grounds of public interest, Rooney would have had to give Vardy an opportunity to respond to the allegation. ""It is no answer to that point that Ms Rooney anticipated that
Ms Vardy would deny the allegation,"" the court added. For a few years now you mightâve been trying to figure out who
coined the term Wagatha Christie. Itâsâ¦ Phoebe Roberts. Back in October 2019, Phoebe was a new mum in London. Holding her three-month-old baby in one arm while scrolling
on her phone with the other, she spotted Coleen Rooneyâs tweet about her online
detective work. ""It was this amazing story with the dot dot dot
ending,"" says Phoebe. ""It had a lot of drama in it. So, I was just like, this
is a detective novel or something, and that's when I came up with Wagatha
Christie.â Her joke was a play on the term Wag and Agatha Christie, who was famous for her detective novels. But although it's made newspaper headlines - and become a nickname for the court case - it didnât lead to a job with the tabloids for Phoebe â
sheâs now living in Belgium as a film curator. ""It is probably my one good joke I've ever made, so I'm
glad I got to share it around,"" she laughs. Phoebe has never made a penny from her online gag, but has
enjoyed finding how far it has travelled. ""When my friends see it around they text me, so I think
you can get it on a phone case, on socks. It's in a lot of strange places now,""
she says. Lizo MzimbaBBC News correspondent Rebekah Vardy seen in a courtroom sketch during the trial I was sitting in Court 13 at the Royal Courts of Justice when Rebekah
Vardy and Coleen Rooney were questioned in the witness box. While both
have spent years in the public eye, giving evidence under oath in a high-profile
trial at the High Court is probably an incredibly intense and difficult
experience. At times, Vardy seemed nervous and edgy. By contrast, Rooney did seem much more relaxed and comfortable. Although it should be
said that the issues Vardy was being questioned on - leaking information and betraying trust - can
be seen as being of a different magnitude to the questions put to Rooney
about the robustness of her ""sting operation"". The judge was fairly unequivocal in her assessment, saying she found it ""necessary to treat Ms Vardyâs evidence with very
considerable caution"" and ""significant parts of Ms Vardyâs evidence were
not credible"". By contrast, she said: ""Ms Rooney was an
honest and reliable witness."" Match of the Day's Gary Lineker has been on the ball with a different type of commentary this afternoon.

Victoria BourneBBC News It was finally judgement day in the Wagatha Christie case - but here at the Royal Courts of Justice it
felt rather.... quiet. Gone were the dozens of paparazzi, the women at
the centre of the argument, their footballer husbands and expensive legal teams
as, unlike in sentencing a criminal case, today's result was delivered online. During the trial, photographers had to have sharp elbows to get
the prized shots of either Rebekah Vardy or Coleen Rooney arriving at
court.  While they weren't here
today, television news required pictures from outside to help tell the story. As it approached midday, a group of journalists huddled
together in the shadows of the High Court all frantically checking their phones
and laptops. It was at precisely 12:01pm an email landed in my inbox with
Mrs Justice Steyn's 75-page judgement, however not everyone received it and my
BBC colleagues, as well as other broadcasters, were all vying to see the
outcome. Such is the interest of the case, a documentary camera crew was
there to record the moment that we all discovered Rebekah Vardy's case had
been dismissed. Moments later, correspondents sprang into action to share the
news many had been waiting for. Rebekah Vardy has just spoken out after losing her libel case against Coleen Rooney, saying she does not intend to appeal against the ruling. ""The case is over,"" she says in a statement. She also issues plea to people who have been ""abusing me and my family"" to stop. ""As I explained in my evidence I, my family and even my unborn baby, were subjected to disgusting messages and vile abuse following Coleen's Post and these have continued even during the course of the trial."" Rebekah Vardy Vardy says she is ""extremely sad and disappointed at the decision that the judge has reached"", adding that it is not the result that she had expected and does not believe is just. ""I brought this action to vindicate my reputation and am devastated by the judge's finding,"" she says. ""The judge accepted that publication of Coleen's post was not in the 'public interest' and she also rejected her claim that I was the 'Secret Wag'. But as for the rest of her judgement, she got it wrong and this is something I cannot accept."" Colin PatersonBBC News This is what it
came down to: At midday some of Britainâs finest legal minds gathered around an
iPad outside the High Court shouting ""is it there yet? Is it there yet?"" At two minutes past the hour, an email arrived from the Judicial
Official and a massive 290-point document detailing Mrs Justice Steyn's judgement was opened. Suddenly the media lawyer Jonathan Coad and the BBCâs
legal correspondent Dominic Casciani were trying to flick to the bottom to see
the outcome. Iâd not seen fingers moving that quickly outside of a game of
Subbuteo. And there it was, point 290: ""For the reasons
that I have given, the claim is dismissed."" ""Rebekah Vardy
has lost!"" they shouted in unison. A quick read of
the summary revealed things could not have gone much worse for Rebekah
Vardy today. Her evidence was described as ""not credible"". The judge said it was likely that she had deliberately deleted a WhatsApp chat was her ex-agent
Caroline Watt. I thought back to
that moment in May of Vardy's fourth day giving evidence in the
High Court, when Rooneyâs barrister David Sherborne accused Vardy of lying under oath. I was in court sitting no more than five feet from
her and saw her react by putting her head in her hands and heard her
sobbing. Repeatedly. The court was stopped to give her time to recover. At the time
I thought she looked like she was thinking: ""Why on earth have I brought this
court?"" And boy will she
be thinking that today. Natasha JohanssonExecutive producer of the It's... Wagatha Christie podcast The saga sparked the podcast series It's... Wagatha Christie on BBC Sounds When Coleen Rooney revealed her unexpected sleuthing skills with a now famous tweet concluding ""itâsâ¦â¦â¦.. Rebekah Vardyâs
account"", it captured the Twittersphere's imagination. Some Twitter users jokingly asked Rooney if she would consider negotiating Brexit. And the courtroom has had
no shortage of tweeted-about moments. But itâs worth remembering the impact social media trolling has had on Vardy and her family. She described it as ""public abuse on a
massive scaleâ and the judge also said some of what she faced was ""vile"". If you're feeling out of the loop, we covered all the twists and turns on our podcastIt'sâ¦ Wagatha Christie, hosted by Abi Clarke. Subscribe now on BBC Sounds and you'll get notified when we drop another episode poring over the judgement later today. The so-called Wagatha Christie trial has ""captured everybody's imagination"", says Antonia Foster, a partner at the defamation specialist law firm Carter-Ruck. ""I havenât known anything like this,"" she tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""When you step back from it, itâs perhaps not the most serious of disputes, but it certainly commanded a considerable number of column inches."" The case has raised issues about social media and libel laws, and how posting an allegation about someone online compares to publishing one in print. ""As this case has proven, you very much can sue on
allegations published on social media,"" she says. ""I suspect that despite the fact that Coleen
Rooney is the victor today, she probably didnât anticipate that posting would
cause the lengthy trial that it has done."" Shortly after the judgement, Rooney said she felt the case should never have reached court. As we've been hearing, the judge says Rebekah Vardy knew about the disclosure of several of Coleen Rooney's private Instagram posts to the Sun newspaper. It's likely her agent, Caroline Watt, undertook the direct act of passing the information to a Sun journalist, the judgement says. Let's take a closer look at some of posts in question: The car crash post Rooney posted a close-up photo of the side of
a car, showing that it had been crashed into, with the words  above ""RIP half a Honda"". In court, Vardy didn't accept that she told her agent about the post, but the judge didn't accept that, citing earlier text messages exchanged between the pair. The pyjamas post Rooney posted a photo of her husband and their three sons sitting up in bed wearing matching spotted pyjamas. The next day, a headline in the Sun read âWayne Rooney is back at home â and in bed with Coleen â as she shares snaps with pals celebrating Halloween togetherâ. The gender selection post Rooney posted a photo of the back of a plane seat, saying: ""Letâs go and see what this gender selection is all about."" The post was fabricated. An article was later published in the Sun with the headline ""Coleen Rooney travelled to Mexico to
look into Â£8k âgender selectionâ treatment in desperate bid to have baby girl"". The flooded basement post Rooney uploaded a photo of a bottle of wine with the caption: ""Needed after today [grimacing face
emoji]â¦flood in the basement of our new houseâ¦when it seemed to be going so well.â The judgement says there was ""compelling evidence"" that the fabricated post was only visible to Vardy's account. A headline in the Sun later read ""Wayne and Coleen Rooneyâs
Â£20million âMorrisons mansionâ flooded during Storm Lorenzo"". In the last few minutes, we've heard from Coleen Rooney who says she's pleased the judge ruled in her favour - but that the case should never have gone to trial. Rooney says she made ""every effort"" to avoid a ""drawn out and public court case"". Her friend and TV personality Lizzie Cundy says Rooney repeatedly ""reached out to Rebekah [Vardy] to try to come and solve this in some way"" - but to no avail. ""This is three years ago [now],"" she tells Sky News. ""A lot has gone on since then - the pandemic, there's a war in Europe, the high cost of living... and Coleen really didn't want this to go to court."" The entire ordeal was ""such a waste of money"", she adds. Cundy claims that she herself offered to get together with the pair and ""sort this out"" over a ""few Proseccos and some nuts"". And now, she adds, ""maybe Rebekah's thinking 'I should've listened'"". The footballer-turned-managerWayne Rooneywas with his wife throughout the trial, holding her bag and opening doors, but he looked away as she told the court they had split up for a period. His ex-international team-mateJamie Vardy- who scored four goals for Leicester City while the case was going on - made his High Court debut on day six, arriving hand-in-hand with his wife. The football stars seemed to acknowledge one another at first, unlike their other halves. Jamie Vardy's first trip to court came on the day Wayne Rooney testified that then-England manager Roy Hodgson had asked him to have a word with Vardy about his wife being an unwanted distraction around Euro 2016. Wayne recalled the chat in detail, saying he had a coffee while Jamie drank an energy drink. However, Vardy said outside the hearing that no such conversation had taken place. Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent Not only does Mrs Justice Steyn say that Vardy's evidence was ""manifestly inconsistent with the contemporaneous documentary evidence, evasive
or implausible"", as we've been reporting she concluded that the loss of some of her WhatsApp messages with Caroline Watt wasn't an accident, as was claimed in court. The finding that Vardy likely deleted her WhatsApp chat with Watt, her former agent, and that Watt deliberately dropped her phone in the sea is highly significant. It's an assessment that evidence was destroyed, and one that a judge does not make lightly. We've watched the drama between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy play out on social media right from the beginning. So as the Wagatha Christie case closes, it seems fitting to let the people of Twitter who have been following the case have their say: Allow Twitter content?

Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent There's a reason why the London libel courts are busy - if you win, you win big. That's because the stakes are often so high - public figures defending public reputations - and such high-risk work comes at a cost from specialist expert lawyers. Rebekah Vardy's loss means she gets no damages - but Rooney's side are now entitled to send her a whopping bill. In principle they can ask for every penny of her costs - but very often a judge will limit that. So how much? Libel lawyers tell me that Vardy's bill could be north of Â£2m ($2.4m). Given her husband, Jamie Vardy, earns top football wages, it won't mean they'll be on soup and bread - but it is still going to sting. In a statement issued to the PA news agency, Coleen Rooney said: ""Naturally, I am pleased that the judge has found in my favour with her judgement today. ""It was not a case I ever sought or wanted. I never believed it should have gone to court at such expense in times of hardship for so many people when the money could have been far better spent helping others. ""Both before and after my social media posts in October 2019, I made every effort to avoid the need for such a drawn out and public court case. All my attempts to do so were knocked back by Mrs (Rebekah) Vardy. ""This left me with no alternative but to go through with the case to defend myself and to end the repeated leaking of my private information to The Sun. ""These leaks from my private Instagram account began in 2017. They continued for almost two years, intruding on my privacy and that of my family. Although I bear Mrs Vardy no ill-will, today's judgment makes clear that I was right in what I said in my posts of October 2019. ""Finally, I would like to thank all of my legal team, my family, friends and everyone who supported me, including the public, through this difficult and stressful time."" We've been hearing from media lawyer Jonathan Coad, who says the case has been ""an absolute disaster"" for Rebekah Vardy. ""What makes it even more tragic is that four times Coleen really tried to settle this case"", he tells the BBC News channel. Vardy suffered ""terrible brand damage"" during the cross-examination by Coleen Rooney's lawyer, David Sherborne, he says. ""More damaging, though, is that she's
effectively been branded a liar,"" he adds, explaining that Vardy denied
leaking stories under oath. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Ukraine's shadow armySarah Rainsford meets the underground partisans resisting Russian occupation in southern Ukraine.,"Ukrainian resistance fighters use drones to spot targets for the military As Ukraine's military steps up its strikes on Kherson, hinting at a new offensive to recapture the region, there is another force working alongside. They are Ukraine's shadow army, a network of agents and informers who operate behind enemy lines. Our journey to meet the resistance fighters takes us through a landscape of sunflower yellow and sky blue to Mykolaiv. The first major town on Ukrainian-controlled territory west of Kherson, it has become the partisans' headquarters on the southern front. Driving through military checkpoints, we pass giant billboards showing a faceless, hooded figure alongside a warning: ""Kherson: The partisans see everything."" The image is designed to make the region's Russian occupiers nervous and boost the morale of those trapped under their rule. A billboard warns collaborators ""Kherson: The partisans see everything."" ""The resistance is not one group, it's total resistance,"" the man standing in front of me insists, his voice slightly muffled by a black mask he's pulled up from his neck so I can't see his face as we film him, in a room I can't describe so that neither can be found. I'll call him Sasha. Shortly before this war, Ukraine bolstered its Special Forces in part to build and manage a resistance movement. It even published a PDF booklet on how to be a good partisan, with instructions on such subversive acts as slashing the tyres of the occupier, adding sugar to petrol tanks or refusing to follow orders at work. ""Be grumpy,"" is one suggestion. But Sasha's team of informers have a more active role: tracking Russian troop movements inside Kherson. ""Say yesterday we saw a new target, then we send that to the military and in a day or two it's gone,"" he says, as we scroll through some of the many videos he's sent from the neighbouring region each day. One is from a man who drove past a military base and filmed Russian vehicles, another is from CCTV footage as Russian trucks pass by, daubed with their giant Z war-marks. Sasha describes his ""agents"" as Ukrainians ""who have not lost hope in victory and want our country to be freed"". ""Of course they're afraid,"" he says. ""But serving their country is more important."" Working alongside Sasha are a team who fly drones into Kherson to spot targets for the military. Civilians, not soldiers, all are volunteers and they fundraise on social media to pay for their expensive kit. The man in charge cultivated decorative plants before the war, but Serhii tells me he joined the fight to free the south after seeing the bodies of civilians executed in Bucha during the Russian occupation there. ""I couldn't just stay at home after that,"" he says. ""I didn't know what else I could do or think of, while this war is going on."" The task he chose instead is extremely dangerous. His team of four get shelled by the Russians every single time they go out, though no-one has been killed. ""I know to some extent it's a matter of chance,"" Serhii shrugs, and breaks into a soft smile. ""But at least if it happens to me, then I will know it was for a cause."" Serhii joined the resistance in the south after the massacre in Bucha The partisans are fighting to prevent Russia's hold over Kherson becoming permanent: to block a referendum that Moscow appears to be planning to stage. Russia has already introduced the rouble and its own mobile phone networks to the region and is pumping its propaganda from state-run TV channels into Ukrainian homes. Local journalists have either fled, or gone to ground. The acting head of the region, Dmytro Butrii, now exiled to Mykolaiv and a small back office protected by sandbags, insists that a vote on joining Russia would be a sham, a ""total fake"" and unrecognised by any ""civilised"" government. These days, that wouldn't matter much to Moscow. For Russia, the region is strategic: it's the source of water for Crimea, which it annexed illegally in 2014, and the last section of a much-discussed 'land bridge', or stretch of territory that links Russia-proper to the peninsula. The exiled head of the region, Dmytro Butrii, says a referendum would be a sham Some locals have switched sides to help the Russians. So Sasha's team are building a database of those ""collaborators"", using information from the inside. ""It's so that no one can claim later that they were with the resistance,"" he explains. But it's also for intimidation. Partisans are encouraged to stick threatening posters outside the collaborators' homes with designs that include the person's face and a coffin, or a ""Wanted"" poster offering big rewards for their death. The activists then photograph the results to send to Sasha. ""There's a lot of graffiti. People write things like 'stuff your referendum' as well as sticking up their posters,"" Sasha describes his latest reports from Kherson. ""It shows how many people are not afraid: in a city with military patrols everywhere, they manage to print leaflets then walk round with glue when they could be stopped at any moment and things would end very badly."" There has been a spate of assassination attempts against those who've joined the Russians. A blogger was shot, an official in the Russian-installed administration was killed and others have been injured in car bombs. The most prominent figures to switch sides now wear body armour as a matter of course. The men I meet all say they have nothing to do with the attacks, but they have no sympathy either. ""Other than the word traitor and scum, I have no other words for them,"" Sasha shrugs. ""They're our enemy."" Vladimir Putin still claims his invasion of Ukraine is a ""liberation"" operation but in Kherson, his troops rule through force and fear. Since Russian forces occupied the region in March, hundreds of people have been detained, many of them tortured. Some have disappeared, unheard of for weeks. Others have been discovered dead or returned to their relatives from Russian custody in body bags. Sources inside the city describe soldiers patrolling the streets and buses stopped at random for everyone inside to be checked. The slightest hint of support for Ukrainian rule, as little as a message or photo on your phone, can get you arrested. Every time Oleh smiles in the mirror, the gaps in place of his teeth are a reminder of the beatings he endured by his Russian interrogators. He tells me they also broke seven ribs - three still haven't mended. His name is not really Oleh, but he's asked me not to reveal his identity. A member of the resistance, he witnessed the torture of another prisoner, Denys Mironov, who then died in Russian custody. Denys Mironov Oleh talks in chilling detail about what happened after 27 March when he and Denys were snatched from the street: he describes constant beatings in the first hours involving electric shock, suffocation and death threats. He's sure his interrogators were from the FSB security service. At some point, his spirits fell so low that he contemplated ending his life, even attacking a guard so they would shoot him. ""They were looking for Nazis, so they beat me because I was bald. They reckoned they'd caught a damn Nazi,"" he answers, when I ask what information his captors had wanted. ""When they stripped me, they saw I had Simpsons underpants so they said I was an American agent and punished me for that."" A month earlier, when the Russians invaded, Oleh and Denys had joined the territorial defence, Ukraine's volunteer army. But much of the military melted away with the first explosions and Kherson's remaining forces were quickly overwhelmed. So the men became partisans, working against the Russians from the inside. ""We got information on where their forces were based, and when they were on the move, and we passed that on to the military,"" Oleh explains, adding that he was involved in a lot more activity that he can't talk about. Another partisan I met described helping Ukrainian forces escape in boats across the Dnipro when they were surrounded - and stealing weapons from the Russians. ""I'll tell you the rest when we win,"" he laughs when I press him for more. Denys, a 43-year-old with a wife and son - and a fruit and veg business before the war - began driving a bread van around Kherson, handing out food and scouting for intelligence as he went. He and Oleh were also collecting weapons, preparing to join the battle to liberate Kherson as soon as Ukraine launched the counter-offensive that everyone expected. Instead, the two men were detained and tortured. I asked Russia's FSB to explain what happened to these men and others. They didn't respond. It was the middle of the first night before Oleh saw Denys again, and by then he could barely walk and was struggling for breath. Even so, the guards beat him some more. ""They hit him in the groin, then the face, then two men with batons took down his trousers and started to beat him near his kidneys,"" Oleh says, recalling how the tape holding a bag over his own head had worked loose enough for him to see. ""It was clear his lungs had been punctured and he'd been really badly hurt,"" he says. ""But if he'd been helped in time, his death could have been avoided. It's awful."" On 18 April the men were transferred to a facility in Crimea and the next day, Denys was finally taken to a military hospital where Oleh was sure he would recover. The first Denys Mironov's family knew of his death was over a month later, when he was returned to Ukraine as part of a body swap. Many people left Kherson for safety soon after the Russians seized control. The government in Kyiv recently urged others to evacuate, warning that a military operation to retake the region was imminent. But getting out isn't easy. Russian officials limit the number of vehicles crossing the frontline and only permit one route into Ukrainian-controlled areas, the road that heads north to Zaporizhzhia. Multiple military checkpoints on the way make it a no-go for Ukrainian men of fighting age. Even women and children face waiting weeks for places on free evacuation buses, or an exorbitant fee for a place in a private car. But hundreds still flee each day, tumbling off buses or unfolding themselves from crowded, stuffy cars just before dusk into a supermarket car park that doubles as a reception area for those forced into exile in their own country. The adults look exhausted, the children's smiles are timid, as if they're not quite sure whether they're safe yet. Steam gushes from beneath the bonnet of a blue Lada like it's about to explode. After security checks, volunteers offer food and clothes and, for some, there are tearful reunions with waiting relatives. People fleeing Russian-occupied territory arrive in Zaporizhzhia We can't travel into Kherson now it's occupied, but the mood in this crowd reveals plenty about life there. Even on Ukrainian-controlled soil, people are wary of what they say. ""Will the Russians see this?"" some of the new arrivals want to know before I film or even record them speaking. Others shake their heads as I approach, and turn away from my microphone. ""It's tough there, the Russians are everywhere,"" Alexandra tells me, bouncing baby Nastya on her knee in the back of a car. Inside the aid tent an older woman is standing with two carrier bags at her feet looking lost and lonely. Struggling with tears, Svitlana tells me she's fled Kherson because her nerves are in shreds but her husband has refused to come with her. ""He said he's waiting for the Ukrainian army to come and liberate us,"" she says. As night begins to fall, and more vehicles pull in, a man admits that his own family are running from more than the missiles. ""We know people are disappearing, it's true,"" he tells me, without giving his name. ""In Kherson, you don't go out in the evening."" A resistance poster reads: Zaporizhzhia, land of death to the occupiers The danger from shelling has increased in recent days, on both sides of the southern frontline. In Mykolaiv the days usually start with explosions from 4am: down south, the Russian launch sites are so close that the warning siren only goes off after the first missile hits. One morning, sheltering in our hotel basement, I counted at least 20 explosions in the city, some close enough to shake the building. Once the curfew lifted, we found a nearby school in ruins, the playground swings blanketed in the thick grey dust of the collapsed sports hall. The ruined regional administration building in Mykolaiv But Ukrainian attacks have also increased, both in number and impact, as more powerful weapons supplied by the West have made it to the region and are making a difference. Residents in Kherson city have recorded multiple strikes on Russian ammunition depots. Bridges across the Dnipro, including the Antonivskiy, have also been hit multiple times, disrupting Russian supply lines. Thepush to retake Khersoncould be approaching. Sasha believes many of those who have remained in the city are ready to stay and fight; those I've spoken to say support for Russian rule is minimal and the searches, detentions and beatings in recent months have shrunk that still further. ""When the army starts to invade, then people will be ready and will help,"" Sasha says. After his own brutal experience in Russian custody, Oleh is already back on the southern front to fight for his hometown, alongside Ukraine's partisan army. ""They can take the land, but they can't take the people,"" is how he puts it. ""The Russians will never be safe in Kherson, because the people didn't want them there. They don't like them. They won't accept them."" Photographs by Sarah Rainsford.

LiveLiveWagatha Christie: Judgment due in Vardy and Rooney case4 minutes ago,"Rebekah Vardy loses her High Court libel case against Coleen Rooney, in the so-called Wagatha Christie trial She says she is ""extremely sad and disappointed at the decision that the judge has reached"" but does not intend to appeal against the ruling Meanwhile, Rooney says she's pleased the judge ruled in her favour - but that the case should never have gone to trial Vardy sued Rooney for libel after Rooney accused her of leaking her private information to The Sun Vardy denied this, saying she had suffered ""public abuse on a massive scale"" as a result of Rooney's claims But in her ruling, the judge says it is likely Vardy's agent Caroline Watt passed information to The Sun with Vardy's help Edited by Flora Drury We're closing our live coverage now, thanks for joining us. Our page was brought to you by Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Jack Burgess, George Wright, Sam Hancock and Aoife Walsh. Flora Drury and Jeremy Gahagan were editors. So, the ""Wagatha Christie"" libel trial has come to its conclusion, with Rebekah Vardy losing her libel case against Coleen Rooney. But what did the judge actually say - and how did the two women react? Here is a quick catch up of some of the key details: There were some well-known names who came up in the trial. Peter Andre's anatomy was discussed at great length. Or not great length, if you believe what you read in Rebekah Vardy's unflattering kiss-and-tell story about the singer. The News of the World article from 2004 was dredged up again in court. Vardy said the article was ""shameful"" and the now-defunct tabloid had ""misrepresented"" a lot of things she had said. She said she had since messaged Andre and his partner privately. After coverage of the case brought the article back under the microscope, Andre responded online, saying he was glad she had acknowledged she had written it ""because her ex-husband forced her to do it"". The trial judgement accepted that Vardy regretted giving the interview and acknowledged that her words could have been twisted. However, it said there was potential relevance in the fact the interview was given to journalist Jane
Atkinson, who Vardy later spoke to for articles in The Sun in 2017 and 2019. ""Ms Rooney relies on evidence of Ms Vardyâs
relationships with journalists from The Sun as supportive of her case,"" it said. Another TV personality who cropped up in the trial wasGemma Collins. Vardy appeared to concede that, in a WhatsApp message that was read to the court, her agent had admitted leaking a story from Coleen Rooney's private Instagram account about an alleged car crash. After Rooney posted that someone she trusted was betraying her, Watt wrote to Vardy: ""It wasn't someone she trusted. It was me."" Asked why she didn't challenge her agent about that, Vardy said she had been too distracted because she was bathing her children while watching Collins' infamous ""faceplant"" on Dancing On Ice. Although Coleen Rooney successfully defended the libel claim brought against her by Rebekah Vardy, one part of her argument was rejected by the court. Rooney defended the publication of her social media post accusing Vardy of leaking the stories on the basis it was true - and in the public interest. But while the High Court ruled in Rooney's favour, finding the accusation she made was ""substantially true"", it said her ""belief that publication was in the public interest
was not reasonable"". Explaining the decision, thecourt's judgement,externalsaid to successfully defend herself on the grounds of public interest, Rooney would have had to give Vardy an opportunity to respond to the allegation. ""It is no answer to that point that Ms Rooney anticipated that
Ms Vardy would deny the allegation,"" the court added. For a few years now you mightâve been trying to figure out who
coined the term Wagatha Christie. Itâsâ¦ Phoebe Roberts. Back in October 2019, Phoebe was a new mum in London. Holding her three-month-old baby in one arm while scrolling
on her phone with the other, she spotted Coleen Rooneyâs tweet about her online
detective work. ""It was this amazing story with the dot dot dot
ending,"" says Phoebe. ""It had a lot of drama in it. So, I was just like, this
is a detective novel or something, and that's when I came up with Wagatha
Christie.â Her joke was a play on the term Wag and Agatha Christie, who was famous for her detective novels. But although it's made newspaper headlines - and become a nickname for the court case - it didnât lead to a job with the tabloids for Phoebe â
sheâs now living in Belgium as a film curator. ""It is probably my one good joke I've ever made, so I'm
glad I got to share it around,"" she laughs. Phoebe has never made a penny from her online gag, but has
enjoyed finding how far it has travelled. ""When my friends see it around they text me, so I think
you can get it on a phone case, on socks. It's in a lot of strange places now,""
she says. Lizo MzimbaBBC News correspondent Rebekah Vardy seen in a courtroom sketch during the trial I was sitting in Court 13 at the Royal Courts of Justice when Rebekah
Vardy and Coleen Rooney were questioned in the witness box. While both
have spent years in the public eye, giving evidence under oath in a high-profile
trial at the High Court is probably an incredibly intense and difficult
experience. At times, Vardy seemed nervous and edgy. By contrast, Rooney did seem much more relaxed and comfortable. Although it should be
said that the issues Vardy was being questioned on - leaking information and betraying trust - can
be seen as being of a different magnitude to the questions put to Rooney
about the robustness of her ""sting operation"". The judge was fairly unequivocal in her assessment, saying she found it ""necessary to treat Ms Vardyâs evidence with very
considerable caution"" and ""significant parts of Ms Vardyâs evidence were
not credible"". By contrast, she said: ""Ms Rooney was an
honest and reliable witness."" Match of the Day's Gary Lineker has been on the ball with a different type of commentary this afternoon. The ex-England footballer has scored a brace of Twitter jokes so far today - one more and it'll be a hat-trick. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Victoria BourneBBC News It was finally judgement day in the Wagatha Christie case - but here at the Royal Courts of Justice it
felt rather.... quiet. Gone were the dozens of paparazzi, the women at
the centre of the argument, their footballer husbands and expensive legal teams
as, unlike in sentencing a criminal case, today's result was delivered online. During the trial, photographers had to have sharp elbows to get
the prized shots of either Rebekah Vardy or Coleen Rooney arriving at
court.  While they weren't here
today, television news required pictures from outside to help tell the story. As it approached midday, a group of journalists huddled
together in the shadows of the High Court all frantically checking their phones
and laptops. It was at precisely 12:01pm an email landed in my inbox with
Mrs Justice Steyn's 75-page judgement, however not everyone received it and my
BBC colleagues, as well as other broadcasters, were all vying to see the
outcome. Such is the interest of the case, a documentary camera crew was
there to record the moment that we all discovered Rebekah Vardy's case had
been dismissed. Moments later, correspondents sprang into action to share the
news many had been waiting for. Rebekah Vardy has just spoken out after losing her libel case against Coleen Rooney, saying she does not intend to appeal against the ruling. ""The case is over,"" she says in a statement. She also issues plea to people who have been ""abusing me and my family"" to stop. ""As I explained in my evidence I, my family and even my unborn baby, were subjected to disgusting messages and vile abuse following Coleen's Post and these have continued even during the course of the trial."" Rebekah Vardy Vardy says she is ""extremely sad and disappointed at the decision that the judge has reached"", adding that it is not the result that she had expected and does not believe is just. ""I brought this action to vindicate my reputation and am devastated by the judge's finding,"" she says. ""The judge accepted that publication of Coleen's post was not in the 'public interest' and she also rejected her claim that I was the 'Secret Wag'. But as for the rest of her judgement, she got it wrong and this is something I cannot accept."" Colin PatersonBBC News This is what it
came down to: At midday some of Britainâs finest legal minds gathered around an
iPad outside the High Court shouting ""is it there yet? Is it there yet?"" At two minutes past the hour, an email arrived from the Judicial
Official and a massive 290-point document detailing Mrs Justice Steyn's judgement was opened. Suddenly the media lawyer Jonathan Coad and the BBCâs
legal correspondent Dominic Casciani were trying to flick to the bottom to see
the outcome. Iâd not seen fingers moving that quickly outside of a game of
Subbuteo. And there it was, point 290: ""For the reasons
that I have given, the claim is dismissed."" ""Rebekah Vardy
has lost!"" they shouted in unison. A quick read of
the summary revealed things could not have gone much worse for Rebekah
Vardy today. Her evidence was described as ""not credible"". The judge said it was likely that she had deliberately deleted a WhatsApp chat was her ex-agent
Caroline Watt. I thought back to
that moment in May of Vardy's fourth day giving evidence in the
High Court, when Rooneyâs barrister David Sherborne accused Vardy of lying under oath. I was in court sitting no more than five feet from
her and saw her react by putting her head in her hands and heard her
sobbing. Repeatedly. The court was stopped to give her time to recover. At the time
I thought she looked like she was thinking: ""Why on earth have I brought this
court?"" And boy will she
be thinking that today. Natasha JohanssonExecutive producer of the It's... Wagatha Christie podcast The saga sparked the podcast series It's... Wagatha Christie on BBC Sounds When Coleen Rooney revealed her unexpected sleuthing skills with a now famous tweet concluding ""itâsâ¦â¦â¦.. Rebekah Vardyâs
account"", it captured the Twittersphere's imagination. Some Twitter users jokingly asked Rooney if she would consider negotiating Brexit. And the courtroom has had
no shortage of tweeted-about moments. But itâs worth remembering the impact social media trolling has had on Vardy and her family. She described it as ""public abuse on a
massive scaleâ and the judge also said some of what she faced was ""vile"". If you're feeling out of the loop, we covered all the twists and turns on our podcastIt'sâ¦ Wagatha Christie, hosted by Abi Clarke. Subscribe now on BBC Sounds and you'll get notified when we drop another episode poring over the judgement later today. The so-called Wagatha Christie trial has ""captured everybody's imagination"", says Antonia Foster, a partner at the defamation specialist law firm Carter-Ruck. ""I havenât known anything like this,"" she tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""When you step back from it, itâs perhaps not the most serious of disputes, but it certainly commanded a considerable number of column inches."" The case has raised issues about social media and libel laws, and how posting an allegation about someone online compares to publishing one in print. ""As this case has proven, you very much can sue on
allegations published on social media,"" she says. ""I suspect that despite the fact that Coleen
Rooney is the victor today, she probably didnât anticipate that posting would
cause the lengthy trial that it has done."" Shortly after the judgement, Rooney said she felt the case should never have reached court. As we've been hearing, the judge says Rebekah Vardy knew about the disclosure of several of Coleen Rooney's private Instagram posts to the Sun newspaper. It's likely her agent, Caroline Watt, undertook the direct act of passing the information to a Sun journalist, the judgement says. Let's take a closer look at some of posts in question: The car crash post Rooney posted a close-up photo of the side of
a car, showing that it had been crashed into, with the words  above ""RIP half a Honda"". In court, Vardy didn't accept that she told her agent about the post, but the judge didn't accept that, citing earlier text messages exchanged between the pair. The pyjamas post Rooney posted a photo of her husband and their three sons sitting up in bed wearing matching spotted pyjamas. The next day, a headline in the Sun read âWayne Rooney is back at home â and in bed with Coleen â as she shares snaps with pals celebrating Halloween togetherâ. The gender selection post Rooney posted a photo of the back of a plane seat, saying: ""Letâs go and see what this gender selection is all about."" The post was fabricated. An article was later published in the Sun with the headline ""Coleen Rooney travelled to Mexico to
look into Â£8k âgender selectionâ treatment in desperate bid to have baby girl"". The flooded basement post Rooney uploaded a photo of a bottle of wine with the caption: ""Needed after today [grimacing face
emoji]â¦flood in the basement of our new houseâ¦when it seemed to be going so well.â The judgement says there was ""compelling evidence"" that the fabricated post was only visible to Vardy's account. A headline in the Sun later read ""Wayne and Coleen Rooneyâs
Â£20million âMorrisons mansionâ flooded during Storm Lorenzo"". In the last few minutes, we've heard from Coleen Rooney who says she's pleased the judge ruled in her favour - but that the case should never have gone to trial. Rooney says she made ""every effort"" to avoid a ""drawn out and public court case"". Her friend and TV personality Lizzie Cundy says Rooney repeatedly ""reached out to Rebekah [Vardy] to try to come and solve this in some way"" - but to no avail. ""This is three years ago [now],"" she tells Sky News. ""A lot has gone on since then - the pandemic, there's a war in Europe, the high cost of living... and Coleen really didn't want this to go to court."" The entire ordeal was ""such a waste of money"", she adds. Cundy claims that she herself offered to get together with the pair and ""sort this out"" over a ""few Proseccos and some nuts"". And now, she adds, ""maybe Rebekah's thinking 'I should've listened'"". The footballer-turned-managerWayne Rooneywas with his wife throughout the trial, holding her bag and opening doors, but he looked away as she told the court they had split up for a period. His ex-international team-mateJamie Vardy- who scored four goals for Leicester City while the case was going on - made his High Court debut on day six, arriving hand-in-hand with his wife. The football stars seemed to acknowledge one another at first, unlike their other halves. Jamie Vardy's first trip to court came on the day Wayne Rooney testified that then-England manager Roy Hodgson had asked him to have a word with Vardy about his wife being an unwanted distraction around Euro 2016. Wayne recalled the chat in detail, saying he had a coffee while Jamie drank an energy drink. However, Vardy said outside the hearing that no such conversation had taken place. Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent Not only does Mrs Justice Steyn say that Vardy's evidence was ""manifestly inconsistent with the contemporaneous documentary evidence, evasive
or implausible"", as we've been reporting she concluded that the loss of some of her WhatsApp messages with Caroline Watt wasn't an accident, as was claimed in court. The finding that Vardy likely deleted her WhatsApp chat with Watt, her former agent, and that Watt deliberately dropped her phone in the sea is highly significant. It's an assessment that evidence was destroyed, and one that a judge does not make lightly. We've watched the drama between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy play out on social media right from the beginning. So as the Wagatha Christie case closes, it seems fitting to let the people of Twitter who have been following the case have their say: Allow Twitter content?

Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent There's a reason why the London libel courts are busy - if you win, you win big. That's because the stakes are often so high - public figures defending public reputations - and such high-risk work comes at a cost from specialist expert lawyers. Rebekah Vardy's loss means she gets no damages - but Rooney's side are now entitled to send her a whopping bill. In principle they can ask for every penny of her costs - but very often a judge will limit that. So how much? Libel lawyers tell me that Vardy's bill could be north of Â£2m ($2.4m). Given her husband, Jamie Vardy, earns top football wages, it won't mean they'll be on soup and bread - but it is still going to sting. In a statement issued to the PA news agency, Coleen Rooney said: ""Naturally, I am pleased that the judge has found in my favour with her judgement today. ""It was not a case I ever sought or wanted. I never believed it should have gone to court at such expense in times of hardship for so many people when the money could have been far better spent helping others. ""Both before and after my social media posts in October 2019, I made every effort to avoid the need for such a drawn out and public court case. All my attempts to do so were knocked back by Mrs (Rebekah) Vardy. ""This left me with no alternative but to go through with the case to defend myself and to end the repeated leaking of my private information to The Sun. ""These leaks from my private Instagram account began in 2017. They continued for almost two years, intruding on my privacy and that of my family. Although I bear Mrs Vardy no ill-will, today's judgment makes clear that I was right in what I said in my posts of October 2019. ""Finally, I would like to thank all of my legal team, my family, friends and everyone who supported me, including the public, through this difficult and stressful time."" We've been hearing from media lawyer Jonathan Coad, who says the case has been ""an absolute disaster"" for Rebekah Vardy. ""What makes it even more tragic is that four times Coleen really tried to settle this case"", he tells the BBC News channel. Vardy suffered ""terrible brand damage"" during the cross-examination by Coleen Rooney's lawyer, David Sherborne, he says. ""More damaging, though, is that she's
effectively been branded a liar,"" he adds, explaining that Vardy denied
leaking stories under oath. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Asos, Boohoo and Asda probed over green claims","Fast fashion brand Boohoo is one of three companies being investigated The UK's competition watchdog is investigating Asos, Boohoo and Asda over claims about the sustainability of their fashion products. If the firms are found to have made misleading claims, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it would not hesitate to take action. Concerns include the use of vague language which may suggest collections are greener than they actually are. The companies said they were committed to providing accurate information. The CMA's move is part of an ongoing investigation into potential ""greenwashing"", when firms brand something as sustainable when this is not the case, and follows concerns about the way the companies' products are being marketed as eco-friendly. How can I reduce my fashion footprint? Greenwashing tricks: Seven ways not to be fooled Boohoo boss: 'We're not a throwaway fashion brand' An initial review in January identified concerns about potentially misleading claims, including companies making broad statements about the use of recycled materials in new clothing with little or no information about the basis for those claims. Other concerns which will be investigated include whether: statements used by businesses are too broad and vague, and may create the impression that collections - such as the ""Responsible edit"" from Asos, Boohoo's ""Ready for the Future"" range and ""George for Good"" at Asda - are more environmentally sustainable than they actually are the criteria used to decide which products to include in these collections may be lower than customers might reasonably expect from their descriptions - for example, some products may contain as little as 20% recycled fabric some items have been included in these collections when they do not meet the criteria there is a lack of information provided to customers about the products included, such as what the fabric is made from any statements made by the companies about fabric accreditation schemes and standards are potentially misleading, such as a lack of clarity over whether the accreditation applies to particular products or to the firm's wider practices Sarah Cardell, interim chief executive of the CMA, said: ""People who want to 'buy green' should be able to do so confident that they aren't being misled. Eco-friendly and sustainable products can play a role in tackling climate change, but only if they are genuine."" ""Should we find these companies are using misleading eco claims, we won't hesitate to take enforcement action - through the courts if necessary,"" she added. ""This is just the start of our work in this sector and all fashion companies should take note: look at your own practices and make sure they are in line with the law."" Possible actions which could be taken by the CMA include securing undertakings from companies to change the way they operate or taking firms to court. The move comes after the CMA published itsGreen Claims Code,externalin September 2021, which aims to help businesses understand how to communicate their green credentials, while avoiding the risk of misleading shoppers. Asos says its ""Responsible Edit"" collection is made up of products made using recycled and sustainable materials Dr Elaine Ritch, a lecturer in marketing, fashion and sustainability at Glasgow Caledonian University, said greenwashing was ""prevalent"" in the fashion industry and used to encourage more consumption. She gave the example of some companies branding fabrics sustainable because they were organic, but in fact they were very cheap so would wear out quickly. However, she told the BBC she did not think the CMA investigation would have a significant impact and called for tougher regulations, including fines for companies who made misleading claims about sustainability. Asos said it was ""committed to playing its part in making fashion more sustainable"" and was cooperating with the investigation. Rival online fast fashion brand Boohoo said it would ""continue to work collaboratively with the CMA"". The company said it recognised the need to provide customers with ""straightforward and no-nonsense information"". Asda said: ""We know how important it is that our customers can trust the claims we make about our products, which is why we ensure the statements we make can be supported by industry accreditations."" The supermarket chain added that it was ""ready and willing to answer any questions the CMA have"".

"Asos, Boohoo and Asda probed over green claimsConcerns include the use of vague language which may suggest clothes are more eco-friendly than they are.BusinessUkraine's shadow army","Fast fashion brand Boohoo is one of three companies being investigated The UK's competition watchdog is investigating Asos, Boohoo and Asda over claims about the sustainability of their fashion products. If the firms are found to have made misleading claims, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it would not hesitate to take action. Concerns include the use of vague language which may suggest collections are greener than they actually are. The companies said they were committed to providing accurate information. The CMA's move is part of an ongoing investigation into potential ""greenwashing"", when firms brand something as sustainable when this is not the case, and follows concerns about the way the companies' products are being marketed as eco-friendly. How can I reduce my fashion footprint? Greenwashing tricks: Seven ways not to be fooled Boohoo boss: 'We're not a throwaway fashion brand' An initial review in January identified concerns about potentially misleading claims, including companies making broad statements about the use of recycled materials in new clothing with little or no information about the basis for those claims.

Thousands of BT staff walk out in strike over pay,"CWU head Dave Ward talks with striking workers on the picket line Thousands of workers at telecoms giant BT are walking out on Friday in the first of two strikes in a row over pay. Engineers and call centre staff voted in favour of industrial action after BT offered a Â£1,500 per year pay rise. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said the action was the first national telecoms strike since 1987. It has warned the strikes could affect the rollout of ultra-fast broadband, and could cause issues for people working from home. But BT has said it had ""tried and tested processes for large-scale colleague absences"" to minimise disruption. More than 40,000 workers are expected to walk out on Friday, with a second strike planned for Monday. BT has repeatedly said it has made its best pay offer and will not be re-opening the 2022 pay review. The CWU has previously criticised the deal, saying company bosses had ""stuck two fingers up"" to workers. In an interview on the picket line on Friday morning, CWU general secretary Dave Ward said that BT staff urgently needed to have their wages increased in line with inflation. ""Our members are taking strike action after delivering a massive 'yes' vote for the first time in 35 years,"" Mr Ward told the BBC. ""The reason for that is that they're desperate for a substantial pay rise to protect them against the cost of living crisis."" He said BT was in a strong position to pay workers more after recording Â£400m in profit in the first quarter. Mr Ward added that BT had plans to increase its prices by 22% over the course of 2022. ""Our members aren't prepared to put up with that anymore. I actually think it's bigger than the summer of discontent - I think what you're seeing now is working people saying enough's enough right across the UK,"" Mr Ward said. Prices are rising in the UK at the fastest rate for 40 years, prompting workers and unions to call for pay rises to keep up with the cost of living. Several industries, such as the railways, have already seen strikes this summer and more are planned. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar On Thursday, BT revealed its first sales growth for five years as the telecoms firm benefited from price increases for customers earlier this year. The group said it was also boosted by more people signing up for fibre-optic broadband and strong trading in its Openreach network business. The company said revenues increased by 1% to Â£5.1bn for the three months to June 30. BT said it engaged in ""exhaustive discussions"" with the union, before finally deciding on a Â£1,500 payment which is said is its ""highest pay award in more than 20 years"" for workers. ""We have confirmed to the CWU that we won't be reopening the 2022 pay review, having already made the best award we could,"" a statement said. ""While we respect the choice of our colleagues who are CWU members to strike, we will work to minimise any disruption and keep our customers and the country connected.""

Cash for 1000 homes to replace temporary housing,"Thousands of people are stuck in temporary accomodation The Welsh government has promised 1,000 new homes to help people stuck waiting for accommodation. The Â£62m social housing scheme includes bringing unused properties back into use quickly, converting buildings, manufacturing ""modular"" homes and might involve turning offices into homes. The homes will not have to meet the usual standards for new social housing. Plaid Cymru said the plan was ""nowhere near enough"" to match the urgent demand for social housing. Ministers say they will ""actively consider"" converting offices into accommodation if high quality plans for doing so are put forward. In April, 7,999 people were in temporary accommodation, with about a quarter in hotels and B&Bs. Housing charity Shelter Cymru said the figure includes 2,000 children, and that some temporary accommodation is of such extremely poor quality that parents are feeding their families without the use of a kitchen. The number of people in temporary accommodation has risen from 3,566 in August 2020. Landlords fear crisis for renters over housing law Wales set to build 20,000 low-carbon social homes Building of new council homes ramped up This figure includes people housed because of the ""everyone-in"" policy to accommodate homeless people at the start of the pandemic. Councils and social housing providers are bidding for the cash, and it is hoped the Welsh government programme will be completed within the next 18 months. Almost half will be long-term homes, while the rest will be temporary accommodation that could be used as an alternative to B&Bs and hotels. While they will need to follow guidance for properties to be fit for human habitation, social housing providers will not have to meet the standards the Welsh government sets for new social housing. That could mean homes being smaller or the Welsh government even considering shared accommodation. But the homes would still be expected to provide good enough space, insulation and daylight. Of the Â£62m, roughly Â£12m is being spent on bringing 400 homes back to use which are already owned by social housing providers but need significant work. A further Â£12m will be spent on modular homes which are built in a factory. Some existing properties could be remodelled, while others could be demolished and rebuilt. This video can not be played The Welsh government restarted council house building in 2019 Plaid's spokeman for housing, Mabon ap Gwynfor, is concerned the plans did not go far enough. The party said figures from 2020-21 showed 13,161 households were assessed as homeless that year. Mr ap Gwynfor said: ""This investment is to be welcomed insofar as it goes, but it's nowhere near enough to match the urgent and immediate demand. ""We need to see much more ambition from the Welsh government if we are to ensure that those in temporary accommodation get the housing they need."" He added: ""I'm also extremely concerned that, with the significant cost of living increase due to come in in the autumn and winter that those numbers will only go up, with much more demand for urgent housing."" Conservative housing spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders welcomed the new funding but believed there had been a ""missed opportunity"" to seriously tackle homelessness as we moved out of the pandemic. ""Over the course of the pandemic, temporary accommodation was made available for people struggling with homelessness and now we are back to square one,"" she said. ""Labour ministers should have ensured that more was done to move people that were housed over the course of the pandemic into full time accommodation."" Ruth Power, chief executive of housing charity Shelter Cymru, welcomed the Welsh government scheme. She said the charity is seeing more people ""who have been stuck in temporary accommodation for months on end, sometimes waiting a year or more for a place to call home"". ""Some of the accommodation is extremely poor quality, leaving some parents struggling to feed their families without a kitchen, and just a kettle or a microwave to prepare food. ""Living like this, and sharing basic facilities with strangers, takes a massive toll on people's health and on family life, and the numbers keep climbing month by month."" The scheme is separate to the Welsh government's target for20,000 new low-carbon social homes for rent by 2026. Welsh government Climate Change Minister Julie James said: ""We have successfully helped thousands of people into temporary accommodation over the last two-and-a-half years but many more are still going to our local authorities for urgent help. ""Our ambition is for everyone to have a safe, suitable, permanent home but our housing system is under significant pressure, that's why we are building more social homes. ""Where people are in hotel or B&B-based temporary accommodation, in particular, it can be difficult for them to move on with their lives. We need more high-quality interim accommodation options - places they can call their own - to allow people to get on with their lives, while we support them to find a permanent home.""

What is the UK doing on energy bills?,"Energy bills have been rising for households across Europe as prices have been driven up by worries about gas and oil supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Individual countries, and the European Union (EU), have announced support schemes for consumers. Here's what they're doing: In 2021, the EU imported 40% of its gas from Russia - so many of its member states are exposed to high energy prices. In response, the EU is introducing: A cap on gas prices if they exceed â¬180 per megawatt hour for three days running, from February 2022. A ""solidarity levy"" - a windfall tax - on excess profits made by oil, gas, coal and refinery companies in 2022. A cap on the revenues of electricity companies which produce energy from wind, solar and nuclear. These revenues have risen as the price of electricity from these sources is linked to soaring gas prices - the cap is expected to raise â¬140 billion (Â£121bn). A mandatory reduction of electricity consumption in peak hours by 5% across the EU, until March 2023. A voluntary reduction of 10% of overall electricity consumption - individual countries will decide how to to this. In October, the German parliament approved a ""defensive shield"" package worth â¬200bn (Â£175bn). It includesa cap on gas and electricity prices for households and some businessesfrom early next year. The government will pay December's monthly gas bill for all households and small-to-medium businesses. In September and October, all taxpayers received a one-off energy payment â¬300. There has been extra help for people on benefits. Public transport tickets are being subsidised. Germany is trying tocut energy consumption,externalby: Heating public buildings to a maximum of 19C, with exceptions for places like hospitals Turning off hot water for washing hands in public buildings Lighting limits for buildings, monuments and advertising A windfall tax on energy companies will be applied from December 2022 to the end of June 2023. In January, the government forced the state-owned energy provider, ÃlectricitÃ© de France (EDF), to cap price rises at 4% for a year. It says it will cap rises in gas and electricity at 15% for 2023, as part of a â¬45bn (Â£39bn) scheme to support households and businesses. France had already announced a one-off â¬100 (Â£84) payment last year to 5.8 million households receiving energy vouchers. The government plans to reduce energy consumption by 10% by: Capping indoor temperatures at 19C for public buildings Cutting the temperature of public sports facilities by 2C and in public swimming pools by 1C Paying civil servants an extra â¬2.88 per day to work from home, if this allows government buildings to close Speed limits on ski lifts and producing less artificial snow The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in the 2023 budget. France is cutting the temperature in public swimming polls by 1C Italy is expecting to spend about â¬49.5bn (Â£42bn). Its measures include a â¬200 (Â£169) one-off payment to people earning â¬35,000 (Â£29,600) a year or less, and a 20% tax credit for all energy-intensive companies experiencing a 30% rise in prices. The Italian government is also trying to reduce gas consumption by: Asking people to turn central heating down by 1C and turn it off for an extra hour every day Limiting heating in public buildings, with exceptions for hospitals, nurseries and some industries The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in 2023. Since November, electricity and gas prices for households have been capped at January 2022 levels - up to a certain amount of consumption. Any extra use will be charged at market rates. The government is also offering a discount of â¬190 on energy bills in November and December to all households. There is a one-off energy allowance of â¬1,300 to those on lower incomes. VAT on energy bills and tax on petrol and diesel have also been cut. The Dutch government is also introducing: a higher minimum wage lower income tax higher benefits and allowances (such as child benefit, student grants and tax credits) It is expecting to spend â¬15.5bn (Â£13.5bn) on these measures. The Dutch government isadvising households and business,externalto cut consumption, including by turning down heating by 1C. The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies. Spain has cut VAT on energy bills and reduced tax on electricity. Spain and Portugal have introduced a price cap for gas - which will last for one year and aims to halve gas bills for 40% of customers in the two countries. There is also a one-off payment of â¬200 euros for people in Spain who earn less than â¬14,000 a year and are not already receiving benefits. Spain's measures are expected to cost about â¬27bn (Â£23bn). The government has an energy-saving plan which includes limiting air conditioning in public buildings and shops in the summer and keeping heating to 19C in the winter. It wants shops to close their doors when the heating is on and says they should switch off lights after 22:00. The government is introducing a windfall tax on energy companies and banks over the next two years. It has announced plans for an energy price support package for households, worth 26.8bn zlotys (Â£4.8bn). It incudes freezing energy prices for 2023 at this year's level, with a limit of 2,000 kWh per year for most households. There will be higher thresholds for households with people with disabilities and for families with three or more children. The government has abolished VAT on food, gas and fertilizer and reduced it on petrol, diesel and energy bills. There is also a new mandatory 10% electricity saving for national and local government public administrations. Households that reduce electricity use by 10% in 2023 compared with 2022, will be rewarded with an additional discount. Norway has set a maximum price that households should pay for their energy - anything over this, the government will pay 80% of the bill. A new package of loans and subsidies for businesses was announced in September. This will cover companies that spend more than 3% of revenue on power costs. The government has also proposed new taxes on onshore wind and hydropower energy, to redistribute some of the huge increase in profits over the past year. The UK government has brought in a cap on the price of a unit of energy until April 2023, which will mean the typical household bill for gas and electricity will be Â£2,500 a year. This is being extended to April 2024, but typical bills will be capped at Â£3,000 a year. There will be more support for those on benefits and for pensions households. How does the energy price cap work? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies? Energy advice: Sunak to expand tips campaign to lower bills The government brought in a windfall tax on UK oil and gas firms' profits which is expected to raise Â£5bn a year. This is being increased and extended. Previously, the government introduced anenergy bill discount of Â£400for every household with some extra support for people on benefits. The UK government launched a public information campaign on how to save energy in November, which was later than other countries in Europe.

"Depp makes Â£3m in hours through sales of his artThe Hollywood actor sold paintings of ""inspiring"" figures including Rolling Stone Keith Richards.London","Johnny Depp said he ""surrounds himself with art"" but had kept his paintings to himself Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has made about Â£3m in just a few hours through a sale of his debut art collection. Depp sold 780 prints through Castle Fine Art's 37 galleries, including in London's Covent Garden, within hours of announcing the sale on Instagram. The Friends And Heroes collection depicts people who have inspired him, including Rolling Stone Keith Richards and Hollywood actress Elizabeth Taylor. ""I've always used art to express my feelings,"" the 59-year-old said. ""My paintings surround my life, but I kept them to myself and limited myself. No one should ever limit themselves."" The actor said he used his art, which also depicted actor Al Pacino and folk legend Bob Dylan, to ""reflect on those who matter most to me, like my family, friends and people I admire"". The Hollywood actor sold paintings of ""inspiring"" figures including (l-r) Keith Richards, Elizabeth Taylor and Bob Dylan All 780 pieces sold within hours on Thursday, with framed individual images going for Â£3,950 and the complete portfolio of four images selling for Â£14,950. Depp's post on Instagram, captioned only ""NOW AT #CASTLEFINEART"", prompted a rush of traffic to the gallery's website causing it to crash. In a press release, the gallery described the actor's work as existing ""at the intersection of pop art and street art"" and as ""pop art with feeling"". The gallery had long been in talks with Mr Depp about staging an exhibition and sale of his work, and expects to host more of it in the future. The sale comes after theconclusion of Mr Depp's high-profile US court caseagainst his ex-wife Amber Heard last month. A jury found a 2018 article Heard wrote for the Washington Post about her experiences as a survivor of domestic abuse to be defamatory and awarded $15m (Â£12m) in compensatory and punitive damages to Depp. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp were in court in Virginia during the televised six-week trial this year Heard won one of three counter-claims, successfully arguing Depp's press agent defamed her, with the jury awarding her Â£1.5m ($2m) in damages. The case followed his UK libel caseagainst the Sun newspaper in November 2020, which he lost,over an article that called him a ""wife beater"". The judge said the paper had proved what was in the article to be ""substantially true"".

Seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth,"Leaders and representatives from across the Commonwealth are expected to come to London for the Coronation of King Charles III on 6 May. Some of these countries were previously in the British Empire, some are still British dominions, while others had no colonial links to Britain but have chosen to join the global club. Here are seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth. About 2.5 billion people - out of a global population of eight billion -live in the 56 Commonwealth countries,external. More than 60 per cent of the Commonwealth's population is aged 29 or under. Globally, a third of all young people aged between 15 and 29 live in Commonwealth countries. The biggest country by population is India, which accounts for about half of the total. Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh are the next biggest countries by population, with the UK fifth. King Charles is the head of state in 14 Commonwealth countries - or realms - in addition to the UK. Most countries in the club are republics - withBarbados the last to remove the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021. Five countries - Lesotho, Eswatini (previously known as Swaziland), Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Tonga - have their own monarch. King Charles remains head of state in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, although for many years there has been an active movement in Australia in favour of becoming a republic. The country's central bank has announced thatCharles will not feature on Australia's new $5 note. What does the King do? Rwanda and Mozambique became members in 2009 and 1995 respectively,although neither were colonised by the British.,externalRwanda was previously under the rule of Germany and Belgium. Rwanda was colonised by Germany and Belgium, not the UK Former French colonies Gabon and Togo are the most recent joiners,becoming members in June 2022,external. Why ex-French colonies are joining the Commonwealth The club has also lost members. South Africa withdrew in 1961 after it was criticised by Commonwealth members for its apartheid policies. It became a member again in 1994. Pakistan was thrown out after a military coup in 1999, but was readmitted in 2004. Membership was suspended again between 2007 and 2008. Former president of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe took his country out in 2003 after its membership was suspended amid reports of election rigging. It applied for re-admission in 2018, but no decision has been reached. The last country to leave wasthe Maldives in 2016, but it re-joined in 2020. The Commonwealth makes up a quarter of the world's land mass. The giant of the group is Canada, the world's second largest country by area. India and Australia are huge too. The late Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh in Tuvalu in 1982 But many of the member countries are small - such as the Pacific island nations of Nauru, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, and Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica in the Caribbean. Thirty-three of the world's 42 small states are part of the Commonwealth. Prince Philip: The Vanuatu tribes mourning the death of their 'god' The UK is no longer the biggest economy in the Commonwealth, according to thelatest GDP numbers from the International Monetary Fund,external, with India overtaking it for the first time in 2022. The combined GDP of the 56 members is more than $13tn (Â£10.8tn). That's more than twice the size of Japan ($5tn, Â£3.75tn), but some way behind the US at $23tn (Â£17.2tn). Trade with the Commonwealth accounted for9% of the UK's total trade in 2021,external- around the same as the UK's total trade with Germany. The UK exported goods and services worth Â£62.6bn to the rest of the Commonwealth, while imports from member states totalled Â£58.2bn The modern Commonwealth was formed in 1949, after ""British"" was dropped from the name and allegiance to the Crown was removed. The Commonwealth heads of government in London in 1969 Only three people have been head of the organisation - King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III. It'snot a hereditary role,although the Commonwealthaccepted King Charles as its head in 2018, when he was Prince of Wales. The organisation is run from London by its secretary-general, currently Baroness Scotland. She was re-elected to a second term in June 2022,despite facing criticism from some member statesover her performance. The other founding members were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and Sri Lanka. The Commonwealth Charter was adopted in 2012, andcommits members to the values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security,external. The Commonwealth has been criticised for being a post-colonial club and for having little influence in the modern world. Supporters argue the benefits which membership brings include developmental support and co-operation on international goals. Russia president Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with the Commonwealth of Independent States Russia and a number of other former members of the Soviet Union set up the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991. It aimed to coordinate economic, defence, immigration and foreign policy across the bloc, although this proved difficult in practice. Georgia withdrew in 2009 after Russia seized part of its South Ossetia territory. Ukraine withdrew its membership in 2018. There is another group called the International Organisation of La Francophonie - an alliance of French-speaking countries which aims to promote the French language and increase mutual co-operation.

Birmingham 2022 - how green are the Games?,"This video can not be played Birmingham 2022 - How green are the Games? The Commonwealth Games begin next week and will involve athletes from 72 nations and territories taking part in the biggest sporting programme in the event's history. Around 6,500 competitors and officials will travel to Birmingham for the Games, which feature 19 sports and eight Para-sports and run from 28 July to 8 August. The scale of the event provides plenty of challenges, chief among them the question of how to stage a global sporting competition in an environmentally sustainable way. These Games take place almost exactly a year after a major United Nations report warned of the need for deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions - and just over a week after UN secretary general AntÃ³nio Guterres told governments the world is facing""collective suicide"",externalin the face of deadly heat extremes. With all this in mind, the organisers of Birmingham 2022 have committed to making this year's Games""the most sustainable yet"".,external So what issues do they face, what are they doing and do their claims stand up to scrutiny? The Alexander Stadium was opened in 1976 and has been redeveloped for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, where it will host athletics and Para-athletics The Commonwealth Games is far from alone in trying to find ways to host a major event while also mitigating the environmental impact. The football World Cup in Qatar later this year is estimated by organisers Fifa to produce around 3.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide, which would be more than some countries' annual emissions. ""Global sporting events have a huge impact on the environment,"" David Goldblatt, a researcher investigating the relationship between sport and the climate crisis toldthe BBC's Costing the Earth programme. ""There is an enormous amount of carbon in the construction that goes into staging an event. Then there's a lot of lighting, pumps, air conditioning, a huge amount of food and drink. ""There's also the transport, with a large number of athletes, media, fans and officials often travelling long distances to be involved."" Listen: Costing the Earth: Sustainable Sport for the Future Does European football care about its climate impact? The climate cost of a continent-wide Euros Construction of venues, as well as travel, energy and food are the biggest contributors to any event's carbon footprint. Birmingham 2022 will take place across 15 venues, with a focus on renovation and development of existing sites. Established venues such as Arena Birmingham will host gymnastics, Coventry Arena will stage judo and wrestling and T20 cricket will take place at Edgbaston. ""Ninety-five per cent of the venues are being reused,"" said Jess Fidler, head of sustainability for Birmingham 2022. ""There's been some rejuvenation at Alexander Stadium [athletics and Para-athletics] and at Sandwell [diving, aquatics, swimming and Para-swimming]. But every other site already existed and that reuse and repurpose is absolutely key from a sustainability perspective."" Fidler said Commonwealth Games organisers want their approach to leave a ""carbon-neutral legacy"". ""We've measured our footprint using the best data available and we've focused on the hotspots of transport, energy and food to drill down into how we can reduce those emissions,"" she said. ""When you buy your Games ticket public transport is included, so that's a way of encouraging people out of their cars. That's a great way to reduce the footprint of the Games but also to get people thinking about using public transport generally. ""There has also been a big focus on local, seasonal food. Some of the caterers are doing carbon labelling [making clear the environmental impact of producing a specific item]. There's been a big focus on waste, using biodegradable food packaging and people knowing what to put in what bin. Small changes like that can make a big impact. ""We've also created a partnership with Severn Trent [water company] from an offsetting perspective where they will plant 2,022 acres over a period of time and that will offset the emissions of the Games."" Carbon offsetting is controversial, withsome scientists and campaignerssaying it can be a barrier to behavioural change. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains the basics of carbon offsetting ""The current forecast is for those 2,022 acres to sequester 240,000 tonnes of carbon, which at the moment is about two thirds of our footprint,"" said sustainability officer and ex-England hockey player Joanna Leigh, who views the planting of the Commonwealth Forest as one important part of the Games' strategy. ""We'll measure our final footprint at the end of the Games and that will be verified by a third party. If we are a little bit over then we'll make sure we top up that 240,000 tonnes with credible carbon offsets."" The question is whether organisers of major events are doing enough - and whether what they say they are doing has the impact they hope for. ""I'm really delighted that these are serious documents [the sustainability plans and pledges] but there are quite a few problems,"" said Goldblatt, who adds that the 2004 Athens Olympics and 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics are examples of ambitions not being met. ""The first is that these can be used as a get-out-of-jail-free card. ""The second is many offset schemes in the past have proved to be unsuccessful - reforested trees have not grown, they weren't planted properly in the first place and the claims collapse. ""Also, many of these reforestation and carbon capture schemes will do their best work in 30 years or more and we really need to make massive and significant change over the next 10-20 years."" Severn Trent says the estimated period for offsetting the 2022 Gamesis 35 years.,external Dr Russell Seymour, chief executive of the British Association for Sustainability in Sport, told BBC Sport Birmingham 2022 is ""setting a high standard"". ""They have taken a comprehensive approach to sustainability,"" he said. ""Birmingham have approached this in a methodical way. They have been very clear in what they can and can't do and realistic also in the way they are reporting [their data]. They're very careful to avoid any kind of 'greenwash'. ""They are being clear that, yes, there are going to be impacts, but they're doing their absolute best to try to mitigate those. Birmingham 2022 is probably doing more than many other major events have."" So is there more organisers of these Games could be doing? ""There are lots more things we'd like to do with more time and more resource,"" added Leigh. ""Hopefully in the future we'd have a fully electric fleet of vehicles - we haven't got that because the market can't supply those yet. ""There's no perfect offsetting solution but ultimately we are taking responsibility for the carbon we produce. We are trying to be as transparent as we can be."" Fiona Burnet, who plays hockey for Scotland and is a member of EcoAthletes, told BBC Scotland: ""Birmingham is a really positive example where they are trying to have a carbon-neutral legacy. ""They are taking steps which are really positive and hopefully other major events will look at Birmingham, a multi-sport event with 72 countries, and think 'if they can do it then why can't we?'. ""If we want to enjoy these huge events in the future then changes need to be made.""
