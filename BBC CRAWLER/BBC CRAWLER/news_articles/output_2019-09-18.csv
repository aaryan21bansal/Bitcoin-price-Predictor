Four lessons on energy and climate change,"Part ofLearn & revise Save to My Bitesize But in the near future, how we generate, use and store it could look very different. The UK has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions to ânet zeroâ by 2050 - and this means big changes. But what are the challenges of supplying reliable and affordable energy? What impact will it have on our lives and how much is it going to cost? BBC News has looked at the latest research on energy and has translated it into a clear and comprehensive visual guide calledBBC Briefing. Here are four things you will learn from reading the Briefing on Energy. The UK currently accounts for about 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Compared with the big emitters USA, China and India it looks like we are doing well, but any reduction would have a limited impact globally. So what does ânet zeroâ actually mean? One thing the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) argues that in reaching net zero, the UK must not increase emissions produced overseas on its behalf. Read more about how action on climate change is aglobal and shared responsibility. You may have heard about rich celebrities paying to have their jet set lifestyles carbon offset - but is it possible to buy your way out? From tree planting to extracting carbon from the air, it all sounds very simple, but methods of capturing and storing carbon are in the very early stages. To have any real impact there would need to be major changes to how we heat our homes and how vehicles and businesses are powered. These methods would of course mean big lifestyle changes and the adoption of new technology. BBC Briefing has looked athow carbon can be captured and stored, and how smart technology will play a big role in making us become more energy aware and energy efficient. Road vehicles emit more than 90% of the UK's transport-based CO2 and a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles in the UK starts in 2040, with the Scottish government pledging and earlier ban in 2032. Elon Musk, Founder and CEO of electric car maker Tesla, said the company ""will not stop until every car on the road is electric."" But electric vehicles are nothing new. They have actually been around for almost two centuries. Learn more abouta battery-powered train and the electric cars of the 1800s, and about governmentâs plans for electric vehicles. The move to net-zero emissions by 2050 will need widespread change and investment - and providing secure reliable, safe and affordable energy for everyday life wonât come cheap. In June 2019 Chancellor Phillip Hammond claimed the 2050 ""total cost of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy is like to be well in excess of a trillion poundsâ â but who foots the bill? Electricity costs will likely increase and the impact on customers will depend on how overall costs are split between households, industry and government.

The five major challenges facing electric vehicles,"Encouraging more people into electric vehicles is at the heart of the government's efforts to tackle climate change. That's becausetransport accounts for 23% of the UK's CO2 emissions,external- more than any other sector. Sales of all-electric vehicles are up 70% on last year, leading to suggestions that we have reached a turning point. But there are good reasons to remain cautious. One of the UK's best-selling cars is the all-electric Tesla Model 3. But its success doesn't change the fact thatonly about 1.1% of new cars,externalsold this year are electric, and that the market for used electric vehicles hardly exists. As it takes most UK drivers anywhere between one and 15 years to change their vehicles, many of us won't be thinking about buying an electric model any time soon. Bigger changes are needed. We will need many more places for charging electric vehicles, for example. And because fuel tax is an important source of income for the government - and electric vehicle users pay lower taxes - changes to the tax system may be required. Individuals and businesses also need to be convinced that electric vehicles suit their needs. This is perhaps the hardest part. Read more about the ""transport revolution"" in energy, in the BBC Briefing,external The government aims to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2040,a target criticised by MPs who want the change made by 2030. But even if these goals are met, it is likely to be decades before the most common vehicles on our roads are electric ones. The number of vans on the UK's roads is increasing faster than any other type of vehicle, in part because of the rapid growth in online shopping Small e-vans are already available and the choice on offer is only likely to increase. It is difficult to compare prices for diesel and e-vans. However, it can be significantly more expensive to lease an electric version of a popular van, than a diesel one. This is likely to mean that electric vans remain unaffordable for many small firms and self-employed delivery drivers for some time. There is more choice for those looking for a new car, but electric vehicles are disproportionately aimed at the higher end of the market. Few all-electric models are available for less than Â£20,000, and buying a new Tesla Model 3 costs about Â£37,000. Prices are likely to continue to fall and operating an electric vehicle tends to be cheaper than a petrol or diesel equivalent. But the higher upfront costs may stop many drivers from buying electric vehicles for the foreseeable future, even when a vibrant second-hand market emerges. There are rapid developments in battery and charging technology, but this is causing deep uncertainty. Which charging technologies will become the gold standard? This is a particular problem for people living in apartment blocks, or houses without a private parking space. Should they expect charging to be available at bollards or lamp posts along their street? Perhaps home charging will not be as important as it is now. Should drivers use facilities at petrol stations, their office or in empty supermarket car parks at night? Other options being explored include induction pads embedded in major roads, which charge cars as they drive over them. BBC Briefing is a mini-series of downloadable guides to the big issues in the news, with input from academics, researchers and journalists. It is the BBC's response to audiences demanding better explanation of the facts behind the headlines. Download your updated BBC Briefing on Energy,external(PDF 10.4MB) Should we stop flying? Are cities as bad for the environment as we think? The road to clean energy This uncertainty about which approach will become most common slows down private sector investment in charging infrastructure. It also makes the role of local authorities more difficult. Acting too soon could mean betting on the wrong horse. Waiting too long could encourage more people into hybrid vehicles, which are less dependent on charging infrastructure, but still use fossil fuels. Even when a standard design for charging emerges, the age-old question of who will pay for installing it remains. It is widely assumed that the private sector will build, operate and maintain charging infrastructure in the UK. But businesses have long been slow to get involved, in part because profit margins remain small and government has heavily subsidised the development of charging points. This is slowly changing: BP and Shell have taken over market leaders Chargemaster and Newmotion, and Tesla is actively rolling out its own charging network at motorway service stations. More like this Six things that affect your chance of a pay rise Who are the smokers that haven't quit? The vegetarian 'meat' aimed at replacing the real thing Why so many people leave London Yet the question remains: how large should the government's contribution be in future infrastructure development? If getting people into electric vehicles is for the public good, should local government pay for charging points in areas where demand is too low to offer healthy profits? And how should investment compare with that in social care, libraries or safe cycling routes, especially when local authority budgets remain as tight as they currently are? Even 100% electric vehicles are not a zero-carbon solution. They may not produce the usual exhaust pipe emissions, but even if all of the UK's electricity was from renewable sources, there would still be an environmental cost. Sourcing the minerals used for batteries, dismantling batteries which have deteriorated, and building and delivering vehicles to customers worldwide all involve substantial CO2 emissions. It is impossible to break all of the links. Electric vehicles are a crucial part of the UK's attempts to drastically reduce transport's emissions. Yet they are no panacea. A large shift away from motorised vehicles is the only way to fundamentally reduce transport's contribution to climate change, however hard and politically unpalatable that may be.

Giving birth two million years ago was 'relatively easy'Why is human childbirth so long and difficult? Scientists may have the answer from studying fossils.,"Human childbirth can be a long, painful, drawn-out process, needing assistance and sometimes taking days. So why do close living relatives like chimps have an easier labour, giving birth in hours and on their own? In an attempt to answer this evolutionary question, scientists have been looking at how ancient members of the human family tree gave birth. Human-like relatives two million years ago had it ""pretty easy"", according to birth reconstruction in a fossil. ForAustralopithecus sediba, which lived 1.95 million years ago in South Africa, we see ""a relatively easy birth process"", says study researcher Dr Natalie Laudicina. ""The foetal head and shoulder breadth have ample space to pass through even the tightest dimensions of the maternal birth canal,"" she says. It's a different story today, where the size and shape of the modern pelvis (a trade-off needed for walking upright), and the large size of a baby's head, make for a tight fit. Human infants have to make several rotations through the birth canal during labour, rather than popping straight out. By studying the few female pelvises we have of our ancient human-like relatives - only six spanning more than three million years of evolution - researchers can get an idea of what birth might have been like further back in the human family tree. Reconstructing birth in Australopithecus sediba It's not the case, though, that birth became progressively more difficult during the course of human evolution. As the University of Boston anthropologist explains, the fossil ""Lucy"" (Australopithecus afarensis) had a more difficult birth process thanA. sediba, in terms of a tighter fit between the foetus and the birth canal, but lived about a million years earlier. Caesarean births 'affecting evolution' Human origins story takes new turn Advanced ape skull find changes human origin ideas ""There is a tendency to think about the evolution of human birth as a transition from an 'easy', ape-like birth to a 'difficult', modern birth,"" says Dr Laudicina, who reports the team's findings in the journal,Plos One,external. ""Instead, what we are seeing is that is not the case. "" Answering the question of when modern childbirth evolved is complicated, she says, because each fossil in the human family tree exhibited their own obstetric challenges. And even today we see variation in how women give birth: some women have relatively easy births that take no time at all, while other women have births that last more than 20 hours with extreme pain.

"US Fed cuts rates for second time since 2008The US central bank has cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, but is split over future moves.","Chairman Jerome Powell voted in favour of the cut The US central bank has cut interest rates for only the second time since 2008, amid concerns about slowing global growth and trade wars. As expected, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for its key interest rate by 25 basis points to between 1.75% and 2%. President Trump reacted by attacking Fed chairman Jerome Powell for lacking ""guts"". Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed for cutting rates too slowly. The president took to Twitter in the minutes immediately following the rate cut announcement to lambast the move: ""Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No ""guts,"" no sense, no vision!  A terrible communicator!"". The bank said the cut is aimed at shoring up the US economy, amid ""uncertainties"" about future growth. But officials were divided about the decision and over the need for future cuts. Seven members of the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee, which sets the rates, voted in favour of Wednesday's cut, including Mr Powell. Two members wanted to hold the rate steady, while one wanted to cut further. Federal Reserve policymakers divided over US rate cuts Why the Fed's interest rate move matters Mr Powell said policymakers decided on a second cut after global growth slowed and trade tensions worsened over the summer. ""The thing we can't address really is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade ... but we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness to some extent,"" he said, referring to the rate cut. However, he dismissed the need for negative interest rates - a proposal backed by Mr Trump - as ""not at the top of the list"". The comments underscored the strain between Mr Powell and the president, who has sought to blame the Fed for economic slowdown, while waging trade wars with China, Europe and others.

Cutting rates helps fuel economic activity, by making it cheaper to borrow money for both businesses and consumers. But with interest rates in the US already low by historic standards - and much of the economic uncertainty caused by the trade war with China - analysts have questioned how much rate cuts will help. US share markets fell after the announcement, but later recovered. The Fed's decision to lower rates on Wednesday follows a similar cut in July and marks a reversal from its policy only a year ago, when America's healthy economy had convinced policy makers to enact a series of small hikes. But US economic growth slowed to 2% in the second quarter, job creation has slipped and inflation remains lower than US policymakers would like. In recent days, parts of the financial markets have also shown signs of a cash-crunch, temporarily pushing short-term interest rates above the Fed's target and prompting the bank to intervene. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent The cut in interest rates was of course the headline from this Fed meeting. But the Chairman Jerome Powell also commented on some developments in the US financial system that have really had people scratching their heads this week. There was a sharp rise in borrowing costs in a rather arcane corner of the financial system known as the repo (repurchase) market which firms use to raise or lend cash for short periods. What was going on? Could it be a warning sign of serious stress somewhere in the financial world? The crisis a decade ago has made people more sensitive to that kind of possibility. Mr Powell said it was due to companies needing a lot of cash for tax payments and for investors buying government bonds. Although the Fed and the markets knew these developments were coming, Mr Powell said they ""had a bigger effect than most folks anticipated"". He said these issues have no implications for the economy.  So, flap over? Maybe. Let's hope so. In economic projections released on Wednesday, Federal Reserve policymakers said they expect the economy to grow 2.2% this year, faster than they forecast in June. Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said the upgrade to that growth prediction underscores the fact that the Fed is worried about global factors, such as the trade war, rather than the underlying health of the US economy. ""This move is all about the deterioration in the global economic outlook over the late summer and very little about incoming US data,"" he said. ""While the Fed has maintained its 'will act as appropriate' language, we still see this as an insurance policy move and don't expect a series of further rate cuts,"" he added.

Man City ease to victory at Shakhtar,"Gundogan scored his first goal of the season for Manchester City Manchester City bounced back from their shock Premier League defeat at Norwich by launching their Champions League campaign in style with a deserved victory at Shakhtar Donetsk. Humbled at Carrow Road on Saturday evening, the English champions were imperious in Ukraine against an initially tenacious, but ultimately inferior, opponent. Riyad Mahrez opened the scoring midway through the first half, firing into a largely empty net after Ilkay Gundogan's curling shot came back off the post. Mahrez then turned provider for the onrushing German to toe-poke the ball past the helpless Andriy Pyatov and give the visitors a firm grip on the game - a grip they did not relinquish. After spurning a number of good opportunities, including an untypically forgiving close-range effort from Raheem Sterling that struck the post, Gabriel Jesus gave the one-sided game a more fitting scoreline with a neat finish after Kevin de Bruyne's pass. Only Dinamo Zagreb's 4-0 hammering of Italian side Atalanta in Croatia prevents Pep Guardiola's side topping the group. Fernandinho: Pep Guardiola had no doubts over Brazilian's defensive ability Gabriel Jesus has scored four goals from six shots on target versus Shakhtar in the Champions League City's 3-2 defeat by Norwich left them five points behind leaders Liverpool (the side they pipped to last season's title) with just five games played. But they have the start they wanted in the Champions League - the only trophy Guardiola has yet to deliver to the Etihad - after arguably the toughest game of a group from which they are favourites to qualify. There was little of the apprehensive defending on display in Norfolk and a far greater level of fluency and attacking verve as the home side's largely counter-attacking attempts were regularly repelled and their defence repeatedly unpicked. Restored to the starting XI, De Bruyne was full of intelligent runs and passes to match, while the direct and pacy trio of Mahrez, Sterling and Jesus (who scored three against the same opponent in a 6-0 win last November) terrorised the home back four. But for some wayward finishing, City could well have matched the scoreline they racked up against Shakhtar in that game at the Etihad a little under a year ago. Regardless, City's recent dominance over a side who are their regular Champions League opponents continues, with this their fourth win in five encounters, the only defeat of which came in a dead rubber at the end of the group stage in 2017-18. City have been plunged into something of a defensive injury crisis of late as a result of the muscle injury that hasconsigned John Stones to a spell on the sidelinesalongside fellow centre-backAymeric Laporte, who is out until the new year. In their absence, Fernandinho - a midfielder by trade but long touted as a potential central defender by Guardiola - made the short move into the back four in Ukraine, alongside Nicolas Otamendi. If, as expected, the Brazilian is to be the man to deputise at the back (and he hinted as much after the game by admitting he had been training as a defender since the start of the season), he will have sterner tests than this, but what he was required to do, he did well. Two interceptions, two solid headers won and a passing accuracy of 90% make for a quietly efficient night. Shakhtar's best opportunities fell to Junior Moraes, but after three times finding himself with just Edersen to beat he first struck the Brazilian's chest with a shot, then missed the ball completely with an attempted flick finish before floating a lob harmlessly off target after the City keeper had rushed out of his box. They sent on wily and capable Ukraine international Yevhen Konoplyanka and Brazilians Marcos Antonio and Dentinho but to zero alteration to the flow of the game. Meanwhile, City were able to give Benjamin Mendy a first run-out of the season and some minutes to Joao Cancelo - a clear indication that while they currently lack depth in some defensive areas they are spoilt for choice in others. Since the start of the 2017-18 Champions League campaign, only James Milner (10) has recorded more assists in the competition than Kevin de Bruyne (9) Shakhtar Donetsk have conceded 15 goals in their five meetings with Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League; the most they've conceded against an opponent in the competition. Manchester City have kept clean sheets in four of their five Champions League matches against Shakhtar Donetsk, double the amount than they have versus any other side. Since the start of 2016-17 campaign, only Real Madrid (84) and Bayern Munich (72) have scored more Champions League goals than Pep Guardiola's Man City (71). Shakhtar Donetsk have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 17 UEFA Champions League matches (36 goals conceded). Riyad Mahrez has had a hand in seven goals in seven Champions League appearances for Man City (2 goals, 5 assists).

Cameron 'sought Queen's help' during Scottish vote,"This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron explains how he sought the Queen's help in Scottish independence vote Former PM David Cameron has revealed he asked whether the Queen could ""raise an eyebrow"" about the prospect of Scotland voting for independence. He told the BBC he sought help from royal officials days before the 2014 vote amid ""mounting panic"" he may lose. What was discussed was not ""anything that would be in any way improper... but just a raising of the eyebrow even... a quarter of an inch"", he said. The Queen laterurged people to ""think very carefully about the future"". The comments - made to a well-wisher outside a church on the Balmoral estate - were one of the main talking points of the referendum campaign. Reflecting on his rise to power and six years in Downing Street in a two-part BBC documentary, Mr Cameron said the Queen's words on the issue were ""very limited but helped to put a slightly different perception on things"". Forget Brexit - what else does Cameron's book tell us? Cameron: Johnson and Gove behaved 'appallingly' PM apology to Queen for 'purr' claim Scotland went on to reject independence by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7%, a result which Mr Cameron said left him ""blissfully happy"". In a statement, Alex Salmond, who resigned as Scotland's first minister in the wake of the result, said Mr Cameron's actions were not only improper, but showed how desperate the No side was during the final stages of the independence campaign. This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron criticises Boris Johnson's motives for supporting Leave campaign The Cameron Years, which begins on Thursday, examines Mr Cameron's modernisation of the party, his decision to enter a coalition with the Liberal Democrats after the 2010 election and the fallout from 2016 Brexit referendum, which led to his resignation. In it, he says: He ""broods"" every day about the Brexit referendum and its consequences He ignored George Osborne's advice against the poll and Michael Gove's reservations Boris Johnson ""agonised"" over his position and ""did not really want to leave"" the EU He still believes Brexit can ""be delivered and made to work"" His government's austerity programme was ""painful"" but necessary Legalising gay marriage was perhaps his ""proudest"" achievement in office On the EU referendum, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he ""wasn't the slightest bit complacent"" during the campaign, saying that he fought ""with every fibre of my being"". But he said the Labour leadership during the campaign ""simply wasn't there, wasn't committed"" and it was ""very hard to fight these things on your own"". He added that the result would ""probably have been even worse"" if people knew he would quit if Leave won the vote. Just as the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club, the first rule of the relationship between the prime minister and the Queen is that you never, ever talk about the relationship between the PM and the Queen. It is difficult to imagine anything other than horror in the Palace at David Cameron's revelations. Not just because he has broken the first rule. But because he has made it painfully clear that in 2014 he used the Queen for his own political purposes. And that she and her advisors thought that was OK. The revelation comes as her suspension of Parliament - a suspension made on the effective instruction of Boris Johnson - comes under unprecedented scrutiny in the Supreme Court. The two cases are very different; but they both highlight the dark greys of the Queen's constitutional position, the discretion she has or lacks, under extraordinary circumstances, to speak out and act. In the run-up to the 18 September poll on Scottish independence, it was reported that the Queen was concerned about the possibility of Scotland opting to sever the 300-year union with England and Wales. A Sunday Times poll on 7 September putting the Yes campaign ahead contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street, Mr Cameron recalls. The poll, which was published while he and his wife, Samantha, were staying at Balmoral, ""hit me like a blow to the solar plexus"". A poll finding the Yes campaign in front contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street Mr Cameron - who agreed to hold the independence referendum in the face of opposition within his party - said there followed urgent conversations between advisers in Downing Street and Buckingham Palace to figure out how the Queen could comment while still remaining within the constitutional boundaries of neutrality. ""I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen's private secretary and I had with the Queen's private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional but just a raising of the eyebrow even, you know, a quarter of an inch. We thought would make a difference."" Buckingham Palace insisted that the Queen was above politics When asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme for more detail about what had happened, Mr Cameron said he ""didn't want to say anything more about this"". ""I'm sure that some people would think, possibly even me, that I've already said perhaps a little bit too much,"" he said. At the time, the BBC's royal correspondent said the Queen's words were ""more of an observation than an intervention"", while Buckingham Palace said any suggestion the Queen was seeking to influence the outcome of the referendum was ""categorically wrong"". Officials insisted the monarch was above politics, and the issue of Scotland's future was a matter for the people. Two weeks after the Scottish referendum, Mr Cameron was forced to apologise after suggesting the Queen ""purred down the phone"" when she was told about the No result. While he feels ""sorry"" about events since the 2016 Brexit vote, Mr Cameron said he did not regret the decision to hold the EU referendum. While some people would ""never forgive"" him, he maintained the UK's 40-year membership was becoming ""unstable"" and the duty of leaders was to ""see difficulties coming and try to resolve them and shape the country's response to them"". He accepted he ""totally underestimated the latent Leave gene"" in his party and that during the campaign while ""he had a winning hand, he could not seem to play it"". After losing the vote, Mr Cameron said he knew he had to quit because he did not have the ""credibility to deliver Brexit"", but was ""desperately sad"" his time in office was cut short. Mr Cameron said the coalition government staved off a financial crisis ""I think of all the things we could and should have done if we had been able... to win the referendum,"" he recalls. ""A whole lot of what we could have done effectively ran into the sand of the European issue."" On his economic and social record, he rejects as ""total nonsense"" opponents' claims that he embraced deep spending cuts as a political choice to reduce the size of the state. He says the multi-billion pound budget deficit inherited by his government in 2010 was a ""clear and present danger to the British economy"" requiring immediate action. ""In the end there were difficult and painful decisions, but inequality fell and the share of income tax paid by the richest went up, not down,"" he argued. ""We protected pensioners, we protected the NHS, we protected help for the poorest."" Mr Cameron's long-awaited memoirs, entitled For The Record, was published on Thursday. In excerpts published by the Times last week, he accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of behaving ""appallingly"" during the Brexit referendum.

California barred from setting own emission rules,"The White House has stripped California of its right to set its own vehicle emissions standards and banned other states from setting similar rules. The waiver allowed the state - America's most populous - to set stricter standards than the federal government. President Trump says the move will cut car prices and the impact on emissions will be minimal. But it is likely to spark a legal battle over states' rights. California has already taken steps to block the administration's efforts. ""We will fight this latest attempt and defend our clean car standards,"" said Governor Gavin Newsom in a statement on Tuesday. Carmakers agree emissions deal despite Trump rules Trump praises his own environmental efforts Trump rolls back clean water protections This is the latest clash between the Republican president and the state, a West Coast fortress of liberal Democrats.

California's ability to set its own rules dates back to the 1970s when Los Angeles was blanketed in choking smog. The state was allowed to set tougher emission standards than the federal government as long as it could provide a compelling reason for why such a waiver was needed. In 1977, other states were allowed to adopt California's stricter standards. The Golden State's rules have largely become the de-facto benchmark nationwide because car manufacturers do not design different sets of vehicles to meet standards in other states. The state accounts for about 12% of all vehicle sales. Emissions control methods first used in California, such as catalytic converters and regulations on oxides of nitrogen, have become commonplace throughout the US. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have already adopted California's stricter exhaust pipe greenhouse gas standards - together representing about a third of the US car market. The Los Angeles skyline, shrouded in smog In July, under the waiver system, California conducted secret negotiations with Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America. The car-makers pledged to produce fleets meeting a standard of 50 miles per US gallon (4.7 litres per 100km), against the current 37 mpg level, by 2026. Increased fuel efficiency means vehicles burn less petrol and emit fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Emissions from transportation, including cars and trucks, are the largest single source of greenhouse gases in the US, according to the US government. But some analysts expect manufacturers to wait for the outcome of litigation on the new standards before they make any changes to their cars. Mr Trump's announcement is his latest move to roll back Obama-era environmental protections. In June 2017, Mr Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement, a climate pact forged under his predecessor involving nearly 200 countries. In December of last year, under guidance from the White House, the Department of the Interior unveiled plans to allow oil drilling on millions of acres that have been off-limits to protect the greater sage grouse, a near-threatened species that spans 10 states in the US. That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it would end rules limiting carbon emissions on new coal plants, soon after the president dismissed a report by his own government warning of future devastating economic consequences to the US from climate change. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Also under Mr Trump, federal bodies have supported freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels until 2026. The administration was reportedly planning to issue separate rules to reverse Obama-era fuel economy requirements in the next few weeks. Globally, the US was last year ranked 10 out of 180 countries in terms of air quality and 27th in overall environmental performance,according to a Yale University study,external. The state of California is a giant, Democrat-blue thorn in Donald Trump's side. Its new governor, Gavin Newsom, has been an outspoken critic of the president. Its attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has launched a fusillade of legal challenges to White House policies. In 2018, California voters overwhelmingly opted for Democratic congressional candidates, helping to wrest control of the US House of Representatives away from the Republican Party. California, in effect, has positioned itself as the progressive counterpoint to Trump's conservative politics - a case study in how to do things differently on a wide range of policies, including healthcare, the environment, immigration and education. Now the president - who seems to take every bit of criticism personally - is pushing back. Car regulations are one of the ways California, by itself one of the world's largest economies, can effectively set national standards regardless of federal action. With this attempt to clip the state's wings, Mr Trump is sending a message about who calls the shots. He's also upping his criticism of California's growing homeless problem - suggesting the progressive model has some glaring flaws. California Democrats aren't going to go down without a fight, however - one that will surely end up in the courts. This episode is simply the latest chapter in a dispute that is far from over. Governor Newsom called the president's announcement ""a failed attempt to assert power"" and ""a continuation of a political vendetta against CA and our progress"". Allow Twitter content?

Echoing the governor, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra vowed to head back to court. Mr Becerra has already sued the White House more than 50 times on a variety of issues including the proposed border wall, the reversal of the Affordable Care Act, and other environmental standards. At a press conference in Sacramento on Wednesday, Mr Becerra took a veiled jab at Republicans. ""Our message to those who claim to support states' rights is, 'Don't trample on ours,'"" Mr Becerra said. ""We cannot afford to backslide in our battle against climate change."" Among car manufacturers, Mr Trump's decision could prompt a split reaction. Though automakers had previously lobbied the White House to relax standing environmental regulations, some manufacturers are reportedly worried that the legal challenges expected to result from the administration's intervention will add to existing market turmoil. Moreover, some carmakers contend that without significant increases in fuel efficiency, US vehicles will be less competitive globally, ultimately resulting in job loss. Public support for stricter greenhouse gas emissions is strong. And according to a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll released last week, 67% of Americans say they support state governments setting stricter fuel efficiency targets than the federal government.

Ex-Rangers player Ricksen dies at 43,"This video can not be played Fernando Ricksen scoring for Rangers Former Rangers player Fernando Ricksen has died at age 43 after a six-year battle with motor neurone disease, the Ibrox club have confirmed. The Dutch international had been battling the condition since 2013. Ricksen was a fans' favourite during his six-year spell at Rangers after being signed by Dick Advocaat in 2000. He helped the club win the domestic cup double in 2002, the treble in 2003 and was captain for a trophy double in 2005. Rangerssaid,externalthey were ""deeply saddened"" to be announcing the news of Ricksen's passing. ""The thoughts of everyone at Rangers is today with his wife Veronika, his daughter Isabella and all his family and friends,"" the club added. 'He gave 100% for the jersey' 'We want to win for Fernando' After diagnosis in 2013, Ricksen spent his years battling motor neurone disease campaigning and raising money to find a cure for the debilitating condition, which affects the nerves and causes weakness over time. His charity has raised over Â£1m in a bid to help scientists with research. Speakingto ITV News in June,external, when he used eye movements to talk via a computer, Ricksen urged those in sport to do more to help pressure drugs companies to find a cure. ""The sports world could put more pressure on the pharmaceutical companies,"" he said. ""This disease is not lucrative enough so it has no priority. ""If tomorrow an MND epidemic came we would have a cure within a week. It's disgusting but a reality."" The former Dutch international also opened up about his own battle with the illness. ""Your body doesn't want to anymore but your brain is functioning without problems. You start losing the ability to speak. Then the legs start to get wobbly. Then you can't lift your legs anymore and you start falling. ""Don't give up,"" was his message to others inflicted with MND. This video can not be played Ricksen always made you smile - former team-mate Mols Ricksen arrived at Rangers from AZ Alkmaar after starting his career at Fortuna Sittard and through his character, attitude, and commitment, quickly became a fans' favourite. Rangers team-mate Arthur Numan played alongside Ricksen for three years, and says his friend was full of passion on the pitch. ""Straight from the beginning he gave 100% for the jersey, he was a winner,"" the Dutchman told BBC Scotland. ""He was a favourite of the fans because of what he gave on the park and also as captain of the team he gave 110% for the result. ""I think that's one of the reasons why he came back to Scotland. He wanted to stay there in the hospice, he treasured those really good memories of playing for Rangers. ""He was a strong character. In 2013 he came out with the news that he was suffering from MND and people thought he wouldn't last long. ""But he fought for nearly six years against it and that shows how he is as a person and as a character - never give up, always give 100% and go for it."" Ricksen left Ibrox for Russian side Zenit St Petersburg and was there reunited with Advocaat. He was part of the Zenit squad that reached the 2008 Uefa Cup final against Rangers, though he did not feature as the Russian side won 2-0. Between 2000 and 2003, Ricksen won 12 caps for his country. Former Scotland striker Billy Dodds also played alongside him at Rangers and shared some fond memories. ""He would cause trouble in an empty house, but he was so genuine and that's what has saddened me,"" Dodds said. ""It's ok talking about him as a player, but there was a good side to Fernando that a lot of people will miss. ""I remember one pre-season we were in Holland,  and we had a bus journey and that's when he decided to open up a wee bit. I was sitting next to him and he just told me about his family, his journey and it wasn't easy. Dodds added: ""There was a thinking side to him, there was a bit of bedevilment, he wanted to kick you, but that's because he was a winner. Opposing fans loved to hate him, but he loved that, that made him tick and made him play.""

UK 'has two weeks to set out Brexit plan',"Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU, according to Finland's prime minister. Antti Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A Downing Street source said: ""We will continue negotiating and put forward proposals at the appropriate time."" Mr Johnson has said a deal is possible at a crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, but he has insisted Brexit will happen by the 31 October deadline, even if a deal is not agreed. Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier Brexit solution must recognise NI status - Foster The UK government said talks with the EU have been making progress since Mr Johnson came into No 10 in July. It said it had put forward ""a number of proposals"" as alternatives to the Irish border backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and a key sticking point in former PM Theresa May's Brexit deal. But Mr Johnson has repeatedly refused to reveal details of the proposals in interviews, saying he did not want to negotiate in public. The EU has continued to criticise the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Earlier, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, said a meeting with Mr Johnson on Monday had been ""constructive"". But he said until proposals had been put forward, ""I will not be able to tell you, looking you straight in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved"". Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit Politics, not process, will make the difference Mr Rinne spoke to reporters after a meeting with the French president in Paris on Wednesday. He said: ""We both agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing - if they exist. ""If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it's over."" The Finnish PM intends to discuss the new deadline with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and Mr Johnson in the coming days, but the position has not yet been agreed with other EU nations. An official at the Elysee said the plan was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the prime minister was on course to deliver a ""fundamentally different"" Brexit deal to ensure the UK leaves on October 31. He told a Telegraph event that to achieve such an outcome the government had to ""listen very carefully to what the DUP says"". DUP Leader Arlene Foster spoke to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on issues concerning devolution and Brexit On Wednesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster told business leaders in Dublin that she wanted a solution to Brexit thatdoes not affect Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Mrs Foster - whose party's support had until recently given the Conservatives a majority in Parliament - said a Brexit deal ""will not be achieved that involves a backstop - whether it is UK-wide or Northern Ireland specific"". The whole of the UK had to leave the customs union and single market, she said. But she added that the DUP was prepared to ""look at Northern Ireland-specific solutions achieved with the support and consent of the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland"". Protesters outside the UK's Supreme Court in London It comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is to go into a third day at the Supreme Court later. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October. Mr Rees-Mogg, who travelled to Balmoral to seek the Queen's approval over the move, said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest she was misled over the decision.

Man stole Â£80k of university books to sell online,"Police established that Barr had stolen and sold thousands of books A prolific thief who stole more than Â£80,000 of books from three university libraries and then sold them online has been jailed for 25 months. Darren Barr made Â£30,450 after he targeted colleges in Edinburgh between October 2017 and September 2018. A court heard Barr, 28, stole thousands of texts from Edinburgh University and Napier and Heriot-Watt universities. He was caught after a PhD student bought a book stolen from her own university library. Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard there were supposed to be six copies of the text in the library but none was available. The woman then bought a copy from online company Webuybooks - only to discover it had actually come from her university library, and had a fake withdrawn notice marked on it. Court documents revealed Napier University was made aware last year of the possible thefts from its libraries at its campus sites at Craiglockhart and Sighthill in Edinburgh. A stock check revealed between 4,000 and 4,250 books had been stolen with around 3,500 books being taken from the Sighthill Campus alone. The value of these books was approximately Â£72,800. The court heard that various inquiries were carried out with Webuybooks. It emerged that the company had purchased hundreds of university textbooks from what appeared to be the same person linked to the same bank account. The account was set up under a false name but detectives discovered it belonged to Barr, who is also known as Alexander Van De Kamp. Searches of CCTV footage showed Barr arriving at various times at the library with a black rucksack and a large hold-all before leaving and driving away. When he was arrested in September 2018 his car was searched and officers found a number of university textbooks. His home address was also searched and a receipt for a courier was found. A courier box was then discovered by the police and found to contain more university books. Almost 1,300 stolen books were later recovered from across the UK , with more than 1,000 of these belonging to Napier University. It was established that around 7,000 had already been sold online. Barr, of Kinross, admitted four charges of theft earlier this year. Passing sentence, Sheriff Kenneth McGowan said: ""What I have before me here is a course of conduct continuing over a lengthy period of 11 months during which a very substantial number of books were stolen from Napier University in particular. ""These were of a high value. There was clearly careful planning on your part. ""In my view a custodial sentence is appropriate."" Det Sgt Dougal Begg of Police Scotland said: ""This is one of the most brazen and high-value thefts from our universities that I can ever recall and the amount of money Darren Barr was able to make by resetting stolen books is staggering. ""Had it not been for the staff at Edinburgh Napier University raising their concerns about missing stock, we may never have uncovered what Barr was up to and even larger quantities of books may have ended up being taken from the institutions. Police discovered that WeBuyBooks paid the accused Â£10,612 for 1,995 books. Ziffit paid Â£18,600 for 4,488 books and Zapper paid Â£1,238 for 253 books. Barr's solicitor Murray Robertson acknowledged that the thefts caused significant loss to the universities involved. Barr now faces a proceeds of crime action later this year.

Retailers to tackle Gove over Brexit food claims,"Top retailers are holding what some describe as ""clear-the-air"" talks with government after a recent row over the impact of no-deal Brexit on the supply of fresh food in particular. The meeting is the result of a demand from some chief executives to meet the prime minister. Earlier this month, Michael Gove, his minister in charge of no-deal preparations, told the BBC: ""Everyone will have the food they need"" and ""no, there will be no shortages of fresh food."" That last point was condemned immediately by the industry group, the British Retail Consortium, as ""categorically untrue"". Indeed, the government's internal Yellowhammer no-deal document from last month, obliged to be published by the Commons before it was suspended, clearly states its reasonable worst-case planning assumption that ""certain types of fresh food supply will decrease"". There are two different meetings this afternoon with Mr Gove and a separate scheduled meeting with top civil servants, all occurring today and attended by various top retail and food chiefs from Tesco, Sainsbury's, Co-op and John Lewis, among others. Retailers have told me they are deeply wary that they are now on the end of a no-deal Brexit blame game from the Boris Johnson government, as it claims to be ready for no-deal and says the French government is ready. The message in some meetings is that the only factor that will cause disruption, tailbacks and delays is, therefore, a lack of preparedness from traders, hauliers and businesses. This has depleted levels of trust between a vital sector and the government at a tense time. Retailers report that despite some improvement in the predicted rate of flow of freight traffic across the Channel in a no-deal Brexit, the timing of Brexit Day comes at the worst possible time, with warehouses full of Christmas stock and the UK at peak dependence on European imports for fresh produce. One top retailer told me that whereas it had more than four weeks of supply in warehouses for the original March Brexit date, its current supplies are between nine and 14 days. Retailers are trying to work out exactly how to deal with a possible consumer response to no-deal. As the published Yellowhammer document puts it: ""There is a risk that panic buying will cause or exacerbate food supply disruption."" Retailers are particularly concerned that should the government, for immediate political reasons, play down the specific narrow risks to some fresh food supply, consumers will not be prepared on 1 November and will be difficult to reassure. One retailer has been reviewing the sensitivity of consumers to shops' ""just-in-time"" supply chains in previous supply disruptions, such as the fuel crisis and the ""Beast from the East"" snow disruption. ""It took two weeks to get full supplies back to normal,"" one chief executive told me. Retailers are finding it difficult to stockpile supplies Of specific concern is the interaction between social media and and localised supply shortages. In particular, the industry is wondering who exactly will reassure consumers not to stockpile. Some insiders, present at key planning meetings, believe the lack of trust of large parts of the public in politicians mean that reassurances from government ministers designed to stop panic-buying could provoke the opposite response. However, those retailers concerned by an emerging Brexit blame game are also increasingly sceptical that it is their job to be reassuring about the consequences of government policy not of their making. It was revealed in Welsh government no-deal papers released this week that a ""UK-wide table top exercise to test the coordinated response for the disruption to food supply and potential public response"" has been scheduled for the end of the month. The administration in Cardiff is believed to be particularly concerned about the impact on more remote communities at the end of supermarket supply chains. It has allocated Â£2m to spread food bank coverage more widely, in anticipation of rising food prices.

Man City ease to victory at ShakhtarMan City launch their Champions League campaign in style with a 3-0 victory at Shakhtar Donetsk.BBC SportComments,"Gundogan scored his first goal of the season for Manchester City Manchester City bounced back from their shock Premier League defeat at Norwich by launching their Champions League campaign in style with a deserved victory at Shakhtar Donetsk. Humbled at Carrow Road on Saturday evening, the English champions were imperious in Ukraine against an initially tenacious, but ultimately inferior, opponent. Riyad Mahrez opened the scoring midway through the first half, firing into a largely empty net after Ilkay Gundogan's curling shot came back off the post. Mahrez then turned provider for the onrushing German to toe-poke the ball past the helpless Andriy Pyatov and give the visitors a firm grip on the game - a grip they did not relinquish. After spurning a number of good opportunities, including an untypically forgiving close-range effort from Raheem Sterling that struck the post, Gabriel Jesus gave the one-sided game a more fitting scoreline with a neat finish after Kevin de Bruyne's pass. Only Dinamo Zagreb's 4-0 hammering of Italian side Atalanta in Croatia prevents Pep Guardiola's side topping the group. Fernandinho: Pep Guardiola had no doubts over Brazilian's defensive ability Gabriel Jesus has scored four goals from six shots on target versus Shakhtar in the Champions League City's 3-2 defeat by Norwich left them five points behind leaders Liverpool (the side they pipped to last season's title) with just five games played. But they have the start they wanted in the Champions League - the only trophy Guardiola has yet to deliver to the Etihad - after arguably the toughest game of a group from which they are favourites to qualify. There was little of the apprehensive defending on display in Norfolk and a far greater level of fluency and attacking verve as the home side's largely counter-attacking attempts were regularly repelled and their defence repeatedly unpicked. Restored to the starting XI, De Bruyne was full of intelligent runs and passes to match, while the direct and pacy trio of Mahrez, Sterling and Jesus (who scored three against the same opponent in a 6-0 win last November) terrorised the home back four. But for some wayward finishing, City could well have matched the scoreline they racked up against Shakhtar in that game at the Etihad a little under a year ago. Regardless, City's recent dominance over a side who are their regular Champions League opponents continues, with this their fourth win in five encounters, the only defeat of which came in a dead rubber at the end of the group stage in 2017-18. City have been plunged into something of a defensive injury crisis of late as a result of the muscle injury that hasconsigned John Stones to a spell on the sidelinesalongside fellow centre-backAymeric Laporte, who is out until the new year. In their absence, Fernandinho - a midfielder by trade but long touted as a potential central defender by Guardiola - made the short move into the back four in Ukraine, alongside Nicolas Otamendi. If, as expected, the Brazilian is to be the man to deputise at the back (and he hinted as much after the game by admitting he had been training as a defender since the start of the season), he will have sterner tests than this, but what he was required to do, he did well. Two interceptions, two solid headers won and a passing accuracy of 90% make for a quietly efficient night. Shakhtar's best opportunities fell to Junior Moraes, but after three times finding himself with just Edersen to beat he first struck the Brazilian's chest with a shot, then missed the ball completely with an attempted flick finish before floating a lob harmlessly off target after the City keeper had rushed out of his box. They sent on wily and capable Ukraine international Yevhen Konoplyanka and Brazilians Marcos Antonio and Dentinho but to zero alteration to the flow of the game. Meanwhile, City were able to give Benjamin Mendy a first run-out of the season and some minutes to Joao Cancelo - a clear indication that while they currently lack depth in some defensive areas they are spoilt for choice in others. Since the start of the 2017-18 Champions League campaign, only James Milner (10) has recorded more assists in the competition than Kevin de Bruyne (9) Shakhtar Donetsk have conceded 15 goals in their five meetings with Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League; the most they've conceded against an opponent in the competition. Manchester City have kept clean sheets in four of their five Champions League matches against Shakhtar Donetsk, double the amount than they have versus any other side. Since the start of 2016-17 campaign, only Real Madrid (84) and Bayern Munich (72) have scored more Champions League goals than Pep Guardiola's Man City (71). Shakhtar Donetsk have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 17 UEFA Champions League matches (36 goals conceded). Riyad Mahrez has had a hand in seven goals in seven Champions League appearances for Man City (2 goals, 5 assists).

California barred from setting own emission rulesThe US president says the move will cut car prices but it is likely to spark a legal battle.US & Canada,"The White House has stripped California of its right to set its own vehicle emissions standards and banned other states from setting similar rules. The waiver allowed the state - America's most populous - to set stricter standards than the federal government. President Trump says the move will cut car prices and the impact on emissions will be minimal. But it is likely to spark a legal battle over states' rights. California has already taken steps to block the administration's efforts. ""We will fight this latest attempt and defend our clean car standards,"" said Governor Gavin Newsom in a statement on Tuesday. Carmakers agree emissions deal despite Trump rules Trump praises his own environmental efforts Trump rolls back clean water protections This is the latest clash between the Republican president and the state, a West Coast fortress of liberal Democrats.

California's ability to set its own rules dates back to the 1970s when Los Angeles was blanketed in choking smog. The state was allowed to set tougher emission standards than the federal government as long as it could provide a compelling reason for why such a waiver was needed. In 1977, other states were allowed to adopt California's stricter standards. The Golden State's rules have largely become the de-facto benchmark nationwide because car manufacturers do not design different sets of vehicles to meet standards in other states. The state accounts for about 12% of all vehicle sales. Emissions control methods first used in California, such as catalytic converters and regulations on oxides of nitrogen, have become commonplace throughout the US. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have already adopted California's stricter exhaust pipe greenhouse gas standards - together representing about a third of the US car market. The Los Angeles skyline, shrouded in smog In July, under the waiver system, California conducted secret negotiations with Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America. The car-makers pledged to produce fleets meeting a standard of 50 miles per US gallon (4.7 litres per 100km), against the current 37 mpg level, by 2026. Increased fuel efficiency means vehicles burn less petrol and emit fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Emissions from transportation, including cars and trucks, are the largest single source of greenhouse gases in the US, according to the US government. But some analysts expect manufacturers to wait for the outcome of litigation on the new standards before they make any changes to their cars. Mr Trump's announcement is his latest move to roll back Obama-era environmental protections. In June 2017, Mr Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement, a climate pact forged under his predecessor involving nearly 200 countries. In December of last year, under guidance from the White House, the Department of the Interior unveiled plans to allow oil drilling on millions of acres that have been off-limits to protect the greater sage grouse, a near-threatened species that spans 10 states in the US. That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it would end rules limiting carbon emissions on new coal plants, soon after the president dismissed a report by his own government warning of future devastating economic consequences to the US from climate change. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Also under Mr Trump, federal bodies have supported freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels until 2026. The administration was reportedly planning to issue separate rules to reverse Obama-era fuel economy requirements in the next few weeks. Globally, the US was last year ranked 10 out of 180 countries in terms of air quality and 27th in overall environmental performance,according to a Yale University study,external. The state of California is a giant, Democrat-blue thorn in Donald Trump's side. Its new governor, Gavin Newsom, has been an outspoken critic of the president. Its attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has launched a fusillade of legal challenges to White House policies. In 2018, California voters overwhelmingly opted for Democratic congressional candidates, helping to wrest control of the US House of Representatives away from the Republican Party. California, in effect, has positioned itself as the progressive counterpoint to Trump's conservative politics - a case study in how to do things differently on a wide range of policies, including healthcare, the environment, immigration and education. Now the president - who seems to take every bit of criticism personally - is pushing back. Car regulations are one of the ways California, by itself one of the world's largest economies, can effectively set national standards regardless of federal action. With this attempt to clip the state's wings, Mr Trump is sending a message about who calls the shots. He's also upping his criticism of California's growing homeless problem - suggesting the progressive model has some glaring flaws. California Democrats aren't going to go down without a fight, however - one that will surely end up in the courts. This episode is simply the latest chapter in a dispute that is far from over. Governor Newsom called the president's announcement ""a failed attempt to assert power"" and ""a continuation of a political vendetta against CA and our progress"". Allow Twitter content?

Who's using armed drones?,"The attacks on Saudi oil installations have led to speculation that armed drones were involved. Both the United States and the Saudi authorities say this may well have been the case. The offensive use of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has grown significantly in recent years, and nowhere more so than in the Middle East. So who has them and who has used them in combat? The first combat use of an armed drone came in October 2001, on the first night of the Afghan War against a Taliban convoy. China has become a major exporter of drones to the Middle East Armed UAVs were initially the preserve of a few technologically advanced nations, with Israel and the United States very much in the lead. Soon a new provider came onto the scene - China, eager to sell its weaponry around the world. The Chinese have boosted the spread of military drones in the Middle East, selling weaponry to at least half a dozen governments. The civilian UAV market has also become more sophisticated, and the technology has been converted into combat drones. While the technology might not be cutting edge, highly capable UAVs can be manufactured by any country with a reasonable industrial base - Iran being a good case in point. And Iran has played a key role in transferring relatively advanced drone technology to several non-state actors, such as the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Fatality as Saudi airport struck by Yemen rebels Exploding rebel drone kills Yemen soldiers US blames Iran for attacks on Saudi oil facilities This video can not be played Drone explodes above a podium where officials were watching a military parade at al-Anad base in Yemen. The Middle East is one of the epicentres of the war on terror. It has drawn in technologically advanced players like the United States, Britain and Russia. There is a host of regional rivalries. The most pronounced fault-line is between Israel and the Gulf Arab states on the one hand, and Iran, its allies and proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis, on the other. The US has used armed drones extensively in the Middle East, as part of its campaigns against both al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State (IS). Weapons such as Predator and Reaper drones have been used against targets in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. The MQ-9 Reaper is a larger, heavier and more capable aircraft than the Predator, capable of carrying a significantly larger weapons payload with a much longer range. As one of Washington's closest military allies, Britain purchased a number of Reaper systems from the US, and has operated them extensively against targets in both Iraq and Syria. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? Long-acknowledged as one of the pioneers in UAV technology, Israel is one of the major exporters of unarmed UAVs, accounting for - according to one 2018 study - about 60% of the global market. Among others customers, it has sold surveillance drones to Russia, and has even shot at least one down when it crossed into Israeli territory from Syria. Israel uses a varied fleet of UAVs for intelligence gathering, surveillance and attack missions. Its armed drones include the Heron TP, the Hermes 450 and the Hermes 900. But Israel has been reluctant to export these armed drones. Iran has developed its own UAV technology Despite the arms embargo and sanctions, Iran has developed a capacity to build reasonably sophisticated armed UAVs. The Shahed-129 was unveiled in 2012 and has been used to hit IS and targets in Syria and Iraq. The Mohajer 6 has been in production since 2018. But the other aspect of Iran's drone programme is its willingness to sell or transfer its technology to its allies and proxies in the region. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has deployed a fleet of Chinese-supplied Wing Loong 1 UAVs, which have been used against targets in Yemen and in the civil war in Libya. The UAE backs the faction led by General Haftar. Turkish drones have been used in Libya in support of the Government of National Accord. Unable to buy American UAVs, Turkey builds its own, which have been used in strikes against Kurdish targets both inside Turkey and in Syria. Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Algeria have all purchased Chinese UAVs. The US has accused Iran of supplying Houthi rebels with UAVs Houthi rebels are among the most adept UAV users among the non-state actors. They operate a number of systems which, according to UN and other experts, depend heavily on Iranian technology. The Houthis have used the Qasef-1, which a UN panel of experts has determined is virtually identical to an Iranian model. These are effectively ""kamikaze"" drones that are deliberately crashed into their targets. A subsequent UN report highlighted the Houthis' use of a more sophisticated UAV-X drone, sometimes referred to as the Samad-2/3, which is believed to have a small explosive warhead. Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah has operated a small number of what appear to be Iranian-supplied drones. The war in Syria saw the first significant use of drones in a major swarm attack intended to overwhelm air defences. Rebel forces have directed several drones at major Russian military bases in Syria. It's clear that armed drone technology has spread widely. Paradoxically, US reluctance to sell advanced UAVs to its allies has not removed the possibility of drone proliferation, because China has stepped in to market its broadly equivalent technology. Using UAVs to strike at targets has helped to open up a new kind of combat, blurring the line between war and peace. UAVs have offered the potential to strike precise targets with limited side-effects (at least if the intelligence guiding them is right). The armed drone or UAV seemed tailor-made for the so-called war against terror. But it was also tailor-made for the sorts of unequal struggles in the region between technologically advanced and far less advanced players.

British Airways pilots call off next week's strike,"British Airways pilots have called off the next strike in their dispute, which had been scheduled for 27 September. Last week, a two-day stoppage called by the pilots' union, Balpa, forced BA to cancel almost all its flights. The strike followed failed negotiations between the union and the airline over a pay offer of 11.5% over three years. Balpa said the strikes on 9 and 10 September had demonstrated the anger and resolve of pilots. It was now time for a period of reflection before the dispute ""escalates further and irreparable damage is done to the brand"", the union said. A spokesman for BA said: ""We have just received this news. We are considering the implications and we will give updates in due course."" British Airways hadalready started cancelling flights for 27 Septemberlast Thursday - just outside the 14-day window when the company must pay passengers compensation if their travel is cancelled. The airline has said it will try to reinstate as many of the flights as possible, but it is not yet clear if they will all be put back on the schedule for 27 September. British Airways said it will be in touch with customers to let them know. The airline was forced to cancel 1,700 flights last week during the pilots' walkout over pay. Some 200,000 passengers had to change their travel plans because of the strikes. Around 200,000 people were forced to change their travels plans because of last week's pilots' strike Balpa said it hoped BA would ""now change its approach and negotiate seriously"" with a view to ending the dispute. Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said: ""Someone has to take the initiative to sort out this dispute and with no sign of that from BA, the pilots have decided to take the responsible course. ""In a genuine attempt at establishing a time out for common sense to prevail, we have lifted the threat of the strike on 27 September."" However, Balpa said it retained the right to announce further strike dates. BA had offered pilots an 11.5% pay rise over three years in July, but this was rejected. Balpa said that its members had taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during tougher times for the airline. It said that now BA's financial performance had improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - pilots should benefit. BA said the 11.5% offer was ""fair and generous"". It has already been accepted by Unite and the GMB, whose members include BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers.

US central bank cuts interest rates again,"Chairman Jerome Powell voted in favour of the cut The US central bank has cut interest rates for only the second time since 2008, amid concerns about slowing global growth and trade wars. As expected, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for its key interest rate by 25 basis points to between 1.75% and 2%. President Trump reacted by attacking Fed chairman Jerome Powell for lacking ""guts"". Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed for cutting rates too slowly. The president took to Twitter in the minutes immediately following the rate cut announcement to lambast the move: ""Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No ""guts,"" no sense, no vision!  A terrible communicator!"". The bank said the cut is aimed at shoring up the US economy, amid ""uncertainties"" about future growth. But officials were divided about the decision and over the need for future cuts. Seven members of the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee, which sets the rates, voted in favour of Wednesday's cut, including Mr Powell. Two members wanted to hold the rate steady, while one wanted to cut further. Federal Reserve policymakers divided over US rate cuts Why the Fed's interest rate move matters Mr Powell said policymakers decided on a second cut after global growth slowed and trade tensions worsened over the summer. ""The thing we can't address really is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade ... but we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness to some extent,"" he said, referring to the rate cut. However, he dismissed the need for negative interest rates - a proposal backed by Mr Trump - as ""not at the top of the list"". The comments underscored the strain between Mr Powell and the president, who has sought to blame the Fed for economic slowdown, while waging trade wars with China, Europe and others.

Cutting rates helps fuel economic activity, by making it cheaper to borrow money for both businesses and consumers. But with interest rates in the US already low by historic standards - and much of the economic uncertainty caused by the trade war with China - analysts have questioned how much rate cuts will help. US share markets fell after the announcement, but later recovered. The Fed's decision to lower rates on Wednesday follows a similar cut in July and marks a reversal from its policy only a year ago, when America's healthy economy had convinced policy makers to enact a series of small hikes. But US economic growth slowed to 2% in the second quarter, job creation has slipped and inflation remains lower than US policymakers would like. In recent days, parts of the financial markets have also shown signs of a cash-crunch, temporarily pushing short-term interest rates above the Fed's target and prompting the bank to intervene. By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent The cut in interest rates was of course the headline from this Fed meeting. But the Chairman Jerome Powell also commented on some developments in the US financial system that have really had people scratching their heads this week. There was a sharp rise in borrowing costs in a rather arcane corner of the financial system known as the repo (repurchase) market which firms use to raise or lend cash for short periods. What was going on? Could it be a warning sign of serious stress somewhere in the financial world? The crisis a decade ago has made people more sensitive to that kind of possibility. Mr Powell said it was due to companies needing a lot of cash for tax payments and for investors buying government bonds. Although the Fed and the markets knew these developments were coming, Mr Powell said they ""had a bigger effect than most folks anticipated"". He said these issues have no implications for the economy.  So, flap over? Maybe. Let's hope so. In economic projections released on Wednesday, Federal Reserve policymakers said they expect the economy to grow 2.2% this year, faster than they forecast in June. Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said the upgrade to that growth prediction underscores the fact that the Fed is worried about global factors, such as the trade war, rather than the underlying health of the US economy. ""This move is all about the deterioration in the global economic outlook over the late summer and very little about incoming US data,"" he said. ""While the Fed has maintained its 'will act as appropriate' language, we still see this as an insurance policy move and don't expect a series of further rate cuts,"" he added.

Ineos to build new 4x4 vehicle in Bridgend,"Ineos says the new Bridgend plant will employ 500 people and produce 25,000 cars a year Ineos Automotive has chosen Bridgend for the production of its new 4x4 vehicle, it has been announced. It is expected to initially create around 200 jobs to make the Grenadier, and up to 500 in the long-term. The company is building a manufacturing and assembly plant and plans to begin production in 2021. It has received support from the Welsh Government, and funding from the UK Government as part of a competition to develop new technologies. The new plant is being built at Brocastle, close to Ford Bridgend,which is to close in 2020with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Some of the skills Ineos requires will be transferable from Ford, the company said. From council house to UK's richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe's football club takeover cleared It is not known how much public funding Ineos will receive, but it is planning to invest Â£600m in the new car, inspired by the original Land Rover Defender which went out of production in 2016. The plant will be built on a new site at Brocastle in Bridgend The new model is likely to face significant competition. Last week at the Frankfurt Motor Show, Jaguar Land Rover launched their new version of the Defender, a modern car which has also been inspired by the original machine. At peak production, it is hoped 25,000 vehicles a year will roll off the line at the new 250,000 sq ft (23,250 sq m) Bridgend site. Key parts for the Ineos vehicle - including the body and chassis - will be built at a second factory in Portugal before being brought to Bridgend for assembly. BMW will supply the engines, and engineering assistance will be provided by another German company, MBTech. Ineos Group chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe said it had seen ""lots of good options to choose from"" for a manufacturing facility. Who is Sir Jim Ratcliffe? Sir Jim Ratcliffe says the car aims to be the ""spiritual successor"" to the Land Rover Defender (pictured) Grew up on council estate in Manchester Made his wealth after founding Ineos petrochemical company in 1998 The richest man in UK, worth an estimated Â£21bn Supported Leave in the EU referendum and backed Theresa May's withdrawal deal Owns a Tour de France winning pro cycle team, a French football club and now builds vehicles ""The decision to build in the UK is a significant expression of confidence in British manufacturing,"" he said. The Welsh Economy Minister Ken Skates said their work to support Bridgend in the run up to the closure of Ford would ""not stop here"". ""We will continue to do all we can to attract new business opportunities,"" he said. Ford opened in Bridgend in 1980 but is due to close the plant in 2020 The Welsh Government also said the company was in talks with two Wales-based component supply companies to support their work. The UK government's competition funding was aimed at technologies for the motor industry's transition to zero-emission vehicles. The Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns described the Ineos investment as a ""welcome boost"" and said they had been supporting the industry through their industrial strategy. ""There have been some significant automotive investments to Wales over the last few years, including atAston Martinin St Athan and together with the Welsh Government we will continue to provide incentives for firms like Ineos to make Wales their home,"" he said. Tom Crotty, a director of Ineos Group, told BBC Wales the Welsh Government's funding and general support was more significant than that received from the UK government - although Mr Cairns had been helpful, he added. He would not be drawn on the exact level of Welsh Government funding, but said it was below the rumoured Â£13m. It was not the deciding factor he added, and the grant was linked to the creation of jobs. ""It's a great area with an industrial tradition, and... there's some really great skilled people and we're going to need up to 500 really skilled people,"" he said. On Brexit, he emphasised the investment did not depend on a withdrawal deal being struck with the EU, but said the company had made no secret of supporting Theresa May's deal and a continued open market across Europe.

The plant is being constructed on a 14-acre (five hectare) plot of land it is buying at market value from the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government said the new business area, Brocastle Business Park, next to the established Bridgend Industrial Estate, will be able to accommodate a further 500,000 sq ft (46,500 sq m) of space. The closure of Ford Bridgend was one of a series of recent blows to the automotive industry in Wales, which includedthe closure of Schaefflerin Llanelli and job losses atCalsonic Kanseiin the town. Peter Hughes, Unite Wales regional secretary described the Ineos decision as ""welcome news"" but highlighted it was not enough on its own to mitigate the loss of the 1,700 Ford jobs. ""The Welsh Government must ensure that Ineos lives up to the standards of what we expect in Wales from socially responsible employers. It is imperative that the jobs being created are of the highest quality, well paid and unionised,"" he said.

On Brexit, he emphasised the investment did not depend on a withdrawal deal being struck with the EU, but said the company had made no secret of supporting Theresa May's deal and a continued open market across Europe.

"British Airways pilots call off next week's strikePilots' union Balpa calls on the airline to ""negotiate seriously"" with a view to ending the dispute.Business","British Airways pilots have called off the next strike in their dispute, which had been scheduled for 27 September. Last week, a two-day stoppage called by the pilots' union, Balpa, forced BA to cancel almost all its flights. The strike followed failed negotiations between the union and the airline over a pay offer of 11.5% over three years. Balpa said the strikes on 9 and 10 September had demonstrated the anger and resolve of pilots. It was now time for a period of reflection before the dispute ""escalates further and irreparable damage is done to the brand"", the union said. A spokesman for BA said: ""We have just received this news. We are considering the implications and we will give updates in due course."" British Airways hadalready started cancelling flights for 27 Septemberlast Thursday - just outside the 14-day window when the company must pay passengers compensation if their travel is cancelled. The airline has said it will try to reinstate as many of the flights as possible, but it is not yet clear if they will all be put back on the schedule for 27 September. British Airways said it will be in touch with customers to let them know. The airline was forced to cancel 1,700 flights last week during the pilots' walkout over pay. Some 200,000 passengers had to change their travel plans because of the strikes. Around 200,000 people were forced to change their travels plans because of last week's pilots' strike Balpa said it hoped BA would ""now change its approach and negotiate seriously"" with a view to ending the dispute. Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said: ""Someone has to take the initiative to sort out this dispute and with no sign of that from BA, the pilots have decided to take the responsible course. ""In a genuine attempt at establishing a time out for common sense to prevail, we have lifted the threat of the strike on 27 September."" However, Balpa said it retained the right to announce further strike dates. BA had offered pilots an 11.5% pay rise over three years in July, but this was rejected. Balpa said that its members had taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during tougher times for the airline. It said that now BA's financial performance had improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - pilots should benefit. BA said the 11.5% offer was ""fair and generous"". It has already been accepted by Unite and the GMB, whose members include BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers.

India announces ban on e-cigarettes,"India's cabinet has announced a ban on the production, import and sale of electronic cigarettes, saying they pose a risk to health. An executive order had been approved banning vaping products because of their impact on young people, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. It is not clear if the order will also prohibit the use of vaping equipment. India has more than 100 million adult smokers, making it a huge potential market for e-cigarette companies. Vaping - which involves inhaling a mix typically made of nicotine, water, solvents and flavours - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit, but its impact on health is still not fully known. The ban will include jail terms of up to three years for offenders. Traditional tobacco products are not affected. ""This means the production, manufacturing, import and export, sale, distribution and advertising related to e-cigarettes are banned,"" Ms Sitharaman told a news conference. She said evidence from the US and India suggested some young people saw vaping as a ""style statement"". India has more smokers than any other country, except for China India is the world's second-largest consumer of tobacco products after China, and more than 900,000 people die in the country each year from tobacco-related illnesses. Proponents of vaping say it helps people stop smoking and that banning it would encourage ex-smokers to pick up the habit again. But India's health ministry, which proposed the ban, says it is in the public interest to ensure vaping doesn't become an ""epidemic"" among young people. Vaping: How popular are e-cigarettes? What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US? While the Indian market seemed ripe for the expansion of popular e-cigarette companies like Juul, it hadn't taken off like it has in the US or the UK. Vapers in the US, UK and France spent more than $10bn (Â£8bn) on smokeless tobacco and vaping products in 2018. This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results According to the World Health Organization, there has been a small but steady decrease in the estimated number of smokers globally, to just over one billion. But it's a different matter when it comes to vaping. The number of vapers has been increasing rapidly - from about seven million in 2011 to 41 million in 2018. Market research group Euromonitor estimates that the number of adults who vape will reach almost 55 million by 2021. In the US, where the potential health risks of e-cigarettes are in the spotlight, there have been 450 reported cases of lung illness tired to vaping this year. There have also been at least six deaths across 33 states. Health investigators in the US are trying to establish whether a particular toxin or substance is behind the outbreak, or whether it's the result of heavy usage. India's ban came a day after New York became the second US state to prohibit the use of flavoured e-cigarettes. Critics of vaping say flavours appeal particularly to children and risk them becoming addicted to nicotine.

What is the UK Supreme Court?,"Lady Hale, the brooch-wearing judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful, has retired from the UK Supreme Court. Who will follow her as its president and what does the Supreme Court do? Lady Hale was president of the Supreme Court from September 2017 to January 2020 and oversaw the decision on the suspension of Parliament. She is among the most well-known judges in the world. Before she became a judge, she was the architect of the UK's internationally-recognised laws on the rights of children. As the first female justice,she has been critical of the lack of female representationon the body in the past. She stood down in 2020 in line with retirement rules for judges. Lord Reed is thenew Supreme Court president,external. The senior Scottish judge also sat in the European Court of Human Rights. He led the importantSupreme Court ruling that overturned high employment tribunal feeswhich had led to claims that people were being denied access to justice. Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues. They are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution. Their job is no different to many comparable bodies in other countries. They rule on what a law means when there is a dispute. These are cases that raise what the court considers to be genuinely important points that affect the nation. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court Their judgements set out how a law should be interpreted and applied. Only a third of the cases that it is asked to rule on are heard by the Supreme Court. The court sits opposite the Houses of Parliament. Its location symbolises the relationship between the two. Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their ultimate interpretation and fair and just use. Over the course of its first 10 years of work, the court has delivered many judgements that have changed the nature of the UK. But its arguably most important case was 2019's decision to rule that Prime MinisterBoris Johnson had broken the law by proroguing (suspending) Parliament for five weeksas he faced division over the Brexit process. Lady Hale, wearing her spider brooch, reads out the Supreme Court's ruling on the suspension of Parliament The justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland. There is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices to decide on cases, so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a majority ruling one way or the other. Since October 2009 it has heard and decided on more than 835 cases. Here are some examples: Two 2018 judgements meant the police could be sued for compensation,after 76-year-old Elizabeth Robinson was knocked overand whendetectives botched a solvable investigation into the John Worboys serial rapist case In 2016, the justices said a law about gang murderhad been wrongly interpreted for 30 years Three years later,justices backed end-of-life decisions Only Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation - but the government is under no legal obligation to act on that. New justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years or a practising lawyer for 15. These are the other members of the Supreme Court. Lord Hodgeis the deputy president and the second Scottish judge on the panel of 12. He specialises in commercial law, in particular intellectual property and land valuation. Lord Kerrwas Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland before joining the Supreme Court at its 2009 opening. As the only Northern Irish justice, he argued forfree NHS abortions to be given to Northern Irish womenwhen they travel to England, but the Supreme Court rejected the case. Lord Wilsonis one of the UK's most experienced judges in family law, having spent 12 years ruling on those cases. Lord Carnwathis an expert in company and commercial law. He has a particular interest in environmental law. Lady Blackis another expert in family law who has taught students at university and, from 2010, also sat as a Court of Appeal judge. Lord Lloyd-Jonesis the Supreme Court's judge from Wales and a Welsh speaker. He specialises in international law He chaired the Law Commission - which advises the government on which laws need reforming - up until 2015. Lord Briggswas appointed to the Court of Appeal in 2013. Three years later he became deputy head of civil justice. Lady Ardenwas a Court of Appeal judge for 18 years and another former head of the Law Commission. Lord Kitchinis an expert in the complex branch of commercial cases that deals with intellectual property, such as patents that protect an invention from being copied by a rival. Lord Saleswas inthe original court which ruled the government must ask Parliamentbefore invoking Article 50, the part of EU law which gives any country the right to leave the EU. This led to the Daily Mail labelling him and the other two judges as ""enemies of the people."" Lord Justice Hamblenis the newest member. He's been a senior judge since 2008, specialising in commercial law. Two more new justices are in the wings waiting to be sworn in later in the year as others retire. Since Mr Johnson lost the prorogation case, there has been a drip feed of stories implying the court got the decision wrong and will face reform. Some Conservatives say judges snatched powers they never had. The Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto pledged a constitutional review which would include the courts. It did not explicitly single out the Supreme Court for reform - so what may happen is unclear. Any attempt to water down the court's powers is likely to face a rocky road. Many lawyers would see this as an act of political revenge. No. There are two unrelated European Courts. TheEuropean Court of Justice(ECJ) oversees EU laws on trade and so on that are passed by the member states. When the UK leaves the EU, it will not be part of that system, unless it were to choose to be, as part of a deal. The entirely differentEuropean Court of Human Rights(ECtHR) was set up (largely at the instigation of the UK) to protect the rights of ordinary people across the continent from undemocratic use of power. It hears very few cases against the UK government as most human rights cases are dealt with by British judges. The Supreme Court takes into account the views of the ECtHR but is entitled to reject its conclusions.

Trump names new national security adviserRobert O'Brien is Mr Trump's fourth national security adviser and replaces John Bolton.,"President Donald Trump and new national security adviser Robert O'Brien US President Donald Trump has named a new national security adviser to replace John Bolton. Robert O'Brien has had a long career in foreign policy working for both main US parties and currently heads hostage negotiations at the State Department. He is Mr Trump's fourth national security adviser. As top adviser on national security, Mr O'Brien will be tasked with tackling everything from immigration policy to heightened tensions with Iran. John Bolton: Who is hawk fired by Trump? Trumpâs pragmatic view of troubled world The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The president and his new appointee spoke with reporters on Wednesday morning in Los Angeles. ""Robert has been fantastic,"" Mr Trump said, praising Mr O'Brien's work with hostages. ""We know each other well."" Mr O'Brien said it was a ""privilege"" to take on the role. ""We've got a number of challenges but there's a great team in place,"" he said. ""I look forward to working with them and working with the president to keep America safe and continue to rebuild our military."" Mr O'Brien follows Mr Bolton, HR McMaster and Michael Flynn in the role, which does not require confirmation by Congress. The new national security adviser trained as a lawyer then went on to advise Republicans on foreign policy and has served in various government roles. Robert O'Brien has had a long diplomatic career working for both Republicans and Democrats Former President Bush appointed him in 2005 to serve as a representative to the UN General Assembly. While at the UN, he worked with Mr Bolton, who was then the ambassador. He has also worked for former secretaries of state Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. A former Obama administration official was among those who celebrated the appointment of Mr O'Brien. ""All I have to say is that @robertcobrien is a really, really good person and that I wish him all the best in what will certainly be a challenging role,"" said Andrew Exum, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for Middle East policy, on Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The new Trump pick and his predecessor share some similar views. Mr O'Brien was critical of the UN in his book, While America Slept: Restoring American Leadership to a World in Crisis. He wrote that his son described the general assembly as ""when all the dictators come to America and give speeches about how bad we are"", something Mr O'Brien called ""one of the better descriptions"" he had heard. Mr O'Brien has also criticised the Iran nuclear deal, calling Iran ""the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world"". This video can not be played Speaking in April 2019, Robert O'Brien addresses families of Americans held captive abroad In his role as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Mr O'Brien works with families of US hostages and advises on related issues, including recovery policies. Mr O'Brien was involved with the release of US rapper ASAP Rocky from Swedish detention last month. He is believed to be the highest-ranking Mormon member of the Trump administration. Mr Bolton, a foreign policy hard-liner, was ousted after repeated clashes with the president and other members of the administration, particularly regarding North Korea and Venezuela. Mr Trump tweeted on 10 September that he had asked Mr Bolton for his resignation because he ""disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions"". Moments after the president's announcement, Mr Bolton said that actually he had offered to resign, and Mr Trump said they would ""talk about it"". Sources said the National Security Council, which advises the president, had become a separate entity within the White House under Mr Bolton and many within the White House criticised Mr Bolton's approach. After more than a year of having a political and ideological lightning rod as national security adviser, Donald Trump went with a much more conventional choice. Where outgoing NSA John Bolton was bombastic - an outside personality with an eye for the television cameras - Robert O'Brien is a behind-the-scenes bureaucratic player. He spent much of his career practising law, and when he did make forays into public service, it was mostly in roles deep in the machinery of government. Mr O'Brien, a civilian, also stands in contrast to the two former generals that the president has chosen for the position, Michael Flynn and HR McMaster. His selection could be an indication that Mr Trump is losing his early affinity for military brass. Given that O'Brien was a foreign policy adviser for the Mitt Romney and Scott Walker's presidential campaigns and worked in the George W Bush administration, Mr Trump's move could also help repair strained relations with the conservative foreign policy establishment. Mr O'Brien takes this top national security position as multiple global disputes teeter on the brink of full-blown crisis. He will work for a commander-in-chief who prides himself on his unpredictability. The task ahead is daunting. Mr O'Brien takes up the role with the administration on the brink of a full-blown crisis with Iran following attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. The US blames Iran for the attacks but Iran has denied any involvement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held discussions in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to explore possible responses. Mr O'Brien will also need to work with the president on a strategy for persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have met three times but tangible signs of progress have been scant. Then there is Afghanistan. This month the US and the Taliban appeared close to a deal to end the long-running conflict but Mr Trump abruptly cancelled a planned meeting following the death of a US soldier in an attack by the insurgents. One of the Taliban's chief negotiators told the BBC their ""doors are open"" and that negotiation is ""the only way for peace in Afghanistan"".

"'Daughter's gambling addiction left me homeless'Kimberley Wadsworth killed herself after gambling away Â£36,000 from her mother to pay off debts.","Kimberly Wadsworth began gambling in 2015 against a backdrop of personal problems The mother of a woman who killed herself after gambling away Â£36,000 in a fortnight hopes a new NHS service will stop others facing the same pain. Kimberly Wadsworth even gambled away money raised to pay off her debts, leaving her mother Kay homeless. The Northern Gambling Service clinic in Leeds is the first outside London. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said no-one's access to support should depend on where they live. Kimberly, 32, who lived in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, started gambling at casinos and online in 2015 against a backdrop of depression, the death of her father and an unhappy marriage. She tried to hide it from her mother, but had spent Â£44,000 on gambling, including Â£17,000 from her grandmother's will. Mrs Wadsworth, 65, said: ""I sold my house in Leeds, the family home. I gave her Â£36,000 so that she could pay off her gambling debts and she didn't pay it off. ""She didn't pay a penny off and she just gambled it all away within two weeks and I became homeless."" Kay Wadsworth's daughter gambled Â£36,000 of her money She said she had arranged for Kimberly to see a hypnotherapist to get her through her gambling addiction but she never went. Instead, she sent her mum a message which read ""It's too late for me, mum"", before taking her life. Mrs Wadsworth said if help had been more readily available then her daughter would still be alive. ""They know how to deal with these people that are gambling addicts, and they know the signs,"" she said. ""It's the signs, and knowing what they've said and knowing that they're hiding it. And the lies that they tell, it's unbelievable."" The Northern Gambling Service will aim to help people with the most serious problems, including those at risk of suicide. NHS to help gambling addicts as young as 13 Bookmakers pledge Â£100m to avoid crackdown Why is gambling so addictive? It has been commissioned by NHS England and Gamble Aware and is run by Leeds and York Partnership Foundation Trust. An estimated 340,000 people across the UK have a serious gambling addiction, according to the Gambling Commission. The NHS and the charity Gamble Aware are jointly funding the service in the north of England - which is expected to cost about Â£1m a year - for the next three years. The service is set to open centres in Manchester and Sunderland, to serve the north of England and north Midlands. More stories from Yorkshire Mr Hancock said: ""As part of our NHS Long Term Plan, we will continue to roll out these specialist services across the country and undo the damage caused by gambling and protect our most vulnerable."" Chris Murphy has spent more than Â£100,000 on gambling Chris Murphy, from Leeds, has agreed to help mentor gamblers who are referred to the new service. He became addicted to gambling after winning Â£350 on a bet aged 17. Since then, he has spent more than Â£100,000 on gambling and tried to take his own life aged 23. The 33-year-old has not gambled for eight months. ""Looking at it as a health problem - you're unwell. So you need support with that. That's an important thing, because there's a lot of self-defeatism, thinking 'why can't I just stop?'. ""It's probably harder to understand than drug and alcohol addiction, with it not being a substance that you're addicted to. ""There's nothing wrong in admitting you need help with something. I think that was one of the things that set me back, that I could do it alone, that I should be able to stop through willpower. ""Actually accepting I have no willpower over that activity, that's where the power really lies in stopping."" Matthew Gaskell, consultant psychologist and clinical lead for the Northern Gambling Service, said the centre could potentially turn around many people's lives. ""Some people can be suicidal, have other mental health problems, relationship breakdown, employment difficulties, financial difficulties as well - so we're going to get some people really very distressed and in real desperate need of help. ""The important message is not everyone is the same so they will get a very personalised care package. ""There's talking therapy which will actively address the gambling problem, also help the person build the life they want for themselves and their families and their future and that's really important. ""This is the first phase - over the next five years we're looking to expand across the country to open 14 clinics.""

Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier,"The EU's chief negotiator acknowledged Boris Johnson's concerns about the backstop The UK and EU ""should not pretend to be negotiating"" a Brexit deal if there are no new proposals on the table, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. He said the UK telling the EU what it does not like was ""not enough"". He cast doubt on a UK proposal to give Northern Ireland a future veto over EU rules, saying all parts of the UK would have to sign up to the terms of exit. The government said it had offered ""a number of proposals"" as alternatives to the Irish border backstop. The backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - has proved a key sticking point. The government said ""constructive discussions"" were ongoing and the UK had been ""clear"" in those discussions ""that the antidemocratic backstop needs to be removed"" if a new deal was to be reached. Boris Johnson has insisted a deal is possible at a crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October - although ministers have been reluctant to reveal the details of new proposals in advance for fear they will be ""rubbished"" by the EU. Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit What does 'podiumgate' say about Brexit deal? Does Luxembourg PM's scorn signal an EU shift? The PM has insisted he will not accept a further delay beyond 31 October despite MPs passing a law requiring him to seek an extension if there is no deal by 19 October. After meeting Mr Barnier and Mr Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday, Mr Johnson said both sides agreed to accelerate efforts to reach an agreement. There were significant moments in Strasbourg this morning, even if the discussion lacked the fireworks present in the Brexit debate elsewhere. Jean-Claude Juncker clearly signalled that in his last few weeks in office he will show solidarity with the Republic of Ireland rather than siding with the UK to get a deal. That will disappoint those in the UK who bank on him wanting an agreement to secure his legacy. The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave a cautious thumbs-up to the big British idea of an all-Ireland zone for plant and animal health. But he appeared to give a thumbs-down to another - giving the Stormont Assembly a decisive say over the Irish backstop, or whatever takes its place. Briefing the European Parliament, Mr Juncker said the lunch had been ""friendly and constructive"" but there had been no progress on the main sticking point - the UK's demand that the Northern Irish backstop should be removed from the current agreement. Mr Juncker said any alternative to the backstop must achieve the same objectives - to prevent the need for physical infrastructure on the border with the Republic of Ireland, to safeguard the EU's single market and protect all-Ireland economic co-operation. ""I said to Mr Johnson that I have no emotional attachment to the backstop but I stand by the objectives it is intended to achieve,"" he said. ""That is why I called on the PM to come forward with operational proposals in writing. ""Until such time those proposals have been presented, I will not be able to tell you looking you straight in the eye that any real progress has been achieved."" What are the Brexit backstop options? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Barnier said the UK had made it clear which parts of the backstop - which would see Northern Ireland closely tied to the single market and the UK follow EU customs rules until a new trade deal is agreed - it did not like, but ""that is not enough to move towards a solution"".

""Almost three years after the British referendum, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly not a question of pretending to negotiate,"" he said. If the UK wanted to remove the backstop, he said it must come up with answers to all the problems the temporary ""safety net"" was designed to solve. However, he appeared to reject UK proposals to give the Stormont Assembly in Belfast a say over how much Northern Ireland conforms with EU customs rules and diverges from England, Wales and Scotland while the UK remained in any backstop arrangement. ""It is up to the UK government to ensure the support of the Northern Irish institutions for the withdrawal agreement that would be signed on behalf of the whole of the UK,"" he said. Following a three-hour debate, the European Parliament approved a motion calling for any Brexit deal to include a backstop and also voted for the UK to be granted a further extension beyond 31 October if it asks for one. MEPs called on the EU to give the UK a further Brexit extension if it asked for one During the session, MEP Guy Verhofstadt called on the UK to give all three million EU nationals living in the country an automatic right to remain. Rather than channelling the ""angry Hulk"" - a reference to Mr Johnson's recent comparison of the UK to the Incredible Hulk -  the Parliament's Brexit spokesman said the PM should adopt the persona of a ""caring nanny"", such as Mrs Doubtfire. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was clear the UK and EU were paving the way for an agreement next month which would be portrayed as a ""victory"" for both sides. Even without the backstop, he said the deal on the table would be ""bad"" for the UK as it would see it ""trapped in EU rules and under the auspices of the European Court"". He also criticised they way Mr Johnson was treated during a visit to Luxembourg last week. He said the country's ""pipsqueak"" leader Xavier Bettel had ""ritually humiliated"" his counterpart by appearing at a press conference without him and berating his Brexit policy.

National security fears threaten defence takeover,"The government is to intervene in a US private equity firm's takeover of UK defence and aerospace firm Cobham, citing national security concerns. Advent International made a Â£4bn offer to buy Cobham in July and shareholders approved the deal last month. But Cobham's founding family raised concerns about the company's future and its connections with UK defence. The government said it wanted to ""support private sector innovation whilst safeguarding public interest"". Dorset-based Cobham, which employs 10,000 people, is known for pioneering technology enabling the mid-air refuelling of planes. The firm also makes electronic warfare systems and communications for military vehicles. ""Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of Cobham, I have issued an intervention notice on the grounds of national security,"" said Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will investigate and carry out a review on the national security implications of the transaction. The government has the power to veto the deal if the CMA finds there are sufficient concerns. It must report the results of its decision by 29 October. Since 2002, the government is thought to have made 16 interventions on takeovers, nine of which were due to national security concerns. None of these deals have so far been blocked. ""Advent is committed to being a responsible steward of Cobham, encouraging its future growth and success. We will continue to engage constructively and cooperatively with the UK government in this part of their review,"" said an Advent spokesperson. The defence technology firm has had a rocky time after issuing a series of profit warnings in 2016 and 2017, which required it to raise funds from its shareholders. Cobham has extensive contracts with the British military, including air-to-air plane refuelling, electronic warfare systems, and training military personnel to use software platforms in missile destroyers and fighter jets. Lady Nadine Cobham, 76, the widow of Sir Michael Cobham, who built up the firm over 25 years, recently spoke of her concerns about the takeover deal, telling theMail on Sunday,externalthat Cobham ""deserves to be protected"" by the government. ""It's an opportune moment for Advent to pounce and the reality is that Advent will break up Cobham and sell off its parts to the highest bidder. ""This may well include air-to-air refuelling, which is a real shocker,"" she said. She also said she would not accept Advent's assurances that it would maintain Cobham's UK and US headquarters, as well as investing further into the firm's research and development efforts. Successive governments have shown themselves to be intensely relaxed about foreign ownership of important bits of British infrastructure. Our power and water supplies, ports and airports are all owned by overseas investors. That relaxed attitude has even extended to defence, particularly when the foreign owners are from allied countries. Boeing, the US defence contractor, provides all kinds of kit, including Chinook helicopters, to the UK armed forces, while the new F-35 Lightning, the cutting edge of the Royal Air Force, is made by another American contractor, Lockheed Martin. That's why this morning's intervention by Andrea Leadsom has taken many by surprise. There was no groundswell of public opinion against the Advent bid for Cobham, despite the best efforts of the founding family to whip one up. A US buyer for a supplier of defence kit might be thought not to raise many issues of national security. But City sources pointed out this morning that silence should not have been mistaken for a lack of activity. Mrs Leadsom could not have intervened while the bid was still live - governments hate to affect commercial processes - but she was free to do so once Cobham shareholders approved the deal on Monday. Meanwhile, defence experts say that Cobham's speciality, air-to-air refuelling, could well be seen as a matter of national security. It is impossible to fight a modern war without the ability to keep aircraft in the air for long periods of time. When the Royal Air Force had to find a way to attack the Port Stanley airfield at short notice during the Falklands War, Cobham engineers made it possible. Cobham is also the undisputed world leader in the field, something that gives UK industry a big entrÃ©e to defence contracts round the world. Most think that in the end, the Advent deal will go through - but that the CMA investigation will result in legally binding undertakings that Cobham keep research and development capabilities here in the UK. Since 2002, the government is thought to have made 16 interventions on takeovers, nine of which were due to national security concerns. The government is still looking into a deal to sell Inmarsat to a consortium of private equity funds In July, the government chose to intervene in another defence and aerospace industry deal - the Â£2.7bn acquisition of satellite communications operator Inmarsat by a consortium of private equity funds. That probe is still ongoing. The move came after new laws were introduced in November, making it easier for the authorities to block takeover bids where there is a risk of technology being acquired by foreign firms. Inmarsat operates satellites that manage critical government communications for the UK and several other countries, particularly in emergency services, naval operations and border control. So far the government has looked into nine takeover deals due to concerns over national security: General Dynamics and Alvis (2004) Finmeccanica and AgustaWestland (2004) Finmeccanica's acquisition of parts of BAE Systems (2005) Lockheed Martin and Insys Group (2005) The General Electric Company and Smiths Aerospace (2007) Atlas Elektronik UK's acquisition of QinetiQ's Under Water Systems division (2009) Sepura and Hytera (2017) Northern Aerospace and Gardner Aerospace (2018) Inmarsat and Connect Bidco (2019) Royal Navy frigate order goes to Babcock Security upgrade plan for spy base LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Joe Biden says Jimmy Carter made a 'powerful difference' in funeral eulogy Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?

Inflation surprise as computer game prices drop,"Inflation growth slowed sharply in August to 1.7% after computer game prices dropped and clothing prices were slow to recover from the summer sales. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation fell below 2.1% in July,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external It is the lowest rate since late 2016. As well as the falling cost of computer games, the ONS said clothing prices rose ""less than last year after the end of the summer sales"". Economists had expected inflation to dip to 1.9% in August. The sharper fall sent the pound down 0.41% against the dollar to $1.2450. The fall should benefit households, pushing wage growth further above the rate of inflation. Recent figures showed that pay, excluding bonuses,increased by 3.8% between May and July. The biggest drop in CPI inflation came from the ""recreation and culture"" sector, where prices fell by 5% in August, in particular in computer games and downloads. The ONS said: ""Price movements for games can often be relatively large, depending on the composition of bestseller charts."" A hangover from retailers' summer sales also weighed on clothing and footwear prices. Although prices rose by 1.8%, it was below the 3.1% increase recorded last August. The ONS said that prices usually grew around this time of year as autumn ranges started to enter shops. But it said the smaller rise ""may have been influenced by the proportion of items on sale"". Andrew Verity, economics correspondent While cheaper computer games contributed most to the slower rise in the cost of living, today's inflation figures also give us a hint of price pressures coming down the pipeline - or rather, the lack of them. The prices charged by food manufacturers to retailers, for example, are down. And prices paid by manufacturers for their raw materials dropped by 0.8% in the year to August. Much of that was down to falling oil prices. As the global economic slowdown reduced demand around the world, the standard UK measure - the price of a barrel of crude from the North Sea oilfield of Brent - dropped by 19%. The global slowdown, in other words, has removed much of the upward pressure on prices. On the financial markets, traders currently now anticipate no change to interest rates for at least a year, with the next move more likely to be down than up. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said companies may be delaying raising prices until there is clarity over Brexit. ""Our analysis of 130,000 goods and services included in the basket suggests that fewer firms raised prices than is typical for this time of year,"" said NIESR's senior economist Jason Lennard. ""Firms are probably waiting to see beyond 31 October before adjusting prices."" The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is holding its two-day meeting to decide on interest rates ahead of an announcement on Thursday. Pantheon Macroeconomics chief UK economist Samuel Tombs said: ""The chance that the MPC follows other central banks and cuts bank rate this year remains slim, despite the sharp fall in CPI inflation in August."" Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, agrees there is unlikely to be any change. The Bank wants to retain flexibility ahead of Brexit and has indicated it's prepared to play the ball as it comes off the wicket in the event of a disruptive exit. ""On the other hand, if everything goes smoothly, the Bank thinks it'll need to lift rates gently in the near future to head off higher prices.""

Trump names new national security adviser,"President Donald Trump and new national security adviser Robert O'Brien US President Donald Trump has named a new national security adviser to replace John Bolton. Robert O'Brien has had a long career in foreign policy working for both main US parties and currently heads hostage negotiations at the State Department. He is Mr Trump's fourth national security adviser. As top adviser on national security, Mr O'Brien will be tasked with tackling everything from immigration policy to heightened tensions with Iran. John Bolton: Who is hawk fired by Trump? Trumpâs pragmatic view of troubled world The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The president and his new appointee spoke with reporters on Wednesday morning in Los Angeles. ""Robert has been fantastic,"" Mr Trump said, praising Mr O'Brien's work with hostages. ""We know each other well."" Mr O'Brien said it was a ""privilege"" to take on the role. ""We've got a number of challenges but there's a great team in place,"" he said. ""I look forward to working with them and working with the president to keep America safe and continue to rebuild our military."" Mr O'Brien follows Mr Bolton, HR McMaster and Michael Flynn in the role, which does not require confirmation by Congress. The new national security adviser trained as a lawyer then went on to advise Republicans on foreign policy and has served in various government roles. Robert O'Brien has had a long diplomatic career working for both Republicans and Democrats Former President Bush appointed him in 2005 to serve as a representative to the UN General Assembly. While at the UN, he worked with Mr Bolton, who was then the ambassador. He has also worked for former secretaries of state Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. A former Obama administration official was among those who celebrated the appointment of Mr O'Brien. ""All I have to say is that @robertcobrien is a really, really good person and that I wish him all the best in what will certainly be a challenging role,"" said Andrew Exum, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for Middle East policy, on Twitter.

The new Trump pick and his predecessor share some similar views. Mr O'Brien was critical of the UN in his book, While America Slept: Restoring American Leadership to a World in Crisis. He wrote that his son described the general assembly as ""when all the dictators come to America and give speeches about how bad we are"", something Mr O'Brien called ""one of the better descriptions"" he had heard. Mr O'Brien has also criticised the Iran nuclear deal, calling Iran ""the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world"". This video can not be played Speaking in April 2019, Robert O'Brien addresses families of Americans held captive abroad In his role as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Mr O'Brien works with families of US hostages and advises on related issues, including recovery policies. Mr O'Brien was involved with the release of US rapper ASAP Rocky from Swedish detention last month. He is believed to be the highest-ranking Mormon member of the Trump administration. Mr Bolton, a foreign policy hard-liner, was ousted after repeated clashes with the president and other members of the administration, particularly regarding North Korea and Venezuela. Mr Trump tweeted on 10 September that he had asked Mr Bolton for his resignation because he ""disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions"". Moments after the president's announcement, Mr Bolton said that actually he had offered to resign, and Mr Trump said they would ""talk about it"". Sources said the National Security Council, which advises the president, had become a separate entity within the White House under Mr Bolton and many within the White House criticised Mr Bolton's approach. After more than a year of having a political and ideological lightning rod as national security adviser, Donald Trump went with a much more conventional choice. Where outgoing NSA John Bolton was bombastic - an outside personality with an eye for the television cameras - Robert O'Brien is a behind-the-scenes bureaucratic player. He spent much of his career practising law, and when he did make forays into public service, it was mostly in roles deep in the machinery of government. Mr O'Brien, a civilian, also stands in contrast to the two former generals that the president has chosen for the position, Michael Flynn and HR McMaster. His selection could be an indication that Mr Trump is losing his early affinity for military brass. Given that O'Brien was a foreign policy adviser for the Mitt Romney and Scott Walker's presidential campaigns and worked in the George W Bush administration, Mr Trump's move could also help repair strained relations with the conservative foreign policy establishment. Mr O'Brien takes this top national security position as multiple global disputes teeter on the brink of full-blown crisis. He will work for a commander-in-chief who prides himself on his unpredictability. The task ahead is daunting. Mr O'Brien takes up the role with the administration on the brink of a full-blown crisis with Iran following attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. The US blames Iran for the attacks but Iran has denied any involvement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held discussions in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to explore possible responses. Mr O'Brien will also need to work with the president on a strategy for persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have met three times but tangible signs of progress have been scant. Then there is Afghanistan. This month the US and the Taliban appeared close to a deal to end the long-running conflict but Mr Trump abruptly cancelled a planned meeting following the death of a US soldier in an attack by the insurgents. One of the Taliban's chief negotiators told the BBC their ""doors are open"" and that negotiation is ""the only way for peace in Afghanistan"".

'Daughter's gambling addiction left me homeless',"Kimberly Wadsworth began gambling in 2015 against a backdrop of personal problems The mother of a woman who killed herself after gambling away Â£36,000 in a fortnight hopes a new NHS service will stop others facing the same pain. Kimberly Wadsworth even gambled away money raised to pay off her debts, leaving her mother Kay homeless. The Northern Gambling Service clinic in Leeds is the first outside London. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said no-one's access to support should depend on where they live. Kimberly, 32, who lived in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, started gambling at casinos and online in 2015 against a backdrop of depression, the death of her father and an unhappy marriage. She tried to hide it from her mother, but had spent Â£44,000 on gambling, including Â£17,000 from her grandmother's will. Mrs Wadsworth, 65, said: ""I sold my house in Leeds, the family home. I gave her Â£36,000 so that she could pay off her gambling debts and she didn't pay it off. ""She didn't pay a penny off and she just gambled it all away within two weeks and I became homeless."" Kay Wadsworth's daughter gambled Â£36,000 of her money She said she had arranged for Kimberly to see a hypnotherapist to get her through her gambling addiction but she never went. Instead, she sent her mum a message which read ""It's too late for me, mum"", before taking her life. Mrs Wadsworth said if help had been more readily available then her daughter would still be alive. ""They know how to deal with these people that are gambling addicts, and they know the signs,"" she said. ""It's the signs, and knowing what they've said and knowing that they're hiding it. And the lies that they tell, it's unbelievable."" The Northern Gambling Service will aim to help people with the most serious problems, including those at risk of suicide. NHS to help gambling addicts as young as 13 Bookmakers pledge Â£100m to avoid crackdown Why is gambling so addictive? It has been commissioned by NHS England and Gamble Aware and is run by Leeds and York Partnership Foundation Trust. An estimated 340,000 people across the UK have a serious gambling addiction, according to the Gambling Commission. The NHS and the charity Gamble Aware are jointly funding the service in the north of England - which is expected to cost about Â£1m a year - for the next three years. The service is set to open centres in Manchester and Sunderland, to serve the north of England and north Midlands. More stories from Yorkshire Mr Hancock said: ""As part of our NHS Long Term Plan, we will continue to roll out these specialist services across the country and undo the damage caused by gambling and protect our most vulnerable."" Chris Murphy has spent more than Â£100,000 on gambling Chris Murphy, from Leeds, has agreed to help mentor gamblers who are referred to the new service. He became addicted to gambling after winning Â£350 on a bet aged 17. Since then, he has spent more than Â£100,000 on gambling and tried to take his own life aged 23. The 33-year-old has not gambled for eight months. ""Looking at it as a health problem - you're unwell. So you need support with that. That's an important thing, because there's a lot of self-defeatism, thinking 'why can't I just stop?'. ""It's probably harder to understand than drug and alcohol addiction, with it not being a substance that you're addicted to. ""There's nothing wrong in admitting you need help with something. I think that was one of the things that set me back, that I could do it alone, that I should be able to stop through willpower. ""Actually accepting I have no willpower over that activity, that's where the power really lies in stopping."" Matthew Gaskell, consultant psychologist and clinical lead for the Northern Gambling Service, said the centre could potentially turn around many people's lives. ""Some people can be suicidal, have other mental health problems, relationship breakdown, employment difficulties, financial difficulties as well - so we're going to get some people really very distressed and in real desperate need of help. ""The important message is not everyone is the same so they will get a very personalised care package. ""There's talking therapy which will actively address the gambling problem, also help the person build the life they want for themselves and their families and their future and that's really important.

Israel election delivers deadlocked parliamentNeither PM Benjamin Netanyahu's party not that of his main rival has gained enough seats to govern.Middle East,"There is no clear route to government for either Benjamin Netanyahu or Benny Gantz No clear winner has emerged from Israel's election, leaving a question mark over who will be prime minister, partial official results show. With 63% of votes counted, the party of right-wing incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu is just behind that of his centrist main challenger, Benny Gantz. The results indicate that both men will struggle to form a majority coalition with smaller parties. Mr Netanyahu is hoping to stay in power for a record fifth term. Citing sources in the Central Election Committee, Israeli media reported that Mr Gantz's Blue and White alliance was on track to win 33 of the 120 seats in the Knesset (parliament), followed by Mr Netanyahu's Likud party with 32 seats. A centre-left bloc led by Mr Gantz and a bloc of right-wing and religious parties led by Mr Netanyahu were both projected to control 56 seats - five short of a majority. Most important things to know about Israel's election Bowen: A referendum on Netanyahu Mr Netanyahu, who became Israel's longest-serving prime minister in July, has been in office for three consecutive terms since 2009. The 69-year-old has pledged to unilaterally annex Jewish settlements and a swathe of other territory in the occupied West Bank if he is returned to power. This video can not be played Benjamin Netanyahu's options are ""shrinking"" after Israel election, says biographer Anshel Pfeffer Palestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in occupied East Jerusalem, have warned such a move will kill any hopes for peace. Mr Gantz has not advocated any form of annexation, though his position on the creation of a Palestinian state is unclear. Like Mr Netanyahu, he has ruled out ever dividing Jerusalem. Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Benny Gantz: The Israeli ex-military chief challenging Netanyahu Official results have been slow to be released by the Central Election Committee, withonly 63.4% of votes counted by 22:16 (19:16 GMT) on Wednesday,external. They put Blue and White about 1.6 percentage points ahead of Likud in the vote count. The Joint List, an alliance of Arab parties, was in third place, the ultra-Orthodox Shas party fourth, and Yisrael Beiteinu, a nationalist party, fifth. The CEC tally does not say how this translates into seats in the Knesset. Based on the projections by Israeli media, neither Mr Gantz nor Mr Netanyahu would be able to form a majority coalition without support from Yisrael Beiteinu. Its leader, Avigdor Lieberman, reiterated on Wednesday that he would only support a unity government that included Likud and Blue and White. However, Mr Gantz has ruled out sitting with Likud if it is led by Mr Netanyahu because the prime minister is facing charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three corruption cases, pending a final hearing next month. Mr Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing. Analysis by Tom Bateman, BBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The prime minister is well short of being able to form a governing bloc of right-wing and religious parties that are prepared to sit with him. In fact the result leaves him in an even weaker position than he was after April's vote. It's almost impossible to predict the outcome, with frenetic horse trading on the way and even the chance of parties fragmenting or politicians shifting allegiances. But as it stands, three broad themes seem among the possibilities: A dominant new governing bloc of the two big rival parties: Likud with Blue and White. This only seems possible without Mr Netanyahu as Likud leader. Needless to say that's a deal breaker for him and, so far at least, for his party Mr Netanyahu's political rival Avigdor Lieberman miraculously changes his mind and agrees to join a right-wing and religious Netanyahu government - something his voters understood would never happen A third election - which nobody here has an appetite for In the meantime, Mr Netanyahu stays on, but watch this space. For a few weeks. In a speech to supporters at a post-election rally in Tel Aviv late on Tuesday, Mr Gantz said he wanted to form a ""broad unity government that will express the will of the people"" and ""start the journey of repairing Israeli society"". ""We will begin negotiations and I will speak with everyone,"" he added. Avigdor Lieberman says he wants a ""broad, liberal, national government"" The former military chief said he would reach out to Yisrael Beitenu and the left-wing Labour-Gesher and Democratic Camp parties. He did not mention the Joint List, which is unlikely to sit in any Israeli government, but later spoke by telephone with its leader Ayman Odeh. At a news conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday night, Mr Netanyahu said: ""There are only two options, a government led by me or a dangerous government dependent on the Arab parties."" Mr Lieberman prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after the last election in April because he refused to back down in a longstanding dispute with religious parties over exempting ultra-Orthodox young men from military service.

"Businessman abducted, beaten and dumped by road","Kevin Lunney is the chief operating officer at Quinn Industrial Holdings A prominent businessman has been abducted in County Fermanagh before being beaten and left at the side of a road in the Republic of Ireland. Kevin Lunney, 50, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings, was driving from work to his home in Kinawley when he was attacked at 18:40 BST on Tuesday. He was found 22 miles (35km) away beside a road in County Cavan at about 21:00 and was taken to hospital. Detectives on both sides of the Irish border are investigating the attack. This video can not be played He was 'bundled into the boot' of a car PSNI Supt Clive Beatty said: ""His injuries are severe and savage. Although not life threatening, they will definitely be life changing. ""Four masked men appeared, smashed the windows of Mr Lunney's vehicle, forcibly removed him from the vehicle and bundled him into the boot of a black Audi saloon and drove him away from his home."" Mr Lunney was badly beaten, suffering a broken leg and ""other very severe but non-life-threatening injuries"", said Quinn Industrial Holdings. His car and another vehicle were found on fire near the Lunney family's home. Kevin Lunney was a close associate of the County Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn and worked with him in his attempts to regain control of the Quinn Group business empire that collapsed in 2012 after Mr Quinn made adisastrous investment in Anglo Irish Bank. There was a series of attacks in 2014 on property belonging to the new owners, including a fuel tanker that was driven into the headquarters building and set on fire. After a buyout by local businessmen, Mr Lunney and other former colleagues were brought back into the manufacturing business and Mr Quinn was employed as a consultant. But Mr Quinn left amid accusations he had been ""stabbed in the back"" and since then there has been a new wave of attacks, threats and intimidation. In spite of Mr Quinn condemning the attacks, they have continued and the company has warned that if they don't stop someone will be seriously injured or even killed. Mr Lunney's abduction and beating has proved those fears are justified. Adrian Barden, the chairman of Quinn Industrial Holdings, said the ""brutal"" incident was the latest in a series of attacks targeting senior staff in the company. Last year, a car belonging to the company's chief finance officer wasset on fire outside his home as his young family slept. Posters marked ""wanted"" and branding Mr Lunney and other Quinn Industrial Holdings directors as ""traitors"" appeared last year in Derrylin, County Fermanagh, where the company is based. In February, Mr Lunney's nose was broken in an alleged attack at a service station in County Cavan. Posters like this are part of a campaign to intimidate Kevin Lunney and other directors, a court heard in March ""Kevin Lunney's abduction and assault is an outrageous attack on a hard-working father of six children but also on his 830 colleagues at Quinn Industrial Holdings and the wider community in the Cavan-Fermanagh region,"" added Mr Barden. ""For several hours last evening Kevin's wife, family and very many friends were left to contemplate the worst."" Mr Barden called on police forces on both sides of the border to ""act quickly and decisively to prevent an inevitable loss of life"" by ""bringing those responsible to justice"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it wanted information about what it described as a ""horrific attack"". It has asked anyone who saw a black Audi car being driven in Derrylin or Swanlinbar in County Cavan to contact detectives. Mr Lunney joined the Quinn business in 1995, working in its then newly-established insurance division. He later became responsible for other parts of the business, including its property portfolio. The area where Kevin Lunney was abducted was cordoned off by police on Wednesday The companies comprising Quinn Industrial Holdings were formerly owned by Sean Quinn, who was once Ireland's richest man. His business empire included insurance, property development and the manufacture and supply of building products, glass and plastics. When it collapsed, businessmen backed by three investment funds bought the manufacturing companies in December 2014 - the firms are run by former close associates of Mr Quinn. After he was discharged from bankruptcy, Mr Quinn was employed as a consultant at his former company but he left the role in 2016 amid tension between him and the management team. It was reported at the time that he left by mutual agreement with the owners. Mr Quinn later said he had been forced out and that his family had been ""stabbed in the back"" by their former company. But he hasrepeatedly condemned attackson property belonging to the owners of his former businesses. Kevin Lunny was a close associate of Sean Quinn, who was once Ireland's richest man His son Sean Quinn Jr said on Wednesday that his family was horrified by the attack on Mr Lunney. ""The people that are carrying out these despicable acts are not doing so for our benefit... and we are totally against this type of activity,"" he added. In March, a court heard that other people who are unhappy Mr Quinn is no longer in charge of the firms he established were behind a campaign targeting Quinn Industrial Holdings executives. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster, a Northern Ireland Assembly member for the area in which Mr Lunney lives and works, said the incident was ""totally abhorrent"".

Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM,"This video can not be played Luxembourg's PM spoke beside the empty podium where Boris Johnson was due to appear Luxembourg's PM has attacked Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit, calling the situation a ""nightmare"". Xavier Bettel said the British government had failed to put forward any serious proposals for a new deal. But Mr Johnson, who pulled out of a joint press conference with Mr Bettel because of noisy protesters, said there was still a good chance of a deal. A government source said the gap the UK and Brussels needed to bridge to achieve a deal ""remains quite large"". Mr Johnson was visiting Luxembourg to hold talks with the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well as Mr Bettel. After the working lunch with Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier, Mr Johnson said he had been encouraged by the EU's willingness to engage with the UK in their shared desire to avoid a no-deal exit - but there had not been a ""total breakthrough"". However, the European Commission said the PM had yet to present concrete proposals for it to consider and insisted any new plans had to be ""compatible"" with the existing withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected three times by MPs. There was then confusion after Mr Bettel held a press conference without Mr Johnson amid noisy protests by anti-Brexit protesters. Mr Bettel, who addressed the media on his own after the UK PM pulled out, said his counterpart ""holds the future of all UK citizens in his hands"" and suggested it was his responsibility to break the deadlock in the process. What does 'podiumgate' say about Brexit deal? In full: Boris Johnson interview from Luxembourg How are the UK's talks with the EU going? This video can not be played Johnson: EU have had 'bellyful' of delays Standing next to an empty lectern, Mr Bettel warned Mr Johnson ""you can't hold the future hostage for party political gain"". He said there were ""no concrete proposals at the moment on the table"" on a new Brexit deal from the UK and said the EU ""needs more than just words"". ""We need written proposals and the time is ticking, so stop speaking and act,"" he said. The existing withdrawal agreement was the ""only solution"", he added. Mr Johnson said his joint press conference was cancelled over fears the two leaders would have been ""drowned out"" by pro-EU protesters. It is understood that his request for it to be held inside was turned down. What exactly should we make of the oh so public venting on Monday by the prime minister of Luxembourg following his meeting with Boris Johnson? Does this mean the EU has lost patience and will no longer engage in negotiations with the Johnson government? Can we expect an Angela Merkel rant or a Mark Rutte rave next? Quite the opposite. ""As long as there is a chance of a deal, it's in our own interest to engage. However frustrating negotiations are,"" a high-level EU contact told me. Read more from Katya's blog The EU's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted a photograph of the empty podium where Mr Johnson had been due to speak alongside Mr Bettel with the caption: ""From Incredible Hulk to incredible sulk"".

Over the weekend Mr Johnson told a newspaper that the UK would break out of its ""manacles"" like cartoon character The Incredible Hulk - with or without a deal. After the working lunch with Mr Juncker, Mr Johnson told the BBC's political editor he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the state of negotiations and suggested the EU wanted to bring the two and half years of arguments about the terms of the UK's exit to an end. ""I see no point whatever in staying on in the EU beyond October 31st and we're going to come out. And actually that is what our friends and partners in the EU would like too. ""And I think that they've had a bellyful of all this stuff. You know they want to develop a new relationship with the UK. They're fed up with these endless negotiations, endless delays."" This video can not be played 'What a load of claptrap' While he was working ""very hard"" to get a deal, Mr Johnson said there would be no agreement unless the EU shifted its position on the backstop, the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. ""If we can't get movement from them on that crucial issue... we won't be able to get it through the House of Commons, no way."" He said there were a number of ideas under discussion which would allow the whole of the UK to leave the EU while protecting the integrity of the bloc's single market, upholding the Good Friday Agreement and supporting the Irish economy. These, he said, included the use of technology to minimise border checks as well as the so-called Stormont lock, a mechanism to give Northern Irish politicians a say on the rules that apply to Northern Ireland. ""It is all doable with energy and goodwill,"" he insisted. A UK government source later said: ""It's clear Brussels is not yet ready to find the compromises required for a deal, so no-deal remains a real possibility - as the gap we need to bridge remains quite large."" As soon as we arrived at the office of the prime minister of Luxembourg it became obvious a planned outdoor news conference could not go ahead. The anti-Brexit protesters in the square numbered less than 100 but their music and megaphones made it sound like a lot more and they occasionally used language you wouldn't want to hear on the news. Behind the scenes the British and Luxembourgish delegations grappled with a diplomatic dilemma: Move the event inside but exclude the majority of the journalists? Gamble that the demonstrators could pipe down for a bit? Silence the host to save the guest's blushes? The end result saw Mr Johnson do a short interview at the ambassador's residence to be shared with everyone while Mr Bettel took to the stage next to an empty podium. He used the moment in the spotlight to deliver an impassioned speech, made all the more dramatic by the fact he's famed as one of the EU's most smiley, mild-mannered leaders. Mr Johnson said he would meet the Halloween Brexit deadline come what may, insisting that the UK would be ""in very good shape"" whether there was a deal or not. But pushed on how he would get around the law requiring him to ask for an extension if there is no deal by 19 October, the PM did not explain how it would be possible. Ahead of Tuesday's Supreme Court hearing into whether the prorogation of Parliament was lawful, Mr Johnson defended the decision to suspend Parliament. Parliament was prorogued last week, ahead of a Queen's Speech on 14 October. Legal challenges to the decision have been lodged in the courts by opposition MPs and campaigners. Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Johnson described claims that Parliament was ""being deprived of the opportunity to scrutinise Brexit"" as ""all this mumbo jumbo"" and a ""load of claptrap"". ""I think people think that we've somehow stopped Parliament from scrutinising Brexit. ""What absolute nonsense. Parliament will be able to scrutinise the deal that I hope we will be able to do both before and after the European Council on October 17.""

Does PM's scorn signal a shift?,"This video can not be played Luxembourg's PM spoke beside the empty podium where Boris Johnson was due to appear What exactly should we make of the oh so public venting on Monday by the prime minister of Luxembourg following his meeting with Boris Johnson? Does this mean the EU has lost patience and will no longer engage in negotiations with the Johnson government? Can we expect an Angela Merkel rant or a Mark Rutte rave next? Quite the opposite. ""As long as there is a chance of a deal, it's in our own interest to engage. However frustrating negotiations are,"" a high-level EU contact told me. How are the UK's talks with the EU going? Where do the UK parties stand on Brexit? A simple guide to Brexit ""It's no secret the EU prefers an orderly Brexit. And if talks breaks down and end in no deal, we (the EU) won't be the ones to have closed the door in the UK's face. It's important that European voters know that."" That said, Prime Minister Bettel's effervescent irritation with the Brexit process is shared by most EU leaders behind closed doors. Frustration seems to seeps out of every pore sometimes in off-the-record conversations with EU diplomats and politicians. Annoyance that more than three years after the UK referendum on EU membership, the country and parliament are still divided over what kind of Brexit - if any - to pursue. This means in EU eyes, they could perform any manner of contortions, make all sorts of compromises in a Brexit deal and still be unsure as to whether it would get through parliament. Resentment that EU leaders are often depicted as the villains of Brexit by high-profile UK politicians and journalists while they insist they never wanted Brexit and now that it's happening it's damaging for the EU itself. Brexit uncertainty is very costly for EU businesses and European governments are spending hundreds of millions on preparing for a possible no deal outcome. Exasperation that Boris Johnson insists on talking about great progress being made in negotiations with the EU, whereas Brussels insiders claim serious talks with the prime minister's main EU envoy David Frost only began on Friday and he has still not presented a concrete proposal on how to replace the backstop guarantee for the Irish border. But most EU figures (bar a couple of well-known exceptions) think it politically prudent to hide any teeth-clenching and nostril-flaring in public. This video can not be played Johnson: EU have had 'bellyful' of delays Boris Johnson said on Monday he wanted to step up EU-UK Brexit contacts to daily meetings. Fine, responded the EU. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker repeated his assertion, previously made to Theresa May, that the EU was open for talk 24/7. But it's important to remember that Mr Juncker and European Commission negotiators don't have the legal power to change the Brexit deal, even if they wanted to. That power lies with the EU national leaders. What will happen with Brexit in the next month? No-deal Brexit: How might it affect the EU? Could Brexit change the taste of whisky? And they are locked in a tussle of words and ""alternative facts"" with the UK prime minister. Boris Johnson insists EU leaders must compromise if they really want a deal. They reply that Mr Johnson has yet to come up with any realistic proposals. Suggesting, as the UK prime minister has, that Northern Ireland follow EU rules on animal, plant and food safety doesn't fly with the EU as an alternative to the backstop. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The EU wants to know what goods are entering its single market after Brexit. So what about customs? The perceived patchy approach of the Johnson government - ""Oh that'll work itself out. There's technology and trusted trader schemes"" - is not acceptable to the EU. ""As long as UK proposals remain flabby and aspirational,"" one key EU diplomat put it to me, ""Brussels is unlikely to budge."" The devil as always is in the detail. If the UK had specific, targeted requests for compromise on the backstop, the other EU leaders would look to Ireland and if Dublin gave the nod, the EU as a whole would most likely follow suit. Equally, if Boris Johnson made a realistic request (from Brussels' point of view) on the backstop and Ireland were reluctant, then Dublin could well come under ""gentle pressure"" from other EU leaders to compromise. But with no concrete, legally operable proposals from the UK at this stage, the pressure felt on Ireland the EU as a whole to ""compromise"" is ""basically zero,"" my contacts tell me.

"Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - BarnierThe EU's chief negotiator says it is ""not enough"" for the UK to say what it does not want.","The EU's chief negotiator acknowledged Boris Johnson's concerns about the backstop The UK and EU ""should not pretend to be negotiating"" a Brexit deal if there are no new proposals on the table, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. He said the UK telling the EU what it does not like was ""not enough"". He cast doubt on a UK proposal to give Northern Ireland a future veto over EU rules, saying all parts of the UK would have to sign up to the terms of exit. The government said it had offered ""a number of proposals"" as alternatives to the Irish border backstop. The backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - has proved a key sticking point. The government said ""constructive discussions"" were ongoing and the UK had been ""clear"" in those discussions ""that the antidemocratic backstop needs to be removed"" if a new deal was to be reached. Boris Johnson has insisted a deal is possible at a crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October - although ministers have been reluctant to reveal the details of new proposals in advance for fear they will be ""rubbished"" by the EU. Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit What does 'podiumgate' say about Brexit deal? Does Luxembourg PM's scorn signal an EU shift? The PM has insisted he will not accept a further delay beyond 31 October despite MPs passing a law requiring him to seek an extension if there is no deal by 19 October. After meeting Mr Barnier and Mr Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday, Mr Johnson said both sides agreed to accelerate efforts to reach an agreement. There were significant moments in Strasbourg this morning, even if the discussion lacked the fireworks present in the Brexit debate elsewhere. Jean-Claude Juncker clearly signalled that in his last few weeks in office he will show solidarity with the Republic of Ireland rather than siding with the UK to get a deal. That will disappoint those in the UK who bank on him wanting an agreement to secure his legacy. The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave a cautious thumbs-up to the big British idea of an all-Ireland zone for plant and animal health. But he appeared to give a thumbs-down to another - giving the Stormont Assembly a decisive say over the Irish backstop, or whatever takes its place. Briefing the European Parliament, Mr Juncker said the lunch had been ""friendly and constructive"" but there had been no progress on the main sticking point - the UK's demand that the Northern Irish backstop should be removed from the current agreement. Mr Juncker said any alternative to the backstop must achieve the same objectives - to prevent the need for physical infrastructure on the border with the Republic of Ireland, to safeguard the EU's single market and protect all-Ireland economic co-operation. ""I said to Mr Johnson that I have no emotional attachment to the backstop but I stand by the objectives it is intended to achieve,"" he said. ""That is why I called on the PM to come forward with operational proposals in writing. ""Until such time those proposals have been presented, I will not be able to tell you looking you straight in the eye that any real progress has been achieved."" What are the Brexit backstop options? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Barnier said the UK had made it clear which parts of the backstop - which would see Northern Ireland closely tied to the single market and the UK follow EU customs rules until a new trade deal is agreed - it did not like, but ""that is not enough to move towards a solution"".

""Almost three years after the British referendum, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly not a question of pretending to negotiate,"" he said. If the UK wanted to remove the backstop, he said it must come up with answers to all the problems the temporary ""safety net"" was designed to solve. However, he appeared to reject UK proposals to give the Stormont Assembly in Belfast a say over how much Northern Ireland conforms with EU customs rules and diverges from England, Wales and Scotland while the UK remained in any backstop arrangement. ""It is up to the UK government to ensure the support of the Northern Irish institutions for the withdrawal agreement that would be signed on behalf of the whole of the UK,"" he said. Following a three-hour debate, the European Parliament approved a motion calling for any Brexit deal to include a backstop and also voted for the UK to be granted a further extension beyond 31 October if it asks for one. MEPs called on the EU to give the UK a further Brexit extension if it asked for one During the session, MEP Guy Verhofstadt called on the UK to give all three million EU nationals living in the country an automatic right to remain. Rather than channelling the ""angry Hulk"" - a reference to Mr Johnson's recent comparison of the UK to the Incredible Hulk -  the Parliament's Brexit spokesman said the PM should adopt the persona of a ""caring nanny"", such as Mrs Doubtfire. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was clear the UK and EU were paving the way for an agreement next month which would be portrayed as a ""victory"" for both sides. Even without the backstop, he said the deal on the table would be ""bad"" for the UK as it would see it ""trapped in EU rules and under the auspices of the European Court"". He also criticised they way Mr Johnson was treated during a visit to Luxembourg last week. He said the country's ""pipsqueak"" leader Xavier Bettel had ""ritually humiliated"" his counterpart by appearing at a press conference without him and berating his Brexit policy.

'My derelict pub still got TripAdvisor reviews',"In 2015, residential developer Charles Goodall bought a derelict pub called Bridge Inn in Middleton-in-Teesdale, a small market town in Durham, hoping to turn it into some houses. The pub hadn't been open for business since 2011, but on TripAdvisor, curiously people posted reviews for three years from 2014 to 2016, claiming to have had Sunday roasts and experienced poor service while doing so. ""We were looking for old photos of the pub on Google and the reviews came up. We found it quite funny,"" Mr Goodall, managing director of New Era Regeneration, told the BBC. ""I did contact TripAdvisor on their website and advised them that the reviews were impossible as the pub wasn't trading and they were slow to respond."" The reviews are still on the TripAdvisor website, but earlier this year the page was finally changed to show that the Bridge Inn is now closed. Mr Goodall added: ""I do use TripAdvisor myself and now I'm a bit sceptical about using the service because of this."" TripAdvisor has released its first ever Transparency Report, in which it reveals that in 2018, it prevented one million fake reviews from being displayed on its website. The derelict Bridge Inn in 2016, before it was converted into three houses The report is believed to be in response tocriticism of its reliabilityfrom a range of external parties, including aggrieved restaurateurs and hoteliers, as well as consumer watchdog Which?. TripAdvisor says 66 million reviews were submitted in 2018, and all of them were put through a moderation process that uses fraud detection technology, while 2.7 million reviews were further screened by a content moderation team. The reviews website says 79% of the reviews were assessed within six hours of being posted, and only 4.7% of reviews were rejected before or after the content had been posted. TripAdvisor defends itself in fake reviews row 'Why I write fake online reviews' ""These third parties do not have access to the key technical data necessary to determine whether or not a review is fraudulent. We do - and with this report, for the first time ever, we want to provide definitive insights into the details and data behind our extensive content moderation efforts,"" TripAdvisor's president and chief executive Stephen Kaufer wrote in the report. ""We do this in the spirit of transparency. We know we're not perfect. But we're constantly working to stay one step ahead of the people who try to abuse our platform - and we believe that no other review platform does more to protect the integrity of their content than TripAdvisor."" Restaurateur Robert Melman met with TripAdvisor in 2018 to express concerns about fake reviews Mr Goodall is not alone in being wary of TripAdvisor. Robert Melman, who founded the Fazenda chain of Brazilian restaurants, told the BBC that his restaurants have received one-star reviews he considers to be unfair. He alleged that some of the reviews came from people who have never dined at his restaurants, or from people who complain about the dress code or city rules preventing children from being in restaurants after a certain time of the day. Many of the negative reviews also come from accounts that post just once to review a Fazenda restaurant, and then never post again, he added. Mr Melman met TripAdvisor in 2018 to express his concerns, but he says nothing changed after that meeting. ""You try to deal with TripAdvisor, and they don't even reply, because they're so powerful and they don't care,"" he said. ""If one reviewer puts a review on my restaurant nine years ago and then never reviews again, then it means this person isn't interested in being a member of the TripAdvisor community and should have been taken off the site."" Reviewer Kurt Weideling has a different problem with TripAdvisor. He closed his account and stopped using the website in 2017, after two negative reviews he posted about hotels he stayed in were deleted by the website. Mr Weideling said that he had posted 10 reviews with his account and only two were negative: ""I basically said that the hotel was very poor value, having paid Â£200-plus for a room that was hot, noisy and with broken, unsafe furniture. The latter was a reference to the fact that the chairs in the room had pieces falling off them. When I sat on one, it nearly collapsed."" Former TripAdvisor reviewer Kurt Weideling stopped using the website after negative hotel reviews he posted were taken down He contacted TripAdvisor to ask why his reviews were deleted, and said he was given a generic response about how reviews could be taken down if they breached terms and conditions, or had been challenged by establishments and found to be biased or inaccurate. ""I didn't pursue the matter, and decided that if this was something TripAdvisor did regularly, then it called into question the legitimacy of their entire reviewing system. So I deleted my account and no longer use TripAdvisor for any purpose,"" he added. But many people do feel that TripAdvisor does offer them value and like using the website. ""TripAdvisor helped massively when I was travelling around Asia last year. I found some really good tips for excursions and came across some lovely restaurants,"" portfolio management analyst Holly Fennell told the BBC. Kathryn Benson, a property manager, agreed: ""I personally find TripAdvisor fantastic. I recently went to Krakow, Poland and booked Auschwitz, the salt mines and a bar crawl on there. Great reviews, great communication and I knew exactly what to expect."" Although some businesses are unhappy, many consumers say they find value in TripAdvisor reviews Several readers told the BBC that it was important to ""use common sense"" when looking at review websites, and to form their own opinions by comparing reviews on different websites and looking at actual photographs. The BBC contacted TripAdvisor for comment and the website said that it believes that both customers and business owners should have a voice. ""That is why we allow business owners the right to publicly respond to reviews, and their responses are published for all to see (subject to posting guidelines, just like reviews). So if an owner believes a review is unfair, they can highlight this in their response. Owner replies do make a difference,"" a TripAdvisor spokesman told the BBC. ""Research shows that customers do read what a business has to say in response to its reviews, and the tone of their replies can often have a bigger impact than the review itself. In other words, a business can often turn a negative review into a positive, just by the way it replies to that reviewer.""

Netanyahu and rival headed for election deadlock,"Exit polls suggest no clear route to government for Benjamin Netanyahu or Benny Gantz Unofficial results in Israel's second election in five months suggest it is too close to call, Israeli media say. Incumbent PM Benjamin Netanyahu's party and that of his main challenger, Benny Gantz, are neck and neck with 32 seats each, the Kan public broadcaster says. A prime minister needs to command a 61-seat majority in parliament. The smaller Yisrael Beiteinu party appears to hold the balance of power. Official partial results are expected on Wednesday. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has been in office for 10 years and is vying to win a record fifth term in office. The 69-year-old, who leads the right-wing Likud party, has pledged to annex Jewish settlements and a swathe of other territory in the occupied West Bank if he is returned to power. This video can not be played Netanyahu's situation is ""dire"", says biographer Anshel Pfeffer Palestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in occupied East Jerusalem, have warned such a move will kill any hopes for peace. Mr Gantz, who leads the centrist Blue and White party, has not advocated any form of annexation though his position on the creation of a Palestinian state is unclear. Like Mr Netanyahu, he has ruled out ever dividing Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital. On Wednesday morning, Yisrael Beiteinu's leader Avigdor Lieberman, reiterated that he would only support a government comprising both Likud and Blue and White. However, Blue and White has ruled out sitting with Mr Netanyahu in a coalition. Official results have been slow to be released, with only 30% of votes counted by 09:15 (06:15 GMT). They put Likud slightly ahead of Blue and White, with the ultra-Orthodox Shas party third and Yisrael Beiteinu fourth, but without indicating how this translates into seats in the Knesset (parliament). According to the Times of Israel, Kan is reporting unofficial results based on what it says is 96.9% of votes counted. It puts Likud and Blue and White both on 32 seats; the Israeli Arab Joint List second on 12 seats; Yisrael Beiteinu on nine; the ultra-Orthodox parties on 17 between them; the right-wing Yamina alliance on seven; Labour-Gesher on 6 and the centre-left Democratic Camp on 5. Based on these reported results, neither Mr Netanyahu nor Mr Gantz can form a majority coalition without support from Yisrael Beiteinu. Exit polls earlier presented a similar picture. Analysis by Tom Bateman, BBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The prime minister is well short of being able to form a governing bloc of right-wing and religious parties that are prepared to sit with him. In fact the result leaves him in an even weaker position than he was after April's vote. It's almost impossible to predict the outcome, with frenetic horse trading on the way, even the chance of parties fragmenting or politicians shifting allegiances. But as it stands three broad themes seem among the possibilities: A dominant new governing bloc of the two big rival parties: Likud with Blue and White. This only seems possible without Mr Netanyahu as Likud leader. Needless to say that's a deal breaker for him and so far at least, for his party Mr Netanyahu's political rival Avigdor Lieberman miraculously changes his mind and agrees to join a right-wing and religious Netanyahu government - something his voters understood would never happen A third election - which nobody here has an appetite for. In the meantime, Mr Netanyahu stays on, but watch this space. For a few weeks. There was a muted response at Likud's election night headquarters in Tel Aviv. Hundreds of chairs for party supporters remained empty, as activists were kept outside the hall and leaders digested the numbers. Likud's foreign affairs director noted that Israeli exit polls had got things wrong in the past. Last time, they underestimated the number of votes for Likud and also for some of the religious parties allied to Mr Netanyahu. Most important things to know about Israel's election Bowen: A referendum on Netanyahu ""There is no point starting to work out a coalition based on these numbers as they will change,"" Eli Hazan said. But Blue and White was ""cautiously optimistic"" that Israel would get new leadership,spokeswoman Melody Sucharewicz told the Times of Israel,external. The BBC's Tom Bateman says that if the projections are correct Mr Netanyahu has no simple route to government. In fact, the figures put him in an even weaker position than after April's election, when coalition talks collapsed, he adds. Avigdor Lieberman says he wants a ""broad, liberal, national government"" Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Benny Gantz: The Israeli ex-military chief challenging Netanyahu Mr Lieberman prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after that vote because he refused to back down over a longstanding dispute with religious parties over exempting ultra-Orthodox young men from military service. Mr Gantz could have an even more complex job to form a government, because of differences between left-wing parties.

Job applications 'filtered by university rank',"Graduates of 24 top UK universities are more likely to find work soon after graduating than those from other universities, research says. Four-fifths of Russell Group graduates entered full-time work within weeks of leaving compared with two-thirds of those from other institutions, a survey for graduate recruiter Milkround found. It said firms used a tick-box system to filter candidates via the league table position of their universities. Milkround surveyed 1,500 new graduates. The graduate jobs board has helped students and graduates to connect with leading employers for decades. It pointed out that some of the best academic universities, such as Aberdeen, St Andrews and Lancaster, did not belong to the prestigious research-focused Russell Group. The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Young 'pessimistic' about social mobility Private school and Oxbridge 'take top jobs' The Russell Group is made up of 24 leading universities: Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Durham, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Imperial College London, King's College London, Leeds, Liverpool, London School of Economics and Political Science, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford, Queen Mary University of London, Queen's University Belfast, Sheffield, Southampton, University College London, Warwick and York. Georgina Brazier, a graduate jobs expert at Milkround, said businesses were missing out on the chance to recruit some ""fantastic grads from other universities"". She also urged employers to take a more balanced approach, rather than taking ""tick-box exercises such as filtering candidates by university league tables"". ""While there's no doubt that many students dream of attending reputationally prestigious universities such as Oxford or Cambridge, most graduates are left with the same level of debt or student loans (and same tuition fees) regardless of what university they attended,"" she said. ""The investment students make to attend university and gain their degree is substantial and whilst academic success should be applauded, some graduates feel the return on investment when entering the workplace should be fairer."" A separate poll of 7,000 students for Milkround found a significant minority wanted recruitment to be carried out ""blind"" to candidates' gender, religion and anything that would denote socio-economic background. A number of high profile firms, such as Deloite, KPMG and the civil service, already use name blind application processes. Dr Jack Britton, at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, found, in 2017, Russell Group graduates earned an average of Â£33,500 after five years - about 40% more than those who had studied at other universities. Graduates of several other institutions - many of them dance and drama colleges - had average earnings closer to Â£15,000. But Dr Britton said much of this could be attributed to the abilities and interests of the graduates themselves rather than the quality of their universities. And he pointed out entrants to Russell Group universities started their degrees with better exam grades, on average. In November last yeara study from Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studiesfound that women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. The study also found men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates.

"Businessman abducted, beaten and dumped at roadside","Kevin Lunney is the chief operating officer at Quinn Industrial Holdings A prominent businessman has been abducted in County Fermanagh before being beaten and left at the side of a road in the Republic of Ireland. Kevin Lunney, 50, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings, was driving from work to his home in Kinawley when he was attacked at 18:40 BST on Tuesday. He was found 22 miles (35km) away beside a road in County Cavan at about 21:00 and was taken to hospital. Detectives on both sides of the Irish border are investigating the attack. This video can not be played He was 'bundled into the boot' of a car PSNI Supt Clive Beatty said: ""His injuries are severe and savage. Although not life threatening, they will definitely be life changing. ""Four masked men appeared, smashed the windows of Mr Lunney's vehicle, forcibly removed him from the vehicle and bundled him into the boot of a black Audi saloon and drove him away from his home."" Mr Lunney was badly beaten, suffering a broken leg and ""other very severe but non-life-threatening injuries"", said Quinn Industrial Holdings. His car and another vehicle were found on fire near the Lunney family's home. Kevin Lunney was a close associate of the County Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn and worked with him in his attempts to regain control of the Quinn Group business empire that collapsed in 2012 after Mr Quinn made adisastrous investment in Anglo Irish Bank. There was a series of attacks in 2014 on property belonging to the new owners, including a fuel tanker that was driven into the headquarters building and set on fire. After a buyout by local businessmen, Mr Lunney and other former colleagues were brought back into the manufacturing business and Mr Quinn was employed as a consultant. But Mr Quinn left amid accusations he had been ""stabbed in the back"" and since then there has been a new wave of attacks, threats and intimidation. In spite of Mr Quinn condemning the attacks, they have continued and the company has warned that if they don't stop someone will be seriously injured or even killed. Mr Lunney's abduction and beating has proved those fears are justified. Adrian Barden, the chairman of Quinn Industrial Holdings, said the ""brutal"" incident was the latest in a series of attacks targeting senior staff in the company. Last year, a car belonging to the company's chief finance officer wasset on fire outside his home as his young family slept. Posters marked ""wanted"" and branding Mr Lunney and other Quinn Industrial Holdings directors as ""traitors"" appeared last year in Derrylin, County Fermanagh, where the company is based. In February, Mr Lunney's nose was broken in an alleged attack at a service station in County Cavan. Posters like this are part of a campaign to intimidate Kevin Lunney and other directors, a court heard in March ""Kevin Lunney's abduction and assault is an outrageous attack on a hard-working father of six children but also on his 830 colleagues at Quinn Industrial Holdings and the wider community in the Cavan-Fermanagh region,"" added Mr Barden. ""For several hours last evening Kevin's wife, family and very many friends were left to contemplate the worst."" Mr Barden called on police forces on both sides of the border to ""act quickly and decisively to prevent an inevitable loss of life"" by ""bringing those responsible to justice"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it wanted information about what it described as a ""horrific attack"". It has asked anyone who saw a black Audi car being driven in Derrylin or Swanlinbar in County Cavan to contact detectives. Mr Lunney joined the Quinn business in 1995, working in its then newly-established insurance division. He later became responsible for other parts of the business, including its property portfolio. The area where Kevin Lunney was abducted was cordoned off by police on Wednesday The companies comprising Quinn Industrial Holdings were formerly owned by Sean Quinn, who was once Ireland's richest man. His business empire included insurance, property development and the manufacture and supply of building products, glass and plastics. When it collapsed, businessmen backed by three investment funds bought the manufacturing companies in December 2014 - the firms are run by former close associates of Mr Quinn. After he was discharged from bankruptcy, Mr Quinn was employed as a consultant at his former company but he left the role in 2016 amid tension between him and the management team. It was reported at the time that he left by mutual agreement with the owners. Mr Quinn later said he had been forced out and that his family had been ""stabbed in the back"" by their former company. But he hasrepeatedly condemned attackson property belonging to the owners of his former businesses. Kevin Lunny was a close associate of Sean Quinn, who was once Ireland's richest man His son Sean Quinn Jr said on Wednesday that his family was horrified by the attack on Mr Lunney.

"Harrow school to launch online sixth formThe historic private school is to teach A-levels over the internet for Â£15,000 per year.","The global wealthy will soon be able to send their children to a top English private school without having to leave home. Harrow is setting up a virtual sixth form which will teach A-levels online to pupils anywhere in the world. It will charge Â£15,000 per year and will initially focus on science and maths subjects, with education firm Pearson providing the technology. The new Harrow School Online will begin teaching from September 2020. Principal Heather Rhodes said the historic school was adapting to a ""rapidly changing world"". This is the latest attempt to use online technology to sell UK education overseas - with the school's brand being used to attract pupils who want to be taught through the internet. The online classes will only be available to pupils outside the UK - and so will not compete with its own bricks and mortar school in north-west London, where fees for boarders are almost Â£42,000 per year. The school is expected to appeal to affluent families in Russia, China, Nigeria, the Gulf and Hong Kong, who want A-levels from a prestigious private school teaching in English. Logging in to Harrow: The online version of the school will teach A-levels over the internet Ms Rhodes said it might also appeal to families working abroad who want more flexibility than a conventional international school. Harrow School Online will operate as a joint project with Pearson, which provides educational technology and also A-levels through its Edexcel exam board. Sharon Hague of Pearson said the online platform had already been tested, and was being used by more than 75,000 pupils learning online in the United States. Eton launches online lessons for China Oxford launches first online 'Mooc' course University science degree course online for Â£5,650 The A-level subjects - chemistry, physics, maths, further maths and economics - will be taught through video-conferencing, with classes of up to 15 pupils per teacher. The school expects to begin with a relatively small number of online pupils, but as the numbers grow, classes are likely to be scheduled around different time zones. There will also be one-to-one teaching and extra-curricular projects, said Ms Rhodes, creating a ""full-school experience"". Unlike the rest of Harrow, which only admits boys, the online school will teach both boys and girls - with entry depending on passing an admissions test. Founded in the 16th Century, Harrow has taught many famous pupils, including Sir Winston Churchill and actor Benedict Cumberbatch. The income will be shared between Pearson and Harrow, with the school saying money from online courses will be used to support bursaries for disadvantaged pupils.

National security fears threaten defence takeoverThe government is looking into Advent's Â£4bn takeover bid for British defence firm Cobham.,"The government is to intervene in a US private equity firm's takeover of UK defence and aerospace firm Cobham, citing national security concerns. Advent International made a Â£4bn offer to buy Cobham in July and shareholders approved the deal last month. But Cobham's founding family raised concerns about the company's future and its connections with UK defence. The government said it wanted to ""support private sector innovation whilst safeguarding public interest"". Dorset-based Cobham, which employs 10,000 people, is known for pioneering technology enabling the mid-air refuelling of planes. The firm also makes electronic warfare systems and communications for military vehicles. ""Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of Cobham, I have issued an intervention notice on the grounds of national security,"" said Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will investigate and carry out a review on the national security implications of the transaction. The government has the power to veto the deal if the CMA finds there are sufficient concerns. It must report the results of its decision by 29 October. Since 2002, the government is thought to have made 16 interventions on takeovers, nine of which were due to national security concerns. None of these deals have so far been blocked. ""Advent is committed to being a responsible steward of Cobham, encouraging its future growth and success. We will continue to engage constructively and cooperatively with the UK government in this part of their review,"" said an Advent spokesperson. The defence technology firm has had a rocky time after issuing a series of profit warnings in 2016 and 2017, which required it to raise funds from its shareholders. Cobham has extensive contracts with the British military, including air-to-air plane refuelling, electronic warfare systems, and training military personnel to use software platforms in missile destroyers and fighter jets. Lady Nadine Cobham, 76, the widow of Sir Michael Cobham, who built up the firm over 25 years, recently spoke of her concerns about the takeover deal, telling theMail on Sunday,externalthat Cobham ""deserves to be protected"" by the government. ""It's an opportune moment for Advent to pounce and the reality is that Advent will break up Cobham and sell off its parts to the highest bidder. ""This may well include air-to-air refuelling, which is a real shocker,"" she said. She also said she would not accept Advent's assurances that it would maintain Cobham's UK and US headquarters, as well as investing further into the firm's research and development efforts. Successive governments have shown themselves to be intensely relaxed about foreign ownership of important bits of British infrastructure. Our power and water supplies, ports and airports are all owned by overseas investors. That relaxed attitude has even extended to defence, particularly when the foreign owners are from allied countries. Boeing, the US defence contractor, provides all kinds of kit, including Chinook helicopters, to the UK armed forces, while the new F-35 Lightning, the cutting edge of the Royal Air Force, is made by another American contractor, Lockheed Martin. That's why this morning's intervention by Andrea Leadsom has taken many by surprise. There was no groundswell of public opinion against the Advent bid for Cobham, despite the best efforts of the founding family to whip one up. A US buyer for a supplier of defence kit might be thought not to raise many issues of national security. But City sources pointed out this morning that silence should not have been mistaken for a lack of activity. Mrs Leadsom could not have intervened while the bid was still live - governments hate to affect commercial processes - but she was free to do so once Cobham shareholders approved the deal on Monday. Meanwhile, defence experts say that Cobham's speciality, air-to-air refuelling, could well be seen as a matter of national security. It is impossible to fight a modern war without the ability to keep aircraft in the air for long periods of time. When the Royal Air Force had to find a way to attack the Port Stanley airfield at short notice during the Falklands War, Cobham engineers made it possible. Cobham is also the undisputed world leader in the field, something that gives UK industry a big entrÃ©e to defence contracts round the world. Most think that in the end, the Advent deal will go through - but that the CMA investigation will result in legally binding undertakings that Cobham keep research and development capabilities here in the UK. Since 2002, the government is thought to have made 16 interventions on takeovers, nine of which were due to national security concerns. The government is still looking into a deal to sell Inmarsat to a consortium of private equity funds In July, the government chose to intervene in another defence and aerospace industry deal - the Â£2.7bn acquisition of satellite communications operator Inmarsat by a consortium of private equity funds. That probe is still ongoing. The move came after new laws were introduced in November, making it easier for the authorities to block takeover bids where there is a risk of technology being acquired by foreign firms. Inmarsat operates satellites that manage critical government communications for the UK and several other countries, particularly in emergency services, naval operations and border control. So far the government has looked into nine takeover deals due to concerns over national security: General Dynamics and Alvis (2004) Finmeccanica and AgustaWestland (2004) Finmeccanica's acquisition of parts of BAE Systems (2005) Lockheed Martin and Insys Group (2005) The General Electric Company and Smiths Aerospace (2007) Atlas Elektronik UK's acquisition of QinetiQ's Under Water Systems division (2009) Sepura and Hytera (2017) Northern Aerospace and Gardner Aerospace (2018) Inmarsat and Connect Bidco (2019) Royal Navy frigate order goes to Babcock Security upgrade plan for spy base LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Joe Biden says Jimmy Carter made a 'powerful difference' in funeral eulogy Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?

"Netanyahu and rival headed for election deadlockThere is no clear winner in Israel's second general election in five months, exit polls suggest.Middle East","Exit polls suggest no clear route to government for Benjamin Netanyahu or Benny Gantz Unofficial results in Israel's second election in five months suggest it is too close to call, Israeli media say. Incumbent PM Benjamin Netanyahu's party and that of his main challenger, Benny Gantz, are neck and neck with 32 seats each, the Kan public broadcaster says. A prime minister needs to command a 61-seat majority in parliament. The smaller Yisrael Beiteinu party appears to hold the balance of power. Official partial results are expected on Wednesday. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has been in office for 10 years and is vying to win a record fifth term in office. The 69-year-old, who leads the right-wing Likud party, has pledged to annex Jewish settlements and a swathe of other territory in the occupied West Bank if he is returned to power. This video can not be played Netanyahu's situation is ""dire"", says biographer Anshel Pfeffer Palestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in occupied East Jerusalem, have warned such a move will kill any hopes for peace. Mr Gantz, who leads the centrist Blue and White party, has not advocated any form of annexation though his position on the creation of a Palestinian state is unclear. Like Mr Netanyahu, he has ruled out ever dividing Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital. On Wednesday morning, Yisrael Beiteinu's leader Avigdor Lieberman, reiterated that he would only support a government comprising both Likud and Blue and White. However, Blue and White has ruled out sitting with Mr Netanyahu in a coalition. Official results have been slow to be released, with only 30% of votes counted by 09:15 (06:15 GMT). They put Likud slightly ahead of Blue and White, with the ultra-Orthodox Shas party third and Yisrael Beiteinu fourth, but without indicating how this translates into seats in the Knesset (parliament). According to the Times of Israel, Kan is reporting unofficial results based on what it says is 96.9% of votes counted. It puts Likud and Blue and White both on 32 seats; the Israeli Arab Joint List second on 12 seats; Yisrael Beiteinu on nine; the ultra-Orthodox parties on 17 between them; the right-wing Yamina alliance on seven; Labour-Gesher on 6 and the centre-left Democratic Camp on 5. Based on these reported results, neither Mr Netanyahu nor Mr Gantz can form a majority coalition without support from Yisrael Beiteinu. Exit polls earlier presented a similar picture. Analysis by Tom Bateman, BBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The prime minister is well short of being able to form a governing bloc of right-wing and religious parties that are prepared to sit with him. In fact the result leaves him in an even weaker position than he was after April's vote. It's almost impossible to predict the outcome, with frenetic horse trading on the way, even the chance of parties fragmenting or politicians shifting allegiances. But as it stands three broad themes seem among the possibilities: A dominant new governing bloc of the two big rival parties: Likud with Blue and White. This only seems possible without Mr Netanyahu as Likud leader. Needless to say that's a deal breaker for him and so far at least, for his party Mr Netanyahu's political rival Avigdor Lieberman miraculously changes his mind and agrees to join a right-wing and religious Netanyahu government - something his voters understood would never happen A third election - which nobody here has an appetite for. In the meantime, Mr Netanyahu stays on, but watch this space. For a few weeks. There was a muted response at Likud's election night headquarters in Tel Aviv. Hundreds of chairs for party supporters remained empty, as activists were kept outside the hall and leaders digested the numbers. Likud's foreign affairs director noted that Israeli exit polls had got things wrong in the past. Last time, they underestimated the number of votes for Likud and also for some of the religious parties allied to Mr Netanyahu. Most important things to know about Israel's election Bowen: A referendum on Netanyahu ""There is no point starting to work out a coalition based on these numbers as they will change,"" Eli Hazan said. But Blue and White was ""cautiously optimistic"" that Israel would get new leadership,spokeswoman Melody Sucharewicz told the Times of Israel,external. The BBC's Tom Bateman says that if the projections are correct Mr Netanyahu has no simple route to government. In fact, the figures put him in an even weaker position than after April's election, when coalition talks collapsed, he adds. Avigdor Lieberman says he wants a ""broad, liberal, national government"" Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Benny Gantz: The Israeli ex-military chief challenging Netanyahu Mr Lieberman prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after that vote because he refused to back down over a longstanding dispute with religious parties over exempting ultra-Orthodox young men from military service. Mr Gantz could have an even more complex job to form a government, because of differences between left-wing parties.

Israel's election: Why it matters,"Israelis are going to the polls on Tuesday for a second general election in just five months. What happens matters not only in Israel but also beyond. Here are five of the most important things to know. Israel has the strongest military in the Middle East (and is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal), and the prime minister decides when to send it into action. Although the country is not fighting any full-scale wars at the moment, there is the ever-present danger that fresh conflict will erupt with its regional foes. The two main contenders for the premiership have both positioned themselves as tough on security - the incumbent, Benjamin Netanyahu, has followed a strategy of air strikes and covert action against threats from neighbouring countries, while his most prominent challenger, Benny Gantz, is a former military chief on whose watch many such operations were carried out. Jeremy Bowen: Election a referendum on Netanyahu Whoever wins will have to decide how to deal with the biggest dangers - the growing presence on Israel's borders of forces backed by Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, and a belief that Iran wants to develop a nuclear bomb - and whether to risk a war whose consequences, observers have warned, will be catastrophic. The fate of the Palestinians depends on who is in power in Israel, since Israel occupies land which they seek for a state of their own. Mr Netanyahu says he will never agree to a sovereign Palestinian state with powers like any other country (something which he says will be a serious threat to Israel). He has also pledged to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and a swathe of land known as the Jordan Valley(which comprises about 30% of the West Bank). Because they are built on occupied territory, the settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? The Palestinians, who want the settlements removed, say such a move would make a Palestinian state impossible and kill the peace process once and for all. Israel and the Palestinians: What are alternatives to a two-state solution? Who is Netanyahu's challenger? Netanyahu: Commando turned PM It is less clear where Benny Gantz stands on the issue. He has not said whether or not he accepts the idea of a Palestinian state, although, like Mr Netanyahu, he rejects withdrawing from all of the occupied West Bank and has also said he will not divide Jerusalem, whose eastern part Palestinians want to be the capital of a future state. While Mr Netanyahu is politically right wing and ideologically driven by Jewish claims to the land based on the Bible, Mr Gantz is considered more centrist and moderate. This may sound paradoxical but Israel's political system - a form of proportional representation - means it is as much about political bargaining after an election than it is to do with the poll itself. Israel has always been governed by coalitions of right-wing or left-wing blocs (or occasionally governments of national unity) - so the outcome of an election depends on what smaller parties demand from the winner (such as ministerial positions or budget pledges) in return for their support. Sometimes even a candidate whose party wins the most votes on the night does not become the prime minister if they cannot form a majority coalition comprising at least 61 seats in parliament. They have several weeks to try to do this after the election - and if they cannot manage it, the president can nominate another candidate for prime minister (in 2009, Mr Netanyahu's Likud party came second but he ended up re-appointed as PM). In April's election, Mr Netanyahu won the most votes but failed to form a coalition, which is he why he called a snap poll for 17 September. Polls show that the cost of living is more of a priority to Israelis than solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Security is also high on their agenda. Perhaps surprisingly to outsiders, corruption allegations against Prime Minister Netanyahu, who could be charged in the near future, are not particularly bothering voters, especially anyone right of centre. However, the fear (notably among left-wing voters) that Israeli democracy is under threat has grown amid concerns over expectations that Mr Netanyahu will seek coalition agreement about legislation providing immunity from prosecution while he is in office and planned reforms that would allow governments to overrule Supreme Court rulings (seen by critics as another way to keep Mr Netanyahu safe). One major issue which cuts across right-left political boundaries is that of conscripting more ultra-Orthodox Jews - who are currently exempted from the draft - into the military. Failure to agree on this was among factors that led to the collapse of Mr Netanyahu's coalition in December 2018, triggering April's election. The same issue also brought an end to the negotiations to form a new coalition, precipitating this poll. Aside from Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz, there are two other key figures who could make a big difference to what happens next. Avigdor Lieberman- An ally-turned-rival of the prime minister, Mr Lieberman leads the right-wing secular Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) party. His withdrawal from Mr Netanyahu's coalition in November 2018 (he considered the PM too weak in dealing with militants in Gaza) left the prime minister with a majority of one. The following month, the coalition collapsed. If his party performs as well as polls predict, Mr Lieberman could hold the balance of power. However, he has said the only way he will help return Mr Netanyahu to office is if he agrees to a government of national unity and shares power with Benny Gantz's Blue and White party - something the prime minister has ruled out. Ayelet Shaked- Mr Netanyahu's former justice minister is the leader of the religious nationalist Yamina (Rightwards) alliance. The grouping's performance will be crucial to Mr Netanyahu's ability to put together a governing coalition. Although Ms Shaked is also a rival of Mr Netanyahu, she has said she will support him in forming a right-wing government. Whether this will be sufficient to remove Yisrael Beiteinu's ability to make or break a Netanyahu-led coalition remains to be seen. Politically hard-right, Ayelet Shaked advocates annexing those parts of the occupied West Bank placed under interim Israeli control in past peace deals with the Palestinians, and says that if Mr Netanyahu forms the next ruling coalition, she will make sure he follows through on his pledge to do it.

National security fears threaten defence takeoverThe government is looking into Advent's Â£4bn takeover bid for British defence firm Cobham.Business,"The government is to intervene in a US private equity firm's takeover of UK defence and aerospace firm Cobham, citing national security concerns.

Harrow school to launch online sixth form,"The global wealthy will soon be able to send their children to a top English private school without having to leave home. Harrow is setting up a virtual sixth form which will teach A-levels online to pupils anywhere in the world. It will charge Â£15,000 per year and will initially focus on science and maths subjects, with education firm Pearson providing the technology. The new Harrow School Online will begin teaching from September 2020. Principal Heather Rhodes said the historic school was adapting to a ""rapidly changing world"". This is the latest attempt to use online technology to sell UK education overseas - with the school's brand being used to attract pupils who want to be taught through the internet. The online classes will only be available to pupils outside the UK - and so will not compete with its own bricks and mortar school in north-west London, where fees for boarders are almost Â£42,000 per year. The school is expected to appeal to affluent families in Russia, China, Nigeria, the Gulf and Hong Kong, who want A-levels from a prestigious private school teaching in English. Logging in to Harrow: The online version of the school will teach A-levels over the internet Ms Rhodes said it might also appeal to families working abroad who want more flexibility than a conventional international school. Harrow School Online will operate as a joint project with Pearson, which provides educational technology and also A-levels through its Edexcel exam board. Sharon Hague of Pearson said the online platform had already been tested, and was being used by more than 75,000 pupils learning online in the United States. Eton launches online lessons for China Oxford launches first online 'Mooc' course University science degree course online for Â£5,650 The A-level subjects - chemistry, physics, maths, further maths and economics - will be taught through video-conferencing, with classes of up to 15 pupils per teacher. The school expects to begin with a relatively small number of online pupils, but as the numbers grow, classes are likely to be scheduled around different time zones. There will also be one-to-one teaching and extra-curricular projects, said Ms Rhodes, creating a ""full-school experience"". Unlike the rest of Harrow, which only admits boys, the online school will teach both boys and girls - with entry depending on passing an admissions test. Founded in the 16th Century, Harrow has taught many famous pupils, including Sir Winston Churchill and actor Benedict Cumberbatch. The income will be shared between Pearson and Harrow, with the school saying money from online courses will be used to support bursaries for disadvantaged pupils.

Poor areas 'are losing cash machines fastest'Consumer group Which? urges the chancellor to act over the loss of free ATMs in poor communities.Business,"Millions of people who rely on cash will be left behind without urgent action from the government, Chancellor Sajid Javid has been warned.

Unpaid breaks rota change 'risks nurse goodwill',"The proposals for nurses in north Wales will be discussed at the assembly on Wednesday Proposed changes to nurses' rotas could result in a ""loss of goodwill"", an AM has warned. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board's plans to not pay staff for their 30-minute breaks would mean an extra unpaid shift each month, Plaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd has said. The proposals were discussed in the assembly on Wednesday, as the health board's consultation ends. The health board said it was to ensure staff could take their breaks. It added plans to standardise shift patterns, breaks and handover periods were designed to benefit staff. Home-visit nurses 'stressed and overworked' 'Huge talent pool' of male nurses missed Student nurses' idea adopted by hospitals Ysbyty Gwynedd is one of the hospitals run by the health board Mr Gruffydd, before the debate, warned the plan could backfire: ""The loss of goodwill among thousands of nurses who are already working under immense pressures will probably make matters worse. ""These proposals... will mean an extra half-hour unpaid per shift. ""That's unacceptable when nurses are already working long hours under pressure, not least because one in 10 nursing posts are vacant within the health board."" Comments on a petition launched by Plaid Cymru show some are unhappy with the plans. ""Staff on the ward regularly miss breaks due to staff shortage and acuity,"" one wrote. ""Myself and other members of staff regularly stay over our shift hours and never claim the time back. ""[I] think this will put the nail in the coffin for an already struggling health board."" The union Unite, which protested against the changes outside a health board meeting earlier this month, said it believed they would have a detrimental effect on the work-life balance of its members. Regional officer Jo Goodchild said: ""Nursing staff are working in this organisation because they care and always put patients first, often to the detriment of their own wellbeing."" Nurses always put patients first to the detriment of their own wellbeing, a union says Trevor Hubbard, the health board's executive director of nursing, said: ""Currently, there are too many instances where staff work through their breaks or are unable to take the protected time on a shift they are entitled to. ""Key to our proposal to standardise shift patterns is ensuring that staff receive adequate breaks, especially when they are working longer shift patterns."" ""The proposals also provide an opportunity for us to reduce the reliance upon agency staff in the process, which has a patient care and staff safety benefit as well as a financial benefit,"" he added. He said the plans would make the board compliant with theWorking Time Regulations and the Nurse Staffing Levels (Wales) Act,external. Health minister Vaughan Gething told AMs said staff rotas were an ""operational matter and the responsibility of individual organisations"". Health bodies should ""should ensure that all of their rotas take into consideration compliance with the Nurse Staffing Levels (Wales) Act 2016; are designed to meet the needs of staff for service delivery; and place patient need at the centre of the management of the workforce"", he said. ""I expect all NHS employers to work closely with trade unions on the staff side on proposed changes to consider and respond appropriately to all comments and concerns,"" Mr Gething added.

Diageo strikes called off after new offer made,"Strike action has been suspended at spirits giant Diageo's Scottish operations after management and unions struck a last-minute pay deal. Workers had been set to walk out at dozens of sites after unions rejected a ""final"" pay offer of 2.8% on Monday. But a deal was struck shortly before the first of a wave of strikes was due to start at 22:00 on Tuesday. The Unite and GMB unions said they would now consult their members on the new offer. The offer is understood to be a two-year deal with a 3% rise this year and an increase in pay next year, in line with the retail price index (RPI) rate as it stands in June 2020. A new collective agreement will also be negotiated by then. Diageo faces wave of strikes in Scotland over pay Scottish Diageo workers vote to go on strike Diageo workers reject 'insulting' pay offer In a joint statement, GMB Scotland organiser Keir Greenaway and Unite Scotland officer Stevie Deans said: ""We are pleased that on the brink of strike action, Diageo tabled an offer that we feel merits our members' consultation. ""The offer is a two-year commitment on pay and also sets out a timeframe for the negotiation of a new collective agreement. ""Our strike action is now suspended while a full consultative ballot of our members takes place on the offer."" A Diageo spokesman said: ""Following further negotiations today, our improved offer has been recommended for acceptance by both the GMB and Unite unions and strike action has been suspended. ""We are pleased to have reached agreement on a good, fair offer that ensures our employees can receive an increase on their pay while maintaining the competitiveness of our operations."" Unite and GMB Scotland members account for nearly half of Diageo's total workforce of 3,000 in Scotland. The ""rolling programme"" of 24-hour strikes had been due to run until 27 September. Unions had claimed the action would hit all of Diageo's bottling, maturation and distillery plants in Scotland, including well-known distilleries such as Talisker, on the Isle of Skye, Lagavullin on Islay and Knockando in Moray. The unions had disputed claims by Diageo that it could not afford to match last year's 3.2% pay award, arguing that the company had made pre-tax profits of Â£4.2bn in its last financial year. Diageo operates dozens of sites north of the border, including distilleries in Perthshire, Fife, Aberdeenshire, the Isle of Skye, the Black Isle and Argyll and Bute.

Lord of the Rings returns to NZ with Amazon showThe TV series produced by the US e-commerce giant has been tipped to be the most expensive ever made.Business,"Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood in a scene from the film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring New Zealand is poised for another Middle-earth-tied economic boost after Amazon Studios picked the country as the location for its much-anticipated Lord of the Rings television series.

"Saudi oil attack drones launched in Iran - US officialsDrones and missiles that targeted oil facilities were fired from southern Iran, US officials say.Middle East","This video can not be played Abqaiq has the world's largest oil processing plant The US has reportedly identified locations in Iran from which drones and cruise missiles were launched against major Saudi oil facilities on Saturday. Senior US officials told media outlets that the locations were in southern Iran, at the northern end of the Gulf. Saudi air defences did not stop the drones and missiles because they were pointed southwards, to prevent attacks from Yemen, they added. Iran denies involvement in the attacks, which disrupted global oil supplies. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels said they had launched the drones that struck the Abqaiq oil processing plant, the world's largest, and the Khurais oilfield. They have launched attacks into Saudi Arabia before, but US officials said on Sunday they believed the drones and missiles did not originate from the south or south-west, and instead were launched from the north or north-west. Who's using armed drones in the Middle East? Images show detail of attacks on Saudi oil sites Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called the attack a reciprocal act by the ""Yemeni people"". Oil prices soared 20% after the attacks, at one point reaching $71.95 (Â£57.53) a barrel. But they have since pared their gains as it appeared market disruption would not be as bad as feared. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said he expected production to be fully back online by the end of the month, adding that half the production at the damaged facilities had already been restored. Oil price falls as Saudi Arabia calms supply fears Brent crude - the international benchmark used by traders - was trading at about $64 (Â£51.20) after the announcement. A senior US official told CBS News that a US team had been on the ground at Abqaiq,externaland identified specific drones and missiles used in the attacks. This wreckage will be analysed and used to present ""a very compelling forensic case"" that Iran was responsible, the report says. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Tuesday the US was ""evaluating all the evidence"", and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was en route to Saudi Arabia ""to discuss our response"". He added: ""The United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it."" One of the US government's satellite images showing damage at the world's biggest oil-processing facility Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that ""Yemeni victims"" were responsible for the attacks,external, saying that blaming Iran would not change the situation and saying the US was ""in denial"". Ending the war was the ""only solution for all,"" he added. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region The huge US oil stash hidden in underground caves And in a televised address, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed talks ""at any level"" with the US, saying any dialogue could only happen if the US ""takes back its words and repents"" after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Earlier this year,President Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the landmark agreementthat had limited Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The president told reporters on Tuesday he was not ruling out meeting Mr Rouhani at UN, as has been previously suggested, but added that he would ""prefer not meeting him"". He also said he would be willing to use the US strategic oil reserves if need be. ""I don't believe I need to, but if we want to use strategic oil reserves, I would open them up,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson meanwhile has condemned the attacks and spoken of his support for Saudi Arabia, telling Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman there was a need to ""establish the facts of what happened"" and reiterating ""the importance of a collective response"", a spokeswoman said. This is the strongest claim yet from the Americans that the attacks against the Saudi oil facilities were launched from Iran itself. No corroborating evidence or intelligence has yet been provided. But if true, it takes the Gulf crisis to a more dangerous level and it demonstrates a new threshold of brinkmanship by the Iranian authorities. It also raises the question: what response, if any, is required? For past US presidents the security of oil supplies in the Gulf was an absolute priority. But for the ""locked and loaded"" Donald Trump, for all his bluster and apparent affinity with the Saudi royal family, this is not necessarily the case. There is no treaty relationship between Washington and Riyadh, and the Saudis are increasingly unpopular on Capitol Hill. The arguments for a response run both ways. If Iran's alleged escalation is not met by firm action, it might only embolden Tehran to go further. But the attacks have demonstrated Saudi Arabia's extraordinary vulnerability. In any protracted conflict it would be very much in the line of fire. For the White House this is a strategic dilemma with no easy answers. The attacks targeted Abqaiq - run by the Saudi state oil company, Aramco - and the Khurais oilfield. Khurais is the closest of the targets to the Yemen border, but is still a considerable 770km (480 miles) away. US officials said there were 19 points of impact on the targets, which could have come from a mix of drones and cruise missiles. The Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia, attacks which have left at least four civilians dead. The conflict in Yemen escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis took control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Soon after, Saudi Arabia and its allies launched an air campaign in a bid to restore Mr Hadi's government. The UN says at least 7,290 civilians have died and 80% of the population - 24 million people - need humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive.

'My derelict pub still got TripAdvisor reviews'TripAdvisor says it is winning the fight against fake reviews using fraud detection technology.Business,"In 2015, residential developer Charles Goodall bought a derelict pub called Bridge Inn in Middleton-in-Teesdale, a small market town in Durham, hoping to turn it into some houses. The pub hadn't been open for business since 2011, but on TripAdvisor, curiously people posted reviews for three years from 2014 to 2016, claiming to have had Sunday roasts and experienced poor service while doing so. ""We were looking for old photos of the pub on Google and the reviews came up. We found it quite funny,"" Mr Goodall, managing director of New Era Regeneration, told the BBC. ""I did contact TripAdvisor on their website and advised them that the reviews were impossible as the pub wasn't trading and they were slow to respond."" The reviews are still on the TripAdvisor website, but earlier this year the page was finally changed to show that the Bridge Inn is now closed. Mr Goodall added: ""I do use TripAdvisor myself and now I'm a bit sceptical about using the service because of this."" TripAdvisor has released its first ever Transparency Report, in which it reveals that in 2018, it prevented one million fake reviews from being displayed on its website. The derelict Bridge Inn in 2016, before it was converted into three houses The report is believed to be in response tocriticism of its reliabilityfrom a range of external parties, including aggrieved restaurateurs and hoteliers, as well as consumer watchdog Which?. TripAdvisor says 66 million reviews were submitted in 2018, and all of them were put through a moderation process that uses fraud detection technology, while 2.7 million reviews were further screened by a content moderation team. The reviews website says 79% of the reviews were assessed within six hours of being posted, and only 4.7% of reviews were rejected before or after the content had been posted. TripAdvisor defends itself in fake reviews row 'Why I write fake online reviews' ""These third parties do not have access to the key technical data necessary to determine whether or not a review is fraudulent. We do - and with this report, for the first time ever, we want to provide definitive insights into the details and data behind our extensive content moderation efforts,"" TripAdvisor's president and chief executive Stephen Kaufer wrote in the report. ""We do this in the spirit of transparency. We know we're not perfect. But we're constantly working to stay one step ahead of the people who try to abuse our platform - and we believe that no other review platform does more to protect the integrity of their content than TripAdvisor."" Restaurateur Robert Melman met with TripAdvisor in 2018 to express concerns about fake reviews Mr Goodall is not alone in being wary of TripAdvisor. Robert Melman, who founded the Fazenda chain of Brazilian restaurants, told the BBC that his restaurants have received one-star reviews he considers to be unfair. He alleged that some of the reviews came from people who have never dined at his restaurants, or from people who complain about the dress code or city rules preventing children from being in restaurants after a certain time of the day. Many of the negative reviews also come from accounts that post just once to review a Fazenda restaurant, and then never post again, he added. Mr Melman met TripAdvisor in 2018 to express his concerns, but he says nothing changed after that meeting. ""You try to deal with TripAdvisor, and they don't even reply, because they're so powerful and they don't care,"" he said. ""If one reviewer puts a review on my restaurant nine years ago and then never reviews again, then it means this person isn't interested in being a member of the TripAdvisor community and should have been taken off the site."" Reviewer Kurt Weideling has a different problem with TripAdvisor. He closed his account and stopped using the website in 2017, after two negative reviews he posted about hotels he stayed in were deleted by the website. Mr Weideling said that he had posted 10 reviews with his account and only two were negative: ""I basically said that the hotel was very poor value, having paid Â£200-plus for a room that was hot, noisy and with broken, unsafe furniture. The latter was a reference to the fact that the chairs in the room had pieces falling off them. When I sat on one, it nearly collapsed."" Former TripAdvisor reviewer Kurt Weideling stopped using the website after negative hotel reviews he posted were taken down He contacted TripAdvisor to ask why his reviews were deleted, and said he was given a generic response about how reviews could be taken down if they breached terms and conditions, or had been challenged by establishments and found to be biased or inaccurate. ""I didn't pursue the matter, and decided that if this was something TripAdvisor did regularly, then it called into question the legitimacy of their entire reviewing system. So I deleted my account and no longer use TripAdvisor for any purpose,"" he added. But many people do feel that TripAdvisor does offer them value and like using the website. ""TripAdvisor helped massively when I was travelling around Asia last year. I found some really good tips for excursions and came across some lovely restaurants,"" portfolio management analyst Holly Fennell told the BBC. Kathryn Benson, a property manager, agreed: ""I personally find TripAdvisor fantastic. I recently went to Krakow, Poland and booked Auschwitz, the salt mines and a bar crawl on there. Great reviews, great communication and I knew exactly what to expect."" Although some businesses are unhappy, many consumers say they find value in TripAdvisor reviews Several readers told the BBC that it was important to ""use common sense"" when looking at review websites, and to form their own opinions by comparing reviews on different websites and looking at actual photographs. The BBC contacted TripAdvisor for comment and the website said that it believes that both customers and business owners should have a voice. ""That is why we allow business owners the right to publicly respond to reviews, and their responses are published for all to see (subject to posting guidelines, just like reviews). So if an owner believes a review is unfair, they can highlight this in their response. Owner replies do make a difference,"" a TripAdvisor spokesman told the BBC. ""Research shows that customers do read what a business has to say in response to its reviews, and the tone of their replies can often have a bigger impact than the review itself. In other words, a business can often turn a negative review into a positive, just by the way it replies to that reviewer.""

Could court overrule government?,"Lady Hale, the brooch-wearing judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful, has retired from the UK Supreme Court. Who will follow her as its president and what does the Supreme Court do? Lady Hale was president of the Supreme Court from September 2017 to January 2020 and oversaw the decision on the suspension of Parliament. She is among the most well-known judges in the world. Before she became a judge, she was the architect of the UK's internationally-recognised laws on the rights of children. As the first female justice,she has been critical of the lack of female representationon the body in the past. She stood down in 2020 in line with retirement rules for judges. Lord Reed is thenew Supreme Court president,external. The senior Scottish judge also sat in the European Court of Human Rights. He led the importantSupreme Court ruling that overturned high employment tribunal feeswhich had led to claims that people were being denied access to justice. Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues. They are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution. Their job is no different to many comparable bodies in other countries. They rule on what a law means when there is a dispute. These are cases that raise what the court considers to be genuinely important points that affect the nation. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court Their judgements set out how a law should be interpreted and applied. Only a third of the cases that it is asked to rule on are heard by the Supreme Court. The court sits opposite the Houses of Parliament. Its location symbolises the relationship between the two. Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their ultimate interpretation and fair and just use. Over the course of its first 10 years of work, the court has delivered many judgements that have changed the nature of the UK. But its arguably most important case was 2019's decision to rule that Prime MinisterBoris Johnson had broken the law by proroguing (suspending) Parliament for five weeksas he faced division over the Brexit process. Lady Hale, wearing her spider brooch, reads out the Supreme Court's ruling on the suspension of Parliament The justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland. There is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices to decide on cases, so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a majority ruling one way or the other. Since October 2009 it has heard and decided on more than 835 cases. Here are some examples: Two 2018 judgements meant the police could be sued for compensation,after 76-year-old Elizabeth Robinson was knocked overand whendetectives botched a solvable investigation into the John Worboys serial rapist case In 2016, the justices said a law about gang murderhad been wrongly interpreted for 30 years Three years later,justices backed end-of-life decisions Only Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation - but the government is under no legal obligation to act on that. New justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years or a practising lawyer for 15. These are the other members of the Supreme Court. Lord Hodgeis the deputy president and the second Scottish judge on the panel of 12. He specialises in commercial law, in particular intellectual property and land valuation. Lord Kerrwas Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland before joining the Supreme Court at its 2009 opening. As the only Northern Irish justice, he argued forfree NHS abortions to be given to Northern Irish womenwhen they travel to England, but the Supreme Court rejected the case. Lord Wilsonis one of the UK's most experienced judges in family law, having spent 12 years ruling on those cases. Lord Carnwathis an expert in company and commercial law. He has a particular interest in environmental law. Lady Blackis another expert in family law who has taught students at university and, from 2010, also sat as a Court of Appeal judge. Lord Lloyd-Jonesis the Supreme Court's judge from Wales and a Welsh speaker. He specialises in international law He chaired the Law Commission - which advises the government on which laws need reforming - up until 2015. Lord Briggswas appointed to the Court of Appeal in 2013. Three years later he became deputy head of civil justice. Lady Ardenwas a Court of Appeal judge for 18 years and another former head of the Law Commission. Lord Kitchinis an expert in the complex branch of commercial cases that deals with intellectual property, such as patents that protect an invention from being copied by a rival. Lord Saleswas inthe original court which ruled the government must ask Parliamentbefore invoking Article 50, the part of EU law which gives any country the right to leave the EU. This led to the Daily Mail labelling him and the other two judges as ""enemies of the people."" Lord Justice Hamblenis the newest member. He's been a senior judge since 2008, specialising in commercial law. Two more new justices are in the wings waiting to be sworn in later in the year as others retire. Since Mr Johnson lost the prorogation case, there has been a drip feed of stories implying the court got the decision wrong and will face reform. Some Conservatives say judges snatched powers they never had. The Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto pledged a constitutional review which would include the courts. It did not explicitly single out the Supreme Court for reform - so what may happen is unclear. Any attempt to water down the court's powers is likely to face a rocky road. Many lawyers would see this as an act of political revenge. No. There are two unrelated European Courts. TheEuropean Court of Justice(ECJ) oversees EU laws on trade and so on that are passed by the member states. When the UK leaves the EU, it will not be part of that system, unless it were to choose to be, as part of a deal. The entirely differentEuropean Court of Human Rights(ECtHR) was set up (largely at the instigation of the UK) to protect the rights of ordinary people across the continent from undemocratic use of power. It hears very few cases against the UK government as most human rights cases are dealt with by British judges. The Supreme Court takes into account the views of the ECtHR but is entitled to reject its conclusions.

BBC launches 'digital wellbeing' app for children,"The app will offer advice alongside the text and messages children type The BBC has created a ""wellbeing"" smartphone app called Own It aimed at children. It monitors how young people interact with friends and family online and through messaging apps. It uses AI to evaluate a child's mood so it can offer advice or encourage them to talk to trusted adults. The app is designed to offer help and support especially if children are about to share sensitive data or send an upsetting message. ""The digital world is a fantastic place for people to learn and share, but we know many young people struggle to find a healthy online balance, especially when they get their first phones,"" said Alice Webb, director of BBC Children's, in a statement. Ms Webb said the app would act as a ""helping hand"" to guide children into developing good habits when using their first phone and avoid some of the potential pitfalls of digital life. Instagram now asks bullies 'Are you sure' - BBC News Social-media use 'disrupts teen sleep and exercise' Half of parents 'want mobiles banned in schools' The app is built around a special software keyboard that pops up when kids type messages and monitors the tone of the words being typed and language used. The Own It app also has its own content that aims to help children manage the amount of time they spend looking at their screen and passes on other advice about responsible online interaction. The BBC said the app would also regularly encourage children to talk to parents and guardians about good and bad online experiences and their phone use. The app has no reporting system that parents can consult to oversee phone use, said the BBC. The app would be ""warmly welcomed"" by some parents, said Prof Sonia Livingstone, a social psychologist from the London School of Economics who heads the EU Kids Online project which researches the digital diets of younger people. Instagram has also put in place tools to help combat bullying Prof Livingstone, who has seen demonstration versions of Own It, added: ""Based on my research on children's online risks and opportunities, I think it should be very helpful for children, especially younger ones, and ideally would also stimulate constructive conversations between children and parents."" She said one of the ""strengths"" of the app was the effort it took to protect a child's privacy. This stood in contrast to other apps that many parents use to monitor and control their children's online lives. However, said Prof Livingstone, there were likely to be limits on its usefulness for some young people. ""The challenge will be to get it to the children who are more at risk online,"" she said. The Own It app began development in 2018 and has drawn on input and support from many different child-focused charities and welfare groups. Partners include the Mental Health Foundation, the Anti-Bullying Alliance, the NSPCC, the Diana Award and Childnet. The app is being launched against a background of research which shows how concerned some parents are about phone use among their offspring. One study published in August suggestshalf of all UK parents want mobiles banned in schoolsto help regulate use. Separate studies suggestteenagers are not damaged by prolonged screen usebut official advice in the UK says parents should tell children to put down their devices in the hour before bed.
