Island fortress up for sale for ÃÂ£6m,"An historic island fortress has been put up for sale with a guide price of Â£6m. Drake's Island in Devon includes a 16th Century barracks, a pier and an underground network of tunnels. The six-acre site, which stands 600m off the coast at Plymouth, has planning permission for a luxury hotel and spa. Aidan McCauley, the son of the island's owner, Dan McCauley, said: ""My dad has long held a vision to see the island brought back into use. ""We are passionate about seeing his vision turned into a reality and are exploring all options to make this happen."" The island was named after Sir Francis Drake, who set sail from there in 1577 to circumnavigate the globe. Latest news and updates from Devon The fort played a crucial role in the defending the maritime city from French and Spanish invasions in the late 16th Century and has been used as a prison, a religious centre, a refuge and, most recently, an adventure training facility, which closed in 1989. The island has remained untouched since then. Drake's Island lies 600m off the mainland, in the heart of Plymouth Sound. Mr McCauley, a businessman and former chairman of Plymouth Argyle football club, purchased Drake's Island in the 1990s. In spring 2017, Plymouth City Council granted planning permission to create a luxury hotel complex including the conversion of the existing buildings.

'Credible' probe needed over missing Saudi,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death The UK, Germany and France have demanded a credible investigation into the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Their foreign ministers said that if anyone were found responsible they should be held accountable, and urged a detailed response from Riyadh. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that whatever happened now was ""absolutely up to Saudi Arabia"". The Saudis deny Mr Khashoggi was killed in their consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. A source quoted by Saudi state media says the country rejects political and economic threats and will meet any action taken against the kingdom with a bigger one in response. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, vanished on 2 October after visiting its consulate in Istanbul. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists The Turkish authorities in Istanbul believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate by Saudi agents - claims Riyadh has dismissed as ""lies"". A joint statement by the three foreign ministers called for a credible investigation to establish the truth about what happened and ensure those responsible for Mr Khashoggi's disappearance were held to account. ""We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi Government to provide a complete and detailed response,"" said Jeremy Hunt, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas. Later Mr Hunt said that whatever happened now was ""absolutely up to Saudi Arabia"". ""None of us know what happened, but we are all extremely concerned about the stories that have emerged, and the country that can help us get to the bottom of this is Saudi Arabia,"" he added. ""If, as they say, this terrible murder didn't happen, then where is Jamal Khashoggi? That's what the world wants to know."" The Europeans' statement comes after US President Donald Trump promised ""severe punishment"" for Saudi Arabia if it turned out Mr Khashoggi was killed in the consulate. Diplomatic sources say both US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox might not attend an upcoming investment conference in Riyadh, but White House aide Larry Kudlow said Mr Mnuchin had not yet pulled out. The event is being hosted by the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to promote his reform agenda. Several sponsors and media groups have decided to withdraw. The Saudis have reacted strongly, with a source quoted by Saudi state news agency SPA saying: ""The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats or attempts to undermine it whether through threats to impose economic sanctions or the use of political pressure. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi ""The kingdom also affirms that it will respond to any action with a bigger one. The Saudi economy has vital and influential roles for the global economy."" But on Sunday evening King Salman appeared more conciliatory, thanking Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for setting up a joint team to investigate the disappearance. No-one could undermine the strong relationship with Turkey, he said. On Sunday, stocks on the Tadawul All-Shares Index plummeted 7% in early trading, wiping out all the gains made this year. In two sessions it lost $50bn (Â£38bn) of its $450bn capitalisation, AFP news agency reported. Salah Shamma, of Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, told Reuters: ""The market is reacting negatively to sentiment around the Khashoggi case."" The index later recovered to close 3.5% down. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. A Turkish security source has told the BBC that officials had audio and video evidence proving Mr Khashoggi, who wrote for the Washington Post, was murdered inside the consulate. Reports suggest an assault and struggle took place in the consulate after Mr Khashoggi entered the building to get paperwork for a marriage. Turkish sources allege he was killed by a 15-strong team of Saudi agents. Saudi ties with West at risk Branson halts Saudi investment talks CCTV footage shows missing Saudi writer.

Is meat too hot for politicians?,"This video can not be played Five things we can do to help prevent global temperatures rising more than 1.5C Just a week after scientists said huge cuts in carbon emissions were needed to protect the climate, a UK minister has shown just how hard that will be. Scientists say we ought to eat much less meat because the meat industry causes so many carbon emissions. But the climate minister Claire Perry has told BBC News it is not the government's job to advise people on a climate-friendly diet. She would not even say whether she herself would eat less meat. Ms Perry has been accused by Friends of the Earth of a dereliction of duty. They say ministers must show leadership on this difficult issue. But the minister - who is personally convinced about the need to tackle climate change - is anxious to avoid accusations of finger-wagging. Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' 'Flexitarian' diets can limit future risks Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say She said: ""I like lots of local meat. I don't think we should be in the business of prescribing to people how they should run their diets."" When asked whether the Cabinet should set an example by eating less beef (which has most climate impact), she said: ""I think you're describing the worst sort of Nanny State ever. ""Who would I be to sit there advising people in the country coming home after a hard day of work to not have steak and chips?â¦ Pleaseâ¦"" Ms Perry refused even to say whether she agreed with scientists' conclusions that meat consumption needed to fall. Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth responded: ""The evidence is now very clear that eating less meat could be one of the quickest ways to reduce climate pollution. ""Reducing meat consumption will also be good for people's health and will free up agricultural land to make space for nature. ""It's a complete no-brainer, and it's a dereliction of duty for government to leave the job of persuading people to eat less meat to the green groups."" He said the government could launch information campaigns, change diets in schools and hospitals, or offer financial incentives. Ms Perry said: ""What I do think we need to do is look at the whole issue of agricultural emissions and do a lot more tree planting. ""But if you and I eat less meat, with all the flatulent sheep in Switzerland and flatulent cows in the Netherlands - that will just be wiped out in a moment. Let's work on the technology to solve these problems at scale."" She said instead of cutting down on meat, we could use (hugely expensive) equipment that sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere. Ms Perry said later that her own typical family meal is not steak and chips, but a stir-fry, which brings the taste and texture of meat into a dish dominated by vegetables. But she did not want to say this on camera. She agreed it was appropriate for the government to advise people on healthy diets because the obesity epidemic is costing taxpayers more in health bills, but implied that this principle did not apply when considering the health of the planet. Her fear of being condemned in the media as a bossy politician highlights the difficulty of the next phase of climate change reductions. Until now, 75% of CO2 reductions in the UK have come from cleaning up the electricity sector. Many people have barely noticed the change. Experts generally agree that for healthy lives and a healthy planet, the battle over climate change will have to get personal. That could mean people driving smaller cars, walking and cycling more, flying less, buying less fast fashion, wearing a sweater in winterâ¦ and eating less meat. People will still live good lives, they say, but they'll have to make a cultural shift. If governments do not feel able to back those messages, they say, the near impossible task of holding global temperature rise to 1.5C will become even more difficult. Ms Perry's comments came as she launched Green GB week, which aims to show how the UK can increase the economy while also cutting emissions. She will formally ask advisers how Britain can cut emissions to zero.

UK 'will see three years of low growth',"The UK can expect low economic growth for the next three years, while a no-deal Brexit could dent growth even further, says a forecasting body. The EY Item Club predicted GDP growth of 1.3% this year and 1.5% in 2019, down from 1.4% and 1.6% respectively in its previous outlook three months ago. The forecaster said these figures were based on the assumption that the UK and the EU would agree transition terms. If this did not happen, conditions could be ""significantly weaker"". If the forecaster's prediction turns out to be accurate, 2018 would be the worst year of growth for the UK economy since the financial crisis. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""Heightened uncertainties in the run-up to and the aftermath of the UK's exit could fuel business and consumer caution. ""This is a significant factor leading us to trim our GDP forecasts for 2018 and 2019."" UK economy is 'stuck in a rut' Brexit will be 'worse for UK than EU' Earlier this year, the EY Item Club predicted that the UK would seetwo interest rate rises this yearand two more in 2019. However, followingthe Bank of England's decision in August to raise ratesfrom 0.5% to 0.75%, the forecaster said it did not now expect another increase until August next year, with two more rate rises likely in 2020. ""The EY Item Club suspects that the Bank of England will want to see sustained evidence that the UK economy is holding up relatively well after Brexit occurs in late March, before hiking interest rates,"" it added. EY chief economist Mark Gregory said: ""The UK economy is going to experience a period of low economic growth for at least the next three years, and businesses need to recognise this and adjust accordingly. ""They should also consider a sharp downside to the economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit and make preparations for such a scenario."" Mr Gregory said a ""prudent approach"" would be for firms to test the robustness of their businesses, especially cash flow, against a short period of severe disruption, followed by a downturn for three or four quarters. ""Even if the Brexit process goes smoothly, the cyclical risks to the UK economy mean this would still be a worthwhile exercise. Now is the time to start to think about the future shape of any UK business after 2020,"" he added.

Police probe inheritance firm collapse,"Universal Wealth Management is now closed and 100 staff have lost their jobs The collapse of an inheritance planning firm that has left dozens of clients fearing for their life savings is being investigated by police. Universal Wealth Management ran seminars called Keep It In The Family, in which they promised to protect people's assets from inheritance tax. The Ipswich-based firm also promised to help people avoid care home fees. Two people connected to the firm have been arrested and released as inquiries continue. After attending a seminar, people typically put their home into a trust run by the company, which meant they no longer officially owned it. The idea was that local authorities would then disregard the property in the event someone needed long-term care. The company was based in Ipswich The BBC has learned the company first hit trouble in late 2017, when it laid off dozens of staff. Earlier this year, some clients started to complain but their emails and calls were going unanswered. In April, two people connected with the firm were arrested on suspicion of fraud. They have since been released but remain under active police investigation. A Suffolk police spokeswoman said: ""Two people who were arrested on suspicion of fraud as part of a large-scale financial investigation have had their police bail cancelled. ""Both have now been released under investigation whilst inquiries are continuing."" The national body that deals with fraud on behalf of victims, Action Fraud, said at least 140 clients of Universal Wealth had contacted it about missing money. The BBC has spoken to a number of people who appear to have lost significant amounts of cash. Nigel Watson fears his parents have lost their Â£250,000 life savings Nigel Watson, from Sabden, near Burnley in Lancashire, attended a Universal Wealth seminar with his parents in 2014. Both signed their houses over to a Universal Wealth Preservation trust, while Mr Watson's parents handed over Â£250,000 - their entire life savings. Mr Watson found out about the collapse of Universal Wealth when he got a letter from a former employee, offering to change the trustees for a fee. ""They were totally in the dark about it,"" he said. ""And I had this bombshell piece of news, which I had to decide whether I told them about or not."" ""It was terrible. Awful. To tell them their whole life savings had disappeared was terrible. I can't describe it."" The company has yet to comment. Its offices in White House Road, Ipswich, are empty and 100 staff have lost their jobs. The investigation will be broadcast on BBC Inside Out East on BBC One on Monday at 19:30 BST.

Royal Mail staff lose out in share saleStaff see the value of their shares shrink by thousands of pounds just before planning to sell them.Business,"Hundreds of Royal Mail staff have complained that they have been short-changed as a result of a dramatic fall in the company's share price. They claim the privatised company deliberately issued a profit warning weeks before many were planning to sell their shares. Since the announcement on 1 October the shares have fallen by 28%. However Royal Mail said it had no choice but to tell the City as soon as it realised profits would be lower. Some 145,000 postal staff have waited five years to sell the free shares they were given at the time of privatisation. Royal Mail shares plunge on profit warning Monday is the first day they can sell their holdings without having to pay tax or National Insurance. The shares have fallen by 45% since they peaked at 632p in May this year, with some staff seeing the value of their holdings slipping by more than Â£2,500. The shares are now just 13p above the original flotation price of 330p. Des Arthur, a postman from Coventry, was one of those who complained about the company's announcement to the City. ""The timing of it could be viewed as extremely cynical,"" he told the BBC. ""It's going to look like it's not right."" The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said hundreds more staff had expressed their anger. ""Our members certainly believe it's just been done to deflate what they would get if they sold their shares,"" said Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the CWU. ""You know what people are like; people in some ways have already spent that money in anticipation."" Royal Mail said it understood the disappointment felt by its staff, but said it had no choice over when to release the profit warning. ""We had an obligation to tell the market, and that's what we did,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""There's no link between that and the free shares."" However the company said anyone who pre-elected to sell their shares before 1 October would be able to cancel their transactions. Other employees said they were happy just to have been given free shares in the first place. ""I'm not annoyed,"" said Adam Alarakhia, a postman from Leicester, whose holding is now worth around Â£2,700. ""The price will shoot up again in our busy period."" Most brokers have Royal Mail shares down as a ""sell"" - in other words they expect the shares to fall further. Berenberg has a target price of Â£3. But the further they fall, the higher the percentage yield. At the moment the annual dividend is a healthy 7%. Indeed so far employees who took their full allocation will have earned Â£850, Royal Mail said, making up for some of their theoretical (on-paper) losses. ""Management have recently reconfirmed their commitment to growing the dividend over time, but with investment demands likely to rise, we find it difficult to see how far that can go,"" said Nicholas Hyett of Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Nonetheless, for income seeking investors Royal Mail could well be attractive."" The original privatisation of Royal Mail was criticised by theNational Audit Office,external, which said that taxpayers had lost Â£1bn, because the flotation price was set too low.

B&M fire crews denied free drinks at McDonald'sThe fast food giant says firefighters tackling a blaze at a B&M store should have got free refreshments.York & North Yorkshire,"Shoppers fled the blaze at a retail park in York McDonald's has apologised after firefighters tackling a blaze at a branch of discount retailer B&M were denied free refreshments. Crews spent Saturday night bringing a huge fire, whichleft the building at York's Clifton Moor retail park ""a burnt-out shell"", under control. It later emerged two members of the public had paid for drinks out of their own pockets when none were provided. McDonald's has said free drinks ""should have been provided on the night"". A number of firefighters reportedly approached the branch, close to the B&M store, while taking a break from combating the blaze. They are said to have asked if the restaurant could provide free drinks, on account of crews not carrying cash while attending a call-out, but were refused. Several firefighters used Facebook to thank ""a lady and a young man"" who bought them refreshments. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire Steve Brown, a crew manager at North Yorkshire Fire Service,wrote,external: ""I was one of the firefighters there last night, thank you to the lady and young man who brought us the teas and coffees, really appreciated."" Phil Leealso expressed thanks, writing,externalthat the teas and coffees ""couldn't have come at a better time. Many thanks from all the lads"". A McDonald's spokesperson said: ""On this occasion, we would like to apologise to the firefighters who bravely tackled last night's fire. ""They should have been provided with free refreshments on the night as a small recognition for their efforts. ""McDonald's will of course be happy to reimburse the member of public involved."" The company would be in touch with the local fire and rescue service, it added. North Yorkshire Fire Service has been contacted for a comment. Plumes of smoke could be seen ""for miles"", said BBC reporter Phil Bodmer Crews remain at the scene of Saturday's blaze, and an investigation into its cause is due to begin, said North Yorkshire Fire Service. A spokesman said the flames had been brought under control but firefighters continued damping down the remnants. He confirmed the fire had been contained within the store and there had been ""no immediate concern for adjacent buildings"". At the height of the blaze, which broke out just before 16:30 BST when the store was still open, local residents were advised to stay indoors and close their windows. Allow Twitter content?

Scotland's Brexit Minister Mike Russell said it was ""an astonishing development"". Sources have told the BBC Ms Davidson and Mr Mundell have made it clear they would resign if Northern Ireland faces new controls that separate it from the rest of the UK - because that could fuel the case for Scottish independence.

The Scottish government's Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme: ""This is an astonishing development, not that Ruth Davidson holds any position in the UK government, but to say that you'll resign if Scotland is not treated as badly as everywhere else strikes me as a complete dereliction of duty. ""They're elected by people in Scotland and here they want Scotland to suffer the hardest of Brexits. That strikes me as a ludicrous position and one in which we should be saying, have they really come to this?"" At the beginning of the summer the government's senior ministers held a day-long meeting about Brexit at Chequers, the prime minister's official country home in Buckinghamshire. The aim was to agree what the government wanted from negotiations with the EU about the future relationship between the UK and the EU over Brexit. The plan that emerged from the meeting has become known as the Chequers plan, or sometimes simply Chequers. The key aim of the plan is to create a free-trade area for goods moving between the EU and the UK while stopping freedom of movement for people between them. To do this, the UK would commit to collecting import taxes, known as tariffs, on behalf of the EU for goods that arrive in the UK on their way to the EU. Meanwhile, goods that were staying in the UK could be charged at a different rate, depending on any future trade deals the UK agrees with other countries. The UK would also agree to a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for manufactured goods and food, which would mean following EU rules and standards. In the future, if the EU changed any of its standards, the UK could decide not to follow those changes but at the risk of losing the free trade agreement for those goods. The government believes the combination of the common rulebook and collecting tariffs for the EU would avoid the need for checks on goods passing between the UK and the EU, including over the Â Irish border. However, the EU doesn't accept all proposals in the Chequers plan. It thinks the proposals amount to ""cherry-picking"" parts of EU membership - in other words, keeping the bits the UK wants to stay attached to, while rejecting other rules. The EU is also unconvinced the UK would be able to accurately track all the goods moving through it. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""We'll resign if you do anything that makes Scotland think there's a better alternative to a hard Tory Brexit' say Mundell and Davidson! ""First, what a bizarre position - isn't it their job to stand up for Scotland? And, second, have they the gumption to resign? I bet they don't!"" Labour MP Ian Murray tweeted: ""But they also don't want to continue to participate in the customs union and single market so how do they suggest resolving it? Utterly contemptible. ""They can't achieve a no hard border in Ireland without participation in the same trading arrangements as the EU.""

Is the PM out of Brexit moves?,"Dominic Raab didn't go to Brussels on Sunday sure of wrapping up every loose end of the Brexit process, tying a ribbon on it and carrying it home to give Theresa May the best ever present at work first thing Monday morning. But officials who have been working away in Brussels all week, including until late on Saturday night, did feel the talks would benefit from a bit of political shoulder to shove them forward, and that decisive progress could have been possible. All week, they have been grappling with one central issue - although there are others unresolved alongside, you guessed it, what to do about the Irish border. The negotiators had made some steps forward, buton Sunday the required political progress didn't come. The talks between the two men were not acrimonious, I'm told, but they got stuck - gummed up in thedetails of the backstop we discuss so often here. The two sides can't agree over how, what is essentially an insurance policy, would apply to the whole of the UK, and its temporary nature. And while there may have been a sense in Brussels that Mrs May was moving towards them, after she talked of doing a deal in the ""national interest"" during last week, if anything the politics at home have got more fraught. Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Thursday's cabinet meeting ramped up concerns and gave Brexiteers another excuse to rattle their sabres. The DUP continues its warnings that it'd sink the administration rather than see the deal it fears done. Several cabinet ministers are thinking about whether they can go on. And, more to the point, different groups of Tory MPs with gripes about other policies are scenting opportunity as the government is so vulnerable. Michel Barnier and Dominic Raab met for brief talks on Sunday Any move for the PM has become both harder, and more urgent. Her party won't accept a proposal to keep the UK essentially in the customs union. Parliament is likely to block no deal. The EU won't accept her Chequers plan. Even loyal ministers are deeply worried - ""She is like a chess player who only has the king left - all she can do is move one square at a time until she is check-mated."" Talks among key officials in Brussels on Monday are cancelled for now. There are no plans at the moment for the Brexit secretary to go back. There are only three days until the EU leaders' meeting where Mrs May has the chance to rescue herself and the talks too. If, of course, the deal is done at the last minute, perhaps this will all be seen as the necessary theatrics. With hindsight, Sunday's comings and goings might just become part of Brexit's messy history - but there is principle at stake here, as well as the practical challenge of getting an accord. If no one's even talking, how can they expect to agree? 'Key issues remain' after Brexit talks What are the Brexit backstop options? What happens now that a deal's been done?

Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop,"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

Saudis defy 'threats' over missing writer,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Saudi Arabia rejects political and economic ""threats"" over missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a source quoted by state news agency SPA says. The country would respond to any punitive action ""with a bigger one"", the unnamed senior source said. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, vanished on 2 October after visiting its consulate in Istanbul. US President Donald Trump said he would ""punish"" Saudi Arabia if it were found responsible for killing him. On Sunday a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany called for a credible investigation to ensure those responsible for Mr Khashoggi's disappearance were held to account. ""We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi Government to provide a complete and detailed response,"" said Jeremy Hunt, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas. Later Mr Hunt said that whatever happened now was ""absolutely up to Saudi Arabia"". ""If, as they say, this terrible murder didn't happen, then where is Jamal Khashoggi? That's what the world wants to know."" Britain and the US are considering boycotting a major international conference in Saudi Arabia this month. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists The authorities in Istanbul believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate by Saudi agents - claims Riyadh has dismissed as ""lies"". The source quoted by SPA said: ""The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats or attempts to undermine it whether through threats to impose economic sanctions or the use of political pressure. ""The kingdom also affirms that it will respond to any action with a bigger one. The Saudi economy has vital and influential roles for the global economy."" But on Sunday evening King Salman appeared more conciliatory, thanking Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for setting up a joint team to investigate the disappearance. No-one could undermine the strong relationship Saudi Arabia had with Turkey, he said. The Saudis have come under considerable international pressure over the disappearance. Diplomatic sources told the BBC's James Landale that both US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox might not attend next month's investment conference in Riyadh, which has been dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"". However, later White House aide Larry Kudlow told ABC News that as things stood Mr Mnuchin was intending to go to Riyadh and would take a final decision ""as new information surfaces"". The event is being hosted by the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to promote his reform agenda. Several sponsors and media groups have decided to pull out. A joint statement of condemnation, if it is confirmed that Mr Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents, is also being discussed by US and European diplomats. The president has said the US will inflict ""severe punishment"" if Saudi Arabia is found to be responsible for the death of Mr Khashoggi. This video can not be played This video has been removed for right reasons He said he would be ""very upset and angry if that were the case"", but ruled out halting big military contracts. ""I think we'd be punishing ourselves if we did that,"" he said. ""If they don't buy it from us, they're going to buy it from Russia or... China."" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia had not so far co-operated with the investigation - despite a statement from Saudi Interior Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz saying his nation wanted to uncover ""the whole truth"". Mr Cavusoglu has urged the kingdom to allow Turkish officials to enter the consulate. On Sunday, stocks on the Tadawul All-Shares Index plummeted 7% in early trading, wiping out all the gains made this year, before recovering slightly around noon.

B&M fire crews denied free drinks at McDonald's,"Shoppers fled the blaze at a retail park in York McDonald's has apologised after firefighters tackling a blaze at a branch of discount retailer B&M were denied free refreshments. Crews spent Saturday night bringing a huge fire, whichleft the building at York's Clifton Moor retail park ""a burnt-out shell"", under control. It later emerged two members of the public had paid for drinks out of their own pockets when none were provided. McDonald's has said free drinks ""should have been provided on the night"". A number of firefighters reportedly approached the branch, close to the B&M store, while taking a break from combating the blaze. They are said to have asked if the restaurant could provide free drinks, on account of crews not carrying cash while attending a call-out, but were refused. Several firefighters used Facebook to thank ""a lady and a young man"" who bought them refreshments. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire Steve Brown, a crew manager at North Yorkshire Fire Service,wrote,external: ""I was one of the firefighters there last night, thank you to the lady and young man who brought us the teas and coffees, really appreciated.""

A McDonald's spokesperson said: ""On this occasion, we would like to apologise to the firefighters who bravely tackled last night's fire. ""They should have been provided with free refreshments on the night as a small recognition for their efforts. ""McDonald's will of course be happy to reimburse the member of public involved."" The company would be in touch with the local fire and rescue service, it added. North Yorkshire Fire Service has been contacted for a comment. Plumes of smoke could be seen ""for miles"", said BBC reporter Phil Bodmer Crews remain at the scene of Saturday's blaze, and an investigation into its cause is due to begin, said North Yorkshire Fire Service. A spokesman said the flames had been brought under control but firefighters continued damping down the remnants. He confirmed the fire had been contained within the store and there had been ""no immediate concern for adjacent buildings"". At the height of the blaze, which broke out just before 16:30 BST when the store was still open, local residents were advised to stay indoors and close their windows. Allow Twitter content?

Seann and Katya Strictly in the clear,"Katya Jones and Seann Walsh danced the Charleston Seann Walsh and Katya Jones are through to the next round of Strictly Come Dancing after a week of controversy. They have faced calls to leave the show after being photographed kissing on the birthday of Walsh's now ex-girlfriend. However, their Charleston received a warm reaction from the crowd who cheered as the pair took on a number of tricky lifts on Saturday night. Katie Piper became the third celebrity to leave the show after losing out to Charles Venn in the dance-off. The TV presenter and her partner Gorka Marquez danced their jive again in the dance-off but the judges chose to save Venn and his partner Karen Clifton after they repeated their salsa. Piper said she felt ""thrilled"" and ""privileged"" to have made it to week four, adding: ""I have taken a lot from this experience and it has all been really positive, and I'll never forget this journey."" Katie Piper's jive with Gorka Marquez saw her in the dance off After the latest elimination, fans were left divided in their reaction on social media, with many saying Walsh deserved to go. One outraged viewer tweeted: ""Cannot believe seann and katya got through, what a great advertisement for cheating!?!"" Another wrote: Allow Twitter content?

Others said it was the right decision, with one tweeting: """"Yyyaaaayyy glad to see Seann and Katya made it through,"" adding it ""is no one else's business"" and not for ""Twitter to play judge and executioner!!"". Comedian Walsh and professional dancer Jones, who is married, both apologised after the images of them kissing emerged. Walsh, 32, tweeted: ""This is no excuse but it was a one-off drunken mistake which I am truly sorry for."" Venn and Clifton survived the dance-off Jones, 29, said the kiss was a ""one-off mistake after some drinks"". ""I'm so sorry about any offence or hurt I may have caused with my actions,"" the dancer tweeted. ""I love my husband and we are very happy together, this is not a reflection on our relationship."" The publication of the photos in a Sunday newspaper of the pair kissing led Walsh's girlfriend to end their relationship. Actress Rebecca Humphries broke her silence soon after, claiming in an open letter that Walsh had called her ""psycho/nuts/mental"" when she suspected something was going on between him and Jones, who is married to Strictly dancer Neil Jones. Performing on Saturday night for the first time since the photographs emerged, Walsh and Jones were scored 28 by the judges. Seann Walsh with Rebecca Humphries Former Strictly professional James Jordan tweeted that he thought the pair had been ""overmarked"" to protect them from elimination. One viewer suggested the show had failed to address the elephant in the room by not referring to the kiss. Strictly kiss: Katya was 'in the wrong' 'I'm no victim' - Strictly star's girlfriend There has been no direct reference on the show to the furore around Walsh and Jones - apart from an indirect joke from Claudia Winkleman on Saturday night. But judge Craig Revel Horwood told The Jonathan Ross Show: ""My take was keep them in the show, make them do the dance of shame, if you like."" More than 10 million viewers tuned in to watch Strictly on Saturday. Peaking at 11.9 million viewers, it had an audience share of 51.2% and was the most-watched show across all channels on Saturday, according to overnight ratings. 14 things we learned from Strictly's stars 'All about the dancing' for Strictly kiss duo Strictly kiss: Katya was 'in the wrong' Seann and Katya 'must do dance of shame' Strictly's Seann speaks out over kiss 'I'm no victim' - Strictly star's girlfriend Has the Strictly curse struck again?

'Massive losses' for Merkel Bavaria ally,"The CSU appears to have lost support to both right and left Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative sister party has suffered huge losses in Bavaria's state election, raising new doubts about her ruling coalition. The centre-right Christian Social Union (CSU) is set to lose its absolute majority in the state parliament, which it has dominated since 1957. The Greens surged into second place, with nearly 17.5%. The anti-immigration AfD is set to enter Bavaria's parliament for the first time, with most votes counted. The CSU got just over 37% - that is, more than 10% down on its 2013 result. It was also a bitter night for Germany's decades-old centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who slumped to just 9.7%. They and the CSU are in a fragile coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU). Bavaria result: Merkel's three challenges The CSU appears to have suffered from the row over immigration policy earlier this year between Mrs Merkel and Horst Seehofer, the CSU leader and German interior minister. He said it was ""not a nice day"" but added it was only ""one side of the coin"" as the vote gives ""a clear mandate"" allowing the CSU to form a new government. Many voters who disliked the tone of the migration debate may have turned to the Greens There are signs that the CSU is leaning towards forming a Bavarian coalition with the right-leaning Free Voters (FW), a new independent party that won 11.6%. That would be a closer alignment than governing with the Greens. Bavaria orders crosses in state buildings Germany's far right march en masse Alternative for Germany (AfD) came fourth with about 10%. It means AfD will have seats in 15 of Germany's 16 state parliaments. German commentators say the parties in Mrs Merkel's coalition will strive to avoid any further splits ahead of another big state election - in Hesse on 28 October, currently run by the CDU. SPD leader Andrea Nahles blamed her party's poor performance in Bavaria on squabbling within the coalition. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Bavaria It was a terrible night for Angela Merkel's Bavarian sister party. The CSU has reigned supreme for decades in what is conservative country. But recent attempts to harden its tone and policies on migration, which included picking high-profile fights with Mrs Merkel, appear to have backfired. It's bad news for Mrs Merkel too. Bavaria reflects what's happening at national level, the dwindling popularity of the traditional centre-right and centre-left parties. Much may now depend on the results in Hesse in a fortnight. The CDU is also losing support. Its general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said that what had happened in Bavaria was a warning. Nearly 13 million residents and the biggest by area of Germany's 16 federal states Its capital Munich is Germany's third-largest city, after Berlin and Hamburg Second-highest GDP out of 16 German states Historically conservative region, with strong Catholic and local traditions Industrial powerhouse: car and IT sectors especially strong, rich in family-run firms AfD's success in Bavaria has not been as great as in eastern Germany but it appears to have taken large numbers of votes from the CSU. But by echoing some of the AfD's hardline policies such as on migration, the CSU also seems to have lost the support of more moderate voters. The CSU's Markus SÃ¶der, current Bavarian prime minister, said the projected result was painful but the party should learn from it. ""We have to analyse the changes taking place both in Bavaria and in society,"" he said. ""One of the most important jobs we now have is to ensure that this state is stable, governable, and remains as strong as it is now."" Some German commentators say the CSU now has an old-fashioned image for many voters. The BBC's Jenny Hill in Bavaria says the election illustrates the complexity of the challenge faced by so many of Europe's large established parties. It's not simply the rise of the far right, she says, but that voters are walking away in favour of smaller, newer movements.

Kangaroo in savage attack on family,"Linda Smith has been caring for animals for 15 years An Australian wildlife carer has suffered a punctured lung as she and her family fought off a savage attack by a kangaroo at their property. Linda Smith, 64, and her husband Jim were feeding kangaroos hit by drought conditions in Queensland when the 6ft (1.82m) grey turned on Jim. The couple and their son fought off the attack, said by wildlife officials to be rare, with a broom and a shovel. The animal hopped off into the bush before emergency services arrived. The incident occurred in Millmerran, about 80km (50 miles) south-west of Toowoomba in Queensland. Speaking from hospital, where the couple are both being treated,Mrs Smith told the Brisbane Times,externalthat some 30 kangaroos and wallabies usually arrive each night to be fed because of the drought, and are given grain and chaff. 'Panicked' kangaroo smashes way into Australian home Kangaroos attacking carrot-bearing tourists spark warnings Police investigate 'sickening' kangaroo killings She said: ""This one kangaroo came in and I thought it was Golly Gosh, one of the kangaroos we have raised. He was a huge grey, would have been at least 6ft."" As her husband, also in his 60s, fed the kangaroo it turned on him. ""Jim was on the ground and the kangaroo just kept at him,"" Mrs Smith said. She fetched a broom but the kangaroo knocked it out of her hand and attacked her too. ""Then my son came out to try and help me and hit him over the head with a shovel,"" Mrs Smith said. She suffered a collapsed lung, broken ribs, abrasions to her arms and legs and other internal injuries and underwent surgery on Sunday. Her husband suffered multiple lacerations while her son, 40, had minor injuries. Queensland Ambulance Service senior operations supervisor Stephen Jones told Agence France-Presse such a vicious attack was ""something that I haven't come across in my 30-odd years in the service"". He said if Mrs Smith had not intervened to help her husband, ""the outcome may have even been death"". Mrs Smith, who has been caring for animals for 15 years since finding an orphaned joey, said: ""I don't want this kangaroo to be hunted down and killed, I love animals.""

"Island fortress up for sale for ÃÂ£6mDrake's Island includes a 16th century barracks, a pier and an underground network of tunnels.Devon","An historic island fortress has been put up for sale with a guide price of Â£6m. Drake's Island in Devon includes a 16th Century barracks, a pier and an underground network of tunnels. The six-acre site, which stands 600m off the coast at Plymouth, has planning permission for a luxury hotel and spa. Aidan McCauley, the son of the island's owner, Dan McCauley, said: ""My dad has long held a vision to see the island brought back into use. ""We are passionate about seeing his vision turned into a reality and are exploring all options to make this happen."" The island was named after Sir Francis Drake, who set sail from there in 1577 to circumnavigate the globe. Latest news and updates from Devon The fort played a crucial role in the defending the maritime city from French and Spanish invasions in the late 16th Century and has been used as a prison, a religious centre, a refuge and, most recently, an adventure training facility, which closed in 1989. The island has remained untouched since then. Drake's Island lies 600m off the mainland, in the heart of Plymouth Sound. Mr McCauley, a businessman and former chairman of Plymouth Argyle football club, purchased Drake's Island in the 1990s. In spring 2017, Plymouth City Council granted planning permission to create a luxury hotel complex including the conversion of the existing buildings.

Another inmate dies at 'dangerous' prison,"Nottingham Prison is just north of the city centre and holds about 1,060 inmates Another inmate has died at a prison criticised for its ""tragic and appalling"" death rate. Robert Frejus, 29, died on Tuesday at HMP Nottingham, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed. A cause of death has not been revealed, but a spokesman said the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman would investigate. In July, inmateFerencz-Rudolf Pusok, 28, was charged with murderfollowing the death of a fellow prisoner 43-year-old Brett Lowe. A statement from the ministry on Mr Frejus' death said its thoughts were with his family and friends. In May, the chief inspector of prisons reported a""dangerous"" and ""disrespectful"" environmentat the Category B jail. Nottingham Prison is just north of the city centre and holds about 1,060 inmates There have been eight self-inflicted deaths at the facility since 2016, including four in the space of as many weeks last year. Chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said inmates might have taken their own lives because they could no longer face life at the ""drug-ridden jail"". In January, Mr Clarkeissued the MoJ with an urgent notification letter, demanding action within 28 days. The move led to Justice Secretary David Gauke publishing an action plan. The MoJ said it had made improvements to the prison, including recruiting more prison officers to improve safety and tackle drugs. The Prison Officers' Association said the prison appeared to be ""struggling to maintain law and order"". Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

B&M fire crews denied free drinks at Mcdonald's,"Shoppers fled the blaze at a retail park in York McDonald's has apologised after firefighters tackling a blaze at a branch of discount retailer B&M were denied free refreshments. Crews spent Saturday night bringing a huge fire, whichleft the building at York's Clifton Moor retail park ""a burnt-out shell"", under control. It later emerged two members of the public had paid for drinks out of their own pockets when none were provided. McDonald's has said free drinks ""should have been provided on the night"". A number of firefighters reportedly approached the branch, close to the B&M store, while taking a break from combating the blaze. They are said to have asked if the restaurant could provide free drinks, on account of crews not carrying cash while attending a call-out, but were refused. Several firefighters used Facebook to thank ""a lady and a young man"" who bought them refreshments. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire Steve Brown, a crew manager at North Yorkshire Fire Service,wrote,external: ""I was one of the firefighters there last night, thank you to the lady and young man who brought us the teas and coffees, really appreciated."" Phil Leealso expressed thanks, writing,externalthat the teas and coffees ""couldn't have come at a better time. Many thanks from all the lads"". A McDonald's spokesperson said: ""On this occasion, we would like to apologise to the firefighters who bravely tackled last night's fire. ""They should have been provided with free refreshments on the night as a small recognition for their efforts. ""McDonald's will of course be happy to reimburse the member of public involved."" The company would be in touch with the local fire and rescue service, it added. North Yorkshire Fire Service has been contacted for a comment. Plumes of smoke could be seen ""for miles"", said BBC reporter Phil Bodmer Crews remain at the scene of Saturday's blaze, and an investigation into its cause is due to begin, said North Yorkshire Fire Service. A spokesman said the flames had been brought under control but firefighters continued damping down the remnants. He confirmed the fire had been contained within the store and there had been ""no immediate concern for adjacent buildings"". At the height of the blaze, which broke out just before 16:30 BST when the store was still open, local residents were advised to stay indoors and close their windows. Allow Twitter content?

What no-deal Brexit could mean,"Another slew of technical notices aimed at providing guidance to the public and businesses on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit were released by the government on Thursday. Ministers say it is an ""unlikely"" scenario and the UK and EU are working on getting an agreement finalised. But what detail has come out ofthe 28 papers,external? Here is a summary: Driving If you have a UK driving licence, you have been able to use it to drive anywhere in the EU, for work or pleasure, as it is valid in all 28 countries. But this could change if there is a no-deal Brexit. The paper warns drivers that some EU states may require an international driving permit - which isn't free - to be legal on their roads, as well as their existing licence. And it could get even more difficult if you plan to permanently move to an EU country. Existing rules mean a UK license can be swapped for a local one. But a no-deal Brexit will mean this ends, and expats may need to take a driving test in their new country before getting behind the wheel. Mobiles Last year, travellers were delighted as Brussels quashed roaming charges for phones used inside the European Union. Rather than massive bills for calling back home or posting snaps on social networks, the mobile networks were forced to treat use in other EU countries the same as if the customer was at home. A no-deal Brexit means free roaming can no longer be guaranteed. The government has tried to put minds at rest, saying it will legislate to include a cap on data roaming charges. However, that is not quite the same as being able to use a UK phone in the EU with no additional costs. Irish citizens As the rules currently stand, UK citizens can cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic without any checks, and vice versa. That is because of the Common Travel Area (CTA) - which allows for passport-free travel between the UK, Irish Republic, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man. But what happens if there is a no-deal Brexit? The government has said there will be ""no practical changes"" to their approach and ""no routine immigration controls on journeys from within the CTA to the UK"". But with no deal agreed, it is not clear what the EU will say to that. Passports Ensure your passport is up-to-date is the message from this paper. Anyone who wants to travel to the EU after Brexit is told to have at least six months left on their document - or they won't be allowed to travel. And those expecting to get their hands on a blue passport soon will have to wait a little longer. Initially, burgundy will still be the colour of choice, although the cover will no longer carry the words ""European Union"". But if you want the blue passport, ministers say they will  be issued in late 2019. Firearms Currently, EU citizens are allowed to travel with firearms between member states. This requires a ""European Firearms Pass"", and if you have one, you can go back and forth with it. However, in a no-deal scenario, people from the UK will not be able to get one of these passes and will have to check with the country they are travelling to what the rules are. The rules won't change for EU citizens though, whose passes will still be accepted in the UK. Safety standards for goods One of the things offered by the EU's single market are common regulations for goods. It means, whether you have tomatoes from Spain or sausages from Germany, they all have to adhere to a strict set of rules for quality. But, come 29 March 2019, there could be problems. If there is a no-deal, goods from the UK would not be covered by the regulations and businesses wanting to export their products would have to check on legislation in each country before they sent them there. Also, goods tested by a UK body - say cosmetics or bathroom products - would no longer be recognised by the EU, so would have to go through checks again - by a European Union-approved body - to make sure they meet the bloc's minimum safety requirements. Cars As with food and make up, car manufacturers are going to face similar regulation issues. If a car is made in the UK, or the parts are, a no-deal Brexit means firms will have to apply to the EU for what is called ""type approval"" - which shows they comply with EU safety and environmental standards. Without this green light, they won't be able to sell their cars and parts in the 27 member states. The paper says that for a time-limited period, perhaps two years, the UK will automatically convert EU approvals into UK approvals - meaning there would be no problem for EU manufacturers wanting to sell their cars in the UK. But, without a deal, there is no guarantee the EU would give Britain the same in return. Broadcasting As it stands, broadcasters in the EU can show their channels in any of the member states, but they only have to come under the scrutiny of one. For example, the BBC can show BBC programmes in France, but it only answers to Ofcom's code, not the French equivalent. This ""country of origin"" principle, however, will disappear with a no-deal Brexit. That means broadcasters will have to abide by the regulations in each individual country they want to show their content in. Personal data You will remember earlier this year that inboxes were flooded with emails about ""GDPR"". The General Data Protection Regulation applies to all organisations that handle European Union citizens' data. When the rules came in, they gave consumers new rights, such as finding out what data is being held on them, and getting firms to delete that information, unless they had a good reason to keep it. Part of the regulation also meant companies were only able to transfer personal data outside of the EU if there was a legal basis for doing so - but they could send it anywhere within the bloc. The UK is going to keep the same standard, so there would be no immediate impact there. However, if a deal wasn't agreed, British companies could face problems getting data from member states, as they would no longer be party to it. Environment/pollution There is a lot of law that has been made in the EU when it comes to protecting the environment and, in turn, the health of citizens. Targets to reduce air, water, and land pollution are set by the bloc, as well as emissions from vehicles and industry. The UK has pledged to keep these standards, and perhaps raise them higher, but in a no-deal scenario, there may have to be interim measures while we wait for the government to get their new rules through Parliament. Also, when it comes to products using damaging chemicals, the companies who make and sell them may need two different permits - one for the UK and one for the EU - giving them more red tape to wade through. Drugs Drug precursors are chemicals that can be used in the illicit manufacture of narcotics. But they can also be used for more legitimate means, such as in medicines, perfumes or for plastics. Trading these materials is easy enough as a member of the EU. But if you are on the outside, it comes at a cost - a license to sell into the block that could cost thousands of pounds. So, a no-deal would put firms in that position straight away. Space The UK is part of a number of joint European space programmes. These include Galileo, a satellite project for GPS systems, Copernicus, which carries out earth observations, and EU space surveillance. These are important for a range of UK businesses, from telecoms firms to universities. But whilst the average smartphone user won't feel the effect, companies, academics and researchers will no longer play a part in developing the systems and will be unable to bid for future contracts. The government has promised to invest Â£92 million from its ""Brexit readiness"" to design its own UK Global Navigation Satellite System, but many in the sector have expressed fears of dropping out of the existing EU version. Grants The UK can apply for a number of different grants from the EU to fund projects across the country. This can range from cash for transport projects and superfast broadband rollouts, through to help for disadvantaged communities, like schemes to create jobs or teach skills. But if there is a no-deal Brexit, the cash these things rely on could be cut off early. In July, the government promised to fund billions of pounds of programmes until the end of 2020 in the event of a no-deal. But there will be some caveats involved, such as collaborations with other member states getting the axe, and changes in line with other public spending. Business and investment The EU has long held big companies to account when it comes to competition. The idea is it stops companies abusing a dominant market position. So, whenGoogle was putting its own shopping service ads at the top of search resultsor whenMicrosoft promoted its web browser on computers running Windows, the EU gave levied hefty fines and imposed new rules. The UK has seen those rules duplicated here - Microsoft introducing a Browser Choice Screen pop-up for example - but if no-deal happens, the same rules won't apply. The government says the UK Competition and Markets Authority will take on responsibility for this role, but it will not be bound by EU law - so outcomes could be different. Shipping We are an island, and as such, shipping has always played a key role in the economy. But a no-deal Brexit could lead to some trouble on the high seas. If a ship from a non-EU country wants to enter an EU port, it has to submit security information and get an exemption before docking. Of course, members of the EU don't need to worry about this. But, a no-deal UK on the outside would have to apply. The papers also reveal crew members from the UK may be affected as they would no longer hold the correct certificates to work on EU vessels. The UK has said it will continue to recognise EU certificates for European workers on British boats - but it is up to the EU to reciprocate that.

Joker 'lookalike' jailed for crime wave,"Damien Hammond, 29, is widely recognised around Nottingham for donning make-up and costumes modelled on the Joker A self-styled Joker lookalike who aped the comic book villain's appearance to ""induce fear into members of the public and retail staff"" has been jailed. Damien Hammond, 29, is widely recognised around Nottingham for donning make-up and costumes modelled on Batman's arch-nemesis. He admitted a series of offences, described as a ""crime wave"" by police, committed over a three-month period. As he was led from the dock, he shouted ""I will kill today"". Appearing at Nottingham Magistrates' Court with bright green hair, Hammond, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to criminal damage and obstructing a police officer. He was jailed after admitting eight offences, including disorderly conduct towards staff in branches of Tesco Express and Shoe Zone. He also admitted disorderly conduct for waving a gun-shaped cigarette lighter while standing among traffic. Hammond had been calm throughout the hearing, even giving a thumbs-up when his make-up was described as representing the Jack Nicholson version of Batman's nemesis. Hammond modelled his make-up on Jack Nicholson and appeared in court with green hair But he reacted with anger when presiding magistrate Dr Janet Ellis told him he was to receive an 11-week sentence. He shouted from the dock: ""Send me to prison, I don't care."" He then vowed to stab prison officers and fellow inmates once his jail sentence began. ""See what you have done, I will kill today!"" he added. Jeff Surgay, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""The defendant's criminal conduct involving intimidating retail staff and disorderly conduct towards police officers, in one case striking an officer to the forehead whilst obstructing a drugs search, has been conducted over a prolonged period of time. ""That, together with him altering his appearance to resemble 'The Joker' appears to be calculated to induce fear into members of the public and retail staff in the city centre."" Hammond was told he must also serve an 18-week sentence which had previously been suspended, and made the subject of a three-year behaviour order banning him from areas of central Nottingham.

Brit shot dead by hunter in French Alps,"Marc Sutton was shot as he rode his mountain bike in the Alps A British mountain biker has been shot by a hunter in the French Alps. The 34-year-old, named locally as Marc Sutton, was killed by a stray bullet while riding in woodland near Montriond, close to the Swiss border. He was biking on a popular mountain track when he was shot by a 22-year-old who was taken to hospital in severe shock. Originally from Caerphilly, south Wales, he owned a restaurant in the small town of Les Gets. The Foreign Office said it was in touch with local authorities and was providing support to his family. The 34-year-old had recently opened his own restaurant in the area Mr Sutton, a keen snowboarder and mountain biker, ran a private catering business in the area and opened his own restaurant, Wild Beets Kitchen, earlier this year. In a Facebook post, he said of the restaurant: ""I still can't believe that this is ours! Hard work does pay off and dreams do come true."" Philippe Toccanier, prosecutor for the Thonon-Les-Bains region, told the Associated Press (AP) the death in thick woods was believed to be an accident. But he said that Mr Sutton ""couldn't be confused with game, as he had a coloured helmet and a coloured mountain bike"". In the past three years, more than 20 people have died in hunting accidents in France. On a local Facebook group people expressed horror and discussed how to prevent further incidents. ""This has to be stopped. Ban the chasse immediately,"" one said, using the French term for hunting. ""There are no excuses. People's lives are shattered."" But others said hunting was a ""lifelong tradition"" and called for safety measures such as restricting hunting to certain days. An inquiry has been launched into the incident of ""aggravated manslaughter,"" French prosecutors said.

West Coast rail firms net ÃÂ£51.2m in dividends,"Virgin and Stagecoach's West Coast line has seen a payout of Â£51.2m Virgin Trains and Stagecoach shared in Â£51.2m worth of dividends from the West Coast main line railway, shortly before walking away from another franchise. Virgin Rail Group's dividends, for the year ending 31 March 2018, are almost double the Â£27.9m that was given back to its shareholders in 2015. The details come after the firms' East Coast franchise collapsed in June, with the government losing out on Â£2.3bn. Virgin said strong performance had led to record payments for taxpayers. But Labour said the failing rail system was ""lining the pockets of billionaires"". Virgin owns 51% of the operator which runs the West Coast main line connecting London to Glasgow - known as Virgin Rail Group - while Stagecoach owns the remaining 49%. The companies were also joint owners of the East Coast franchise. In June, both Stagecoach and Virgin Trains dropped out of thecontract. The two firms ran the East Coast main line for three years from 2015, promising to pay Â£3.3bn to run the franchise until 2023. But by the end of 2017 it was clear they were in trouble, and in June the East Coast franchisewas handed back to the government. At the time, Labour and trade unions accused Virgin of costing taxpayers Â£2bn. Mr Grayling told the House of Commons in May that Stagecoach and Virgin had lost almost Â£200m on the failed East Coast franchise, but there had not been a loss to taxpayers ""at this time"". Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the East Coast franchise failed because Stagecoach and Virgin Trains overestimated the profitability of the line Reacting to news of the West Coast dividend, Labour's Rachel Maskell told the BBC it was ""shocking"" that money from the franchise was not being put back into the railways. She said: ""At the same time, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is letting them off a Â£2bn bill [for the East Coast franchise] which the taxpayers are having to bail out. ""This shows how franchising completely fails the public... buying a ticket is so extortionate these days that many people can't afford to travel by rail."" She added that Labour wanted to see dividends reinvested into publicly-owned railways that put passengers at the heart of business. A spokesperson for Virgin Trains said that the West Coast line had seen ""industry-leading levels of customer satisfaction thanks to innovations such as automatic delay repay, free films and TV on board, and mtickets"". A Department for Transport spokesperson said that privatisation had helped to ""transform"" the UK's railways innovation, investment and improved customer service: ""Virgin Trains continue to be the leading long distance operator in the National Passenger Survey results delivering consistently high customer satisfaction. ""West Coast passengers will see ongoing investment and innovation with the introduction of the West Coast Partnership in 2019.""

Melania: 'Don't care' jacket was a message,"Melania Trump wore the Zara jacket in June during a visit to Texas It was a mystery which sparked countless think pieces: Why did US First Lady Melania Trump wear a $39 jacket emblazoned with ""I really don't care, do you?"" during a trip to a migrant child detention centre? At the time of the June trip, Donald Trump said it was a message to the ""Fake News Media"". Her communications chief, however, had insisted it was ""just a jacket"". Now we have an answer: Mrs Trump has admitted she was sending a message. Mrs Trump visited the New Hope Children's Shelter in McAllen, Texas, on 21 June. The centre housed 55 children, including some separated from their parents as part of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy towards illegal immigration. However, she was criticised for wearing the controversial jacket on her way to the centre and during her return trip, although she took off the jacket before arriving at the centre itself. There was widespread speculation and criticism over what message Mrs Trump intended to send by wearing the jacket on that particular trip - although her spokeswoman said ""there was no hidden message"". Five things Melania's jacket could mean Melania: I'm world's most bullied person In pictures: Melania's African tour However, in an interview with ABC news that was released on Saturday,the former model acknowledged the jacket ""was a kind of message, yes"",external. ""It's obvious I didn't wear the jacket for the children, I wore the jacket to go on the plane and off the plane,"" she said. ""It was for the people and for the left-wing media who are criticising me. I want to show them I don't care. You could criticise whatever you want to say. But it will not stop me to do what I feel is right."" Mrs Trump criticised the media for being ""obsessed"" about her clothing. ""I often asking myself, if I had not worn that jacket, if I will have so much media coverage,"" she said, adding: ""I would prefer they would focus on what I do and on my initiatives than what I wear."" Mrs Trump's apparent stand delighted supporters, but critics have focused on the fact the admission has caught her team in a lie, and criticised the timing of her message. Allow Twitter content?

Davis urges cabinet Brexit rebellion,"David Davis has been a persistent critic of the PM's plans since quitting in July Cabinet ministers should ""exert their collective authority"" and rebel against Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal, ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis has said. The prime minister has suggested a temporary arrangement for the whole UK to remain in the customs union while the Irish border issue is resolved. Brexiteers fear this may be indefinite, limiting the ability to do trade deals. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were ""different ways"" to ensure any commitments were time-limited. Asked whether any deal would include a date at which the UK would no longer be bound by the rules of the customs union, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show, ""I certainly hope so"". ""There are different ways you can make sure something is credibly time-limited and that is what I want to see "", he said. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke to Andrew Marr about Brexit negotiations There was ""absolutely no reason"" for cabinet ministers to quit over the issue, he suggested, urging them to ""pull behind"" Mrs May ahead of a crucial summit of EU leaders on Wednesday. The current Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, went to Brussels on Sunday afternoon to meet with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier ahead of the event. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: ""With several big issues still to resolve, including the Northern Ireland backstop, it was jointly agreed that face-to-face talks were necessary."" Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop DUP leader: 'No-deal Brexit most likely' Latest no-deal Brexit contingency plans Wednesday's summit will signal whether or not a deal is likely to be struck in the run-up to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019. But writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Davis said the PM's plan was unacceptable.,external ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that government has taken in modern times,"" he added. And Labour, on whom Theresa May may have to rely to win a Parliamentary vote on the deal later this year, said it would not support ""any fudge cooked up with Brussels"". ""The government are playing chicken on this,"" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC's Andrew Marr show, claiming a choice between no deal and a ""bit of Theresa May nonsense"" was unacceptable. ""We say no... We are not agreeing to build half a bridge when we do not know where it is going."" Mr Davis resigned from his post in July - days after Mrs May's so-called Chequers deal was agreed by cabinet - saying he did not believe in the plan. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which will become the UK's border with the EU, is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a divorce deal with Brussels. Wrangling is continuing over the nature of a ""backstop"" to keep the border open if a wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it. The EU's version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels' rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and her Democratic Unionist allies. Mr Davis said the government's negotiating strategy had ""fundamental flaws"", arising from its ""unwise decision"" to let the EU dictate the principle of the backstop in December, when the two sides agreeda wider settlement on citizens rights and the so-called divorce bill. By Helen Catt, BBC political correspondent That David Davis is no fan of Theresa May's Brexit plan is not surprising. That he's choosing to ratchet up the pressure with a public call to rebellion aimed at her most senior ministers is perhaps more so. The former Brexit secretary's own resignation from the cabinet in July did not alter the prime minister's course. But time to reach a deal with the EU is now considerably shorter, and there have been reports that other senior Conservatives have concerns about the back-up plan for the Irish border too. The key question is perhaps not so much whom his article might persuade, but whether or not it reflects what some in the cabinet may already be thinking. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it had been a mistake for the prime minister to allow herself to get ""boxed in"" over the issue of Northern Ireland. Asked on Sky News' Sophy Ridge show whether he backed calls for a Cabinet rebellion, Mr Duncan Smith said, ""when you no longer agree on a fundamental issue, then it's probably time that you found yourself on the back benches"". Negotiations have continued this weekend between the UK and the EU ahead of Wednesday's meeting. On Saturday evening,German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported a deal had already been reached,externalbetween Mrs May and the EU, and would be announced on Monday. But a No 10 source told the BBC the report was ""100%, categorically untrue"" and negotiations were ongoing. Elsewhere, DUP leaderArlene Foster warned the prime minister on Saturday not to accept a ""dodgy"" deal with the EU. Mrs Foster said Mrs May should not back a plan that would ""effectively cut Northern Ireland adrift"".According to a leaked email reported in the Observer, Mrs Foster is preparing for a no-deal Brexit.,external At the beginning of the summer the government's senior ministers held a day-long meeting about Brexit at Chequers, the prime minister's official country home in Buckinghamshire. The aim was to agree what the government wanted from negotiations with the EU about the future relationship between the UK and the EU over Brexit. The plan that emerged from the meeting has become known as the Chequers plan, or sometimes simply Chequers. The key aim of the plan is to create a free-trade area for goods moving between the EU and the UK while stopping freedom of movement for people between them. To do this, the UK would commit to collecting import taxes, known as tariffs, on behalf of the EU for goods that arrive in the UK on their way to the EU. Meanwhile, goods that were staying in the UK could be charged at a different rate, depending on any future trade deals the UK agrees with other countries. The UK would also agree to a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for manufactured goods and food, which would mean following EU rules and standards. In the future, if the EU changed any of its standards, the UK could decide not to follow those changes but at the risk of losing the free trade agreement for those goods. The government believes the combination of the common rulebook and collecting tariffs for the EU would avoid the need for checks on goods passing between the UK and the EU, including over the Â Irish border. However, the EU doesn't accept all proposals in the Chequers plan. It thinks the proposals amount to ""cherry-picking"" parts of EU membership - in other words, keeping the bits the UK wants to stay attached to, while rejecting other rules. The EU is also unconvinced the UK would be able to accurately track all the goods moving through it. The boss of clothing firm Next has suggested leaving the EU without an over-arching deal would not be a disaster for the retail sector and urged ministers to step up their preparations. Lord Wolfson, a Conservative peer, told Andrew Marr it need not result in delays at the UK's ports as firms could complete new customs declarations online or at their warehouses while tariffs on EU imports could be set at zero to ensure prices do not go up. But more than three-quarters of NHS trusts have made no preparations for Brexit whatsoever - according to documents obtained by the People's Vote campaign under Freedom of Information requests. The group also commissioned a YouGov poll of the UK's doctors and nurses, who - according to the poll - now back another referendum by a margin of three to one.

Crunch Brexit talks tackling 'big issues',"The UK and EU say key issues remain unresolved following unscheduled Brexit talks in Brussels. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier met for more than an hour ahead of a crunch EU leaders' summit this week. Mr Barnier tweeted that issues, such as how to avoid a hard border with Ireland, were ""still open"". A UK government spokesman said UK and EU negotiators ""have made real progress in a number of key areas"". ""However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop,"" he added.

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said talks had ""made progress"" in the last few days - and dismissed reports of a row between Mr Raab and Mr Barnier - but added it was ""clear the two sides are stuck"" on how the Irish backstop might work. No further talks are planned before Mr Barnier and Theresa May's summit on Wednesday, she added. The meeting comes as domestic political pressure on Mrs May increases amid threats of potential cabinet resignations. Top Tories 'could resign over Brexit deal' Brexit: All you need to know In a letter to the prime minister, Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson said they would not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently from the rest of the UK in any Brexit deal. It follows reports that other top ministers have been considering their positions over the weekend ahead of a meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday at which ministers could be asked to give their consent to any agreement. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg While there may have been a sense in Brussels that Mrs May was moving towards them, if anything the politics at home have become more fraught. Thursday's cabinet meeting ramped up concerns and gave Brexiteers another excuse to rattle their sabres. The DUP continues its warnings that it'd sink the administration rather than see the deal it fears done. Several cabinet ministers are thinking about whether they can go on. And, more to the point, different groups of Tory MPs with gripes about other policies are scenting opportunity as the government is so vulnerable. Any move for the PM has become both harder, and more urgent. Her party won't accept a proposal to keep the UK essentially in the customs union. Parliament is likely to block no deal. The EU won't accept her Chequers plan. Even loyal ministers are deeply worried - ""She is like a chess player who only has the king left - all she can do is move one square at a time until she is check-mated."" Read more from Laura. The Raab-Barnier meeting came amid conflicting signals as to whether the two sides were nearing a deal on the terms of the UK's exit next March. Diplomats from the remaining 27 EU member states were summoned for an update on the process at 17.30 BST, prompting feverish speculation that a deal had been done. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke to Andrew Marr about Brexit negotiations The EU's aim is to have the entire Withdrawal Agreement agreed in principle in time for Wednesday's summit of EU leaders in Brussels. If the EU's 27 - as they are known - agree on it, then work will begin on drafting the political declaration on the future relationship. EU leaders are likely to call another summit in mid-November, at which the withdrawal deal and the framework of future co-operation could be finally approved. The deal would then have to be approved by the UK and EU Parliaments. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said that while Mr Raab's visit had an air of drama, it was standard practice in the talks for civil servants to hand over to politicians at key points like this. Rather than a ""victory lap"" by Mr Raab, he said the UK's statement that ""face-to-face talks were necessary to resolve several big issues"" should be taken at face value, and Northern Ireland remained a ""sticking point"". The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which will become the UK's border with the EU, is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a divorce deal with Brussels.

Brexiteers fear this will leave the UK in indefinite limbo, bound by the EU's rules and limited in the trade deals it can negotiate with other countries. Writing in the Sunday Times,,externalformer Brexit Secretary David Davis urged ministers to ""exert their collective authority"" and reject the plans at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has been hosting other European foreign ministers at his Chevening residence, said such calls were ""wrong"" when ""last-minute"" talks were going on and Mrs May was ""battling for Britain"". ""The reason that's wrong is there is no-one who is going to be able to negotiate the right deal for Britain better than Theresa May. This is the time to stand rock solid behind Theresa May.""

In their letter to the PM, Mr Mundell and Ms Davidson indicated they would not tolerate a situation in which Northern Ireland remained in the customs union and single market, while the rest of the UK was outside it.

Davis calls for cabinet Brexit rebellion,"David Davis has been a persistent critic of the PM's plans since quitting in July Cabinet ministers should ""exert their collective authority"" and rebel against Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal, ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis has said. The prime minister has suggested a temporary arrangement for the whole UK to remain in the customs union while the Irish border issue is resolved. Brexiteers fear this may be indefinite, limiting the ability to do trade deals. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were ""different ways"" to ensure any commitments were time-limited. Asked whether any deal would include a date at which the UK would no longer be bound by the rules of the customs union, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show, ""I certainly hope so"". ""There are different ways you can make sure something is credibly time-limited and that is what I want to see "", he said. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke to Andrew Marr about Brexit negotiations There was ""absolutely no reason"" for cabinet ministers to quit over the issue, he suggested, urging them to ""pull behind"" Mrs May ahead of a crucial summit of EU leaders on Wednesday. The current Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, went to Brussels on Sunday afternoon to meet with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier ahead of the event. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: ""With several big issues still to resolve, including the Northern Ireland backstop, it was jointly agreed that face-to-face talks were necessary."" Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop DUP leader: 'No-deal Brexit most likely' Latest no-deal Brexit contingency plans Wednesday's summit will signal whether or not a deal is likely to be struck in the run-up to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019. But writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Davis said the PM's plan was unacceptable.,external ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that government has taken in modern times,"" he added. And Labour, on whom Theresa May may have to rely to win a Parliamentary vote on the deal later this year, said it would not support ""any fudge cooked up with Brussels"". ""The government are playing chicken on this,"" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC's Andrew Marr show, claiming a choice between no deal and a ""bit of Theresa May nonsense"" was unacceptable. ""We say no... We are not agreeing to build half a bridge when we do not know where it is going."" Mr Davis resigned from his post in July - days after Mrs May's so-called Chequers deal was agreed by cabinet - saying he did not believe in the plan. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which will become the UK's border with the EU, is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a divorce deal with Brussels. Wrangling is continuing over the nature of a ""backstop"" to keep the border open if a wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it. The EU's version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels' rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and her Democratic Unionist allies. Mr Davis said the government's negotiating strategy had ""fundamental flaws"", arising from its ""unwise decision"" to let the EU dictate the principle of the backstop in December, when the two sides agreeda wider settlement on citizens rights and the so-called divorce bill. By Helen Catt, BBC political correspondent That David Davis is no fan of Theresa May's Brexit plan is not surprising. That he's choosing to ratchet up the pressure with a public call to rebellion aimed at her most senior ministers is perhaps more so. The former Brexit secretary's own resignation from the cabinet in July did not alter the prime minister's course. But time to reach a deal with the EU is now considerably shorter, and there have been reports that other senior Conservatives have concerns about the back-up plan for the Irish border too. The key question is perhaps not so much whom his article might persuade, but whether or not it reflects what some in the cabinet may already be thinking. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it had been a mistake for the prime minister to allow herself to get ""boxed in"" over the issue of Northern Ireland. Asked on Sky News' Sophy Ridge show whether he backed calls for a Cabinet rebellion, Mr Duncan Smith said, ""when you no longer agree on a fundamental issue, then it's probably time that you found yourself on the back benches"". Negotiations have continued this weekend between the UK and the EU ahead of Wednesday's meeting. On Saturday evening,German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported a deal had already been reached,externalbetween Mrs May and the EU, and would be announced on Monday. But a No 10 source told the BBC the report was ""100%, categorically untrue"" and negotiations were ongoing. Elsewhere, DUP leaderArlene Foster warned the prime minister on Saturday not to accept a ""dodgy"" deal with the EU. Mrs Foster said Mrs May should not back a plan that would ""effectively cut Northern Ireland adrift"".According to a leaked email reported in the Observer, Mrs Foster is preparing for a no-deal Brexit.,external At the beginning of the summer the government's senior ministers held a day-long meeting about Brexit at Chequers, the prime minister's official country home in Buckinghamshire. The aim was to agree what the government wanted from negotiations with the EU about the future relationship between the UK and the EU over Brexit. The plan that emerged from the meeting has become known as the Chequers plan, or sometimes simply Chequers. The key aim of the plan is to create a free-trade area for goods moving between the EU and the UK while stopping freedom of movement for people between them. To do this, the UK would commit to collecting import taxes, known as tariffs, on behalf of the EU for goods that arrive in the UK on their way to the EU. Meanwhile, goods that were staying in the UK could be charged at a different rate, depending on any future trade deals the UK agrees with other countries. The UK would also agree to a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for manufactured goods and food, which would mean following EU rules and standards. In the future, if the EU changed any of its standards, the UK could decide not to follow those changes but at the risk of losing the free trade agreement for those goods. The government believes the combination of the common rulebook and collecting tariffs for the EU would avoid the need for checks on goods passing between the UK and the EU, including over the Â Irish border. However, the EU doesn't accept all proposals in the Chequers plan. It thinks the proposals amount to ""cherry-picking"" parts of EU membership - in other words, keeping the bits the UK wants to stay attached to, while rejecting other rules. The EU is also unconvinced the UK would be able to accurately track all the goods moving through it. The boss of clothing firm Next has suggested leaving the EU without an over-arching deal would not be a disaster for the retail sector and urged ministers to step up their preparations. Lord Wolfson, a Conservative peer, told Andrew Marr it need not result in delays at the UK's ports as firms could complete new customs declarations online or at their warehouses while tariffs on EU imports could be set at zero to ensure prices do not go up. But more than three-quarters of NHS trusts have made no preparations for Brexit whatsoever - according to documents obtained by the People's Vote campaign under Freedom of Information requests. The group also commissioned a YouGov poll of the UK's doctors and nurses, who - according to the poll - now back another referendum by a margin of three to one.

Brit 'shot dead by hunter' in French Alps,"Marc Sutton was shot as he rode his mountain bike in the Alps A British mountain biker has been shot by a hunter in the French Alps. The 34-year-old, named locally as Marc Sutton, was killed by a stray bullet while riding in woodland near Montriond, close to the Swiss border. He was biking on a popular mountain track when he was shot by a 22-year-old who was taken to hospital in severe shock. Originally from Caerphilly, south Wales, he owned a restaurant in the small town of Les Gets. The Foreign Office said it was in touch with local authorities and was providing support to his family. The 34-year-old had recently opened his own restaurant in the area Mr Sutton, a keen snowboarder and mountain biker, ran a private catering business in the area and opened his own restaurant, Wild Beets Kitchen, earlier this year. In a Facebook post, he said of the restaurant: ""I still can't believe that this is ours! Hard work does pay off and dreams do come true."" Philippe Toccanier, prosecutor for the Thonon-Les-Bains region, told the Associated Press (AP) the death in thick woods was believed to be an accident. But he said that Mr Sutton ""couldn't be confused with game, as he had a coloured helmet and a coloured mountain bike"". In the past three years, more than 20 people have died in hunting accidents in France. On a local Facebook group people expressed horror and discussed how to prevent further incidents. ""This has to be stopped. Ban the chasse immediately,"" one said, using the French term for hunting. ""There are no excuses. People's lives are shattered."" But others said hunting was a ""lifelong tradition"" and called for safety measures such as restricting hunting to certain days. An inquiry has been launched into the incident of ""aggravated manslaughter,"" French prosecutors said.

"Saudis defy 'threats' over missing writerSaudi Arabia will respond to any political or economic actions, a source tells state media.Middle East","This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Saudi Arabia rejects political and economic ""threats"" over missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a source quoted by state news agency SPA says. The country would respond to any punitive action ""with a bigger one"", the unnamed senior source said. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, vanished on 2 October after visiting its consulate in Istanbul. US President Donald Trump said he would ""punish"" Saudi Arabia if it were found responsible for killing him. On Sunday a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany called for a credible investigation to ensure those responsible for Mr Khashoggi's disappearance were held to account. ""We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi Government to provide a complete and detailed response,"" said Jeremy Hunt, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas. Later Mr Hunt said that whatever happened now was ""absolutely up to Saudi Arabia"". ""If, as they say, this terrible murder didn't happen, then where is Jamal Khashoggi?

""The kingdom also affirms that it will respond to any action with a bigger one. The Saudi economy has vital and influential roles for the global economy."" But on Sunday evening King Salman appeared more conciliatory, thanking Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for setting up a joint team to investigate the disappearance. No-one could undermine the strong relationship Saudi Arabia had with Turkey, he said. The Saudis have come under considerable international pressure over the disappearance. Diplomatic sources told the BBC's James Landale that both US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox might not attend next month's investment conference in Riyadh, which has been dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"". However, later White House aide Larry Kudlow told ABC News that as things stood Mr Mnuchin was intending to go to Riyadh and would take a final decision ""as new information surfaces"".

UK and US 'may boycott' Saudi conference,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Britain and the US are considering boycotting a major international conference in Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the BBC has learned. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, vanished on 2 October after visiting its consulate in Istanbul. The authorities in Istanbul believe he was murdered there by Saudi agents - claims Riyadh has dismissed as ""lies"". Donald Trump has said he will ""punish"" Saudi Arabia if it is responsible. Several sponsors and media groups have decided to pull out of this month's investment conference in Riyadh, dubbed Davos in the Desert, as a result of concerns over Mr Khashoggi's fate. Diplomatic sources have now told the BBC's James Landale both the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox might not attend the event, which is being hosted by the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to promote his reform agenda. A spokesman for the UK's international trade department said Dr Fox's diary was not yet finalised for the week of the conference. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists A joint statement of condemnation, if it is confirmed that Mr Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents, is also being discussed by US and European diplomats. However, Mr Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, has said words alone will not be good enough if he has been murdered. Hatice Cengiz: ""I have been waking up every morning hoping to hear from him"" ""If we have already lost Jamal, thencondemnation is not enough,"" she wrote in a piece for the New York Times,external. ""The people who took him from us, irrespective of their political positions, must be held accountable and punished to the full extent of the law."" She added that Saturday had been Jamal's birthday. ""When your loved one leaves this world, the other world no longer seemed scary or far away. It is being left here all alone, without them, that is most painful."" President Trump has said the US will inflict ""severe punishment"" on Saudi Arabia if the kingdom is found to be responsible for the death of Mr Khashoggi. He said he would be ""very upset and angry if that were the case"", but ruled out halting big military contracts. ""I think we'd be punishing ourselves if we did that,"" he said. ""If they don't buy it from us, they're going to buy it from Russia or... China."" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia was not yet co-operating with the investigation - despite a statement from Saudi Interior Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz saying his nation wanted to uncover ""the whole truth"". Mr Cavusoglu has urged the kingdom to allow Turkish officials to enter the consulate. On Sunday, stocks on the Tadawul All-Shares Index plummeted 7% in early trading, wiping out all the gains made this year, before recovering slightly around noon. In two sessions it lost $50bn (Â£38bn) of its $450bn capitalisation, AFP news agency reported.

Patisserie Valerie discovers 'secret' overdrafts,"Patisserie Valerie was saved from the brink of collapse by a Â£20m loan from its chairman The board of Patisserie Valerie discovered the existence of two ""secret"" company bank overdrafts this week, according to boss Luke Johnson. The entrepreneur told theSunday Times,externalthat Â£9.7m had been spent in two overdrafts set up with HSBC and Barclays. Mr Johnson said neither he, the board, nor the auditors had known that the firm had bank overdraft facilities. On Friday,he provided Â£20m in loansto save the chain from collapsing. Mr Johnson said that the past seven days had been ""the most harrowing week"" of his life, and that he felt a ""moral obligation"" to rescue the business. ""There were 2,800 jobs at stake, there was 12 years of effort that I and colleagues had put into the business, and the board were determined not to allow the business to go into administration,"" he told the Sunday Times. It all started on Wednesday when Patisserie Valerie announced that its board had become aware ofan HMRC winding-up petition against its principal subsidiary Stonebeach,external, with the tax body seeking a payment of Â£1.14m. In May, Patisserie Valerie said that it had Â£28.8m in cash reserves, while half-year profits were 14.2% up on the previous year at Â£11.1m. On Thursday, the firm announced that its board had found ""a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business"". Grant Thornton, which has audited the firm's accounts since 2010, said it would not comment on Mr Johnson's revelations to the Sunday Times. On Friday, Mr Johnson agreed to lend Â£10m for three years to owners Patisserie Holdings plc, which the company said would provide ""immediate liquidity"". He has also provided a further bridging loan facility of up to Â£10m. The firm said it had also raised another Â£15m by issuing new shares. The directors said the company had required an immediate cash injection of no less than Â£20m, without which it could not continue trading in its present form. On the same day, the company saidits finance director Chris Marsh had been arrestedand released on bail. The Serious Fraud Office said it had ""opened a criminal investigation into an individual"", who was not named.

"Crackdown on 'ÃÂ£250m free prescription fraud'Checking eligibility before drugs are issued could halve false claims in England, the government says.Health","England is the only part of the UK which charges for prescriptions Patients claiming free prescriptions in England face checks before medicine is issued in an effort to stamp out fraud. Prescription fraud currently costs the NHS in England an estimated Â£256m a year. A new digitised system to be piloted next year will mean pharmacies can instantly verify who is entitled to free medication. But pharmacists have opposed similar plans in the past, saying they harm patient trust. Sandra Gidley from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ""What if the computer says no? That is a real dilemma. ""Sometimes somebody has free prescriptions legitimately, they've got a medical exception - they're something like a diabetic - and they might forget to renew it and the computer says no. ""You're not going to stop a diabetic from getting their insulin, for example. ""So I think this is potentially fraught with problems."" Currently, patients either present an exemption certificate or sign the back of their prescription stating they do not have to pay the Â£8.80 charge. The NHS Business Authority runs random checks, but only after the medication has been dispensed. In 2016-17,the number of Â£100 fines it issued for false claims doubledto more than 900,000. The new approach will require pharmacists to check the digital exemption system before handing over medication. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The message is clear. The NHS is no longer an easy target and if you try to steal from it you will face the consequences."" Should the long-term ill have free prescriptions? Free prescriptions 'saving Welsh NHS money' England is the only part of the UK which charges for prescriptions. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the British Medical Association have said many of those fined are not fraudsters, but people who fail to complete paperwork properly or forget to renew their exemption. People with long-term illnesses and those on low incomes were most likely to be affected, they said. Fraud is estimated tocost the NHS Â£1.2bn a year, or about 1% of its total budget. The prescription checks are part of a series of measures intended to prevent Â£300m of fraud by April 2020. Other measures include a counter-fraud team targeting rogue dentists and pharmacists who charge the NHS for work they have not carried out. Should long-term ill get free drugs?

Is meat too hot for politicians?Climate scientists say we must eat less meat but the UK government will not sell that message.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Five things we can do to help prevent global temperatures rising more than 1.5C Just a week after scientists said huge cuts in carbon emissions were needed to protect the climate, a UK minister has shown just how hard that will be. Scientists say we ought to eat much less meat because the meat industry causes so many carbon emissions. But the climate minister Claire Perry has told BBC News it is not the government's job to advise people on a climate-friendly diet. She would not even say whether she herself would eat less meat. Ms Perry has been accused by Friends of the Earth of a dereliction of duty. They say ministers must show leadership on this difficult issue. But the minister - who is personally convinced about the need to tackle climate change - is anxious to avoid accusations of finger-wagging. Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' 'Flexitarian' diets can limit future risks Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say She said: ""I like lots of local meat. I don't think we should be in the business of prescribing to people how they should run their diets."" When asked whether the Cabinet should set an example by eating less beef (which has most climate impact), she said: ""I think you're describing the worst sort of Nanny State ever. ""Who would I be to sit there advising people in the country coming home after a hard day of work to not have steak and chips?â¦ Pleaseâ¦"" Ms Perry refused even to say whether she agreed with scientists' conclusions that meat consumption needed to fall. Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth responded: ""The evidence is now very clear that eating less meat could be one of the quickest ways to reduce climate pollution. ""Reducing meat consumption will also be good for people's health and will free up agricultural land to make space for nature. ""It's a complete no-brainer, and it's a dereliction of duty for government to leave the job of persuading people to eat less meat to the green groups."" He said the government could launch information campaigns, change diets in schools and hospitals, or offer financial incentives. Ms Perry said: ""What I do think we need to do is look at the whole issue of agricultural emissions and do a lot more tree planting. ""But if you and I eat less meat, with all the flatulent sheep in Switzerland and flatulent cows in the Netherlands - that will just be wiped out in a moment. Let's work on the technology to solve these problems at scale."" She said instead of cutting down on meat, we could use (hugely expensive) equipment that sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere. Ms Perry said later that her own typical family meal is not steak and chips, but a stir-fry, which brings the taste and texture of meat into a dish dominated by vegetables. But she did not want to say this on camera. She agreed it was appropriate for the government to advise people on healthy diets because the obesity epidemic is costing taxpayers more in health bills, but implied that this principle did not apply when considering the health of the planet. Her fear of being condemned in the media as a bossy politician highlights the difficulty of the next phase of climate change reductions. Until now, 75% of CO2 reductions in the UK have come from cleaning up the electricity sector. Many people have barely noticed the change. Experts generally agree that for healthy lives and a healthy planet, the battle over climate change will have to get personal. That could mean people driving smaller cars, walking and cycling more, flying less, buying less fast fashion, wearing a sweater in winterâ¦ and eating less meat. People will still live good lives, they say, but they'll have to make a cultural shift. If governments do not feel able to back those messages, they say, the near impossible task of holding global temperature rise to 1.5C will become even more difficult. Ms Perry's comments came as she launched Green GB week, which aims to show how the UK can increase the economy while also cutting emissions. She will formally ask advisers how Britain can cut emissions to zero.

"Hurricane-force winds rip through PortugalThe remnants of Hurricane Leslie leave 300,000 homes without power after striking overnight.Europe","This video can not be played About 1,000 trees have been uprooted by the hurricane-force winds Hurricane-force winds have struck central and northern Portugal, leaving 300,000 homes without power. The remnants of Hurricane Leslie swept in overnight on Saturday, with winds gusting up to 176km/h (109mph). Civil defence officials said 27 people suffered minor injuries, with localised flooding, hundreds of trees uprooted and a number of flights cancelled. The storm, one of the most powerful to ever hit the country, is now passing over northern Spain. Is climate change making hurricanes worse? The worst-affected areas in Portugal were around the capital, Lisbon, and in the districts of Coimbra and Leiria. Aveiro, Viseu and Porto in the north also suffered damage. About 1,000 trees have been uprooted, officials say. The main A1 motorway was among the roads temporarily blocked. The storm wreaked havoc throughout Portuguese towns and cities Some 1,900 incidents were reported to emergency services, although civil defence commander Luis Belo Costa said ""the greatest danger has passed"". Hundreds of people remained in an arts centre in Figueira da Foz after a concert because of the high winds. A resident of the town told SIC television: ""I have never seen anything like it, The town seemed to be in a state of war, with cars smashed by fallen trees. People were very worried."" The city centre of Figueira da Foz also took damage Heavy rainfall from storm Leslie in a market in Pamplona in Spain The roof blew off a stadium hosting the European final of the women's roller hockey competition, halting the event, AFP news agency reported. It is rare for an Atlantic hurricane to reach the Iberian peninsula, with only five such events recorded. Hurricane Leslie had formed on 23 September but was downgraded to a tropical storm before it made landfall. However, it retained gusts of hurricane strength. The Spanish Meteorological Agency (Amet) said Leslie was moving north-east through the peninsula. Gusts of almost 100km/h were recorded near the city of Zamora early on Sunday, but winds have now lessened. Amet said that on Sunday morning large areas of Asturias, Castille and LeÃ³n and Cantabria would be affected, with north-eastern areas hit in the afternoon. Four departments in southern France have also been put on alert for storms and flooding. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

Robert Frejus, 29, died on Tuesday at HMP Nottingham, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed. A cause of death has not been revealed, but a spokesman said the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman would investigate.

A statement from the ministry on Mr Frejus' death said its thoughts were with his family and friends. In May, the chief inspector of prisons reported a""dangerous"" and ""disrespectful"" environmentat the Category B jail. Nottingham Prison is just north of the city centre and holds about 1,060 inmates There have been eight self-inflicted deaths at the facility since 2016, including four in the space of as many weeks last year. Chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said inmates might have taken their own lives because they could no longer face life at the ""drug-ridden jail"". In January, Mr Clarkeissued the MoJ with an urgent notification letter, demanding action within 28 days. The move led to Justice Secretary David Gauke publishing an action plan. The MoJ said it had made improvements to the prison, including recruiting more prison officers to improve safety and tackle drugs.

Murdered Archbishop Romero becomes saint,"Archbishop Romero is revered across Latin America as a champion of the poor Pope Francis has conferred sainthood on murdered Salvadoran Archbishop Ãscar Romero at a ceremony in the Vatican. He praised the cleric - an advocate for peace during El Salvador's civil war - for sacrificing his own safety to be ""close to the poor and his people"". Ãscar Romero was killed by soldiers while giving Mass in 1980. His killers have never been brought to justice. Pope Francis also canonised Pope Paul VI, known for making reforms to the Catholic Church in the 1960s. The bestowing of a sainthood onto Archbishop Romero has long been called for by Catholics in the region, the BBC's Will Grant reports. Thousands of pilgrims gathered Sunday to pay tribute to the new saints Pope Francis led a ceremony to elevate the two men, and five others, to sainthood in Saint Peter's Square. ""We declare and define Paul VI and Ãscar Arnulfo Romero GaldÃ¡mez... to be saints and we enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole church,"" he told a crowd of 60,000 people, including multiple heads of state. The pope wore the blood-stained rope belt worn by Archbishop Romero when he was murdered and used the chalice and pastoral staff of Pope Paul VI. How does someone become a saint? Oscar Romero: Latin Americaâs martyr and hero The Argentine pontiff, Latin America's first, has hailed both men for their bravery during difficult times and their dedication to social justice and the oppressed. Among the other newly appointed saints include an Italian orphan who died of bone cancer aged 19 and a German nun. Thousands of pilgrims gathered to pay tribute to the new saints, including some 5,000 Salvadorans. Archbishop Romero and Pope Paul VI have been elevated to sainthood Archbishop Romero was beatified in May 2015 in a ceremony in El Salvador which drew huge crowds. For the faithful, his power came from the fact he criticised both sides of the El Salvadoran conflict, which started in 1980, for any actions that affected civilians. When the US-backed Salvadoran army was using death squads and torture to stop leftist revolutionaries from seizing power, he used what would become his last homily to speak out against it. Many in the region see him as the saint of central America ""The law of God which says thou shalt not kill must come before any human order to kill. It is high time you recovered your conscience,"" he said, calling on the National Guard and police to stop the violence. ""I implore you, I beg you, I order you in the name of God: Stop the repression."" The next day, on 24 March 1980, Archbishop Romero was shot dead as he celebrated Mass in a hospital chapel. Salvadorean priest 'a martyr' - Pope Murdered archbishop to be made a saint His death horrified the world and escalated the violence in El Salvador that spiralled into a 12-year civil war that claimed 75,000 lives. Many Salvadorans are still angry that 38 years later, Archbishop Romero's killers have never faced justice because of a 1992 amnesty law. He is still despised by some on the far right, who describe him as a ""guerrilla in a cassock"". Pope Paul VI brought about sweeping changes as part of Vatican II but opposed birth control Born Giovanni Battista Montini in the Lombardy region of Italy in 1897, Pope Paul VI was beatified in 2014. Elected pope in 1963, he continued the reforms of his predecessor, John XXIII, until his death in 1978. The reforms, brought in by the Second Vatican Council or Vatican II, changed the relationship between the Catholic faithful and priests. The unfinished business of Vatican II Mass, which had been celebrated in Latin, was translated into the language of the congregation and priests faced church goers instead of the altar. During his 15-year pontificate, Pope Paul VI wrote seven encyclicals. One of them, Humanae Vitae (Of Human Life), published in 1968, was highly controversial due to its opposition to birth control and led to protests around the Catholic world.

Bucket list for dog dying of cancer,"A sunrise hike of Mount Mansfield, Vermont was on Finn's bucket list When Finn was diagnosed with cancer in May, Cynthia wanted to make sure his last weeks were his best. She and her husband Robert Peterson made a bucket list for six-year-old Finn and those final adventures have beenshared with dog lovers everywhere on Instagram,external. Finn, who lives in Burlington, Vermont has been on a hot air balloon ride, eaten a steak dinner, been apple picking, swum in the ocean, and there is yet more planned. ""We've turned a devastating experience into an empowering one. We've made friends with people globally whose dogs also have cancer,"" Cynthia, 29, told the BBC. Finn, with Cynthia Peterson, 29 and her husband Robert, 33, in Vermont Cynthia, an intensive care nurse, found Finn on an internet forum in 2012 when he was just six weeks old and she says he supported her throughout her 20s. ""He helped me through the grief when my dad died and now he's dying of cancer, too. ""It's a hard blow but really powerful to look back at how he got me through those times and now I'm going to help him,"" she explained. The idea for Finn's bucket list came from a care package they received from Live Like Roo Foundation, an organisation that supports families whose pet has cancer. Finn went on a tethered hot air balloon ride in August The list focuses on activities he would enjoy, like hiking, but they also visited a fire station, made homemade dog treats, and he made a new friend. Finn hasn't responded well to chemotherapy to treat the T-cell lymphoma, and he has just six to eight weeks left. As well as writing a song about Finn, Cynthia plans to write a children's book in his memory. ""He's a very enthusiastic, loyal dog who really lights up at anyone. He would have been an amazing therapy dog."" Finn visited a fire station with Cynthia and Robert's other dog Yogi Connecting with other dog owners using the hashtag #CanineCancerWarrior is helping them feel less isolated. ""There are thousands of posts. It's really beautiful. There are 40 or 50 dogs in one group with their stories shared."" Cynthia also hopes that using social media to document Finn's last weeks will raise awareness of canine cancer and how it affects many families globally. The bucket list is helping them pre-grieve for their pet. ""We know he's dying, but we are trying to make him happy. ""We will look back on this and think we made his final days the best we could. We're making the most of what we've got,"" she adds.

Hurricane-force winds rip through Portugal,"This video can not be played About 1,000 trees have been uprooted by the hurricane-force winds Hurricane-force winds have struck central and northern Portugal, leaving 300,000 homes without power. The remnants of Hurricane Leslie swept in overnight on Saturday, with winds gusting up to 176km/h (109mph). Civil defence officials said 27 people suffered minor injuries, with localised flooding, hundreds of trees uprooted and a number of flights cancelled. The storm, one of the most powerful to ever hit the country, is now passing over northern Spain. Is climate change making hurricanes worse? The worst-affected areas in Portugal were around the capital, Lisbon, and in the districts of Coimbra and Leiria. Aveiro, Viseu and Porto in the north also suffered damage. About 1,000 trees have been uprooted, officials say. The main A1 motorway was among the roads temporarily blocked. The storm wreaked havoc throughout Portuguese towns and cities Some 1,900 incidents were reported to emergency services, although civil defence commander Luis Belo Costa said ""the greatest danger has passed"". Hundreds of people remained in an arts centre in Figueira da Foz after a concert because of the high winds. A resident of the town told SIC television: ""I have never seen anything like it, The town seemed to be in a state of war, with cars smashed by fallen trees. People were very worried."" The city centre of Figueira da Foz also took damage Heavy rainfall from storm Leslie in a market in Pamplona in Spain The roof blew off a stadium hosting the European final of the women's roller hockey competition, halting the event, AFP news agency reported. It is rare for an Atlantic hurricane to reach the Iberian peninsula, with only five such events recorded. Hurricane Leslie had formed on 23 September but was downgraded to a tropical storm before it made landfall. However, it retained gusts of hurricane strength. The Spanish Meteorological Agency (Amet) said Leslie was moving north-east through the peninsula. Gusts of almost 100km/h were recorded near the city of Zamora early on Sunday, but winds have now lessened. Amet said that on Sunday morning large areas of Asturias, Castille and LeÃ³n and Cantabria would be affected, with north-eastern areas hit in the afternoon. Four departments in southern France have also been put on alert for storms and flooding. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

Melania: 'Don't care' jacket was a messageMrs Trump's own team had denied that her clothing during a visit to a detention centre had any meaning.US & Canada,"Melania Trump wore the Zara jacket in June during a visit to Texas It was a mystery which sparked countless think pieces: Why did US First Lady Melania Trump wear a $39 jacket emblazoned with ""I really don't care, do you?"" during a trip to a migrant child detention centre? At the time of the June trip, Donald Trump said it was a message to the ""Fake News Media"". Her communications chief, however, had insisted it was ""just a jacket"". Now we have an answer: Mrs Trump has admitted she was sending a message. Mrs Trump visited the New Hope Children's Shelter in McAllen, Texas, on 21 June. The centre housed 55 children, including some separated from their parents as part of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy towards illegal immigration. However, she was criticised for wearing the controversial jacket on her way to the centre and during her return trip, although she took off the jacket before arriving at the centre itself. There was widespread speculation and criticism over what message Mrs Trump intended to send by wearing the jacket on that particular trip - although her spokeswoman said ""there was no hidden message"". Five things Melania's jacket could mean Melania: I'm world's most bullied person In pictures: Melania's African tour However, in an interview with ABC news that was released on Saturday,the former model acknowledged the jacket ""was a kind of message, yes"",external. ""It's obvious I didn't wear the jacket for the children, I wore the jacket to go on the plane and off the plane,"" she said. ""It was for the people and for the left-wing media who are criticising me. I want to show them I don't care. You could criticise whatever you want to say. But it will not stop me to do what I feel is right."" Mrs Trump criticised the media for being ""obsessed"" about her clothing. ""I often asking myself, if I had not worn that jacket, if I will have so much media coverage,"" she said, adding: ""I would prefer they would focus on what I do and on my initiatives than what I wear."" Mrs Trump's apparent stand delighted supporters, but critics have focused on the fact the admission has caught her team in a lie, and criticised the timing of her message. Allow Twitter content?

"Hurricane-force winds rip through PortugalThe remnants of Hurricane Leslie left more than 15,000 homes without power after striking overnight.","This video can not be played About 1,000 trees have been uprooted by the hurricane-force winds Hurricane-force winds have struck central and northern Portugal, leaving 300,000 homes without power. The remnants of Hurricane Leslie swept in overnight on Saturday, with winds gusting up to 176km/h (109mph). Civil defence officials said 27 people suffered minor injuries, with localised flooding, hundreds of trees uprooted and a number of flights cancelled. The storm, one of the most powerful to ever hit the country, is now passing over northern Spain. Is climate change making hurricanes worse? The worst-affected areas in Portugal were around the capital, Lisbon, and in the districts of Coimbra and Leiria. Aveiro, Viseu and Porto in the north also suffered damage. About 1,000 trees have been uprooted, officials say. The main A1 motorway was among the roads temporarily blocked. The storm wreaked havoc throughout Portuguese towns and cities Some 1,900 incidents were reported to emergency services, although civil defence commander Luis Belo Costa said ""the greatest danger has passed"". Hundreds of people remained in an arts centre in Figueira da Foz after a concert because of the high winds. A resident of the town told SIC television: ""I have never seen anything like it, The town seemed to be in a state of war, with cars smashed by fallen trees. People were very worried."" The city centre of Figueira da Foz also took damage Heavy rainfall from storm Leslie in a market in Pamplona in Spain The roof blew off a stadium hosting the European final of the women's roller hockey competition, halting the event, AFP news agency reported. It is rare for an Atlantic hurricane to reach the Iberian peninsula, with only five such events recorded. Hurricane Leslie had formed on 23 September but was downgraded to a tropical storm before it made landfall. However, it retained gusts of hurricane strength. The Spanish Meteorological Agency (Amet) said Leslie was moving north-east through the peninsula. Gusts of almost 100km/h were recorded near the city of Zamora early on Sunday, but winds have now lessened. Amet said that on Sunday morning large areas of Asturias, Castille and LeÃ³n and Cantabria would be affected, with north-eastern areas hit in the afternoon. Four departments in southern France have also been put on alert for storms and flooding. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/hSome minor flooding, little structural damage.Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/hRoofs and trees could be damaged.Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/hHouses suffer damage, severe floodingStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/hSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""Mayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...

Major B&M store blaze investigation due,"Shoppers fled the blaze at a retail park in York McDonald's has apologised after firefighters tackling a blaze at a branch of discount retailer B&M were denied free refreshments. Crews spent Saturday night bringing a huge fire, whichleft the building at York's Clifton Moor retail park ""a burnt-out shell"", under control. It later emerged two members of the public had paid for drinks out of their own pockets when none were provided. McDonald's has said free drinks ""should have been provided on the night"". A number of firefighters reportedly approached the branch, close to the B&M store, while taking a break from combating the blaze. They are said to have asked if the restaurant could provide free drinks, on account of crews not carrying cash while attending a call-out, but were refused. Several firefighters used Facebook to thank ""a lady and a young man"" who bought them refreshments. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire Steve Brown, a crew manager at North Yorkshire Fire Service,wrote,external: ""I was one of the firefighters there last night, thank you to the lady and young man who brought us the teas and coffees, really appreciated."" Phil Leealso expressed thanks, writing,externalthat the teas and coffees ""couldn't have come at a better time. Many thanks from all the lads"". A McDonald's spokesperson said: ""On this occasion, we would like to apologise to the firefighters who bravely tackled last night's fire. ""They should have been provided with free refreshments on the night as a small recognition for their efforts. ""McDonald's will of course be happy to reimburse the member of public involved."" The company would be in touch with the local fire and rescue service, it added. North Yorkshire Fire Service has been contacted for a comment. Plumes of smoke could be seen ""for miles"", said BBC reporter Phil Bodmer Crews remain at the scene of Saturday's blaze, and an investigation into its cause is due to begin, said North Yorkshire Fire Service. A spokesman said the flames had been brought under control but firefighters continued damping down the remnants. He confirmed the fire had been contained within the store and there had been ""no immediate concern for adjacent buildings"". At the height of the blaze, which broke out just before 16:30 BST when the store was still open, local residents were advised to stay indoors and close their windows. Allow Twitter content?

"Hundreds celebrate priest's canonisationSalvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who spoke out against atrocities, will become a saint on Sunday.Latin America & Caribbean","Archbishop Romero is revered across Latin America as a champion of the poor Pope Francis has conferred sainthood on murdered Salvadoran Archbishop Ãscar Romero at a ceremony in the Vatican. He praised the cleric - an advocate for peace during El Salvador's civil war - for sacrificing his own safety to be ""close to the poor and his people"". Ãscar Romero was killed by soldiers while giving Mass in 1980. His killers have never been brought to justice. Pope Francis also canonised Pope Paul VI, known for making reforms to the Catholic Church in the 1960s. The bestowing of a sainthood onto Archbishop Romero has long been called for by Catholics in the region, the BBC's Will Grant reports. Thousands of pilgrims gathered Sunday to pay tribute to the new saints Pope Francis led a ceremony to elevate the two men, and five others, to sainthood in Saint Peter's Square. ""We declare and define Paul VI and Ãscar Arnulfo Romero GaldÃ¡mez... to be saints and we enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole church,"" he told a crowd of 60,000 people, including multiple heads of state. The pope wore the blood-stained rope belt worn by Archbishop Romero when he was murdered and used the chalice and pastoral staff of Pope Paul VI. How does someone become a saint? Oscar Romero: Latin Americaâs martyr and hero The Argentine pontiff, Latin America's first, has hailed both men for their bravery during difficult times and their dedication to social justice and the oppressed. Among the other newly appointed saints include an Italian orphan who died of bone cancer aged 19 and a German nun. Thousands of pilgrims gathered to pay tribute to the new saints, including some 5,000 Salvadorans. Archbishop Romero and Pope Paul VI have been elevated to sainthood Archbishop Romero was beatified in May 2015 in a ceremony in El Salvador which drew huge crowds. For the faithful, his power came from the fact he criticised both sides of the El Salvadoran conflict, which started in 1980, for any actions that affected civilians. When the US-backed Salvadoran army was using death squads and torture to stop leftist revolutionaries from seizing power, he used what would become his last homily to speak out against it. Many in the region see him as the saint of central America ""The law of God which says thou shalt not kill must come before any human order to kill. It is high time you recovered your conscience,"" he said, calling on the National Guard and police to stop the violence. ""I implore you, I beg you, I order you in the name of God: Stop the repression."" The next day, on 24 March 1980, Archbishop Romero was shot dead as he celebrated Mass in a hospital chapel. Salvadorean priest 'a martyr' - Pope Murdered archbishop to be made a saint His death horrified the world and escalated the violence in El Salvador that spiralled into a 12-year civil war that claimed 75,000 lives. Many Salvadorans are still angry that 38 years later, Archbishop Romero's killers have never faced justice because of a 1992 amnesty law. He is still despised by some on the far right, who describe him as a ""guerrilla in a cassock"". Pope Paul VI brought about sweeping changes as part of Vatican II but opposed birth control Born Giovanni Battista Montini in the Lombardy region of Italy in 1897, Pope Paul VI was beatified in 2014. Elected pope in 1963, he continued the reforms of his predecessor, John XXIII, until his death in 1978. The reforms, brought in by the Second Vatican Council or Vatican II, changed the relationship between the Catholic faithful and priests. The unfinished business of Vatican II Mass, which had been celebrated in Latin, was translated into the language of the congregation and priests faced church goers instead of the altar. During his 15-year pontificate, Pope Paul VI wrote seven encyclicals. One of them, Humanae Vitae (Of Human Life), published in 1968, was highly controversial due to its opposition to birth control and led to protests around the Catholic world.

Training firm referred to policeThe Department for Education has referred the company to the police and 500 jobs are at risk.Derby,"Aspire Achieve Advance (3aaa) announced it had ceased trading on Thursday, wishing employers, apprentices and staff ""all the best"" A training provider has been referred to police after it announced it had ceased trading, with 500 jobs at risk. More than 3,000 Aspire Achieve Advance (3aaa) apprentices also face an unclear future after the firm's Department for Education (DfE) contract was axed. The department said it had referred its findings to police, through Action Fraud. 3aaa announced it had ceased trading on Thursday, wishing employers, apprentices and staff ""all the best"". Peter Marples, one of the founders of the Derby-based firm which offered courses in 34 academies across the country, stood aside from 3aaa last month, saying he wanted to spend more time on his health and his family. He has now also stepped down as director and chairman of the Spencer Academies Trust, which runs 18 schools in the East Midlands. Liam McClelland, 18, from Telford, was 13 months into an IT Level 4 apprenticeship with 3aaa. He was shocked when he learned via an email on Friday that the firm had gone under. ""It was all so sudden. I was in the academy last week and everything seemed fine,"" he said. ""I was only two months away from finishing my qualification. ""It's very frustrating, and I fear that the last year has been a waste of time and that all the work I have done is useless. ""The qualification would have given me an equivalent to a first year degree and allowed me to progress in the IT sector. ""There's been no support currently and I've heard nothing from the DfE. ""My main hope is that I can transfer the work I have done so far to another provider."" 3aaa said concerned apprentices, parents or employers could get in touch by email Announcing it had ceased trading on its website, 3aaa apologised ""for any inconvenience"" and said concerned apprentices, parents or employers could email them. A Department for Education spokeswoman confirmed it had terminated its contracts with 3aaa and said its priority was ""finding new training providers as quickly as possible for the affected learners"". She added: ""We have put a specialist team in place to identify new providers and help learners with as little disruption as possible. Following our investigation we have referred our findings to the police, through Action Fraud."" Derbyshire Constabulary said it had received a referral from Action Fraud in relation to 3aaa and ""inquiries were ongoing"". The BBC contacted 3aaa for comment, but has had no response. However, the directorstold the Derby Telegraph in a statement,externalthat the Education Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) told them they would no longer provide progress payments for learners, and added: ""This immediately removes the ability for the company to continue to operate.""

UK and US 'could boycott' Saudi conference,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Britain and the US are considering boycotting a major international conference in Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the BBC has learned. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, vanished on 2 October after visiting its consulate in Istanbul. The authorities in Istanbul believe he was murdered there by Saudi agents - claims Riyadh has dismissed as ""lies"". Donald Trump has said he will ""punish"" Saudi Arabia if it is responsible. Several sponsors and media groups have decided to pull out of this month's investment conference in Riyadh, dubbed Davos in the Desert, as a result of concerns over Mr Khashoggi's fate. Diplomatic sources have now told the BBC's James Landale both the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox might not attend the event, which is being hosted by the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to promote his reform agenda. A spokesman for the UK's international trade department said Dr Fox's diary was not yet finalised for the week of the conference. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists A joint statement of condemnation, if it is confirmed that Mr Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents, is also being discussed by US and European diplomats. However, Mr Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, has said words alone will not be good enough if he has been murdered. Hatice Cengiz: ""I have been waking up every morning hoping to hear from him"" ""If we have already lost Jamal, thencondemnation is not enough,"" she wrote in a piece for the New York Times,external. ""The people who took him from us, irrespective of their political positions, must be held accountable and punished to the full extent of the law."" She added that Saturday had been Jamal's birthday. ""When your loved one leaves this world, the other world no longer seemed scary or far away. It is being left here all alone, without them, that is most painful."" President Trump has said the US will inflict ""severe punishment"" on Saudi Arabia if the kingdom is found to be responsible for the death of Mr Khashoggi. He said he would be ""very upset and angry if that were the case"", but ruled out halting big military contracts. ""I think we'd be punishing ourselves if we did that,"" he said. ""If they don't buy it from us, they're going to buy it from Russia or... China."" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia was not yet co-operating with the investigation - despite a statement from Saudi Interior Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz saying his nation wanted to uncover ""the whole truth"". Mr Cavusoglu has urged the kingdom to allow Turkish officials to enter the consulate.
