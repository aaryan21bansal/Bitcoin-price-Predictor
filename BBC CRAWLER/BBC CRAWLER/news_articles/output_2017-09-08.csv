Girl lost on night out raped by gang,"(L-R) Shershah Muslimyar, Rafiullah Hamidy and Tamin Rahmani were jailed for 14 years each Three men and a boy raped a girl who had asked them for directions when she got lost on a night out with friends. The girl, 16, who cannot be named, was trying to get to a friend's house in Ramsgate, Kent, when she was attacked and then dumped on the street. They fulfilled their ""depraved sexual desires"" on the 16-year-old girl, Canterbury Crown Court heard. Three of the men were each jailed for 14 years each and a 17-year-old boy was jailed for seven years. The girl was found crying in the street by two people returning from a night out. Rafiullah Hamidy, 24, of High Street, Herne Bay, Shershah Muslimyar, 21, of Hovenden Close, Canterbury, Tamin Rahmani, 38, of Northwood Road, Ramsgate, and the 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all denied rape but were found guilty by a jury in May. Sentencing, Judge Heather Norton said the girl had been trying to make her way on foot back to a friend's house having missed the last train home, and was ""young, drunk, disorientated and vulnerable"". She said the girl thought the four were going to help her, but instead they ""took her up to a bedroom, pushed her on to a mattress and repeatedly raped her"" over a sustained period. Rafiullah Hamidy fled to Italy after raping the teenage girl Judge Norton said the girl had been clear that while she was being raped, others were in the room watching. Describing it as a prolonged attack in degrading circumstances, she told the defendants: ""This was an appalling and repeated gang rape of a vulnerable girl who had sought your assistance."" They attacked the girl at Rahmani's home in the early hours of 18 September 2016. He owns 555 Pizza and Kebab in Northwood Road, Ramsgate, and is in the UK under a spousal visa. Hamidy fled to Taranto in southern Italy after the attack where he was detained by local officers. He was returned to the UK following an extradition hearing and taken into custody at Heathrow Airport on 28 March. After the hearing, Det Insp Richard Vickery said the men ""saw an opportunity to fulfil their depraved sexual desires and betrayed the trust she placed in them in the worst possible way"".

May is 'hopeless and weak',"The Times highlights an attack on Theresa May,externalas ""hopeless and weak"" by Conservative party donor Lord Harris of Peckham. In an interview with the paper, Lord Harris says the prime minister's administration is mishandling Brexit and he would prefer a ""strong Labour government"" led by a figure such as Tony Blair. He also criticises Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as ""lazy"", and adds that Environment Secretary Michael Gove has ""no personality"". In its leading article,external, the Times complains of ""paralysis"" in Downing Street and describes Mrs May as a ""caretaker adrift"". Nevertheless, it urges her to stay on and face down factions in her own party who it says are exploiting her weakness in Parliament to pursue their own narrow interests. The prime minister's declaration of admiration for Geoffrey Boycott catches the attention of the Guardian, which points out that the famously obdurate cricketer was eventually sacked as Yorkshire captain amid an acrimonious dressing room revolt. It also notes that the team won nothing during Boycott's time in charge, and that he once scored so slowly during his brief spell as England captain that Ian Botham was sent on deliberately to get him run out. The Daily Telegraph attacks the UK's initial response to Hurricane Irma,externalas ""embarrassingly slow"" as the storm smashed through British territories in the Caribbean. It says those affected are British passport holders - no different to citizens of the Falklands or Gibraltar - and the UK should care for all of them. The Telegraph thinks the situation ""smacked of a government distracted"" by Brexit. The Daily Express agrees,externalthat ""we should be doing so much more"". It says the foreign aid budget could be saving lives in the Caribbean instead of being used on ""pointless development projects"". The Daily Mirror hails Saturday night's reopening,externalof the Manchester Arena as a triumph over terror and a ""new beginning"". It says the victims of the bombing in May must never be forgotten but nor should ""crazed jihadists"" be allowed to destroy our way of life. In the Mirror's view, the Manchester Arena, like the Bataclan in Paris, will become a symbol of defiance against what it calls ""miserable fanaticism"". According to the Daily Mail,external, ministers are considering plans to raise on-the-spot fines for littering from a maximum of Â£80 to Â£150. For those who pay late, the penalty could increase to Â£300. Councils have been pressing for the change and for the freedom to spend the proceeds as they wish - raising fears, says the Mail, that they will use litter patrols as cash cows.

Boy who backed out of shooting detained,"The boy told police he had suicidal thoughts at the time A boy who took a shotgun and 200 rounds of ammunition into school with the intention of harming others has been detained for six years. The 15-year-old had a change of heart and instead called 999 from Higham Lane School, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Warwick Crown Court heard the boy had been ""seconds away"" from opening fire. Judge Andrew Lockhart QC said: ""A moment in time separated the pupils and staff of this school from being the subject of a terrible event."" The court heard the teenager, who also took a balaclava into school, had depression, an anxiety disorder and felt a sense of hopelessness at the time of the incident, on 13 June. He cannot be named because of his age. A teacher sat with the boy until police arrived at the school A 999 call handler ""averted disaster"" by questioning the boy about his mental state and instructing him to dis-assemble the double-barrelled gun, and place it outside the room he was in. The court also heard how a teacher helped calm the situation down until the police arrived. The shotgun and ammunition - used by the boy and his father for clay pigeon shooting - were legally held and correctly stored, the Crown Prosecution Service said (CPS). Passing sentence, the judge told the teenager: ""In interview, you were frank and told the police that you took the gun to school that day intending to harm people. ""At that time you were in a room, angry to the point of being prepared to use serious and lethal force, armed with a loaded shotgun and 200 cartridges. ""Had you begun to shoot I have no doubt serious injury and death would have resulted and it is impossible for me to predict how many might have been hit."" He added that if the shooting had happened it would have ""taken a dreadful place in the history of truly wicked crimes committed in this country"". The boy's mother sobbed when he was sentenced The teenager pleaded guilty to having the gun with intent to endanger life, as well as possessing 200 rounds of ammunition with intent to endanger life, and possession of a lock-knife. Supt Martin Samuel, from Warwickshire Police, said: ""Our emergency call handlers are all trained to make quick decisions in high pressured situations. ""The call handler in this case immediately understood the severity of the situation and took immediate steps to ensure the safety of everyone concerned. He is a credit to the force."" Head teacher Phil Kelly said on Friday the school had reviewed its safety procedures since the incident.

NHS warns on social media during terror,"NHS staff and terror attack victims and their families have been warned about the risks of using social media in new guidelines issued by NHS England. The guide cautions that internet trolls may subject victims to ""vile and upsetting abuse"", as was seen after the Manchester and London terror attacks. It also warns people to be wary of journalists seeking accounts of events. The process of retelling a story can make people ""relive the worst parts"" of horrific events, it warns. People may say more than they intend to when ""vulnerable, upset or angry"", it adds. The NHS England guide also issues specific advice to younger people, cautioning: ""People will use your information for their own ends and when you're in the heat of the moment you may say more than you intend or later regret."" Regarding trolls, it tells teenagers: ""They can say things like you're only doing something for money or to abuse the system and so on. ""This is incredibly hurtful - which is what the sender intends - and it will upset you, or make you angry and that's never the best time to think about what you tell."" But the guidelines add that social media can also play a positive role in helping victims and families after attacks. It points out that coverage can help people by appealing for help, getting questions answered, or paying tribute to those who have been killed. 29 year-old Martyn Hett lost his life in the Manchester attack Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn died in the Manchester attack, said he was inundated by media attention. ""I had a couple of bad run-ins with people physically turning up at my house, my parents' house and my place of work,"" he told the BBC. ""It was incredibly inappropriate. We'd not even confirmed he'd died at this point, so everything was incredibly raw."" Mr Hett welcomes the guidelines: ""Overall I'm very much in favour of clear guidance being put in place for people, but to be honest I think some basic decency should really cover most of it."" The guide warns NHS staff against ""accidentally revealing something about the incident which is not already in the public domain."" It says: ""Often in terror incidents the receiving hospitals are not named in the media straight away, so don't post that you've had a busy shift dealing with victims, as this will confirm something which isn't already known."" It reminds staff to maintain patient confidentiality and cautions them against tweeting rumours. But Prof Chris Moran, NHS England's clinical lead for trauma, said social media helped doctors respond in the aftermath of the Manchester attack. ""Staff in Manchester were alerted quickly and got to their hospitals before a major incident was even declared,"" he said. ""This real-time reporting helped NHS staff anticipate injuries, numbers of casualties and what they would be dealing with."" He added: ""The flip side to the coin is that misinformation on social media spreads fast and can cause lots of problems, including increased anxiety for patients, families and staff."" This occurred following Manchester whenfake images and rumours circulated online.

Girl mutilated by rats in French home,"Rats may have been attracted to rubbish piled up in a nearby car park A disabled French girl covered in rat bites is critically ill in hospital after a pack swarmed into her bedroom in northern France. The 14-year-old paraplegic was sleeping on the ground floor when the attack happened, in a rented house in Roubaix. A medical expert quoted by France Info said the girl had 45 facial lesions, 150 on her hands and 30 on her feet. The girl's father is suing the landlord for alleged negligence. Reports say rubbish bins nearby were overflowing. The father, who has two other children, said he found his paraplegic daughter Samantha ""drenched in blood"" in her bed last Saturday. He said everything had been fine when the family had gone to bed. He was sleeping upstairs. ""There was blood coming from her ears - I was terrified that she might have had a brain haemorrhage,"" he said, quoted by thelocal newspaper Courrier-Picard.,external Some of her fingertips were bitten off and surgeons cannot repair them, he said. The family has now been moved to a different house and police are investigating the attack. The hospital has run checks on Samantha for possible infections, including rabies. The rabies test was negative. Such attacks on humans are rare, though hungry rats do sometimes feed on corpses.

Academies trust pulls out of 21 schools,"Wakefield City Academies Trust said the decision was in the ""best interests"" of pupils A trust which runs 21 schools has announced it is pulling out in the first week of the new term. Wakefield City Academies Trust (WCAT) said it was unable to ""facilitate the rapid improvement our academies need, and our students deserve"". The Department for Education (DfE) said many of theschools within the trust,externalwere performing below the national average. It said it would work with the trust until a new sponsor could be found. More on this and other local stories from across Yorkshire Only four of the schools are rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted. Eleven out of 14 primary schools and six of the seven secondary schools were performing below the national average in 2016. In a statement, the trust said it recognised the announcement would cause uncertainty but said the decision was in the ""best interests"" of the students. A DfE spokesperson said academies operate within a strict system of accountability, allowing swift action to ""deal with under-performance"". It said its priority was to ensure all children receive the best possible education. Regional commissioners are now working with the schools to identify new sponsors and ensure minimal disruption for pupils. Damian Walenta, from the National Education Union, said the news had come as no surprise and was largely down to a lack of accountability. ""Whilst the quality and values of academy chains vary greatly, we hear more and more bad news about poor academy chains,"" he said. In November,The Independent,externalnewspaper reported the trust had paid its then chief executive Â£82,000 for 15 weeks' work. An investigation into WCAT found it had been put in an ""extremely vulnerable position as a result of inadequate governance, leadership and overall financial management"".

Half of new retirement homes make a loss,"Ken says his children have lost out from his retirement property dropping in value Around half of new build retirement homes sold during a 10-year period were later re-sold at a loss, according to exclusive research for the BBC. The research by the Elderly Accommodation Counsel charity found falls in value could be more than 50%. It looked at thousands of Land Registry records for resale details of homes built between 1998 and 2012. The charity found many properties built after 2002 had underperformed the general property market. Adam Hillier of the Elderly Accommodation Counsel (EAC), which advises people considering retirement housing, called the scale of the falls ""startling"". According to the research, 51% of retirement properties built and sold between 2000 and 2010, and then sold again between 2006 and 2016, suffered a loss in value. For those properties which declined in value, the average loss was 17%. For some, the falls are much steeper. The EAC found that for new build retirement properties sold between 2005 and 2007, and then resold between 2012 and 2014, more than four fifths fell in value. The average loss for these properties was 25%. The Elderly Accommodation Counsel charity said the trend was ""startling"" Mr Hillier said it was unclear why it was happening. ""It's the million dollar question, really. ""I think part of it is the new build premium - especially when it comes to retirement housing,"" he said. Another reason could be under-investment from developers once they have built the properties, he said. ""The traditional model was to hand over these properties to a managing agent to run them,"" he said. ""Does the developer have that much of an interest in investing in the property?"" The trend has continued in recent years too. For new retirement properties sold between 2008 and 2010, and then resold between 2015 and 2017, nearly two thirds were sold for less than the purchase price. The average loss here was 19%. Money Box spoke to the residents of one development - Burlington Court, in Bridlington in East Yorkshire - where prices have more than halved since it was first built around a decade ago. According to Land Registry figures, one flat in Burlington Court, bought new in 2006 for Â£166,000, was resold for just Â£70,000 in 2014.  Another two bedroom apartment bought for Â£140,000, in 2008, was sold last year for Â£58,000. Ken, 91, bought his flat in Burlington Court for around Â£180,000 in 2008. ""I thought when I bought this that if I lived for another five or six years, my children would get maybe Â£190,000 for it,"" he said. ""In actual fact they'll be lucky to get Â£70,000 for it, maybe even Â£60,000. ""It's criminal really. When I mention it other people, they say: 'Why should you worry, you won't be here?' ""But I do feel my son and daughter have lost out. It's a lot of money,"" he added. The developer said Burlington Court was hit by a lack of parking and difficult local market Margarete, 92, paid nearly Â£150,000 for her flat eleven years ago. She sold a detached bungalow in York. Like most residents of Burlington Court, she says it's a nice place to live, with a nice community of people. But Margarete says she's always wanted to move back to Germany, where she was born. However the value of her property means that isn't now an option. ""My friends in Germany always wanted me to go back."" ""But if I get Â£40,000 for this flat I'd be lucky. I couldn't afford to go back to Germany and buy a place there."" The largest developer of retirement homes, McCarthy and Stone, told the BBC that the numbers did not include incentives given to the original buyers, which effectively lowers the purchase price. The company also said it had worked hard to increase resale values in recent years, including extending leases, retaining management of developments, and providing sales support. ""The vast majority of our retirement apartments increase in value on resale"", McCarthy and Stone told the BBC in a statement. ""It is also important to understand that the value of specialist retirement housing is not purely financial. It improves lives, provides peace of mind, care and support and ultimately helps older people maintain their independence. ""However, we recognise that there are a small number of cases, particularly with our older properties, where resale values of some apartments haven't performed as we would have wished.  This can be down to many reasons, including the performance of some local property markets."" McCarthy and Stone, which also built Burlington Court, said resale values in that particular development had been hit by a lack of car parking spaces and a difficult local property market. Sebastian O'Kelly, director of BetterRetirementHousing.com, said: ""Dismal resale prices for retirement properties help explain why only 2% of over-65s live in designated retirement properties - far less than the US or Australia. ""Something is seriously wrong with the business model that these flats fall so drastically in value. ""The retirement housing sector will not expand notably until this is addressed. That would be more effective than attempting to deny that the problem exists."" Listen to the full report on Money Box, midday on Saturday 9 September on BBC Radio 4.

My brotherâs killer is now my friend," There are already three women in the room when the Taylors arrive. Jim Taylor heads to the opposite corner from where the trio is seated. His grown-up daughter, Denise, follows him. The two groups eye each other uncomfortably. This is the room that you wait in before attending a parole board hearing where they decide whether a prisoner should be released. Neither the women nor the Taylors are used to seeing other people here, at the Correctional Training Facility in Soledad, California. They are unsure if they are there in opposition to each other. They don’t talk, but they listen. After a few minutes they realise that they are all victims of a crime, and that they are attending different parole hearings. One of the women turns to the Taylors, a look of relief on her face. “You’re not the enemy,” she says. “I’m not the enemy to anybody, not even the defendant,” Jim replies. The women look at each other. They weren’t expecting that. In their world, defendants are always the enemy and victims attend parole hearings for one reason – to make sure the enemy doesn’t get out. They try again. This time a different woman asks Jim how long he has been coming here. “Twelve years,” he says. He keeps talking. One day, he says, he hopes to visit the defendant outside prison. That is not what the women want for the defendant whose parole hearing they are there to attend. When a prosecutor informs them that their inmate’s parole will hopefully be denied, they nod in agreement. “Hopefully,” they say. Jim looks at his daughter, Denise. “Situation’s different,” he says. She is the reason they are there, Denise and her brother, Bo. But Bo is dead. Ronnie Fields, the man whose parole they are there to support, murdered him. He doesn’t look at them. He is dressed in what look like blue hospital scrubs. He has a beard and black glasses: Ronald Fields, inmate D00742. The Taylors call him Ronnie. Rules dictate that Fields should not look at the Taylors unless given permission to do so. The Taylors have left the waiting room and are now across the hall in Conference Room Two. The prosecuting attorney doesn’t talk to the Taylors and he doesn’t make room for them next to him at the table. They find seats against the wall with the victim’s advocate, a large woman with an abundance of purple hair. Fields sits at the table, next to his state-appointed attorney, DeJon Ramone Lewis, the same lawyer who represented Charles Manson at Manson’s parole hearing in 2012. It is just after 08:30 in the morning on 6 December 2016 when commissioner Jack Garner begins introductions. He warns the Taylors that the documents he will be reading from may be graphic and difficult for them to hear. They know. They have heard the story before. It starts on a September afternoon in 1984 with Bo and a friend trying to buy marijuana in Compton, a city in Los Angeles County synonymous with gang violence. It ends with Bo being shot. There are more details in the court documents: the location of the liquor store where Bo and his friend found Fields’s friend smoking a joint, the different places Fields took them to purchase pot, the type of car Fields was driving, the name of the street Bo was killed on. The only detail that really matters though is that after deciding to take Bo’s money without handing over the drugs, Fields took a home-made gun from his car. He told Bo and Bo’s friend to run. Bo, confused, asked: “What?” There was a single shot. It struck Bo in the heart. Fields was sentenced to a minimum of 27 years. Thirty-two years later Bo’s father makes his way to one of the room’s many microphones. He is here to voice his support for Field’s release, something only about 1% of victims’ families do, according to commissioner Garner. Jim shuffles the way old men do, stumbling slightly. He is 78 now, with white hair and a bit of a belly. He has a tendency to ramble. It doesn’t take long for him to deviate from the statement his daughter helped him prepare. He mentions Fields’s father and then how much Fields has changed over the years. “I don’t know how he could show any more remorse than he has,” Jim says, his voice cracking. “Certainly, I’m satisfied.” Denise hands her father a tissue. Then she replaces him at the table and reads her own statement. She is 54 and has lived most of her life without her brother, her only full biological sibling. Her father removes his glasses and wipes his eyes. Denise stops for a minute, unable to continue. Then starts again: Having to come back to these parole hearings year after year only causes more pain to me and my family.” “I realise that Mr Fields’s crime is considered to be against the state, but we are the ones who live the day-to-day reality of the loss of my brother, Bo. And also the continued imprisonment of the man responsible for his death, a sentence that we no longer support.” Denise makes her way back to her seat. Jim puts his arm around his daughter’s shoulders. He pats her back. She says: I get more emotional each time. I never cried in the first hearing.” Fields’s gaze remains fixed straight ahead, his face a mask. The Taylors have left the waiting room and are now across the hall in Conference Room Two.

Busy intersection in Compton, Los Angeles, 1985 (Los Angeles Public Library) It was the year they were supposed to become friends. That is what Denise hoped. It was 1984 and she was back home in Manhattan Beach, outside Los Angeles, a 22-year-old college graduate. She was going to work and apply to medical school while living at home. She would have time on her hands, time she wanted to use to get to know her little brother better. Bo was an adult now, 19. Denise thought if she made the effort they could be friends, just like her father and his sister were. As children, Denise and Bo had never really got along. Denise was the “good kid”. She did well in school, stayed out of trouble and listened to her parents. Back when they had a shared bedroom, her side was always neat and orderly. Bo’s side was pure chaos. His report cards were never good. He was always finding ways to get out of class, getting in trouble. He was like that even before their parents divorced, but Denise thinks the divorce made things worse. It happened when she was about 13 and it split the siblings apart, Bo went with their father and Denise went with their mother. Denise felt lucky. She remembers her father as angry. Jim admits he has had to work to become the person he is today, hinting at earlier struggles. He completed a 12-step addiction programme before he got what he describes as a second chance at life. He comes from a very conservative religious background. He remembers thinking people in his church, the Church of Christ, were good, but outsiders – Pentecostals, Baptists – were bad. It was a narrow tunnel vision it took him years to shed, one that his children followed when they were young. Denise told her grade school friends that she wished they would go to church because she was sad they were going to go to hell. Although he has softened over the years and discarded some of his earlier hard-line viewpoints, Jim still teases Denise for being too liberal. He questions whether Bo would have changed, whether Bo would have used the potential he believes he wasted: I always wondered what Bo would be. He was a troubled child. But I’ve seen others turn their lives around.” No-one seems to remember whether Bo graduated from high school. Denise recalls him being into gardening. Both she and her father remember him hanging out at the beach, his hair blond and tousled, his chest bare, just like it was the day he was shot. It was the year they were supposed to become friends.

Manhattan beach, Los Angeles He had been at the beach that day. Two African-American girls asked him and his friend for a ride home. That is how Bo, a white boy from an upper-middle-class suburban enclave, ended up in Compton in the 1980s, a time when the crack epidemic was destroying inner cities. Bo wasn’t from that world, but he didn’t think anything of asking two young African-American men where he could get some pot. He had dropped the girls off by then and was parked outside a liquor store in a neighbourhood where he didn’t belong. At first, Fields thought Bo and his friend were cops. Then, after he figured out they were just clueless kids, he decided to rip them off, by taking their money without delivering the pot. Denise was coaching soccer that day. It was a Saturday and her team had a game the next day. She was at her mother’s house when one of Bo’s friends came by and told them that Bo had been shot. When they arrived at the hospital a doctor pulled them aside: We tried to revive him, tried to sew the hole up in his heart. We couldn’t revive him. I’m sorry to tell you, he’s dead.” That’s what Denise remembers the doctor saying. But it didn’t sink in. Stuff like that didn’t happen where they were from. Denise was sobbing when she called her father. Jim couldn’t understand what she was telling him. It sounded like she was saying Bo was dead. “But it didn’t make sense,” says Jim. “I mean my son doesn’t die - my son didn’t get killed.” When he finally understood, Jim imagined a motorcycle accident. Bo had a friend who had been killed in a biking accident not long before. But Bo had been murdered. Jim went to every legal proceeding: the preliminary hearing, the trial, the sentencing. He took detailed notes. He wanted the death penalty for Fields. He fantasised about bringing a gun to court and shooting the man who killed his only son. Years later, after the terror attacks of 11 September 2001, he started referring to his son’s murder as his personal September 11th. Denise went to the first day of the trial. She didn’t attend the sentencing, but she telephoned in and said she wanted Fields to be sentenced to life without parole. She became scared of black people. When an elderly African-American couple stopped her to ask for directions she wondered if they wanted to hurt her: There was just the sense that you don’t know what’s coming - it could come from anywhere.” She cried through one medical school interview, aced another by mentioning her brother’s murder when asked to talk about trauma. When she graduated from medical school there was no picture of her with her brother like the one taken at her college graduation. He wasn’t there at her wedding or when she had her first and then her second child. But she never forgot him. She mentioned him on the order of service for her wedding and named her first son Jonathan, after him. Jonathan was Bo’s real name but Jim used to call his son “Boy” and as a toddler Denise copied him. It was because her “boy” came out as “bo” that her brother became Bo.

Over the years Denise had forgotten Fields’s name. But in a strange twist, she had ended up working with men just like him. As a young doctor, she had to work places senior staff didn’t want to go. One of those places was the county jail. Denise didn’t mind. Her new patients were often some of the same people she had treated at the county hospital. In 1997 she took a job at the California Men’s Colony in San Luis Obispo County, a medium-security men’s prison located halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Unlike the men at the jail, those she now treated were there for the long haul. She began to get to know them. Once she knew them a bit, she asked what they were in for. Many of them said murder. They would tell her their stories. She realised they had been in prison for about the same length of time Fields had. Fields, she thought, might, in fact, be like these guys, probably was like them, and she liked these guys. They were “nice people who made mistakes”. She didn’t believe they were evil, at least not the select group of men she worked with at the prison hospice she helped found. She wanted to know if really, Fields was like them. She had forgiven him, but she wanted to hear him say he was sorry. She didn’t want to make him feel bad, but she wanted her pain acknowledged. She wanted him to understand what he had taken from her and her family. She asked the men she worked with at the hospice, lifers, what they thought of her plan to contact Fields. The lifers told her they would give anything to be able to say sorry to their victims’ families. They told her how hard it was to attend parole hearings, see the families suffering and know they were the cause of that suffering. In 2005 Denise wrote to Fields and asked if she could visit him. Denise reads Ronnie's letter: Fields’s reply came back immediately in neat handwriting on lined yellow paper. “Miss Taylor, believe me when I tell you this: no matter what you or your family think of me, I live every day of my life with the fact that I took a life. I regret that it happened and I’m deeply sorry for bringing so much pain and discomfort into your lives. Miss Taylor, you made a request to visit me and I am ashamed to see you though I owe your family as much so therefore I will honor your request to visit.” Denise was familiar with prisons, but this was different. At the Correctional Training Facility in Soledad, California, instead of showing her prison identification and breezing through, she had to queue and then wait in a cafeteria-like space with walls painted a ghastly institutional yellow-grey.

She didn’t believe they were evil, at least not the select group of men she worked with at the prison hospice she helped found. Denise reads Ronnie's letter: She wanted to know if really, Fields was like them. She had forgiven him, but she wanted to hear him say he was sorry. She didn’t want to make him feel bad, but she wanted her pain acknowledged. She wanted him to understand what he had taken from her and her family. She asked the men she worked with at the hospice, lifers, what they thought of her plan to contact Fields. The lifers told her they would give anything to be able to say sorry to their victims’ families. They told her how hard it was to attend parole hearings, see the families suffering and know they were the cause of that suffering. In 2005 Denise wrote to Fields and asked if she could visit him. Fields’s reply came back immediately in neat handwriting on lined yellow paper. “Miss Taylor, believe me when I tell you this: no matter what you or your family think of me, I live every day of my life with the fact that I took a life. I regret that it happened and I’m deeply sorry for bringing so much pain and discomfort into your lives. Miss Taylor, you made a request to visit me and I am ashamed to see you though I owe your family as much so therefore I will honor your request to visit.” Denise was familiar with prisons, but this was different. At the Correctional Training Facility in Soledad, California, instead of showing her prison identification and breezing through, she had to queue and then wait in a cafeteria-like space with walls painted a ghastly institutional yellow-grey. It has been 21 years since Fields murdered her brother. She is told Fields will enter through a door at the opposite end from which she entered. She keeps an eye on the door. She doesn’t even know what Fields looks like. She watches every black inmate who enters, her eyes following them until they inevitably head to a table that is not hers. Then a tall man with a slight Afro haircut walks toward her. Taylor stands up. “Hi, I’m Denise,” she says, extending her hand.His grip is firm, but not crushing. “I’m Ronnie.”They sit down. He is the first to speak: Can I tell you what happened that horrible day?” She has to lean in close to hear him. The room is a concrete box off which all the various conversations around them bounce. Every once in a while a guard calls out: “OK, that hug’s long enough,” or “Hands above the table.” Fields doesn’t meet her eyes. He was 24 when he killed Bo. He came from a good family, but he followed his older brothers into a gang. He had gang tattoos, but was never convicted of a gang-related crime. He dropped out of school in 11th grade when his girlfriend got pregnant. He worked at a car wash, at a used car dealership.His record was relatively clean, aside from a juvenile charge of taking another kid’s bag. Then he shot Bo. He describes the shooting the same way Taylor has heard it told many times before. He says: I’m sorry for what I took from you. I’m sorry I’ve caused you this pain.” Taylor takes out the pictures she brought to show him: photos of her husband and sons. She tells Fields about how her children will never know their uncle, how her husband will never know his brother-in-law. Fields, in turn, tells her about his family: his dead parents, his two brothers behind bars. She is the first visitor he has had in a decade. After two hours Taylor thanks him for letting her visit and gives him a short hug. He doesn’t resist. He walks her to the gate. She tells him she will come again. And she does.The next time she visits she brings her father. It is the first of almost half a dozen parole hearings they attend. Some family members feel they have to rally against the murderer, demand his or her death in order to honour their lost loved one, says Denise. Society encourages this. Denise does not. Still, she does wonder whether she is betraying her brother. People ask her what Bo would think. She tells them she honestly doesn’t know. When she told her parents about her first visit to Fields, her mother was OK with it, but expressed no desire to meet him. Her father was another story. Denise feared he would be angry, but he surprised her by being curious. He wanted to know what had happened, why this terrible event had occurred. Jim wrote to Fields about his Christian faith and his religious belief in redemption. Still, the first time he saw Fields, the emotion that flooded him was anger. But it wasn’t anger at Fields. It was anger at the parole board. For Fields, Jim felt compassion. He also felt nostalgia for what he had lost. Now that he knew Fields, he was convinced that Fields had not intended to kill his son. It was just a terrible tragedy. Jim says: I think maybe 10-15, possibly 20 years, that was justice for Bo, He’s not going to come back. So now the justice I got to worry about is justice for Ronnie. And I don’t think a life sentence is just for him.” It has been 21 years since Fields murdered her brother. She is told Fields will enter through a door at the opposite end from which she entered.

And I don’t think a life sentence is just for him.” In the beginning, Denise wrote letters almost every month. Eleven years later, she corresponds less often, but she rarely misses a parole hearing. She takes a day off work and drives the hour-and-a-half each way with her father. Each time they have attended a hearing, Fields has been denied parole. Jim wants Fields to be released while he is still young enough to enjoy freedom. Fields is 56 now, two years older than Denise. He was first eligible for parole in 2001. It is now the end of 2016. It is almost 11:00 when commissioner Garner announces the decision. He has gone over Fields’s upbringing, his crime and his recovery. He notes that Fields had his gang tattoos removed soon after he arrived in prison and that he has kept his distance from gang members while incarcerated. Now he goes over Fields’s sentence once again. He talks about the rules for parole and legal standards. Denise picks at her cuticles. Fields remains expressionless. Garner continues, “Having these legal standards in mind, we find that you do not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society or a threat to public safety and are therefore eligible for parole.” Garner keeps talking, explaining the number of days Fields has to remain in prison while the Governor decides whether to approve or deny his parole, the risks Fields still faces, the challenges ahead. Fields removes his glasses and brings a tissue to his face. Ronnie expresses regret in this letter For the first time today he loses his composure. Jim has also removed his glasses and uses the tissue his daughter gives him to cover his face. Deputy commissioner John Denvir continues where Garner left off: What I personally thought was your strongest area was remorse.” He continues, “and I think that’s partially because Mr Taylor’s family has, you know, become – and you described them as friends or at least have made themselves available to get to know you.” Denise keeps the tissue box between her and her father. The commissioners finally stop talking. Fields is taken back to his cell and the Taylors head home. As they walk to the parking lot Jim turns to his daughter: I feel like I’ve done something good for once in my life.” A prison van drops Fields off at the Salinas train station. It is 16 April 2017 and he is out of prison after 32 years, six months and 11 days. I’m free, I’m finally free I get to sleep somewhere else tonight instead of being in a cage.” He smiles. It is something he couldn’t do in prison. Inside he had always to maintain his “mean face”. He smiles again thinking about the first meal he wants to eat: a double cheeseburger, large fries and vanilla milkshake from the fast food chain, Carl’s Jr. Ronnie reacts to being released from prison: He has been warned that his body may not be ready for real meat after decades of processed meat. He worries slightly about the long bus ride to Los Angeles - and the risk of getting sick or dizzy - because it has been so long since he has been on a trip. He has heard Los Angeles has been “rebuilt” and isn’t as gang-riddled as he remembers. He was 24 when he got locked up. Now he takes medication for high blood pressure. All he has in the world is a debit card with $978.33 on it and a plastic tub filled with personal items. The money comes from three decades spent making furniture in the prison for 30 and later 80 cents an hour. The tub contains a portable CD player and CDs: The Intruders, BWB and David Ruffin. There is also a chess set, photo albums, a very small television and a leather-bound Bible. The Bible is from Jim Taylor. It is the Taylors that Fields credits with his freedom. I could still be in that prison right now probably for the rest of my life had they chose to oppose my parole and fight to keep me in here as hard as they fought to get me out. I’d probably die in that prison.” He isn’t sure if he could have done the same if the roles were reversed. When Denise Taylor first came to visit, he says his supervisors warned him not to meet her. They told him it would just upset him. He knew that, he knew she might try to hit him or yell at him. He decided he wouldn’t fight back if she did. He felt he owed her at least that much. But she was pleasant and after that first visit she kept coming back. In time it became clear she and her father weren’t visiting him because they hated him but because they cared about him. It just made me feel more human, less lost and more civilized, how these people were looking at me.” Ronnie with his grandson For years they were his only visitors. His grandmother died while he was at Folsom State Prison, one of the five prisons where he served time. His father died in 1993, his mother in 1994. His sister is dead. He has lost track of his brothers, all of whom have also spent time behind bars. He has two sons and a stepson. He has never seen his seven grandchildren or two great-grandchildren except in photos. On his prison paperwork Denise is listed under next of kin. He sent her his guitar years ago, along with the clothes he planned to wear when he got paroled. When he learned he was finally getting out he called her and asked her to send him the jeans he is now wearing. Jim offered to let Fields live with him, Denise promised to take him shopping for clothes. He appreciates everything they have done, but sometimes it is hard to be with them. We try to have the best time. But it’s always in me, that guilt is always in me that I took their loved one away from them.” Fields doesn’t blame the parole board for denying him parole so many times. “I’m a killer,” he says. “They ain’t changed. I have.” When he went in he might have taken what wasn’t his, but now he says he wants to work for his money. He hopes to get a job operating machines used to make furniture, the same job he performed in prison. He plans to sign up for government assistance for housing, food and healthcare. But his immediate concern is how he will get from the bus stop to the transitional home where he will be living when he lands in Los Angeles later tonight. A fellow bus passenger offers him her mobile phone so he can call someone to ask for a ride. He looks at the phone. “How do you use this?” He doesn’t know how to dial or how to hold it. Finally he punches in his son’s number. “Hi,” he says. “It’s your daddy.” Fields meets his granddaughter, for the first time later that night. She is already a young woman. There are other grandchildren, many of them also already grown. Ronnie with his granddaughter Three cars filled with relatives are there to greet him when he arrives in Los Angeles around 10pm. A young man jumps out of one of the cars: “Grandpa, I got a 9mm (handgun) and a .45 (pistol) in the car”. “Which car are you riding in?” Fields asks. He wants to make sure he isn’t in it. That’s how he remembers the conversation. He is on parole for life. Twice a month he has to check in with his parole officer. He has to pee in two separate cups: one to test if he has been drinking, the other to test if he has been smoking marijuana. Ronnie with his two sons He calls Denise Taylor almost as soon as he is out. They “friend” each other on Facebook and make plans to meet. Then Fields’s parole officer steps in and says Taylor needs to fill out paperwork before being allowed to communicate with Fields. In July, permission is given and Taylor makes plans to visit. Fields cancels. They reschedule. A week or so before the meeting, Fields calls and insists the meeting was for a different date and his weekend plans have now been ruined. His impatience is no surprise to the Rev Camira “CC” Carter, house manager of the transitional home where Fields lives. At The Martin Home, most of the 15 male residents are lifers, men who have spent 20 or 30 years in prison. The challenge I think they face is they want everything quickly. They just want to get so much done, they’ve lost so much time.” Ronnie and family When Fields arrived at The Martin Home he was very quiet, Carter says. He kept to himself. Three months later he still stays out of things, especially conflicts, but he is opening up a bit more. A few weeks ago he got a job packing macadamia nuts. He gets up at 03:45 in the morning in order to catch a bus to get him to work by 06:00. He attends all the home’s programmes and meetings and steps up when he sees something needs to be done. Carter believes his relationship with the Taylors has helped Fields stay focused. “I think it motivates him to say, ‘I'm going to be the best person I can be for as long as I can. Look what I did, and these people have shown me love and mercy,’ and I think that drives him,” she says. It is a Sunday morning in late July and Carter and Fields are at church in Los Angeles. Fields is seated on the aisle in the back row. He has a mobile phone now and glances at it during slow moments in the service. Ronnie at church On his home screen is a photo of him and a number of children, some of them his great grandchildren. While he was in prison he didn’t see any family after his mother died in 1994, but now that he is out they are back in his life. He is even dating Mae again, the mother of his oldest son. When he leaves The Martin Home in another few months he plans to move near Mae and two of his sons. The third son lives in another state. He was a baby when Fields was locked up and calls Fields by his first name “Ronnie” instead of “Dad”. Fields is upset that this son didn’t acknowledge him on his birthday or Father’s Day. So he has cut him off. There it is again, the impatience, the anger. Taylor notices it after the service when she is driving Fields in her boxy Toyota Scion with its Obama sticker on the windshield and rainbow flag on the dashboard. Fields talks about cars and how much he needs one right away so he can stop spending so much of his time on the bus. Taylor counsels patience, sounding a lot like an older sister. Fields asks after her dad. Then he answers his mobile phone. he says to the person on the other line: We in Compton, we going to the crime scene.” It is a place Taylor has never been. After her brother was killed she used to pass the freeway exit that Bo had taken and think, “That’s where it happened.” Coming here with Fields feels like coming full circle. It is the first time Fields has been back. A lot has changed in the more than three decades he has been away from this city of about 100,000 in Los Angeles County. There is a new freeway, different shops. Source: Los Angeles Times The violent Compton of the 1980s – when the number of murders doubled between 1984 and 1989, reaching 84 homicides in 1989, according to the Los Angeles Times – seems long gone. In 2011 the LA County Sherriff’s Department recorded only 17 homicides in Compton. But they climbed again in 2013 and again in 2016, when they reached 33, according to Los Angeles Times statistics. Not long after pointing out the liquor store where he met Bo, Fields notes a street blocked off by several police cars: “Ain’t nothing changed out here.” In Compton, says Fields, a lot of people don’t forgive. Some of his friends think he is a fool for getting in a car with Taylor and going to the site where it all happened, a spot that happens to be in rival gang territory - that is how Fields thought of this area back then and it is still how he thinks of it today. Even though the apartment block the shooting happened outside of has been replaced by a local government building and he no longer belongs to a gang. He checks his phone. His girlfriend, Mae, sent him a text: Baby be careful. Make sure she don’t have a weapon on her…” They park and walk to the street corner where it happened. Taylor brings photos of Bo. Over the years the memories have faded, but being here brings them back, makes her brother feel real for her, as if he is alive again. She tears up and turns away from Fields, who remains stiff and guarded. He watches the cars driving by, always on the lookout. He doesn’t feel safe here. He remembers how often people he knew used to get shot. It was normal in his world. To some extent, it still is. He mentions family members from the younger generation who are in trouble with the law, who carry weapons. His two brothers are on drugs: meth and crack. Ronnie and Denise at the crime scene: Taylor always knew their lives were different, but before standing on that street corner she hadn’t realised quite how different they were.They leave the site and get lunch, waffles with fried chicken. Taylor pays. As she drives Fields home it is clear to both of them Fields can’t be the replacement brother he once promised to be, mowing her lawn and helping around her house. As her car approaches The Martin Home, Taylor’s phone announces: “Arrived at Ronnie Fields’s home.” They both laugh. Taylor isn’t sure if they will stay in touch. She notices every time Fields recounts the story of the murder he adds a few embellishments, taking a little less responsibility. She says: He is sorry though. I don’t believe he is going to do it again.” Then she turns away from the two-storey home with barred windows on Crenshaw Boulevard and drives out of south-west Los Angeles.

Why more women are getting into shooting,"The Shotgun & Chelsea Bun Club describes itself as the UK's largest ladies' shooting community It has traditionally been seen as a man's game, enjoyed by country types wearing flat caps and tweed. But the number of women taking up shooting - particularly clay pigeon shooting - is on the rise. Why? Growing up in Berkshire, Danielle Brown's only experience of the countryside was ""seeing it on the television"". ""I was a right town girl,"" she said. ""Went to a comprehensive, mum on her own, didn't have much money, never thought about country pursuits."" Danielle Brown got into shooting after moving to the countryside It was when she moved to Herefordshire with her husband that she was introduced to shooting by a neighbour. After a bit of investigating she came across the Shotgun & Chelsea Bun Club - a group holding events specifically for women - and she was hooked. ""I just loved it, that feeling when you shoot a clay, a moving target in the sky. I wanted to do it again."" The club is one of a number of groups attracting an increasing number of women to shoot, and building a new image for the sport. This video can not be played Shooting: Not just a sport for men Gone are the days of shooting being just a pursuit for country folk; members are now as likely to be students and shop assistants as they are bankers and lawyers. And numbers of female shooters are rising. Figures show the number of women joining theBritish Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) each year has risen a third over the past four years,external. The association welcomed 1,212 women in 2011, compared with 1,603 in 2015, and now has almost 10,000 female members. Femmes Fatales aims to ""challenge the misconception that shooting is a man's game"". Participants are more likely to don sportswear than reflect the ""Downton Abbey and farmers in tweed look"", says founder Lydia Abdelaoui. Rachel Carrie, left and Lydia Abdelaoui, right, who founded Femmes Fatales Miss Abdelaoui, 33, works in the shooting industry for an ammunition manufacturer, but only took up the sport three years ago. ""It never really appealed to me that much until I went with a group of women,"" she said. ""I had been before, but it was just a bit dull, I find men are really competitive. We had such a laugh and got to talk about doing things to attract more women and that's where the idea of Femmes Fatales came about."" The group started out on social media and has built up a ""community"" of about 7,000 women. ""It's not farmers and the gentry, it's just normal people from all different backgrounds who are just serious about the sport,"" says Miss Abdelaoui. ""We try to get away from the misconception that people have about shooters and to make it a bit more feminine and up to date. ""I had a Twitter exchange with a guy and he called us 'privileged women' and he suggested that women that shoot are all 'ladies that lunch' that don't have jobs - nothing could be further from the truth. Everybody works hard and we shoot at weekends."" Shotgun & Chelsea Bun Club members enjoy tea and cake after a day of shooting At the Shotgun & Chelsea Bun Club, women meet for shooting followed by tea and cake. It was founded by Victoria Knowles-Lacks who, while learning to shoot with her uncle, saw there was a ""major lack"" of women shooting. ""I'd see wives and daughters being dragged round clay grounds press buttons on clay traps for their husbands and I just thought the shooting industry is missing a trick,"" said the 33-year-old from Shropshire. When Mrs Knowles-Lacks took four female friends who ""weren't overly keen"" to a group shooting lesson, she baked a cake to ""soften"" the day. And the winning combination of clays and cake was born. ""We shot in a small group under instruction, then we had tea and cake. The format has stayed the same since that very first day. ""I've made it my mission to make it really easy, affordable and to showcase how social and how much fun shooting is,"" she added. Women enjoy shooting and the social side of the sport at the Shotgun & Chelsea Bun Club It is the social side of the club that Mrs Brown, 38, says has ""transformed"" her life. ""I don't have children so I didn't have any natural way of making my own friends, I didn't have any hobbies but all of a sudden I went to those clubs and met these lovely ladies."" The financial controller now practises once or twice a week and competes a couple of times a month. While she admits her hobby is expensive, she says there are many routes into it, such as hen parties, and it's not just for the well off - she herself makes sacrifices to fund her passion. ""I don't go clothes shopping any more, I buy shotgun cartridges instead."" The profile of the sport is giving women shooters ""visibility"" for the first time, added Mrs Knowles-Lacks. ""When we started the club back in 2011 there was literally nothing for female shooters. You'd see a few ladies at clay shoots or in the kitchen on game shoots, but there weren't really any opportunities. ""It's definitely reaching people who wouldn't really have considered trying the sport before."" Breakfast's Holly has a go at shooting.

The Rohingya crisis: Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act?,"She was the perfect symbol of democracy. Highly intelligent, well-read, articulate and photogenic. Set against this, the thuggish Burmese generals could never hope to capture the good opinion of the international media. Not that they ever cared to try. Those of us who worked undercover in Myanmar remember a constant struggle to stay out of the way of the secret policemen and spies. We were despised by the junta and feted by the pro-democracy movement. When I first encountered Aung San Suu Kyi shortly after her first release from house arrest in July 1995, she was - after Nelson Mandela - the most important global symbol of defiance against tyranny. The world's media related how she had faced down soldiers with their rifles levelled in her direction. Her fight for democracy in Myanmar was backed around the world The UN and others demanded her release from house arrest and worked hard to achieve that goal. We listened to her address supporters at the gates of her lakeside villa about the need for tolerance and discipline. In her interviews with me back in the 1990s, she repeatedly stressed the need for non-violence. She was always keen to know how the African National Congress had managed the transition to majority rule in South Africa, my previous posting. The phrase ""freedom from fear"" was repeated, and became the title of a bestselling book. Aung San Suu Kyi, swarmed by supporters on her release from house arrest in 2002 It was language which Western journalists (including myself), were eager to hear. Many who found their way to Myanmar in those days were veterans of recent tragedies in Rwanda and the Balkans. After witnessing genocide and ethnic cleansing, we were inspired by the words of the lady by the lake. Here was a peacemaker in a world made dark by the actions of Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, and the Hutu power extremists of Rwanda. In retrospect, we knew too little of Myanmar and its complex narratives of ethnic rivalries, deepened by poverty and manipulated over decades by military rulers. And we knew too little of Aung San Suu Kyi herself. Malala has called on her fellow Nobel peace laureate to intervene We did not calculate that the stubbornness which refused to concede to the military junta might, if she came to power, prove equally forceful when confronted with foreign criticism. Her greatest strength in adversity could prove a defining weakness. Old friends in the international human rights movement and some previously sympathetic politicians have become strongly critical. Malala calls for defence of Rohingya Anybody who has spent time in her company knows that shifting her mind when she is set on a course of action is extremely difficult. This video can not be played Aung San Suu Kyi talking to Fergal Keane in April 2017 Last December, when Vijay Nambiar, the UN Special Representative to Myanmar, urged Aung San Suu Kyi to visit Rakhine state, he was rebuffed. As one member of her inner circle put it to me: ""She will never ever be seen to do what Nambiar tells her to do."" Nor will she ever concede that the Rohingya Muslims are being subjected to ethnic cleansing, not even when tens of thousands are being burned from their homes amid widespread reports of killing and sexual violence. What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? Rohingya Muslims: What has Aung San Suu Kyi said? Rohingya crisis: Suu Kyi says 'fake news helping terrorists' Myanmar's Rohingya: Truth, lies and Aung San Suu Kyi This is not the first time she has faced criticism over the Rohingya. It was the same story five years ago during a campaign that displaced more than 100,000 Rohingya. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? Daw Suu, as she is known, did not visit the area or speak out in defence of the persecuted minority. While her government has moved to tackle hate speech by Buddhist extremists, she has not made the kind of public gestures in support of Muslims made by her hero Mahatma Gandhi and his colleague Jawaharlal Nehru during the violence of India's partition. Gandhi paid with his life and the leaders did not succeed in ending the slaughter. But both men laid down a marker about the values of the India they wished to see emerge from partition. Jawaharlal Nehru (L) and Mahatma Gandhi publicly condemned violence against Muslims during India's partition The memory of Nehru wading into Hindu mobs to prevent sectarian violence is one of the 20th Century's defining acts of personal courage. Nobody expects this of Aung San Suu Kyi, but it is the absence of even rhetorical intervention that disturbs many former supporters. The suffering of the Rohingya is a tragedy in itself. But the palls of smoke from Rakhine state is indicative of a military that feels it can carry on in the old brutal way, whatever the world says. Tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state The action unleashed now against the Rohingya will be familiar to the residents of other ethnic areas in Myanmar such as Shan state, or in the war against the Karen. Aung San Suu Kyi does not control the military and they do not trust her. But her refusal to condemn well-documented military abuses provides the generals with political cover. It goes further than silence. Her diplomats are working with Russia and the UN to prevent criticism of the government at Security Council level, andshe herself has characterised the latest violence as a problem of terrorism. Stubbornness in the face of what she feels is unfounded criticism is part of the equation. But there is a more troubling question: is her long-declared commitment to universal human rights partial, a concern that does not and never will embrace the beleaguered Rohingya Muslims in this Buddhist majority country? She may yet answer that question by pressing the military to end its brutal crackdown. At this moment there is little sign of that happening.

Is Germany's migrant crisis over?,"This video can not be played Asylum applicant Khaled Kohestani at work in Oberhausen ""Oberhausen is my home now,"" says Khaled Kohestani. ""A lot of things have happened since I arrived here two years ago."" Khaled, 24, first spoke to the BBC16 months ago. Everything in Germany was new to him. He was scared of getting on the bus. ""Everybody is so quiet, no one speaks or say hello, I'm scared of doing something illegal, we don't know the rules and we can't speak to anyone."" Khaled lived in a refugee centre for three months but now has accommodation and a job Khaled is not scared anymore. We meet him in a metal workshop, where he's grinding and polishing iron doors and garden tables, sending sparks flying. ""Things are much easier today, mainly because I speak German now, nothing really is a problem because I understand what people say."" Khaled is an exception. Out of the 1,902 asylum seekers living in Oberhausen, North Rhine-Westphalia, only 42 are, like him, employed or doing an apprenticeship. But that is no guarantee that he'll be allowed to stay. In January this year, his asylum application was rejected by the German authorities. Khaled and his lawyer have appealed against the decision but Afghanistan is considered a safe country and Khaled and his family could be deported if the appeal is rejected. Two years on from the big influx of migrants and refugees into Germany, things have calmed down and reception centres are operating below their full capacity. A man in his forties selling curry-wurst for a couple of euros in a small food market on the edge of Oberhausen says when the migrants started coming to Germany there was a lot of noise about what might happen. But for him the city has not really changed in that time, and it does not feel as if there are more foreigners than before. Oberhausen and the migrant crisis Changing attitudes of a German city Can a Syrian cafe hold the key to the German migrant crisis? How one German city is coping with refugees Chief police inspector Tom Litges says initially the city's reception centres were overcrowded and it was not unusual to be called out to break up fights among the migrants. But things are calmer these days. ""The small protests against migrants and refugees have also have stopped. They used to be massively outnumbered by pro-migrant demonstrators anyway,"" he points out. The German Red Cross organises activities for children living in Oberhausen's refugee centre On Duisburg street, a Turkish artist paints a wall with a dozen children living at a refugee centre. They are colouring jolly characters that seem to come out of a comic book. Germany is nearing the climax of its general election campaign, but immigration is no longer the hot national issue it once was. ""The situation is now much calmer for everybody and I don't think that the refugee crisis of 2015 will have an impact,"" says Joerg Fischer from the German Red Cross, who was on the front line in 2015 when emergency camps had to be opened to accommodate everybody. Voters go to the polls on 24 September and Martin Schulz is challenging Angela Merkel for the job of chancellor ""If the elections had taken place 18 months ago it would clearly have benefited the far right but two years ago Angela Merkel said 'Wir schaffen das' - we will do this - and indeed we did it."" ""Oberhausen has received more migrants and refugees than any other region. We'll probably start receiving more people in the autumn again so we are using this time to start integration programmes, we now have a football team, cooking classes for men and empowerment classes for women as well as art workshop for the kids."" On the high street in central Oberhausen elections posters are everywhere, but to the newcomers the election campaign is barely noticeable. ""It's so quiet,"" says Osmane, a 20-year-old from Guinea. ""It doesn't look like its elections time here. In Africa it's chaos during electoral campaigns, you can get mugged for no reason. It is peaceful here, I like it."" With just over two weeks to go before the vote, the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany (AfD) is expected to enter the federal parliament for the first time. Whoever wins the federal election will make little difference to Khaled's future in Oberhausen. He says his life is in Germany now rather than Afghanistan and vows to do everything he can to stay. ""My son goes to the kindergarten, my wife is learning German and I've got a job."" ""German people are always on time everywhere so I try to be punctual, I want my boss to be satisfied with me."" And for now that seems to work. ""His German still needs to improve but he's doing well and he is a reliable worker,"" says Frank Kalutza, who gave him his first job. The decision for now is out of Khaled's hands and could take several more months. ""I don't want to leave, there is nothing in Afghanistan for me.""

Reality Check: Does debt interest cost more than NHS pay?,"The claim:We pay more on debt interest than on NHS pay. Reality Check verdict:If you use the Office for Budget Responsibility's headline figure for debt interest then we actually spend more on NHS pay. With nurses demonstrating in Parliament Square against the pay cap this week, Prime Minister Theresa May was asked by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn about whether public sector workers could be paid more. She replied by blaming the last Labour government for the amount of debt the country has, saying: ""As a result of the decisions the Labour Party took in government we now have to pay more on debt interest than on NHS pay."" Reality Check asked Downing Street for the figures to back this up and were told that in 2016-17 debt interest costs were expected to have been Â£49.1bn while NHS staff costs the same year were Â£48.1bn. Let's look at those figures in turn. The debt interest costs figure comes from the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR)economic and fiscal outlook,externalfrom the time of the Budget in March. The tricky thing with this figure is that the OBR comes up with two numbers depending on whether or not you count what's known as the Asset Purchase Facility (APF). As part of its attempts to stimulate the economy, the Bank of England has bought a large amount of UK government bonds. The government has to pay interest on those bonds, so it makes interest payments to the Bank of England. But once a quarter, the Bank of England returns those interest payments to the government. The OBR's headline figure doesn't count the money which has been returned as part of government spending. In 2016-17 it was Â£36.0bn. The one used by Theresa May ignores the fact the money was returned to government coffers, so totals Â£49.1bn. The figure for NHS pay is a surprisingly difficult one to give a definitive answer to. The number Downing Street gave comes from the Department of Healthannual report and accounts.,external The figure of Â£48.1bn is for all permanently employed staff of the departmental group, which means it includes people working full-time for the NHS in England as well as those working for the Department of Health and arm's length bodies such as Public Health England. It includes employer national insurance contributions and pension contributions. It does not include anyone working for the NHS in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland because staff there are paid by the devolved administrations. It also does not include anyone employed via an agency, on a temporary contract, or most staff working in GP surgeries. We asked NHS Digital to come up with a figure for only the salaries of NHS England staff and they gave us the remarkably precise figure of Â£39,450,395,739.60, i.e. about Â£39.5bn. NHS Digital warns that the figure is lower than it should be because it excludes data for two hospital trusts and also does not include maternity pay or sick pay. As with the Department of Health figures, it also does not include figures for the NHS outside England or for GP practices. But even this figure is higher than the amount spent on debt interest when the APF is taken into account.

Star Wars actor McDiarmid takes on immigration row role,"Ian McDiarmid portrays Enoch Powell at the time of his ""rivers of blood"" speech and later towards the end of his life A single controversial speech probably made Enoch Powell the most admired and the most detested British politician of the 1960s.  In 1968 his intervention in Britain's policies on migration ended his career as a shadow minister - but it made him known around the world.  Chris Hannan's play What Shadows, starring Star Wars actor Ian McDiarmid, looks at Powell's motives then and at his legacy today. Hannan says the play What Shadows isn't really about Powell, although the politician dominates the stage. ""I knew I wanted to write about national identity and Powell is a good way of exploring that.  But the inspiration was partly my own background in a working-class Irish family in Scotland.  There was a huge amount of discrimination as the Irish were often seen as unwanted immigrants.  So the Powell speech resonated more widely than you might think."" In April 1968 Powell made a speech which has gone down in British political history.  The Conservatives were in opposition under Edward Heath - a party rival for whom Powell had little respect.  Powell, the Tory defence spokesman, knew some of his white constituents in Wolverhampton South-West were unhappy at levels of immigration from the Commonwealth. Ian McDiarmid (left) is known for playing Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in Star Wars He made a speech at the Midland Hotel in Birmingham, using the racial language of the time, in which he quoted the Roman poet Virgil, setting out dark forebodings about growing levels of migration.  ""Like the Roman,"" he said ""I seem to see the River Tiber foaming with much blood."" The press around the world reported the so-called ""rivers of blood"" speech and Powell was quickly sacked from the Tory front bench.  But TV news bulletins were filled with voters for whom Powell had become an unlikely populist hero. Hannan's play shows events surrounding the Birmingham speech and then revisits Powell towards the end of his life.  The play was seen last year at the Birmingham Rep and is now being restaged in Edinburgh and London.  The lead role is taken by Ian McDiarmid, famous on screen as the Emperor Palpatine in the Star Wars films. The play's poster gives an inflammatory image of Enoch Powell McDiarmid says the 1968 Britain we see portrayed isn't very different from the nation today.  ""I think we now have a divided Britain, almost down the middle - as it very much was when Powell made the speech. ""There are the people who have reason to be grateful and happy about multiculturalism and there are other people who are feeling rather dispossessed.  And that's something which he put his finger on in 1968 - in fact he lit the blue touch-paper. ""So Chris has written about a divided nation but with Powell there's also a divided personality.  He was a romantic nationalist and a passionate person: he felt he had an insight into human nature.  In a public sense he had two great ambitions: he wanted to be Viceroy of India and then he wanted to be prime minister.  They both came to nothing."" Political journalist Simon Heffer was Powell's official biographer.  Before the politician's death in 1998 they spoke about the Birmingham speech - but he was never quite sure if Powell had been surprised at its huge impact with the public. Ian McDiarmid (left) previously played the World War One foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey in drama 37 Days ""There's no denying that Enoch had aspirations to be his party's leader.  He disliked the fact that Edward Heath was a pro-European and not a traditional Tory.  He knew the Birmingham speech would aggravate Heath but he was also, I think, acting as a dedicated constituency MP.  He was not a racist and I think he had no theories about race as such - but he was opposed to immigration. ""Some of the language he used in the speech undoubtedly offended people with his talk of 'charming, wide-grinning piccaninnies'.  It's fair to point out that he was quoting a constituent. ""But when I wrote his biography a lot of his contemporaries at Westminster told me his speech had made it impossible to discuss immigration at all: the whole thing became so toxic.  That was not what he intended."" Hannan enjoyed delving into Powell's complex personality.  But he says it's contemporary Britain he had in mind writing the play.  ""We find this conversation so difficult: it's as if the language isn't fit for talking about it.  As soon as we raise the subject of racism and immigration we can last about two minutes before we give up and shut the dialogue down. The playwright Chris Hannan says conversation about immigration has become harder since the time of Enoch Powell ""I believe the conversation has actually got worse over the half century since the Powell speech.  The play really ask, 'How do we learn to talk about this?  How do we learn to talk about the things that divide us?'  Because we have to get beyond all the hatred - there's no choice about that.  The play is about the Birmingham speech needing to be answered.  It's not a matter of agreeing with it but I want to know, with all the anger, how on earth do we talk to each other?"" McDiarmid has to make Powell tick on stage - so does he find something to like in him? ""Acting works by empathising with your character.  If you fail to do that, the audience simply won't take it seriously and the whole thing will fall apart.  So I admire him for sticking to his guns.  But at the end of the day you have to ask if what he did advanced the argument in any productive way.  I'm not sure it did. ""I suspect the audience may go away thinking he was brave but also naÃ¯ve - or prejudiced but also honest.  I think there are elements of all those aspects to him.  But he was a significant character in British life.  And - whether you like his arguments or not - the issues he raises are as relevant as they ever were.""

May: Trump hand holding was 'to assist',"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has described the time she and US president Donald Trump held hands as a ""moment of assistance"". The leaders were captured on camera as they walked at the White House on Mrs May's visit in January 2017. The picture made headlines around the world, with some suggesting it was a sign of their closeness. Government sources in Washington DC suggestedMr Trump has a fear of stairs or slopes. Speaking on the BBC's Test Match Special, Mrs May said: ""We were walking along, he said there was a ramp around the corner and it might be difficult walking down it so to take his arm. ""And then when we got to the top of the ramp he took my hand, just for going down the ramp and then that was it ... I think it was to assist."" The prime minister added: ""You suddenly see this bank of photographers and then of course it becomes something that the photographers and the journalists and the commentators and everybody pick up. But I think it was genuinely a moment of assistance."" Theresa May was speaking to Test Match Special Asked whether she trusted Mr Trump not to ""press the button or be reckless"", Mrs May said the president was surrounded by ""very good advisers"" who would help him make the right decisions. ""I believe that Donald Trump as American president will take the decisions that are right for security and safety around the world,"" she added. ""He has very good advisers around him in some of the individuals he has in key roles of state, defence and so forth. And we will work with them. ""I had a call with him earlier this week, talking exactly about North Korea and what we can do together, particularly at the United Nations ... and how we can work with other countries to achieve what we all want, which is for North Korea to stop what is illegal activity."" In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC's Jonathan Agnew at Lord's cricket ground, Mrs May also hit back at critics of her general election campaign, saying ""I don't think I'm in the least robotic"". Mrs May was ridiculed by critics during the election for repeating stock phrases, such as ""strong and stable,"" with one dubbing her the ""Maybot"". Instead of addressing large crowds and doing walkabouts, like her Labour opponent Jeremy Corbyn, her appearances were mostly limited to tightly-controlled party events. She said she had been ""frustrated"" that as prime minister she had not been able to ""knock on doors"" and meet ordinary people. ""In any election campaign a plan is made about what that campaign is going to be like. ""I get frustrated... people used the word robotic about me during that campaign. I don't think I'm in the least robotic. ""What I really enjoy is getting out there talking to people, hearing from them, understanding what the issues are for them. ""That's what drove me when I first became prime minister."" She also discussed harassment on social media, saying she worried about its impact on young people's mental health. ""Social media is hugely positive in most of the ways that people use it. But there is this aspect to it that does enable people to harass others, to make really very unpleasant comments, and beyond unpleasant comments, real threats. ""That's why it is important that the Crown Prosecution Service recently issued some new guidance on prosecutions of online harassment and threats online. I think it's important that action is taken when it's right, when it's passed the level which is appropriate in terms of criminality and prosecutions."" She added: ""If it's a crime offline, it's a crime online. I think sometimes people think that online is a different sort of world and it doesn't matter and you can do what you like. Actually, no, you can't. You should behave online as you would offline."" Asked if she had taken the election result, which saw her lose her Commons majority, personally, Mrs May said: ""As the leader of the party of course you have to take it to a degree personally and you have to accept that responsibility."" Mrs May, a longstanding cricket fan, was attending the test match between England and the West Indies, at Lord's.

Mexico quake death toll rises to 58,"This video can not be played This is what the southern region of Mexico woke up to after an 8.1 magnitude quake The race to rescue those trapped in the rubble continues, nearly 48 hours after a powerful earthquake struck off Mexico's southern coast. The 8.1 magnitude quake left at least 65 people dead, according to officials. Another 200 people were injured, President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto said, as he declared a national day of mourning. Meanwhile, the feared category one Hurricane Katia, which struck Veracruz on the east coast on Saturday, has been downgraded to a tropical storm. The US National Hurricane Center reported Katia had been rapidly weakening since making landfall, but local officials are worried the storm could still cause landslides and flooding. BBC in depth - Earthquakes A history of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? Rescue efforts following the earthquake, which struck late on Thursday, are focussing on the worst-hit states of Tabasco, Oaxaca and Chiapas. Tens of thousands of emergency packs, as well as 100 extra police officers and rescue dogs were sent to JuchitÃ¡n, Oaxaca, which was the most affected town. The earthquake is the most powerful anywhere in the world since September 2015, but its depth - 70kmaccording to the US Geological Survey,external- means that the shaking felt at the surface was less strong than it would have been for an equally powerful but shallower tremor. President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto speaks in JuchitÃ¡n on Friday At least 37 people have been reported dead in JuchitÃ¡n, according to the Milenio newspaper. The town hall and a number of other buildings destroyed or badly damaged. ""The situation is JuchitÃ¡n is critical; this is the most terrible moment in its history,"" said Mayor Gloria Sanchez. Police officer Vidal Vera, 29, who had not slept in more than 36 hours, told AFP: ""I can't remember an earthquake this terrible. ""The whole city is a disaster zone right now. Lots of damage. Lots of deaths. I don't know how you can make sense of it. It's hard. My sister-in-law's husband died. His house fell on top of him."" Mr PeÃ±a Nieto, who visited the town on Friday, said flags would fly at half-mast on Saturday out of respect for the dead and bereaved. The president said 45 deaths had been reported in Oaxaca, 12 in Chiapas and four in Tabasco. Parts of the town hall in JuchitÃ¡n were levelled The BBC's Arturo Wallace says the affected region is the poorest and least developed part of Mexico and the full extent of the damage is yet to become clear. At least one other person was killed in Guatemala, its president has said. The huge quake struck at 23:50 local time on Thursday (04:50 GMT Friday), shaking buildings and causing panic hundreds of miles away in the capital, Mexico City. Patients at a hospital in Villahermosa, Tabasco state, were moved into the open after the quake struck The earthquake also triggered a tsunami warning and the evacuation of thousands of people in coastal communities in Chiapas. The warning was later lifted. Throughout Friday, the region was shaken with scores of aftershocks. President PeÃ±a Nieto's office said he would travel to Chiapas to survey the damage. Pope Francis, addressing an open air Mass on a visit to Colombia, said he was praying ""for those who have lost their lives and their families"". The earthquake was more powerful than the 1985 tremor which hit close to Mexico City and caused thousands of deaths. Correspondents say the death toll appears to have been lower because it struck further away from highly populated areas.

Man who imported child sex doll jailed,"David Turner owned a number of child sex dolls, and possessed images of child sexual abuse A former school governor and church warden who imported a child sex doll has been jailed for 16 months. David Turner, 72, admitted importing the child-size item and possessing 34,000 images of child sexual abuse. An investigation began when the UK Border Force intercepted a package in November, imported from China. The National Crime Agency (NCA) then discovered that Turner, of Ramsgate, Kent, had two other child sex dolls, and indecent images of children. Turner was sentenced by Judge Simon James at Canterbury Crown Court for possessing a doll that was 3ft 10in (1.16m) tall, which he had also bought clothes for. He was sentenced to eight months for owning the doll and eight months for possessing images of child sexual abuse. He was officially convicted of one charge of importing a child sex doll, three charges of possession of indecent images of a child, three charges of making indecent images, and a charge of possessing extreme pornographic images. David Turner dressed the black haired doll himself In July, a court ruled the child sex doll was an obscene item, after Turner's lawyers had argued it was not covered by a law banning their importation. Other men have been convicted for importing child sex dolls, but this was the first case where the question of whether a doll is indecent or obscene had been tested by the courts. What a terrible fall from grace for David Turner who until his arrest last November was a much-respected member of the Ramsgate community. Even though he had no previous convictions a jail sentence was inevitable given the number of abuse images he'd amassed, including 138 of the most serious kind, and the need to send out a message to other people contemplating ordering child sex dolls. Investigators believe it's a growing problem facilitated by the internet. This week, Simon Bailey, the chief constable who leads on child protection for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said it wouldn't be long before there were virtual reality videos of child sexual abuse - and robots engineered for the task. ""Trust me, it will happen,"" he said. In a police interview, Turner said he preferred viewing indecent images of girls aged between four and 10 and added he had secretly taken pictures of minors in public. Children in the images were as young as three. He was placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years and given an indefinite sexual harm prevention order. Officers also found that he had 29 fictional stories which described the rape of children, but the accounts fell outside the Obscene Publications Act. The NCA's Hazel Stewart said: ""Importing child dolls to have sex with - as David Turner did - is a crucial flag to potential offending against children. ""In this case it enabled us to uncover Turner's long-standing sexual interest in children. He should not be near them and I am delighted that our investigation has seen him convicted and jailed."" Turner is one of seven people in the UK to have been convicted for possessing the obscene dolls to-date. The Border Force has seized 123 dolls from 120 individuals since March 2016. They were convicted using a 19th Century law, called the Customs Consolidation Act of 1876. The Crown Prosecution Service's Donna East said: ""Given the nature of the offence, which is very much modern day, with people ordering these sex dolls online, it is perhaps surprising that we are using laws dating back to the end of the 19th century, but this demonstrates how the law can apply to many circumstances."" Child sex dolls are considered a relatively new phenomenon, which have seen only a handful of convictions The NSPCC has complained that the dolls offer a ""legal loophole"" to potential child sex abusers, and has called for them to be criminalised in the same way as indecent images. The charity's chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""At present in England and Wales it is only illegal to import an obscene or indecent item. It is not a crime to make these dolls, to distribute them or to possess them. ""This is baffling and needs to be changed so that the law in relation to child sex dolls is brought in line with the law on prohibited images. ""I urge [the home secretary] to take swift action and remedy this issue at the earliest available opportunity.""

Woman jailed for sex ring trafficking,"Carolann Gallon pleaded guilty to three counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation A woman who trafficked underage girls to a drugs and grooming ring that forced young women to have sex has been jailed for six years and three months. Carolann Gallon was one of 18 peopleconvicted as part of Operation Sanctuary, an investigation into the sexual abuse of vulnerable girls. The 22-year-old, of Hareside Court, Newcastle, admitted three counts of trafficking. Another gang member, Abdulhamid Minoyee, was sentenced to 15 years. The 34-year-old, of Gainsborough Grove, Newcastle, had been convicted of raping a woman with learning difficulties, sexual assault, and the supply of drugs. Read more about the sentencing and other North East stories Newcastle Crown Court heard that Gallon took girls - two of whom were in care and one who was only 13 years old - to the parties knowing they would be sexually abused. She also took a girl with learning difficulties to a flat where she was raped by Minoyee. Abdulhamid Minoyee gave a girl with learning difficulties cannabis and raped her while she was intoxicated The prosecution said after Gallon was arrested, she told police: ""I didn't force them into having sex. They [are] not kids, they've got their own mind. ""If they're mortal [drunk] they are going to do something, why get mortal in the first place? ""It's self-inflicted, I've got no sympathy."" Police paid Â£10,000 to child rapist 'Vile crimes committed by evil men' Gallon was aged 17 or 18 at the time of the offences, but police decided that she was an active member of the gang rather than a victim. Judge Penny Moreland said: ""You were described yourself as being a victim. ""There have been ample opportunities for you to make complaints about these matters. You have never chosen to do so."" She added that Gallon continued to ""ally"" herself with other defendants. All but one of the grooming gang have now been sentenced A total of16 men and one woman have now been jailed, with one more to be sentenced on 14 September. Victims were lured to parties, known as ""sessions"", at addresses around the West End of Newcastle by men who apparently befriended them. There they were plied with alcohol or drugs - some became addicted - and forced to have sex. During sentencing, victims' impact statements described their psychological damage, and those living close to the party addresses spoke of being ""put through hell"". Speaking after sentencing, Det Supt Steve Barron, from Northumbria Police, said: ""I have spoken to some of these victims and they are lovely people. ""They have had a tough life and to then go through courts is so difficult for them. It has just been brilliant to see how their bravery is now showing justice.""

Powerful painkiller use 'an addiction risk',"Opioid painkillers include tramadol, codeine and morphine The use of potentially addictive painkillers across England has doubled in the last 15 years, according to a report by leading public health experts. Researchers found one in 20 people was being prescribed opioid painkillers, such as codeine and tramadol. They also found that drugs were being prescribed for longer periods of time. Experts say long-term use leads to a risk of addiction while the benefits become greatly reduced. A routine prescription drug led James to the brink of destruction. His problems started with severe stomach aches but the painkillers he was prescribed quickly stopped working. Desperate for pain relief, he was soon spending Â£400 a month on additional supplies from online pharmacies. James went from taking eight pills a day to 50 - and almost before he knew it, his life had spiralled out of control. ""A few months before, I was just this normal guy working full time, kids and a wife and happy, then all of a sudden I am basically a drug addict. ""I thought it would be fine. I thought I would be on these tablets short term, but then before I knew it, I couldn't get off them."" For James, the side-effects were terrible - headaches, nausea, constipation - and then a series of seizures that he feared would end his life. This video can not be played James says he wouldn't have started taking codeine if had known how addictive it was. ""They can ruin your life without you knowing because I do believe that probably within a year - taking the same amounts or increasing - they probably would have killed me."" James is now getting help to deal with his crippling addiction through a programme run by his council and a local GP practice. Research in just a handful of GP practices where he lives in Scunthorpe alone identified more than 100 people dependent on painkillers. But responsibility for helping them falls between the NHS and local councils, and schemes like the one James is on are rare. The data comes from a wider study of 50,000 NHS patients in England,externalby the Public Health Research Consortium. It looked at those who had been prescribed at least one of four types of potentially addictive drugs - known as Dependence Forming Medicines - between 2000 and 2015. The biggest single group of drugs were opioid painkillers which can help relieve pain for cancer patients or those with short-term needs. The data shows more people are being prescribed these powerful medicines. In 2015, 5% of patients were receiving regular prescriptions, double the rate when compared with 2000. Neil Smith, research director at the National Centre for Social Research, said: ""This report highlights that a balance needs to be struck between avoiding prescribing that might lead to dependence or other harms and ensuring proper access to medicines to relieve suffering and treat disorders. ""Trends in the extent and duration of opioid prescribingâ¦ need close and ongoing monitoring."" Doctors say that for short-term use, opioid painkillers, such a tramadol, codeine or morphine can be very effective. But when used over a longer period of time the body develops a tolerance and so that effectiveness declines. They also come with side-effects including headaches, nausea and constipation as well as being potentially highly addictive. Experts warn that no-one should stop their medication before seeking the advice of their GP. But Dr Cathy Stannard, a specialist in pain management, says it is clear that patients using opioid drugs for a long time are often getting little benefit, but suffer all the side-effects. ""I am not suggesting somebody who is benefiting has their drugs removed. ""But out of a population who are taking these drugs, the majority are not benefiting and they should be supported to come off these medicines."" Today's report doesn't contain hard data on addiction but it does indicate there is a growing need to closely monitor the use of these powerful drugs.

Strongest quake in century hits Mexico,"This video can not be played A bowling alley shakes in Tuxtla Gutierrez, 240km from the epicentre An earthquake described by Mexico's president as the country's strongest in a century has struck off the southern coast, killing at least 36 people. The quake, which President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto said measured 8.2, struck in the Pacific, about 87km (54 miles) south-west of Pijijiapan. Oaxaca and Chiapas states bore the brunt of the damage and dozens of aftershocks have been reported. A tsunami warning was initially issued but later lifted. The quake, which struck at 23:50 local time on Thursday (04:50 GMT Friday), was felt hundreds of miles away in Mexico City, with buildings swaying and people running into the street. President PeÃ±a Nieto said about 50 million Mexicans would have felt the tremor and that the death toll might rise. His office said he would travel to Chiapas to survey the damage. BBC in depth - Earthquakes A history of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? At least 25 people were killed in Mexico's Oaxaca state, 17 of them in the town of JuchitÃ¡n, officials said. Another seven were reported killed in Chiapas and three more, including two children, died in Tabasco state. President PeÃ±a Nieto said more than 200 people had been injured. At least one person was killed in Guatemala, its president has said. Images showed collapsed buildings across Oaxaca. In JuchitÃ¡n, the municipal palace and a number of other structures were destroyed or badly damaged. Parts of the municipal palace in JuchitÃ¡n were levelled A hotel collapsed in the town of MatÃ­as Romero, Oaxaca state, but it is not clear if there were any casualties. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center,external(PTWC) had originally said that tsunami waves of more than 3m (9ft) were possible along the coasts of Mexico, with threats also facing El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica.  It said later that waves only 0.7m high reached the Mexican coast. Some coastal areas were evacuated as a precaution. BBC's Lourdes Heredia The earthquake has brought back memories of the tremor of 1985, which left massive destruction in Mexico City and a death toll of 10,000. This explains the scenes of panic on the streets of the capital, more than 1,000km away from the epicentre. The government does not expect the same scale of physical destruction, as the states most affected are in the poorest and least-developed regions. Chiapas is the southernmost state, along the Guatemalan border. It's a very mountainous, remote area, where 25% of the population belong to indigenous groups. It's also much visited by tourists seeking to explore some of the best and most well-preserved archaeological treasures, such as the ancient Mayan city of Palenque. At magnitude 8.2, the quake outstrips the deadly 1985 tremor that hit close to Mexico City and caused thousands of deaths. TheUS Geological Survey,externalmeasured the latest quake slightly lower, at 8.1, saying it struck at a depth of 70km. Soldiers stood guard after a hotel collapsed in the town of Matias Romero, Oaxaca state The coastal town of Puerto Madero, Mexico, was among those evacuated amid fears of a tsunami Damage in the Mexican city of Oaxaca, about 300km from the epicentre The tremor was strong enough to bring down buildings near Mexico City Mr PeÃ±a Nieto said the Salina Cruz refinery on the southern coast had temporarily suspended operations. Schools were closed in 11 Mexican states. Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent This is the biggest quake experienced anywhere in 2017. Going on the statistics, you would expect at least one magnitude 8 to occur somewhere on the planet each year. It occurred where the Pacific ocean floor is drawn under Mexico and Guatemala. A great slab of rock, known as the Cocos tectonic plate, is driving towards the coast at a rate of 75mm per year. As it jerks downwards into the Earth's interior, about 200km offshore, large tremors are the inevitable outcome. There have been three magnitude 7s in 2017, with a 7.9 recorded deep under Papua New Guinea back in January. This latest event, being an 8.2, is nearly three times as energetic. That tells you something about how the magnitude scale works. Fortunately, this event was deep, too. The rupture, which will have ripped across more than 100km of fault line, was down at 70km. That will have limited some of the shaking, but as we've seen there is still extensive damage. Some electricity cuts were reported in the capital and social media video showed lampposts and the famous Angel of Independence statue swaying violently. Journalist Franc Contreras, who is in Mexico City, told the BBC: ""You could hear loud cracks in the concrete. It sounded like a giant wooden branch being just broken open violently. Guatemala's Red Cross tweeted damage in the town of Tacana, close to the Mexican border ""People were streaming out of the hallways here. And everybody walking out single file into the streets, trying to avoid overhead high power lines."" Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales appealed for calm on national television and in a Twitter post. ""We have reports of some damage and the death of one person, even though we still don't have exact details,"" Associated Press quoted Mr Morales as saying. Cindy Lamothe, who is in the Guatemalan city of Antigua, told the BBC: ""It was swaying so intensely it felt like we were in a boat and I heard neighbours screaming through the walls... it lasted almost three minutes."" Mexico is currently also being threatened on its eastern coast by Hurricane Katia. The category one hurricane is about 300km south-east of Tampico and has sustained winds of 140km/h the National Hurricane Center says.

Cold Feet cast's sombre return,"Cold Feet returned with the original cast last year after a 13-year hiatus The Cold Feet cast have revealed how their return to filming had a sombre start after the Manchester Arena bombing, where 22 people were killed after Ariana Grande's concert. ""It was horrible. Just horrible,"" said John Thomson, who plays Pete. ""I couldn't wait to get home to my girls that night, as we nearly went. ""We couldn't get into town because town was shut down. We re-jigged the schedule and went to the studio. "" He paid tribute to the Cold Feet team, saying: ""Credit to everyone that day, crew especially and cast."" The new series starts nine months after the end of the last one They were meant to be filming on 23 May in St Ann's Square, where flowers were laid in tribute to the victims of the bombing the day before. Fay Ripley, who plays Jenny, said: ""The first thing you think is - we're in Manchester, working with people who are friends. The first call you make is 'is everyone okay?' ""Then you look to Manchester. You try to behave in a way that's responsible. My kids came up about a week after. We all went to St Anne's Square, something I know they will always remember."" Hermione Norris spoke of the impact of the bombing on Manchester Hermione Norris, who plays Karen, added: ""It's a small community and it was felt incredibly strongly."" Last year's series was a huge success for ITV and was very warmly received after its 13-year gap. This video can not be played Cold Feet is back for a new series but what happened to the characters? ""It was an enormous relief that people welcomed us back with open arms,"" admitted Ripley. ""We didn't have an example - it was the first experiment of bringing something back after (more than) 10 years. But it's the same characters so why wouldn't you be interested?"" John Thomson said he felt the pressure of filming this series But after that success, Thomson said it wasn't easier this time round. ""The pressure was huge, it's harder in a way - like the difficult second album. ""To be honest when I had my storyline pitched to me I was a bit underwhelmed. ""Because we went in guns blazing the first time round, we had to bait the audience because it'd been 13 years so we had to go in strong. ""You can't go in on popularity stakes alone, that's so arrogant, so we had to have decent, meaty storylines and it worked."" Fay Ripley said there's some ""fun to be had"" in this series ""What I had to appreciate is once we'd now established ourselves you can build slowly to a bigger thing."" Ripley said the audience could look forward to a few surprises along the way. ""There may be some cameos, famous cameos coming up. I'm not allowed to say who or when, but there might be fun to be had. Some people you might recognise."" Between the last series and this one, Nesbitt made headlines after he madean impassioned speechabout equality for actresses at the Bafta TV Awards. Something his co-star Ripley approved of. ""I think it's great to have someone stand up and defend women in the workplace. I've paid for a taxi for James to go and renegotiate my salary. Nesbitt, pictured with onscreen son Cel Spellman, said the characters' children growing up ""means a whole new dynamic"" ""Obviously I am joking - in Cold Feet we don't have a gender issue. If there is any (disparity) it's not because of that."" Nesbitt has a slightly different memory of it, joking that she was a ""nightmare"" with teasing him over his speech. But he's glad he did it. ""I didn't want to become the spokesperson for it, but I'm very, very happy to be part of the campaign for the equal representation of actresses. ""Society is absorbing on a daily basis  - particularly the young - that even though there is a 50/50 split for genders, for every female part there's three male parts. Tina and Adam got together at the end of the last series ""That is absorbed by my children and anyone's children on a daily basis - subconsciously or consciously - it is bound to have an impact on actual equality and who has power and who has influence."" He added: ""You know what was funny was my eldest daughter sent me a text having seen it saying 'You go girl', which I thought was very good."" As for the success of this series John Thomson said another series is not definite. ""Everyone goes 'oh it's in the bag' and you go 'not in this day and age, absolutely not'. ""You cannot rest on your laurels. It's best to go in with low expectations."" Robert Bathurst is happy to do occasional series with gaps in between And Robert Bathurst, who plays David Marsden said it would be fine if this was the end for the time being. ""If we do no more that's that, and in a sense it might allow us to get older, and creatively it could become open ended until we die - we might just do a couple here and a couple there until we're 105."" This is an idea Thomson is fully on board with. ""We'll do it now in our 50s, sit on it a bit and come back in our 70s. I'm glad that's the idea because I'm a comedy actor and my pension was going to be Last of the Summer Wine - they all rocked up in that - that was our pension but it's gone now.""

Boy faces trial over moped acid attacks,"Emergency crews and other moped drivers went to the help of victims on 13 July A 16-year-old boy has denied carrying out a string of acid attacks on six moped riders. The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, is accused of targeting the men to steal their bikes, spraying them in their faces with a noxious liquid. He will stand trial in January.

Father jailed over baby's dog bite death,"Reggie Young, who was three weeks old, was attacked on 20 June 2015 A father who was drunk and asleep when his dog killed his three-week-old son has been jailed for 21 months. Reggie Young was mauled for up to 20 minutes at the family home in Falkland Road, Sunderland, on 20 June 2015. Ryan Young, 32, of Holborn Road, Sunderland, previously pleaded guilty at Newcastle Crown Court to being in charge of a dangerous dog. Judge Tim Gittens said Reggie's mother Maria Blacklin returned home to a scene of ""Gothic horror"". A child neglect charge was ordered to lie on file. The court heard the Lakeland terrier-cross, which was called Tricky, was destroyed soon after the attack. Judge Gittins said: ""Reggie was subjected to a most dreadful, torturous, confusing attack and he sustained horrific and painful injuries."" Ryan Young was jailed for 21 months at Newcastle Crown Court The court heard Miss Blacklin had been at a family gathering after her grandmother's death when the dog attacked her son at around 04:00 BST. She returned home to find Reggie in a pool of blood on the floor, the hearing heard. The court heard how Young failed to prevent the attack because he had drunk eight cans of lager and had fallen asleep, and only woke up when he heard Miss Blacklin screaming. Reggie was blue but still breathing and paramedics were called, but he could not be saved. Young, who refused to give a breath test, later told police: ""I would not say I was drunk, more tired."" Prosecutor Shaun Dodds told the court: ""The officers who arrived described the defendant as appearing drunk."" Ryan Young carried his son's coffin at the funeral service in July 2015 The court heard inquiries suggested the baby fell or was dragged from the bouncer and was mauled by the terrier, which had not been introduced to the newborn and may have been driven to attack by Reggie's ""unco-ordinated"" movements. Mr Dodds added: ""Had the defendant not been asleep in drink, he would have been able to stop the attack."" Young wept loudly throughout the proceedings. No family members were in court for the sentencing hearing. His defence barrister Caroline Goodwin QC said: ""Nothing he can do can turn back the clock and bring back his own child. ""It was all the more harrowing for the family when he carried his child's coffin before the funeral service."" The judge accepted that Young was a hard-working father and had developed depression since his son's death.

UK steps up Hurricane Irma relief effort,"This video can not be played ""The wind was like nothing I've ever known in my life"" The UK is stepping up its relief effort in response to Hurricane Irma, with the first of three RAF aid flights on its way to the Caribbean. A Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship has also begun delivering emergency aid to British overseas territory islands hit by the disaster. Houses have been reduced to rubble in the British Virgin islands, where a state of emergency has been declared. The UK government has been accused of responding too slowly to the storm. The British Virgin Islands' governor, Gus Jaspert, has asked the UK for help amid reports of widespread devastation, with casualties and fatalities reported. Mr Jaspert has warned that another storm, Hurricane Jose could reach the islands at the weekend. Sharon Flax-Brutus, director of tourism for the British Virgin Islands (BVI), said the damage was difficult to assess because communications were down,  but that ""many homes are without roofs, or have been diminished to merely foundations"". A state of emergency has been declared in the BVI which was hit by Hurricane Irma Simon Cross, who moved to the BVI two years ago, said the first warning he had of the hurricane hitting his building was when a skylight was blown off the roof. ""The wind was scary enough for us to all end up huddling in an adjoining bathroom which had a small window protected by metal shutters. ""The wind was like nothing I've ever known in my life. It was crazy."" Tortola 'is like a warzone' after Irma Briton Emily Killhoury, who lives on Tortola in the BVI with her husband Michael and their two children, aged nine and 10, told the BBC her family bunkered down in a cupboard when the storm hit. ""Our downstairs doors suddenly blew out, which was terrifying. We just stayed hiding,"" she said. ""We eventually emerged at about 7pm to see total devastation. Everybody is shocked, but trying to be practical."" Emily Killhoury's house was a strong concrete structure, other properties were worse hit Sir Richard Branson, who was at his private retreat on Necker Island in the BVI, said the whole area had been ""completely and utterly devastated"". In ablog,external, Sir Richard said his team were safe and well after taking shelter in his concrete wine cellar, but added: ""I've never seen anything like this hurricane. ""We are still assessing the damage, but whole houses and trees have disappeared."" Irma passed over the British overseas territories of Anguilla, Montserrat and the BVI on Wednesday night - and went on to batter another, the Turks and Caicos islands further north, on Thursday evening. Ex-pat Pheadra McLellan, left, lives on St Martin with her three children and French partner There have also been concerns for British nationals who are living in areas outside the overseas territories. British national Pheadra McLellan, her three children and her French partner Bernadine Gallis live on the island of St Martin. Ms McLellan's family last spoke to her on Wednesday night, when she said the family were seeing the storm out in a bedroom in their house. Cousin-in-law Claire Mays said: ""[We've] been calling the consulate, the FCO, but we've just been told, 'OK you've given us their details, please update us once you hear from them so we can tick it off the list.'"" The storm is nowexpected to hit Florida or neighbouring statesin the US over the weekend. UK armed forces assessing the damage in Anguilla on Thursday The UK has almost tripled therelief fundfor British overseas territories to Â£32m, amid criticism of its response. Prime Minister Theresa May has chaired a meeting of the government's emergency response Cobra committee. She said UK troops deployed on the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ship Mounts Bay have been working in Anguilla and have ""made the airfield serviceable, restored power to the hospital and rebuilt emergency shelters"". They have also begun assisting the governor of the BVI and working to ensure the airfield is accessible for military aircraft to fly in with emergency supplies, she added. ""Every effort is being made to ensure that as much as possible can be done in advance of Hurricane Jose, which is the next hurricane reaching that area."" The prime minister said the UK was also ""committed"" to providing support to ensure reconstruction work is done in the region in the long-term. Irma pummels Turks and Caicos Irma will be 'devastating' to US Survivors describe 'total devastation' In pictures: Irma ravages Caribbean Teenage surf champ killed riding hurricane wave British overseas territories are self-governing but rely on the UK for protection from natural disasters. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the impact of Hurricane Irma on the Caribbean was ""entirely predictable"" and the British government ""should have acted much faster"". But Mrs May has insisted that the UK responded ""swiftly"". Anguilla:Hit by the full blast of the hurricane on Wednesday. At least one death reported. British Virgin Islands:Reports of casualties and fatalities and extensive damage. Expected to require extensive humanitarian assistance. In amessage the people of the BVI,external, governor Gus Jaspert said: ""I come to you with a heavy heart after experiencing and observing the extent of devastation caused by Hurricane Irma."" Communications are difficult. Montserrat:""Swiped"" by Irma but suffered less serious damage. Turks and Caicos:Battered by the hurricane on Thursday night, with roofs ripped off, streets flooded, utility poles snapped and a widespread black-out on the main island of Grand Turk. A British Royal Logistics Corps Mexflote arrives in Anguilla to help with the relief effort Humanitarian workers with 200 shelter kits and the British ship, RFA Mounts Bay, were sent to the area before the hurricane struck. The MoD-owned vessel arrived in Anguilla on Thursday and delivered six tonnes of emergency aid, with personnel there clearing roads and helping to restore power. The ship has since arrived in the BVI - 90 miles to the west - to help with disaster relief efforts there. Warship HMS Ocean is also being sent from the Mediterranean but is not expected to arrive for another two weeks. The first British military flight to join the relief effort has left RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire carrying about 50 personnel - including engineers, marines and medics, as well as rations and water. Other transport aircraft are expected to follow with helicopters on board. What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories? Thousands of British tourists are believed to be holidaying in the Caribbean, the travel association Abta said. Britons in the region have been urged to follow evacuation orders, while states of emergency have been declared in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Florida, amid fears Miami could be struck directly by the hurricane. Holiday firms are monitoring the situation and some have cancelled flights or offered to amend bookings for those due to travel to affected areas in the coming days. The cruise company Carnival hascancelled four cruises,externalbound for the Caribbean that were due to depart over the next few days - and warned that others may be cut short. The Foreign Office urges people planning to go to the areas to follow the advice from the local authorities, including any evacuation orders, and check its officialtravel guidance,externalbefore travelling. It has set up a hotline for people affected by the disaster and for people whose loved ones may be affected on 020 7008 0000.

And he remembers what they said to him as he set about putting them out of business with Redbox, the movie rental company. âThey said 'wait a minute, we rent movies for $5. You canât make money renting them for a dollar!â"" ""The year I left we did $1.5bn in revenue. Blockbuster doesnât exist any more."" Lowe was also on the founding executive team at Netflix, and he helped guide the company to be the dominant online streaming service. It is one of Silicon Valleyâs great disruptors - turning an industry almost on its head. Now he thinks he can do it again, this time with cinema. Lowe didnât create Moviepass - itâs been around for six years - but heâs the companyâs new chief executive at a time when it is making a dramatic move: itâs lowered its monthly subscription rate to $9.95. For that money you can watch any movie, at (almost) any movie theatre in the US, any time you like, as often as you like (though not more than once per day). It used to be $50, an expenditure for only the most dedicated filmgoers. But at $10, Lowe thinks heâs cracked it, and casual film-watching millennials, who have stopped going to the movies as much, will be flooding through the doors once again. âThatâs the group we can get to go much more often,â Lowe says. ""Thatâs great for the industry."" This isnât some kind of coupon trick or shady deal. When you sign up to Moviepass, youâre sent a straightforward debit card in the post. When you pick a film you want to watch, and a place to watch it, the company finds out the normal ticket price and adds precisely that amount to your card - and you purchase it just as you would normally. The money is only unlocked when you get in close proximity to the theatre, and one of the companyâs patented technologies locks your card so it can only be used for buying that ticket. In other words, you canât just load it up for a âfilm"" and then go and buy lunch instead. Trust me, I tried. So whatâs the catch? Well, thereâs a big one - but for now at least itâs for the company, not you. You need to be in close proximity to the theatre before the money will ready You'd do well to get one movie ticket for $9.95, let alone a whole month's worth. So what gives? Itâs simple - Moviepass is going to sink the cost in the hope that eventually, somehow, they will be able to make up the deficit by taking a profit share from other cinema-related spending. If Lowe can prove that Moviepass is encouraging many more people to go to the movies, he thinks chains will agree to share the added profit from the multiple daylight robberies that occur when you decide to order popcorn and a drink. Also, he says while the company obviously loses money on each ticket in big cities with high prices, it will make it up in parts of the US where tickets are less than $9.95 - though Iâm personally not buying that strategy. Even if a ticket in small-town USA costs $5, two films a month in and Moviepass is already in the red. It is, ultimately, a quite literal bums-on-seats strategy. An Uber-like approach of subsidising everything at bonkers expense until people can't live without it - and work out the rest later. Moviepass already has a powerful enemy, however. AMC, the biggest theatre chain in the US, has threatened to take legal action against the company. Movie theatre chain AMC is unhappy about the ""untenable"" deal ""That price level is unsustainable and only sets up consumers for ultimate disappointment down the road if or when the product can no longer be fulfilled,"" the company said. AMC is caught in a hard place. It canât simply block the Moviepass card because, as I mentioned, itâs just a Mastercard. The firm would have to block all Mastercard transactions (or some other inventive method, which would see them fall foul of various legal and contractual obligations). Lowe suspects the firm might take issue with Moviepass as it is about to launch a subscription service of its own. AMC did not respond to the BBCâs request for comment on this article. Moviepass expects to have 2.5m subscribers by next year. It currently has 300,000 - 150,000 of which came in the two days following the price drop to $9.95. But right now itâs struggling to get its cards sent out to new customers - thereâs a 2-3 week wait for them to arrive, according to reports. Yet investors are apparently happy to plough money into the idea until it works (or not). They see the opportunity as being something well beyond the movie ticket, Lowe says. âWe think that going to the movies is the centrepiece of a whole night out. You could go shopping, you could get drinks, you could go to dinner, you might take a Lyft. ""We want to be part of that whole ecosystem. We want to drive more business around that night out to the movies.""

MP Paisley denies Â£100K holiday claim,"Ian Paisley succeeded his late father as MP for North Antrim in 2010 MP Ian Paisley has referred himself to a parliamentary watchdog over claims he did not declare Â£100,000 in hospitality from the Sri Lankan government. A newspaper report said the DUP MP and his family took two all-expenses-paid holidays to the island in 2013. TheDaily Telegraph,externalsaid he recently met Sri Lankan officials to discuss the possibility of post-Brexit trade deals with the south Asian country. But the MP said the report was ""devoid of fact or logic"" and ""defamatory"". Mr Paisley later tweeted an image of a letter from his solicitor, Paul Tweed, refuting the allegations,externaland saying that the Antrim MP had referred the matter, and a full explanation, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Who are the DUP? DUP-Tory deal: What you need to know 'Not a penny' without Stormont deal The DUP's 10 MPs In response to the Sri Lankan holiday claims, a DUP spokesman said it would await the outcome of the commissioner's investigation. DUP MP Nigel Dodds told the BBC's Inside Politics programme: ""Allegations have been made. Ian has given a very robust response and referred it to his legal team. ""He has also referred himself, quite rightly, to the Parliamentary Commissioner so this can be fully investigated."" The newspaper reported that the Paisley family flew business class to Sri Lanka twice in 2013 and stayed in luxurious hotels. It estimated the total worth of the trips at about Â£100,000 and claimed the cost and expenses were paid for by the Sri Lankan government. Mr Paisley this week tweeted a picture of himself meeting the Sri Lankan High Commissioner Amari Wijewardene ""to discuss NI-Sri Lanka trade deal after Brexit"". Two days later he tweeted a picture of himself with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox ""discussing our trade agreements post-Brexit"". The 50-year-old MP is the son of the late Ian Paisley, founder and former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), now the largest political party in Northern Ireland. In 2010, the then Mr Paisley Jr succeeded his father as MP for the North Antrim constituency. Ian Paisley's late father was one of Northern Ireland's most significant political leaders He is currently one of 10 DUP MPs who are propping up Theresa May's minority Conservative government. The DUP struck a significant deal with the Tories after the snap general election in June, which saw Mrs May losing her majority in the House of Commons. At the time, it was reported that the agreement would result in more than Â£1bn in extra government spending for Northern Ireland over the next two years. The DUP signed a deal to support the Conservative government in June However, a Stormont Civil Service source told the BBC on Thursday the Treasury had made clear that""not a penny"" would be released unless power-sharing was restored in Northern Ireland. The DUP replied that the delivery of the financial package ""does not depend on the nature of local government at Stormont"". Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January, when a coalition led by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed.

Should you let a 'robot' manage your retirement savings?,"Would you be better off with an automated financial adviser? Automated financial advice delivered by computer algorithm - often dubbed robo-advice - is a fast-growing business. But should you entrust your life savings to a computer? For many of us, talking about money is embarrassing - revealing our income and spending habits can feel like disrobing in public. So it's no wonder seeking investment advice from an impersonal, unbiased computer program is proving so popular. Consultancy firm Accenture found that 68% of global consumers would be happy to use robo-advice to plan for retirement, with many feeling it would be faster, cheaper, and more impartial than human advice. ""Many of our clients say they feel awkward in face-to-face meetings, preferring an online experience where they don't feel judged,"" says Lynn Smith, a director of robo-advice firm Wealth Wizards. So how does robo-advice work and is it really any better than traditional financial advice? Robo-adviser firms use algorithms to analyse your financial situation and goals and then work out an investment plan to suit you. Basically, you answer lots of questions online about your income, expenses, family situation, attitude to risk, and so on, and then the algorithm allocates your savings to a mix of investments, from index funds that aim to mimic a particular stock market index or sector, to fixed-income bonds. Robo-adviser algorithms allocate your cash to a balanced mix of investments As some investments are riskier than others, younger investors will generally have their portfolios weighted towards higher-risk, higher-growth investments, whereas older investors approaching retirement will see the balance of their portfolios weighted towards lower-risk, fixed income investments, such as government bonds or gilts. Joe Ziemer, vice president of communications at Betterment, a US robo-adviser with more than $9bn under management, says: ""The Betterment service takes your information and uses a series of algorithms to create an asset allocation plan, which might be, for example, 90% equities and 10% bonds for a retirement saver."" The crucial point is that these algorithms work everything out for you at much lower cost than many traditional wealth advisory firms. Wealth Wizards, for example, typically charges Â£65 for investments up to Â£30,000, and 0.30%, or Â£300, on a Â£100,000 investment pot. Betterment charges 0.25% a year. That's peanuts compared to human advisers' fees, which come in at about Â£580 for advice on a Â£200-a-month pension contribution, or Â£1,000-Â£2,000 for guidance on what to do with your Â£100,000 pot when your retire, according to UK adviser network Unbiased. Many of these robo-advisers will offer human advice as well - for any extra fee - if your finances are more complicated or you need tax planning services as well. ""When a client needs advice spanning a number of different regulatory regimes, human advice will be required,"" says John Perks, managing director of life and pensions at UK insurer LV, which launched its Retirement Wizard robo-advice service two years ago. Many of us are facing poverty in retirement because we're not saving enough, yet living longer So could these cheaper investment services encourage more of us to save more? The powers that be certainly hope so. World Economic Forum figures show the collective retirement savings gap of the world's largest economies will hit $400tn (Â£307tn) by 2050, meaning a lot of people could be spending their retirements in poverty. Governments are concerned that this might then place an unsustainable burden on welfare systems. Robo-advice is certainly growing in popularity. Market research aggregator Statista says the US market will grow 29% per year between now and 2021, and forecasts that the number of Chinese investors using robo-advice services will jump from two million to 79.4 million in the same period. While Consultancy AT Kearney forecasts that robo-advisers will be managing $2.2tn within five years, representing a 68% annual growth rate. Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen? Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think? How your digital self could 'live' on after you die And these services are only likely to become more sophisticated as the data from money management and banking apps are fed in to the algorithms and artificial intelligence is added to the mix, experts believe. ""If you knew everything about a person, you could wire up the back office to do the same as a human adviser. The fact find is the difficult bit,"" says Ms Smith. But are we really happy to ditch the human adviser completely? No, is the short answer. Accenture finds that a significant proportion of us still want human interaction, particularly if our finances are complex. Successful financial services firms will need a strategy ""that seamlessly integrates technology, branch networks and staff"", argues Accenture's Piercarlo Gera, senior managing director, distribution and marketing services. While Betterment provides 100% of its advice online, clients can still talk to a human being when they want to. Betterment claims it's investment portfolios are based on Nobel Prize-winning research Even those who prefer face-to-face interaction could still benefit from the robo-advice phenomenon, however. ""Using robo-advice can cut the time it takes an adviser to provide regulated advice for a client from nine hours down to just 90 minutes,"" LV's Mr Perks says. ""This could transform companies' back office operations, allowing them to offer a cheaper service."" But what about investment performance? Are algorithms choosing cheap investments that merely track markets better at making you money than professional fund managers trying to back winners on your behalf? The truth is that only about a quarter of funds managed by clever humans outperform the market as a whole, so when you take into account the much higher management fees you pay for that level of service, the performance difference is likely to be marginal for most of us. The robots may be coming, but in this case at least, they seem to be on the side of the small investor trying to save for a comfortable retirement.

Fizz Friday: Why women are picking prosecco over champagne,"This video can not be played Prosecco v champagne: Which one tastes better? It's Friday and across the country, people will soon be clocking off with a glass of fizz. Sales of the Italian wine are soaring faster than you can say ""I'll be there in a prosecco"", but what's the secret behind its sparkling success? On Instagram, there are almost two million photos tagged #prosecco and a further 12,000 for #FizzFriday. Even Theresa May's future has beendebated over a glass of sparkling Italian wine. Supermarkets are stacking their shelves high with bottles that give you change from Â£10 and bars up and down the UK are promoting it as an affordable, weekly treat. But its success is not solely down to cost. ""It is targeted at women,"" says Vhari Russell from the Food Marketing Expert.  ""Many of them like to drink bubbles and bubbles are associated with luxury and celebrations. ""It is served in beautiful glasses and can be seen as very classy."" Has prosecco become the go-to celebration drink? In a bar in Birmingham a group of women are sharing a bottle of prosecco. ""It feels very feminine,"" says Bev Gordon. ""It just makes you feel more sophisticated,"" her sister, Jennifer Tristham, adds. ""We'll drink it at house parties, when we're out, at little reunions... it's now become part of our lifestyle,"" their friend, Wendy Johnstone, explains. According to Richard Halstead from market researcher Wine Intelligence, the beverage could be described as the ""phenomenon of the last five years"". He said it is ""wildly popular"" among women in their 20s and 30s who post pictures on social media of themselves clinking glasses and popping corks. This video can not be played ""Drinking prosecco is part of our lifestyle"" It is a trend Alex Windsor and his fiancÃ©e, Sophie Andrews, spotted when they gave up their jobs to launch a mobile prosecco van. ""We see a huge amount of people taking pictures with glasses and putting them on social media sites,"" says Mr Windsor. ""Prosecco is a lot cheaper than champagne and a lot of people tell us it tastes nicer. It is a much more affordable drink, but gives [off] that elegance you get with champagne."" Ms Russell says prosecco has now overtaken champagne as the go-to drink for big occasions. But cutting back on luxuries in favour of an affordable alternative started in the wake of the 2007 financial crash, according to Mr Halstead. ""No-one sees the bottle, or pays much attention, so there was the easy trade-down from champagne [to prosecco] if you were hosting an event,"" he says. Supermarkets were also quick to jump on the bubble bandwagon, adding prosecco to the ""dine in"" meal deals designed to mimic restaurant-quality food without the hefty bill, says Ms Russell. But the marketing genius was really in its pricing, with many chains offering bottles at discounted prices. ""If you can't afford to go on holiday or go out to dinner, the idea of having a mini celebration with change from Â£10 is a strong pull,"" Mr Halstead adds. Georgie Pilling, Katie Matkin and Sofia Meadowcroft are all prosecco fans It's a move that has paid off for major retailers. Lidl has seen sales of its own brand bottles grow by 79% in January 2017 compared to the same month last year, while Marks and Spencer's prosecco sales saw a 25% rise from 2015 to 2016. Waitrose saw a 12% increase in sales since last year and said the nation's love of the sparkling wine has grown so much they will be releasing a prosecco turkey in time for Christmas. So is prosecco here to stay or will it fall flat like its once fashionable Spanish counterpart, cava? Paul Creamer, wine buyer at Loki Wines in Birmingham, says they no longer stock the once-popular sparkling wine as there is no demand for it. He says cava is having a personality crisis and believes it would take a marketing miracle for it to get back on the same playing field as its counterparts. ""The problem is that the global image of champagne is very well managed compared to that of cava,"" Mr Creamer explains. ""It would take a seismic shift in cava marketing to reposition it in a different niche or price tier with the wine market."" Alex Windsor and Sophie Andrews spotted a van-sized gap in the prosecco market Food and drink journalist Paul Fulford thinks cava is often associated with an older generation of people that first holidayed in Spain - in a similar way people associate sherry with their grandparents. But he says cava is actually better quality than prosecco. ""It has a more superior taste because of the way it is made, the fizz is more integrated, making the [bubbles] less likely to disappear. And the flavour is better,"" he adds. Similar methods are used in the manufacture of champagne, cava and prosecco, but withcrucial differences that set each other apart,external. Champagne uses the ""methode champenoise"", which requires it be made from the region's grapes and fermented in the bottle for at least 15 months; cava is formed from a blend of wines and ferments for nine months as per the ""methode tradicional"", while prosecco implements the ""Italian Charmant"" method - fermenting in steel tanks. But can you really taste the difference? At Albert's Schloss in Manchester, Katie Matkin thinks so. ""I've had champagne before and it tastes heavy, I didn't like it,"" she says. ""Whereas everyone seems to like prosecco. It's cheap, it's light, it's easy, you can add things like syrups."" Prosecco's versatility as both a standalone drink and mixer has helped broaden its appeal. Rather than fall foul of nostalgia it has embraced it, even aiding in the resurrection of the Aperol Spritz - a cocktail popular in the late 1980s which has reappeared in countless pubs and bars. Looking to the future, there are now skinny, vegan and organic versions of the drink available, as well as sweets, candles, bubble bath and even ""pawsecco"" for your pet. So is it just flavour of the month? Mr Fulford thinks not. ""It feels like indulgence without the extravagance, most of the varieties are so easy to drink and it suits everyone's palate,"" he says. ""It is here to stay, it's ingrained in people's drinking habits."" Perhaps prosecco's popularity is a combination of things - its marketability, the ceremony, and the perception it gives. But fizz fan Tamara Poxon thinks there is a simpler explanation. ""When you compare it to the price of champagne, there's no reason why somebody wouldn't drink prosecco."" The Aperol Spritz, made with prosecco, soda and the herbal liqueur from which it takes its name, is popular once again Were the English first to invent bubbly?

Scotland's top police officer steps aside,"Mr Gormley was appointed as chief constable of Police Scotland in January 2016 The chief constable of Police Scotland, Phil Gormley, has stepped aside after further allegations of gross misconduct were made against him. Itemerged in Julythat Mr Gormley was being investigated by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) over bullying allegations. He has now taken ""special leave"" after a further complaint was made. Mr Gormley denies the allegations, and said he intends to resume his duties in the future. He was appointed as chief constable of Police Scotland - which is the second largest force in the UK after the Metropolitan Police in London - in January of last year, and his contract still has 16 months to run. In a statement, he said: ""I have been notified by the SPA of a complaint made against me. This complaint originates from a member of the Force Executive. ""In the interests of the office of chief constable and the broader interests of Police Scotland, I have sought and been granted special leave to enable this matter to be properly assessed. ""I deny and reject the allegations and will co-operate with the SPA's assessment and procedures. It is my intention to resume my full duties when this matter has been resolved."" In July, Pirc began an inquiry following allegations made by a police superintendent of bullying which, if proved, would amount to gross misconduct. Last month a second complaint - by a rank and file officer - was received by the SPA which is considering whether to pass it to Pirc. And today the chief constable has been told Pirc is investigating a third complaint. This came from either a senior civilian manager or an assistant or deputy chief constable. The Force Executive is Police Scotland's senior management team, and is made up of officers ranked at Assistant Chief Constable and higher, as well as the force's deputy chief officer and the director of information and communications technology. The latest complaint against Mr Gormley was passed to Pirc by the SPA, with the commissioner concluding that the claims would amount to gross misconduct if found to be true. Astatement released by Pirc,externalconfirmed it was alsostill investigating the earlier allegations of misconduct,externalmade against the chief constable. The statement added: ""Once each investigation is concluded, the commissioner will submit a report to the SPA containing a summary of the evidence and providing an opinion on whether the misconduct allegations about the chief constable should be referred to a misconduct hearing. Police Scotland is the second largest force in the UK after the Metropolitan Police ""Where the Authority determines that there is a case to answer for either misconduct or gross misconduct, it must refer the misconduct allegation to a misconduct hearing."" The SPA, which holds Police Scotland to account, said it would keep the decision to grant the chief constable leave under review on a four-weekly basis. Iain Livingstone, who is Mr Gormley's deputy, will take over the top job until further notice. Mr Livingstone is due to retire later this year.

He had formerly been deputy director of the National Crime Agency, and had served as the chief constable of Norfolk Police. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie had been among those calling for Mr Gormley to stand aside when the initial allegations were made against him in July. Mr Rennie said: ""It has taken too long but Phil Gormley has made the right decision to temporarily stand aside and I commend him on that. ""The investigation needs to be completed effectively and swiftly so that Police Scotland can move on. ""There is a lot to fix in Police Scotland and we need effective leadership to fix it.""

Girl's organs donated to record 8 people,"Jemima's organ donations have helped five different children around the country. A 13-year-old girl who died from a brain aneurysm has helped  a record eight different people, including five children, through organ donation. Jemima Layzell, from Somerset, who died in 2012, donated her heart, pancreas, lungs, kidneys, small bowel and liver. Jemima's parents said she was clever, compassionate and creative - and would have been ""very proud of her legacy"". NHS Blood and Transplant said no other donor had helped as many people. Jemima collapsed during preparations for her mum's 38th birthday party and died four days later at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. Her heart, small bowel, and pancreas were transplanted into three different people while two people received her kidneys. Her liver was split and transplanted into a further two people, and both of her lungs were transplanted into one patient. Normally, a donation results in 2.6 transplants - eight is very unusual. Jemima's mum Sophy Layzell, 43, a drama tutor, and dad Harvey Layzell, 49, managing director of a building firm, said they knew Jemima was willing to be a donor because they had spoken about it a couple of weeks before her death, after someone they knew died in a crash. Sophy said: ""They were on the register but their organs couldn't be donated because of the circumstances of their death. ""Jemima had never heard of organ donation before and found it a little bit unsettling but totally understood the importance of it."" She said they still found the decision to donate their daughter's organs hard, but felt it was right. Jemima's family have set up a trust in her name to promote organ donation ""Everyone wants their child to be special and unique and this among other things makes us very proud. ""Shortly after Jemima died, we watched a programme about children awaiting heart transplants and being fitted with Berlin Hearts in Great Ormond Street Hospital. ""It affirmed for us that saying 'no' would have been denying eight other people the chance for life, especially over Jemima's heart, which Harvey had felt uncomfortable about donating at the time."" An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. It can develop anywhere in the body, but most commonly in the brain and around the heart. In the brain, if the ballooning blood vessel bursts, extensive bleeding causes severe brain damage - and usually results in death or serious disability. There are usually no signs of the problem before the aneurysm ruptures. Aneurysms in children are rare and it is still not clear why blood vessels weaken to make them form. Jemima's parents said it was very important for families to talk about organ donation. ""Every parent's instinct is to say no, as we are programmed to protect our child. It's only with prior knowledge of Jemima's agreement that we were able to say yes. ""Jemima was lovely - clever, funny, compassionate and creative - and we feel sure she would be very proud of her legacy,"" Sophy said. Sophy, Harvey, and Jemima's sister Amelia, aged 17, now runThe Jemima Layzell Trust,external, which helps young people with brain injuries and also promotes organ donation. NHS Blood and Transplant said hundreds of people were still dying unnecessarily while waiting for a transplant because too many families said no to organ donation. Last year, 457 people died waiting for a transplant, including 14 children. There are currently 6,414 people on the transplant waiting list, including 176 children. In 2015, 22-year-oldTom Wilson died in a freak accident,externalafter he was hit on the head by a hockey stick. His donated organs, as well as skin, bone and tissue, are thought to have helped the lives of around 50 people. Join the conversation onour Facebook page,external.

Police request Madeleine inquiry funds,"Madeleine McCann disappeared in Portugal in 2007 Police have asked the government for more money to investigate the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, weeks before funding is due to end. More than Â£11m has been spent on the Metropolitan Police hunt, but funding will run out at the end of the month. In April, the force said it wasstill pursuing a critical line of inquiry, 10 years after Madeleine's disappearance in Portugal, aged three. A family spokesman said her parents were ""encouraged"" by the request. The Home Office said the application would be considered. What happened the night Madeleine went missing? Police funds extended for six months Madeleine, whose parents Kate and Gerry are from Rothley, Leicestershire, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in May 2007. The Met's Operation Grange has been helping with the search for clues about what happened to her since 2011. In April, the force's Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, said they still hoped they could provide answers. He said: ""I know we have a significant line of inquiry which is worth pursuing, and because it's worth pursuing it could provide an answer, but until we've gone through it I won't know whether we are going to get there or not."" Kate and Gerry McCann have worked to try to find their daughter - including by issuing pictures of how she may have looked later on in childhood Mr Rowley said there was no ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine was alive or dead. He also declined to reveal the nature of the working theories or whether any suspects were currently being considered, but said the investigating team were still receiving evidence and new information from members of the public on a daily basis. In March, the Home Office granted police Â£85,000 to cover ""operational costs"" between April and September this year. The McCann spokesman added: ""Naturally, Kate and Gerry hope the Met request is granted. ""They are encouraged that there remains work to be done that requires extra funding and they remain very grateful to all Operation Grange officers who are continuing to look for their daughter."" A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ""Funding is in place until the end of September.

Should you let a 'robot' manage your retirement income?,"Would you be better off with an automated financial adviser? Automated financial advice delivered by computer algorithm - often dubbed robo-advice - is a fast-growing business. But should you entrust your life savings to a computer? For many of us, talking about money is embarrassing - revealing our income and spending habits can feel like disrobing in public. So it's no wonder seeking investment advice from an impersonal, unbiased computer program is proving so popular. Consultancy firm Accenture found that 68% of global consumers would be happy to use robo-advice to plan for retirement, with many feeling it would be faster, cheaper, and more impartial than human advice. ""Many of our clients say they feel awkward in face-to-face meetings, preferring an online experience where they don't feel judged,"" says Lynn Smith, a director of robo-advice firm Wealth Wizards. So how does robo-advice work and is it really any better than traditional financial advice? Robo-adviser firms use algorithms to analyse your financial situation and goals and then work out an investment plan to suit you. Basically, you answer lots of questions online about your income, expenses, family situation, attitude to risk, and so on, and then the algorithm allocates your savings to a mix of investments, from index funds that aim to mimic a particular stock market index or sector, to fixed-income bonds. Robo-adviser algorithms allocate your cash to a balanced mix of investments As some investments are riskier than others, younger investors will generally have their portfolios weighted towards higher-risk, higher-growth investments, whereas older investors approaching retirement will see the balance of their portfolios weighted towards lower-risk, fixed income investments, such as government bonds or gilts. Joe Ziemer, vice president of communications at Betterment, a US robo-adviser with more than $9bn under management, says: ""The Betterment service takes your information and uses a series of algorithms to create an asset allocation plan, which might be, for example, 90% equities and 10% bonds for a retirement saver."" The crucial point is that these algorithms work everything out for you at much lower cost than many traditional wealth advisory firms. Wealth Wizards, for example, typically charges Â£65 for investments up to Â£30,000, and 0.30%, or Â£300, on a Â£100,000 investment pot. Betterment charges 0.25% a year. That's peanuts compared to human advisers' fees, which come in at about Â£580 for advice on a Â£200-a-month pension contribution, or Â£1,000-Â£2,000 for guidance on what to do with your Â£100,000 pot when your retire, according to UK adviser network Unbiased. Many of these robo-advisers will offer human advice as well - for any extra fee - if your finances are more complicated or you need tax planning services as well. ""When a client needs advice spanning a number of different regulatory regimes, human advice will be required,"" says John Perks, managing director of life and pensions at UK insurer LV, which launched its Retirement Wizard robo-advice service two years ago. Many of us are facing poverty in retirement because we're not saving enough, yet living longer So could these cheaper investment services encourage more of us to save more? The powers that be certainly hope so. World Economic Forum figures show the collective retirement savings gap of the world's largest economies will hit $400tn (Â£307tn) by 2050, meaning a lot of people could be spending their retirements in poverty. Governments are concerned that this might then place an unsustainable burden on welfare systems. Robo-advice is certainly growing in popularity. Market research aggregator Statista says the US market will grow 29% per year between now and 2021, and forecasts that the number of Chinese investors using robo-advice services will jump from two million to 79.4 million in the same period. While Consultancy AT Kearney forecasts that robo-advisers will be managing $2.2tn within five years, representing a 68% annual growth rate. Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen? Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think? How your digital self could 'live' on after you die And these services are only likely to become more sophisticated as the data from money management and banking apps are fed in to the algorithms and artificial intelligence is added to the mix, experts believe. ""If you knew everything about a person, you could wire up the back office to do the same as a human adviser. The fact find is the difficult bit,"" says Ms Smith. But are we really happy to ditch the human adviser completely? No, is the short answer. Accenture finds that a significant proportion of us still want human interaction, particularly if our finances are complex. Successful financial services firms will need a strategy ""that seamlessly integrates technology, branch networks and staff"", argues Accenture's Piercarlo Gera, senior managing director, distribution and marketing services. While Betterment provides 100% of its advice online, clients can still talk to a human being when they want to. Betterment claims it's investment portfolios are based on Nobel Prize-winning research Even those who prefer face-to-face interaction could still benefit from the robo-advice phenomenon, however. ""Using robo-advice can cut the time it takes an adviser to provide regulated advice for a client from nine hours down to just 90 minutes,"" LV's Mr Perks says. ""This could transform companies' back office operations, allowing them to offer a cheaper service."" But what about investment performance? Are algorithms choosing cheap investments that merely track markets better at making you money than professional fund managers trying to back winners on your behalf? The truth is that only about a quarter of funds managed by clever humans outperform the market as a whole, so when you take into account the much higher management fees you pay for that level of service, the performance difference is likely to be marginal for most of us. The robots may be coming, but in this case at least, they seem to be on the side of the small investor trying to save for a comfortable retirement.

Deadly earthquake strikes off Mexico,"This video can not be played A bowling alley shakes in Tuxtla Gutierrez, 240km from the epicentre An earthquake described by Mexico's president as the country's strongest in a century has struck off the southern coast, killing at least 36 people. The quake, which President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto said measured 8.2, struck in the Pacific, about 87km (54 miles) south-west of Pijijiapan. Oaxaca and Chiapas states bore the brunt of the damage and dozens of aftershocks have been reported. A tsunami warning was initially issued but later lifted. The quake, which struck at 23:50 local time on Thursday (04:50 GMT Friday), was felt hundreds of miles away in Mexico City, with buildings swaying and people running into the street. President PeÃ±a Nieto said about 50 million Mexicans would have felt the tremor and that the death toll might rise. His office said he would travel to Chiapas to survey the damage. BBC in depth - Earthquakes A history of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? At least 25 people were killed in Mexico's Oaxaca state, 17 of them in the town of JuchitÃ¡n, officials said. Another seven were reported killed in Chiapas and three more, including two children, died in Tabasco state. President PeÃ±a Nieto said more than 200 people had been injured. At least one person was killed in Guatemala, its president has said. Images showed collapsed buildings across Oaxaca. In JuchitÃ¡n, the municipal palace and a number of other structures were destroyed or badly damaged. Parts of the municipal palace in JuchitÃ¡n were levelled A hotel collapsed in the town of MatÃ­as Romero, Oaxaca state, but it is not clear if there were any casualties. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center,external(PTWC) had originally said that tsunami waves of more than 3m (9ft) were possible along the coasts of Mexico, with threats also facing El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica.  It said later that waves only 0.7m high reached the Mexican coast. Some coastal areas were evacuated as a precaution. BBC's Lourdes Heredia The earthquake has brought back memories of the tremor of 1985, which left massive destruction in Mexico City and a death toll of 10,000. This explains the scenes of panic on the streets of the capital, more than 1,000km away from the epicentre. The government does not expect the same scale of physical destruction, as the states most affected are in the poorest and least-developed regions. Chiapas is the southernmost state, along the Guatemalan border. It's a very mountainous, remote area, where 25% of the population belong to indigenous groups. It's also much visited by tourists seeking to explore some of the best and most well-preserved archaeological treasures, such as the ancient Mayan city of Palenque. At magnitude 8.2, the quake outstrips the deadly 1985 tremor that hit close to Mexico City and caused thousands of deaths. TheUS Geological Survey,externalmeasured the latest quake slightly lower, at 8.1, saying it struck at a depth of 70km. Soldiers stood guard after a hotel collapsed in the town of Matias Romero, Oaxaca state The coastal town of Puerto Madero, Mexico, was among those evacuated amid fears of a tsunami Damage in the Mexican city of Oaxaca, about 300km from the epicentre The tremor was strong enough to bring down buildings near Mexico City Mr PeÃ±a Nieto said the Salina Cruz refinery on the southern coast had temporarily suspended operations. Schools were closed in 11 Mexican states. Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent This is the biggest quake experienced anywhere in 2017. Going on the statistics, you would expect at least one magnitude 8 to occur somewhere on the planet each year. It occurred where the Pacific ocean floor is drawn under Mexico and Guatemala. A great slab of rock, known as the Cocos tectonic plate, is driving towards the coast at a rate of 75mm per year. As it jerks downwards into the Earth's interior, about 200km offshore, large tremors are the inevitable outcome. There have been three magnitude 7s in 2017, with a 7.9 recorded deep under Papua New Guinea back in January. This latest event, being an 8.2, is nearly three times as energetic. That tells you something about how the magnitude scale works. Fortunately, this event was deep, too. The rupture, which will have ripped across more than 100km of fault line, was down at 70km. That will have limited some of the shaking, but as we've seen there is still extensive damage. Some electricity cuts were reported in the capital and social media video showed lampposts and the famous Angel of Independence statue swaying violently. Journalist Franc Contreras, who is in Mexico City, told the BBC: ""You could hear loud cracks in the concrete. It sounded like a giant wooden branch being just broken open violently. Guatemala's Red Cross tweeted damage in the town of Tacana, close to the Mexican border ""People were streaming out of the hallways here. And everybody walking out single file into the streets, trying to avoid overhead high power lines."" Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales appealed for calm on national television and in a Twitter post. ""We have reports of some damage and the death of one person, even though we still don't have exact details,"" Associated Press quoted Mr Morales as saying. Cindy Lamothe, who is in the Guatemalan city of Antigua, told the BBC: ""It was swaying so intensely it felt like we were in a boat and I heard neighbours screaming through the walls... it lasted almost three minutes."" Mexico is currently also being threatened on its eastern coast by Hurricane Katia. The category one hurricane is about 300km south-east of Tampico and has sustained winds of 140km/h the National Hurricane Center says.

The UK, France, and the Netherlands have sent ships, rescue teams and emergency supplies to their territories.The British Virgin Islands have also been hit, with governor Gus Jaspert saying he is ""truly heartbroken""at news of fatalities and injuries. A state of emergency has been declared there. Health officials fear disease could spread quickly in areas of the Caribbean where drinking water and sanitation services have broken down.Nasa has recorded images of the eye of the storm passing over the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A strong earthquake has struck off the southern Pacific coast of Mexico, leading to tsunami warnings for Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama and Honduras.The quake, which reached magnitude 8, was felt hundreds of miles away in Mexico City, where buildings shook.

Bats 'tricked' into flying into buildings,"Greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) were studied in experiments Modern buildings with large expanses of glass or mirrored surfaces are ""potentially dangerous"" for bats, research suggests. Scientists are calling for monitoring of the risks, particularly in areas where bats congregate in large numbers. Bats have a remarkable ability to fly at high speeds in the dark avoiding natural hazards such as trees. Yet, smooth, vertical surfaces such as glass windows create a ""blind spot"" for the flying mammals, a study shows. ""Bats predominately rely on their echolocation system to forage, orientate, and navigate,"" says a team led by Dr Stefan Greif of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology near Munich in Germany. ""We found that bats can mistake smooth, vertical surfaces as clear flight paths, repeatedly colliding with them, likely as a result of their acoustic mirror properties."" Bats use echolocation to detect obstacles in flight, find their way into roosts and forage for food. As they fly, they make calls and listen to the returning echoes to build up a sonic map of their surroundings. Bats can flit through natural obstacles, such as forests, which return some echo back to them. However, vertical mirroring surfaces such as window panes appear to trick them into thinking that the way ahead is clear. Prof Gareth Jones of Bristol University, who is not connected with the study, is an expert on bat echolocation. ""Sound reflects away in front of a bat flying over water, and the flight route ahead is often clear, or interrupted with obvious targets like trees that can be detected by echolocation,"" he explained. ""Vertical surfaces seem to reflect sound in ways that make the surface difficult to detect, and increase collision risk."" A colony of greater mouse-eared bats Smooth vertical surfaces are rare in bats' natural habitat. However, they treat horizontal, smooth surfaces like water, and attempt to drink from them. To investigate the issue, researchers analysed the flight behaviour of greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) in dark flight tunnels. The researchers placed a metal plate either vertically or horizontally in the corner of the tunnel and watched what happened. Of 21 individual bats, 19 collided with the vertical plate at least once but never with the horizontal plate. When the bats collided with the vertical plate, they were producing fewer calls and approaching the plate at a more acute angle and at higher flight speeds compared with the bats that avoided collision. Similar findings were found with three species of bat in the wild. No bats were injured in the experiment. The findings, published in the journal,Science,external, may explain why injured or dead bats are sometimes found near buildings. The researchers are calling for more evidence to be gathered on the scale of the threat to bats. They say smooth vertical services should be avoided at sites where bats migrate, forage or raise their young. ""Only if we identify and evaluate the real extent of collisions with acoustic mirrors can we avoid or mitigate potential detrimental effects on bat populations,"" said Dr Greif and co-researchers. Commenting on the research, Prof Kate Jones of University College London, said: ""As we try and encourage more sustainable and nature-friendly cities, it is really important to understand how city design will impact wildlife populations and this study provides some key information for bats."" Bats make up one fifth of all land mammals. They are among the most endangered of the world's animals, because much of their habitat has been destroyed. As important pollinators for many plants, and key predators of insects, their loss has serious consequences for the planet. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"Australians surrender almost 26,000 guns","More than 400 weapons have been surrendered each day since July Australians have handed in nearly 26,000 firearms in the nation's first gun amnesty since its landmark response to a mass shooting in 1996. The amnestybegan on 1 Julyto help counter a growing terrorism threat and an influx of arms in the country. It is illegal to own an unregistered firearm in Australia. Those caught outside the amnesty period face fines of up to A$280,000 (Â£172,000, $225,000) and up to 14 years in jail. The current programme, running until 30 September, means Australians can surrender unregistered firearms and related items without fear of prosecution. Justice Minister Michael Keenan said the ""great result"" so far would make the nation safer. Police estimate there are as many as 260,000 illicit guns in Australia, with some used in organised crime as well as recent terror incidents. Mr Keenan cited the example of Man Haron Monis, the perpetrator of aSydney cafe siegein 2014, who used an unregistered shotgun which had entered Australia in the 1950s. Australians turned in 643,726 firearms in 1996 and 1997 following the killing of 35 people in the Tasmaniantown of Port Arthur- the nation's worst and most recent mass shooting. The incident also led to a ban on semi-automatic and automatic weapons in the country.

Ethnic minority offenders 'face bias',"The criminal justice system has ""deep-seated issues to address"", says David Lammy Young offenders from ethnic minorities will become ""the next generation"" of criminals unless the justice system is reformed, says MP David Lammy. A review led by him,externalfound the system in England and Wales is biased and discriminates in treatment of people from ethnic minority backgrounds. The Labour MP has made 35 recommendations, including delaying or dropping some prosecutions. The government said it will ""look carefully"" at the suggestions. People from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds make up 25% of the prison population in England and Wales and 41% of the youth justice system, despite these groups being 14% of the general population, the review says. It has highlighted various ""concerning"" statistics, including a rise in the proportion of first-time offenders from these backgrounds to 19% - up from 11% - in the past 10 years, and the same increase in the proportion of young people reoffending. Recommendations from the report included allowing low-level offenders to ""defer"" prosecution and opt for a rehabilitation programme before entering a plea, more gathering of data on the ethnicity and religion of offenders, and the introduction of targets for a more representative workforce within the justice system. Mr Lammy said it was well established that there was an over-representation of people from minority backgrounds in the criminal justice system, but his report was about looking at their ""treatment and outcomes"". Whilst he does not believe all of the blame lies at the door of the justice system, noting the ""broadly proportionate"" decision on charging by the Crown Prosecution Service, Mr Lammy said: ""It is clear to me that BAME individuals still face bias."" MP David Lammy has made 35 recommendations to reform the criminal justice system Trust is one of the major issues, according to the report. It says individuals from these backgrounds do not trust the advice provided by their solicitors or police officers when it comes to pleading guilty. As a result, the rate of black defendants pleading not guilty in Crown Courts between 2006 and 2014 was 41%, compared with 31% for white defendants - leading to more trials and longer sentences. Also, when in prison, many BAME men and women believe they are actively discriminated against, which Mr Lammy says ""contributes to an atmosphere of 'us' and 'them' and an urge to rebel, rather than reform"". By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent The most striking recommendation in this detailed and well-evidenced report is the idea of deferred prosecutions. It's similar to the ""conditional cautioning"" scheme under which people escape trial if they admit their offence and agree to undergo rehabilitation, do unpaid work or pay compensation. The Lammy report also referred to Operation Turning Point - a deferred prosecution pilot project run in the West Midlands which resulted in fewer violent offenders committing further crimes compared with those taken through the courts. If rolled out, the programme would be applied to offenders from all ethnic backgrounds, though those from BAME communities, who are disproportionately represented, could benefit most. But its success would depend on probation, health and justice agencies working together, and working intensively with offenders.  And that requires investment at a time when budgets are tight. His biggest concern, however, is the youth justice system, as whilst youth offending has fallen significantly in the past 10 years, there is now a larger share of young people from ethnic minorities offending for the first time, reoffending and serving a custodial sentence. The report points out black children are more than twice as likely to grow up in a lone parent family, and black and mixed ethnic boys are more likely than white boys to be permanently excluded from school.

Mr Lammy said the youth justice system seemed to have ""given up on parenting"" - saying behind many young offenders are adults who neglect or exploit them. Mr Lammy said responsibility must be taken by adults - and the youth justice system ""should be more rooted in local communities"" where parents can play a stronger role. Prisons are products of society, he said: ""The criminal justice system has deep-seated issues to address, but there is only so much it can do."" More data should be recorded and published on both ethnicity and religion for better scrutiny of the Criminal Justice System's approach The Crown Prosecution Service should consider its approach to gang prosecutions, making sure people's actions are punished, not their associations Modern slavery legislation should be reviewed to see if it can help prevent the exploitation of vulnerable young men and women Identifying information should be redacted to make for ""race-blind"" decisions on cases All sentencing remarks made in Crown Court should be published, along with a system of online feedback on judges Hiring of new judges, with a national target of a representative judiciary of 2025, along with a more representative prison staff Low-level offenders should be allowed to ""defer"" prosecution and opt for a rehabilitation programme before entering a plea - a model used in the West Midlands, which Mr Lammy says has ""produced impressive results and should be rolled out across the country"" Young offenders should be assessed for their maturity to inform sentencing decisions The prison service should take a ""problem solving"" approach for dealing with complaints and ensure fairness for prisoners when it comes to incentives and earned privileges, Reformed offenders should be able to apply to have their criminal records ""sealed"" - so they need not disclose their offence to a employer Junior Smart, who founded the St Giles' Trust SOS project - which supports young people in the justice system - after spending five years in prison for drugs offences, welcomed the report. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The cultural understanding amongst young people is you don't trust the police and you don't talk to the police. ""There is that lack and we need them to come forward, and we need to make sure that victims are supported. ""And the fact is the criminal justice system doesn't reflect the diversity and how criminality is evolved over time... ""It is not lack of will - these people have got the best intentions for these young people - but they don't reflect the diversity that we are seeing and they don't understand the complexity."" Malcolm Richardson, chairman of the Magistrates Association, said there was not sufficient evidence to pinpoint why the disparity occurs, but he agreed the lack of trust in the system needed to be addressed.

Labour shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said Mr Lammy's recommendations could ""play an important role in eradicating discrimination"". Justice Secretary David Lidington said the government would ""look very carefully"" at the review's findings and recommendations before responding fully. Gareth Wilson, the National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for equality and diversity, said he would work with the Home Office and College of Policing to make more data on ethnicity available for scrutiny - but also work on making the force more representative. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said the CPS would consider the review's recommendations.

Amazon kicks off competition for new HQ,"Amazon's current headquarters in Seattle has fuelled an economic boom Amazon says it wants to build a massive second headquarters in North America, sparking immediate competition from rival cities to attract what could be billions of dollars in investment. Officials from Toronto, Texas, Maryland and Chicago were among those who said they planned to try to win Amazon's new venture. The e-commerce giant is seeking a base for as many as 50,000 workers. It said it plans to spend $5bn (Â£3.8bn) on the project over 15-17 years. Opportunities to compete for headquarters projects are nearly unheard of in the US at the scale Amazon envisions, experts said. By comparison General Electric plans to move 800 people to a new headquarters in Boston. ""It is very rare,"" said Craig Richard, vice-chair of the International Economic Development Council. ""You don't have a lot of these that happen so when the occasion arises... economic developers jump at it."" Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said the headquarters would be a ""full equal"" to its headquarters in Seattle. ""Amazon HQ2 will bring billions of dollars in up-front and ongoing investments, and tens of thousands of high-paying jobs,"" he added. ""We're excited to find a second home."" The firm said it is looking for a site in a city area with more than one million people.  It wants a location with access to mass transit that is close to major highways and an international airport. The firm also said incentives offered by local governments would be a ""significant"" factor in the decision. Locations such as Austin, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, and Toronto shot to the top of list of potential places. Austin is home to Whole Foods, the grocery chain that Amazon recently acquired. Amazon has received millions in subsidies as it expanded its warehouse network Deciding to build a second headquarters speaks to Amazon's massive growth as well as the breadth of its business, which includes logistics, retail, media and cloud computing, analysts said. It is unusual for a firm to opt to conduct a headquarters search in the public eye. But Amazon has a long history of seeking government support for expansions. The firm won more than $240m in subsidies in the US between Jan 2015 and Dec 2016 for its warehouse network, according to a study by the non-profit Good Jobs First. Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, said a public competition is a negotiating tactic designed to yield better offers. ""Amazon may already know where it wants to go but even if it does, it can stage an auction to up the ante with that place it likes the best,"" he said. The firm may also be sending a political message by not limiting the search to the US, analysts say. Mr Bezos is among several corporate leaders to have broken with US President Donald Trump on issues such as climate change and immigration. ""It's natural for a US company to say we're thinking about creating a new US location,"" said Gregg Wassmansdorf, a senior managing director at Newmark Knight Frank, who has worked on corporate relocations. ""It takes a little more intention to say we're looking at a North American option."" Amazon said officials should submit proposals - including economic incentive packages - by October 19. The firm plans to settle on the location next year. Mayors such as John Tory of Toronto issued messages touting their towns, calling his city a ""prime candidate"". Allow Twitter content?

Officials elsewhere said they were not deterred by the prospect of tough negotiations over a possible incentive package. ""We know it will be a big number but we're going to be aggressive in going after it,"" said Steve Pennington, managing director for business and industry sector development at the Maryland Commerce Department. ""I think everyone will be very aggressive.""
