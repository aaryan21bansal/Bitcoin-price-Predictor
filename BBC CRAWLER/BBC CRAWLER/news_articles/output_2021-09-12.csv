"Health tax will hit poor families hard, HMRC warns","Plans to raise National Insurance to fund health and social care could lead to the breakdown of struggling families, the UK's tax authority says. Ministers announced the tax hike this week to pay for an Â£86,000 personal cap on lifetime social care costs in England, and tackle NHS backlogs. HMRC analysis has predicted it will have a ""significant"" impact on wages, inflation, and company profits. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was the fairest way to fund investment. But also speaking on Sunday, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth called the proposals a ""punishing unfair tax rise on working people"". Social care changes at-a-glance Landlord tax could help pay for social care - Starmer What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? The 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance (NI), a tax paid by workers and employers, will begin next April, before becoming a separate Health and Social Care Levy from April 2023. Along with a 1.25 percentage point hike in dividend tax from next April, it is expected to raise Â£12bn a year for the next three years. Analysis prepared for the government,externalby HMRC, published after MPs backed the changes last week, said in 2022-23 a worker on the median basic rate taxpayer's income of Â£24,100 would be expected to pay an additional Â£180 per year. Employees on the median higher rate taxpayer's income of Â£67,100 would be expected to pay an additional Â£715, the document added. It added: ""There may be an impact on family formation, stability or breakdown as individuals, who are currently just about managing financially, will see their disposable income reduce."" The analysis also forecast the increase would impact companies' decisions on hiring staff, and setting salaries. And it said turning the NI increase into a separate levy - meaning it would appear as a separate line on workers' pay slips - would mean extra staff costs for HMRC. The majority of the Â£36bn fund raised by the rise over the next three years will go towards tackling the backlog of NHS cases, which has worsened during the Covid pandemic. A smaller portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system. The government has promised the share going to social care will increase after that, but has not specified exactly by how much. Labour has criticised the tax hike as unfair to working people, and said it would not do enough to improve care offered in the social care system. The party said it backed more spending on health and social care - but has been coming under pressure to specify how they would pay for it instead. Leader Sir Keir Starmer recently said the money could be raisedthrough taxing landlords. He has also said it could be funded through ""wealth taxes"", but has not set out details. On Sunday, Mr Ashworth told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that improving care for people in their own homes, so that they did not have to move into a care home, could save Â£2.5bn a year that could be spent on ""the front line"". Speaking on the same programme, Mr Javid defended the tax hike, adding it would make government support for social care ""more generous"" and said paying for the changes through higher borrowing would be ""wrong"". ""The way this has been done, through a broad-based progressive tax, is the fairest way possible to support us all, for our health needs and our care needs,"" he added. After backing the proposals last week, MPs will vote on the legislation to set up the new health and social care levy next week. What is happening to the cap on care costs?

Ryanair: Holiday prices likely to rise sharply soon,"The boss of budget airline Ryanair has warned holiday prices are likely to rise sharply next year as consumer demand for travel rebounds. Michael O'Leary toldThe Sunday Times,externalfewer flights, inflation and more taxes would drive airfares up. ""I think there will be a dramatic recovery in holiday tourism within Europe next year,"" he said. ""And the reason why I think prices will be dramatically higher is that there's less capacity."" Ryanair's short-haul rivals had all had to reduce their fleets because of the pandemic, he added. Ryanair predicts rapid rebound in airline travel Seven more destinations are on the green list Air travel yet to fully restart, says UK industry ""Take out Thomas Cook (six million seats), Flybe (eight million seats), Norwegian (nearly 24 million seats)... Alitalia's reducing its fleet by 40%,"" said Mr O'Leary. ""There is going to be about 20% less short-haul capacity in Europe in 2022, with a dramatic recovery in demand."" Ryanair is planning to open a new base at Newcastle International Airport next year, creating at least 60 aviation jobs. Its rival EasyJet meanwhile has closed its basesat Stansted, London Southend and Newcastle airports, and from 1 November,Ryanair will cease all operations at Southend, meaning no passenger planes will use the airport. This comes as economists predict inflation will continue to rise over the rest of the year, which Mr O'Leary said was a factor in increasing airfares, as well asthe threat of increasing environmental taxes. Airlines say bookings have not recovered sufficiently, despite easing Covid restrictions However, to combat this he intended to cut prices for winter 2020 in order to ""grab market share from everywhere"". Airlines have been hit hard by lockdowns and travel restrictions around the world, with many announcing job cuts. EasyJet said in May that itplanned up to 4,500 job cutsas it struggled with the collapse in air travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. It has started to fly passengers again but does not expect 2019 levels of demand to be reached again until 2023. Multiple airlines have warned that thousands more jobs could be at risk if the government's furlough scheme was not extended after 30 September,as bookings have not recovered. They have also criticised the government for its ""confusing"" traffic-light travel list system. Canada, Switzerland and Denmark were among the latest countries to join the UK's green travel list. Meanwhile, the government is planning to overhaul the traffic light system in the coming weeks, the BBC has been told. Tim Alderslade from industry body Airlines UK said: ""There are over half a million direct jobs that rely on aviation and we're now entering the lean winter period. Something may have to give, without the furlough support that is coming to an end this month. ""This summer was such a missed opportunity - alone across Europe we insisted on expensive and complex PCR tests and it's no wonder demand remained weak. Until we stop being such an outlier it will be impossible to get back to anything like 2019 levels of trade."" Ryanair predicts rapid rebound in airline travel How are travel rules being relaxed?

"UK still lagging on climate policy, report says","Britain is lagging way behind its schedule for cutting carbon emissions in the run-up to November's climate summit in Glasgow, a report says. Think tank the Green Alliance says current plans will deliver less than a quarter of the cuts needed to meet the UKâs 2030 climate goal. Little progress has been made in areas such as farming (a 7% improvement), power (12%), and waste (15%), it warns. The government said the UK is committed to meeting future climate commitments. The UK has vowed to cut emissions by 78% by 2035 - a world-leading target. Ministers promise that the coming Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) and net zero strategy - an over-arching plan to de-carbonise the whole economy - will deliver carbon-cutting policies in time for November's summit, known asCOP26. Poorest countries fear not reaching UK for COP But Caterina Brandmayr, from the Green Alliance, said: âThis is a make-or-break moment for the government. âCOP26 will fail without the major emitters making genuine commitments in these final 50 days - and as president of COP, the UK has to lead the way to raise ambition globally. âUnless the net-zero strategy and CSR meet the scale of the challenge and opportunity, the UK will be headed into Glasgow with little to show by way of progress on cutting its emissions in this crucial decade.â Its report said over the past six months, transport has been the best performing government department. It is now almost half way to hitting its departmental target, thanks largely to plans to electrify motoring. As other departments lag behind, the reportâs authors are urging swift government action in five areas: Reducing the amount of high-carbon materials used in the economy â such as steel and cement Producing farm subsidy policies that will capture CO2 emissions Improving transport further by setting out a legal framework for the transition to electric vehicles and stopping airport expansion Producing an ambitious heat and buildings strategy The buildings strategy has been held up as ministers struggle with the practicalities of helping people to insulate their homes and install expensive low-carbon heating when their gas boiler packs up. Ms Brandmayr said: âThe delay has been very disappointing. We need a comprehensive set of measures that will insulate homes, install low-carbon heating and create jobs.â Green Allianceâsnet zero policy tracker,externalreports on progress every three months. It reinforces criticism by green groups that the UK is a leader in setting targets, but not in sticking to them. When approached for a comment, the government did not directly challenge the Green Alliance figures. A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We are a world leader in the fight against climate change and are absolutely committed to meeting our future climate commitments, having already cut emissions by 44% over the past three decades, and are on track to outperform our current carbon budget plans which takes us to 2022. ""We have clear plans to cut emissions further, having recently published our energy white paper, North Sea transition deal, transport decarbonisation plan, industrial decarbonisation and hydrogen strategies. ""We have also secured new investments in offshore wind, electric vehicles and battery manufacturing and supply chains, and rolled out schemes to decarbonise homes and buildings. Further details will be set out in our net zero strategy."" The governmentâs net zero ambitions have come under fire recently by right-wing Conservatives arguing that the cost of de-carbonisation would be too high. The Treasury is reported to be worried about the final bill. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, in an ""early action"" scenario the cost of the net zero transition between 2020 and 2050 could be as little as 0.4% of GDP annually. These costs would increase significantly in scenarios where climate action is delayed or abandoned.

"UK must prepare for more economic shocks, says TUC","Better pay and conditions for delivery drivers will help fix the supply chain crisis, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady has said. She also called for a rise in capital gains tax to fund an increase in pay for care workers. ""After decades of real wage cuts... no-one can seriously say working people don't deserve a pay rise."" She said pay rises were crucial for the government's ""levelling up"" agenda to boost poorer regions of the UK. Speaking at the TUC Congress in London to an audience almost all attending online, Ms O'Grady called on the UK's unions to continue their fight for better pay and conditions across the economy. To ministers wondering how to fix the widespread problems with the supply of goods, she said: ""Well, here's a novel idea - let's make that industry deliver decent conditions, direct employment and a proper pay rise."" Ms O'Grady listed Nando's chicken, Ikea mattresses and Wetherspoon's beer as items that had recently run out due to problems such as a lack of delivery drivers. She told the story of a care worker called Carol, working a 24-hour shift for less than the minimum wage, and called for an increase in tax on wealth - through capital gains tax - to fund a pay rise for the sector. ""It can't be right that a dedicated care worker pays a bigger share of her hard-earned income to fund the social care system than the private equity magnate who profits from buying up and selling care homes,"" she said. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme ahead of her speech, Ms O'Grady urged the government to reconsider recent rises to National Insurance contributions, describing the move as ""another hit"" to young people and low-paid workers. ""We saw far too much inequality before the crisis, it's got a lot worse. We know that working people have been subject to pay freezes and pay pauses for years."" She argued that shifting tax to wealth instead may offer a boost in demand for the economy. ""One thing you can guarantee about working people is that they spend their money locally and that's what will get the economy moving again."" She called for a furlough-style short working scheme to be permanently in place, ""to keep people in good jobs - and to make sure we bounce back fast."" TUC warns of job losses if UK misses green targetss Starmer should be inspired by Biden, says TUC leader Staff shortages could last two years, says CBI ""If levelling up means anything, it must mean levelling up at work and levelling up living standards."" The director-general of the employer's organisation is also giving a keynote speech later today. He is set to warn that a return to ""business as usual"" in economic policy would be a mistake, with the UK lagging behind some of its international competitors in driving investment in the industries of the future. He will say: ""The lack of detail and pace from the government on some of the big economic choices we must make as a country are the biggest concerns for business."" He will call for a series of measures including: Smarter taxation that rewards those firms who invest in the future New individual training accounts to make it easier to access support Speeding up major infrastructure projects with ""catalytic"" public investment Replicating the successes of offshore wind in hydrogen and other emerging industries as well as rebalancing economic regulation. ""Investing by the UK: that must be our mantra now, so that the decade ahead does not repeat the low growth, zero productivity of the decade past, and government holds the key to unlocking it all,"" Mr Danker will say. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had shown it was committed to supporting business investment, extending the Annual Investment Allowance increase for another year and introducing the super-deduction, which it called ""the biggest two-year business tax cut in modern British history"". ""The impact of the pandemic means we have had to make the tough but responsible decision to raise taxes. We've asked both individuals and businesses to pay a bit more as we get our public finances back on a sustainable path,"" the spokesperson added.

British tobacco giant negotiated bribe for Mugabe,"Robert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for decades A BBC Panorama investigation has found evidence that suggests one of Britain's biggest companies paid a bribe to the former Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe. Documents show British American Tobacco (BAT) was involved in negotiations to pay between $300,000 and $500,000 to Mugabe's Zanu-PF party in 2013. The documents also reveal BAT was paying bribes in South Africa and using illegal surveillance to damage rivals. BAT says it is committed to the highest standards of corporate conduct. President Mugabe's 37-year rule was secured through elections marred by allegations of fraud and violence. He was ousted in 2017 and died in 2019. The ruling party Zanu PF is now under new leadership. Robert Mugabe: From liberator to tyrant Cannabis part of the future says tobacco giant In a joint investigation with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the University of Bath, Panorama obtained thousands of leaked documents. They show how BAT funded a network of almost 200 secret informants in southern Africa. Watch BBC Panorama: Dirty Secrets of the Cigarette Businesson BBC Oneon Monday at 19:30BST Most of this work was outsourced to a South African private security company called Forensic Security Services (FSS). FSS was officially tasked with fighting the black-market cigarette trade, however former employees have told the BBC that they broke the law to sabotage BAT's rivals. Internal documents show in one operation, FSS staff were instructed to close down three cigarette factories run by BAT's competitors in Zimbabwe. FSS paid a local firm to conduct surveillance on a Savanna Tobacco factory in 2012, but the company got caught. Three of its directors were charged in connection with illegal surveillance. The arrests prompted the then president, Robert Mugabe, to make a speech condemning the men's actions and BAT's suspected involvement. However, Panorama has found that behind the scenes, contractors working on behalf of BAT were talking to Zimbabwean officials. The man who was sent in to negotiate a deal, who wishes to remain anonymous, told Panorama he bribed a number of government officials to secure a meeting to discuss the men's case. He said: ""I had to make it clear that they're going to expect a nice thick envelope of notes."" British American Tobacco is one of the world's largest tobacco companies It is one of the UK's ten biggest companies It owns major cigarette brands including Lucky Strike and Pall Mall Last year, it sold close to 650 billion cigarettes Documents seen by the BBC confirm that the man was provided with the equivalent of US$12,000 in South African rand. They also suggest the money for the bribes was provided by BAT. An internal memo outlines the deal that was proposed. The Zimbabwean official said that with the upcoming presidential elections, a donation to Mugabe's party - Zanu PF - would help. The memo said: ""With this donation, they could then go back to the President"" to try to get the problem sorted out. ""The amount of the donation would have to be in the region of between USD300,000 to USD500,000 to Zanu PF,"" it said. The documents do not show whether the bribe was in the end paid, but Panorama has spoken to three sources who have confirmed that BAT was aware of the terms of the deal on offer. Within days of the deal being offered, all three directors were free. BAT declined to answer Panorama's questions about the Zimbabwe payments, but it did not deny paying a bribe to Robert Mugabe. It is against UK law for a British company to pay bribes, no matter where the payment takes place. FSS worked for BAT in southern Africa between 2000 and 2016. Evidence strongly suggests they bribed customs officials and police officers, and that BAT secured access to information from the police camera network, which was used to spy on its rivals. FSS tapped the phones of BAT's competitors, placed tracking devices on their delivery vehicles and bribed staff to hand over information. Documents show senior staff from BAT's London HQ personally recruited and paid some of the informants working at competitors' factories. BAT staff would also load cash onto currency cards in London and the informants could then withdraw the money anonymously in South Africa. It is a payment system sometimes used by organised crime groups to evade detection. This video can not be played British American Tobacco: I was a spy for cigarette giant, says whistleblower BAT's lawyers said the allegations are not new and that it was not unlawful to pay sources to gather information about criminal behaviour. They said the company rejects the allegation that any steps were taken with the aim of impacting the lawful activities of legitimate competitors or for commercial advantage. BAT said: ""We emphatically reject the mischaracterisation of our conduct... Our efforts in combating illicit trade have been aimed at helping law enforcement agencies in the fight against the criminal trade in tobacco products. ""Acting responsibly and with integrity underpins the foundations of our culture."" Ninety per cent of South African-grown tobacco is bought by BAT This is not the first time BAT has been accused of bribery. In 2015,Panorama found the company had  secretly paid politicians and civil servantsin countries in east Africa to undermine anti-smoking measures. The revelations prompted a five-year investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO). Earlier this year, it concluded there was not enough evidence for prosecution. BAT says it fully cooperated with the SFO's investigation, which included allegations relating to South Africa and which resulted in no action being taken.

Hospital pressure to continue for at least a month,"Wales' health minister says hospitals and GP surgeries are under ""huge pressure"" Pressures on Welsh hospitals are expected to continue until at least mid-October, Wales' health minister has said. Eluned Morgan has asked people to only use A&E services and GP surgeries if absolutely necessary. Some health boards have alreadypostponed routine surgeryand suspended some visits. It comes as Public Health Wales reports eight further deaths with Covid, and 2,317 new cases. It brings the total in Wales throughout the pandemic to 5,734 deaths and 306,060 cases. Wales Covid vaccine passport decision due next week Private PCR tests to be allowed for Welsh travellers Misinformation blamed for Covid admissions rise First Minister Mark Drakefordsaid on Friday that modelling suggestedthere could be ""100 new Covid-19 hospital admissions"" every day in Wales by the end of September as that is when experts expect the Delta-variant infection to peak. The Covid infection rate in Wales has risen to 557 cases for every 100,000 people - the highest since December last year. Ms Morgan said case numbers ""are likely to continue... until at least the end of September and then we're likely to see a levelling off"". Because of the lag between people catching Covid and potentially ending up in hospital, Ms Morgan said this suggests the pressure on hospitals will ""continue at least until about mid-October"". Ms Morgan told BBC's Politics Wales there were many issues to consider regarding vaccination passports Ms Morgan added a ""really difficult"" decision must be made on whether to introduce vaccination passports, asEngland scraps their plans to do so. Adecision is expected by next Fridayon whether the passports will be made mandatory in order to gain entry to some events in Wales. They are being introduced inScotland from 1 October. This video can not be played Sajid Javid announced on Sunday that the vaccine passports would not be going ahead in England ""There are lots of practical and ethical issues we've got to consider around vaccine passports,"" Ms Morgan toldBBC Politics Wales. ""Clearly, there's a hope that suggestions that we may need vaccine passports for nightclubs, for example, may help drive the numbers of young people who may want to take the vaccine up."" More than a fifth of young people aged 16-39 in Wales have yet to receive one dose of the vaccine. ""We know the [case] rates are incredibly high at the moment amongst young people and so that's why we're very anxious to drive those numbers up,"" Ms Morgan said. Routine surgeries have been delayed and many hospitals have limited or cancelled visits TheBetsi Cadwaladr health boardin north Wales announced on Friday it was suspending routine operations and halted most hospital visits. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board has also suspended most patient visitsfor ""the safety of our patients and staff""at its facilities in Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf. At its height back in January, there were 1,643 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Welsh hospitals, compared to 441 cases earlier this week. But the total number of people in Welsh hospitals because of Covid or other reasons is at its highest level since the start of the pandemic. The health minister said there were ""difficulties getting people out of hospital"" because of a lack of social care staff. She said she was having weekly meetings with councils and the health boards to deal with a ""quite critical"" situation. She blamed Brexit, ""because we did have a lot of eastern European workers"", and people moving to work in the tourism sector over the summer. Welsh labour made a manifesto commitment to paying all social care staff the Â£9.50 an hour real living wage Fewer than half of social care workers earn a ""real living wage"", according toresearch published by Cardiff Universityin August 2020. Paying social care staff the real living wage of Â£9.50 an hour was a key Welsh Labour manifesto commitment, so Ms Morgan said the government was ""in the process of working with the trade unions to make sure that when we give that living wage that the money actually gets to the people on the frontline"". In terms of changing the social care system, she said ministers have ""a long-term ambition"" to introduce free personal care ""but it is going to take us a while to get to that point"". An independent report published in 2018 suggested anincome tax rise in Walesof between 1% and 3% could be used to fund elderly social care. Asked if a social care levy was off the table in light of theUK government's National Insurance hike, Ms Morgan said: ""I think it would be very difficult for us to be taxing people twice for the same service.""

Private PCR tests to be allowed for Welsh travellers,"Welsh travellers currently must pay for the more expensive NHS PCR tests Foreign travellers from Wales can use a wider choice of Covid testing firms from 21 September, the Welsh government has announced. Welsh residents can currently only use more expensive NHS tests -,external- in astance that had been criticised. But that will change because of new UK rulespolicing private PCR travel testsand a spot checks regime. The Welsh Tories have accused Wales' Labour government of a ""belated U-turn"" But Wales' health minister Eluned Morgan said the change is because of new UK regulations which will have an ""impact on standards for private tests"". Travellers returning to Wales must currently use NHS PCR tests on day two of their return - and day eight if unvaccinated - at a cost of Â£68 each. In England, private testing is available, from about Â£50. More destinations added to 'green' list Autumn sun? Travel rules for the Med EU 'vaccine passport' and how to use it This was previously criticised by travellers as ""unfair"" because it meant people in Wales had to pay more - and there had been a Â£1,000 fine for using a private test provider instead. Test requirements applied to travellers returning to Wales even if they arrive at an airport or port in England. Tory MP David TC Davies hadasked the monopolies watchdogto investigate the decision not to allow people returning to Wales to shop around for the cheapest deal on Covid PCR tests to save money, as is allowed in England. Anyone travelling overseas and returning to the UK must take a PCR test for Covid But Welsh ministers said NHS testing ensured any positive cases and harmful variants were identified as early as possible, flagging concerns that test results were ""not flowing into Welsh systems"", making it difficult to track and trace holidaymakers who might be infected. As a result of concerns,the Competitions and Markets Authority has made a series of recommendations,externalto UK ministers to improve the travel testing market. The UK government said it would tighten rules on private providersfollowing complaints of ""cowboy behaviour""by some testing companies, after complaints were raised about inaccurate and misleading advertised pricing and slow delivery of results. The Welsh government said the new measures would ensure test results - including identifying new variants of Covid - would be processed and reported ""quickly and within a comparable time period to NHS tests"", and it will therefore allow private tests to be used for people returning to Wales. ""We've been putting a lot of pressure on the UK government to come in with measures that would give us a lot more confidence that if people were to used these private tests that they would be of a particular standard,"" said Ms Morgan. ""Given the new regulations and the impact on standards for private tests, we will make changes to the rules to enable people travelling to Wales to book tests with private sector providers, if they wish."" The health minister said she welcomed the progress made addressing concerns over private testing - and stressed NHS tests would also be available to book. ""It's important to remember that coronavirus is still with us, and our advice continues to be that people should avoid all non-essential international travel,"" Ms Morgan added. The Welsh Conservatives have accused Wales' Labour government of a ""belated U-turn"" which they say ""will come as little consolation to the thousands of hardworking Welsh families who've been clobbered by Labour's costly testing scheme"". ""Far from something to celebrate, the timing of such an announcement after the conclusion of the summer holidays will anger many families who've been forced to fork out hundreds of pounds due to the stubbornness of Labour ministers,"" said their health spokesman Russell George.

GB's Raducanu storms to US Open title,"This video can not be played Watch the best shots as Raducanu wins US Open US Open 2021 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDate:30 August-12 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live/BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Emma Raducanu ended Britain's 44-year wait for a women's Grand Slam singles champion as she beat Leylah Fernandez to win the US Open in the most thrilling style. The 18-year-old ended her scarcely believable run in New York with a 6-4 6-3 win over her 19-year-old Canadian opponent in a high-quality final. Raducanu threw herself to the floor in disbelief as she fired down an ace to conclude what has been the most remarkable journey. Raducanu served for the match at 5-3 but cut her leg as she went break point down, leading to a medical time-out and a clearly irritated Fernandez expressing her frustration to the match official. However, Raducanu shrugged off the delay, saving a further break point before closing out her third championship point. The two shared a warm hug before Raducanu headed up the stairs at Arthur Ashe Stadium to celebrate with her support box. Raducanu was cheered on by an emotional Virginia Wade, who was the last British woman to win a major trophy at Wimbledon in 1977. Emma Raducanu is the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam and has done so without dropping a set ""It means so much to have Virginia Wade here and also Tim Henman,"" Raducanu said in her on-court speech. ""They are British icons and for me to follow in their footsteps gave me the belief I could do it."" With the victory, Raducanu becomes: The first British female winner at the US Open since Virginia Wade in 1968 The first qualifier in the Open era to win a Slam The youngest women's Slam champion since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004 The youngest Briton to win a Grand Slam title The first woman to win the US Open without dropping a set since Serena Williams in 2014 She will take home Â£1.8m in prize money, rise to 23 in the world rankings and will become the British number one on Monday. Raducanu will also know that she has starred in one of the biggest moments in British sporting history - and captured the imagination of the fans at home and in New York. 'I don't want to let go of the trophy' Queen leads congratulations to Raducanu Teenager's triumph crowns epic sporting year Relive Raducanu's historic US Open victory 5 Live Sport Specials: Raducanu's Fairytale of New York Astonishing. Ridiculous. Meteoric. Unbelievable. Take your pick - but no word can ever really sum up what Raducanu has achieved. Two weeks ago, Raducanu had a flight booked back to the UK, just in case she did not come through qualifying in New York. Seventeen days later, she has lifted the trophy in front of a rapturous crowd. Raducanu did not just come through qualifying: she dominated the tournament. The most games she lost in one set in her entire run in New York - five - came in the second round of qualifying. It is not just that Raducanu has kept on winning, but she has done it with such dominance. She did not drop a set en route to the final, despite meeting Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and in-form Maria Sakkari on the way. This video can not be played Emma Raducanu wins US Open - watch the winning moment In the big moments, she has held her nerve, trusting in her power and serve, even when she saw two championship points go by in the final. This is someone who, two months ago, was collecting her A-Level results. She only made her WTA main-draw debut in June. All this has happened so quickly, and yet not once has Raducanu not looked like she belongs. With all the attention on Raducanu after Wimbledon - as well as questions from some about her mental toughness - she could have easily been overwhelmed. Instead, she trusted in herself, hired a new coach in Andrew Richardson and went to America to play in the various events. No-one could have seen this coming; not the ease with which Raducanu would brush her opponents aside, or the calmness with which she would approach every match. But Raducanu always believed. And she will leave New York as the US Open champion. Emma Raducanu received an A* and A in maths and economics in her A-Levels - and then won the US Open two months later Former British number one Laura Robson on BBC Radio 5 Live:""There are so many sliding doors moments. Before Wimbledon, Emma didn't have a main draw wild card. Would she be in this position if they hadn't upgraded it? Would this happen if she hadn't had to retire from the fourth round with breathing problems? ""She played an almost perfect performance in her first Grand Slam final. You have to think there will be so many more."" Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash:""I cannot believe it. It is unheard of for a qualifier to win the US Open. Goran Ivanisevic won Wimbledon as a wildcard but he had already been to Wimbledon finals, not playing a second Grand Slam. ""She hits so cleanly. I cannot come up with a reason for this to happen. It does not make sense at all. Her performance is mindboggling."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:""I have never seen anything like this and I suspect if I work in this business for another 20 years I won't see anything like it."" Allow Twitter content?

A full Arthur Ashe Stadium - which holds almost 24,000 people - is one of the most intimidating sights in tennis, but neither player looked fazed as they walked out on to the biggest stage of their career. Fernandez had more of the crowd support, given that she has ousted the second, third and fifth seed in New York, but there was still good support for Raducanu. The first three games lasted for 23 minutes, both players showing a devastating array of cross-court punches and fiery returns of serve, and they traded breaks as they found their footing. As she has done throughout the tournament, Raducanu dug herself out from 0-30 down several times, stepping forward, playing more aggressively and finding her first serves. That gave her the confidence to attack Fernandez's second serve and put herself on top. She closed out the first set with a forehand down the line, turning and pumping her fist towards her box before letting out a yell of ""come on!"" to the crowd as they rose to applaud. Fernandez has shown tenacity throughout the tournament and she did so here, saving three break points in her first service game to stop Raducanu taking a 2-0 lead in the second. She then found the break, adjusting to hit Raducanu's serves better, and it looked as though the momentum had swung the way of the young Canadian. However, there is a reason Raducanu has not dropped a set in New York. At the changeover she sat quietly, eyes closed, before again increasing her tempo and creating the break opportunity. She broke with the shot of the match - a stunning forehand pass, made from almost off the court, that left Fernandez stranded at the net. Two championship points came and went on the Fernandez serve, saved once again by brave hitting, but Raducanu did not falter despite taking a nasty cut to the leg as she slid behind the baseline. It was an odd interlude in what was an entertaining final that proved that the future of women's tennis is bright.

"Three-year wait for answers over death of girl, 4","Skyla Whiting died with sepsis days after becoming unwell with an upset tummy in May 2018 A mum whose four-year-old daughter died with sepsis says waiting more than three years for her inquest has added to her grief. Skyla Whiting died days after becoming unwell with an upset tummy in May 2018. Her inquest is set for 19 November. Her mother Amy Whiting, from Blaenavon, Torfaen, said the wait had been ""like a big black cloud over your head"". The Ministry of Justice said the Covid pandemic had posed ""significant challenges"" but services had continued. Mrs Whiting said: ""Skyla was a beautiful, bubbly little girl and really, really healthy, no medical problems at all. ""Everything about her was special, she was our world."" Skyla Whiting died in May 2018 and her inquest is set for 19 November Mrs Whiting said when Skyla came home from school complaining of an upset tummy in May 2018 she took her to her GP, who initially thought her lactose allergy may have come back. That night, Skyla became unwell with a temperature and a rash over her body, so her parents took her back to the GP the next day where they were told she had a viral infection. Her condition again worsened that night. WATCH: Sepsis: What is it - and how to spot it?

Her parents took Skyla to Nevill Hall A&E department in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. After spending some time on the children's ward they were again told Skyla had a viral infection and sent her home. Mrs Whiting said: ""Skyla again overnight became more poorly. ""We phoned the hospital in the morning and asked could we bring her back in and we were told no, they didn't want us to bring her back in because her symptoms were that of a viral infection. ""So I phoned back again an hour later and said 'no, I'm not happy about that, I want her to go back in, she's definitely deteriorating'. ""She was vomiting, she had diarrhoea she couldn't even walk, we were carrying her."" Skyla was taken back to the children's ward where they did blood tests which found her infection levels to be seriously high. Skyla's parents plan to attend the inquest into her death in November ""Her lips had turned blue and she was in extreme pain with her legs,"" said Mrs Whiting. ""It took until seven o'clock the next morning for a consultant to come and actually see her. He then realised that she was inseptic shock,external. ""She was ventilated and taken to Noah's Ark Children's Hospital [in Cardiff], who were absolutely fabulous with her but unfortunately it was too late by the time we got there."" Skyla deteriorated further overnight and she died on 15 May. Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said: ""Our thoughts remain with the family of Skyla and we're very sorry for the circumstances surrounding the care she received. ""This matter has been fully investigated by the health board in accordance with its serious incident protocol. ""The findings have been fully and openly shared with the family and the Senior Coroner for Gwent."" It said the health board had already undertaken ""corrective actions to address the issues raised through our investigation"". ""We have focused heavily on the topic of sepsis during staff clinical governance days, as well as increasing awareness of the Clinical Sepsis Pathway and emphasising the importance of recognising the symptoms of deteriorating patients,"" it said. Skyla's mother Amy says she is nervous about attending the inquest Skyla was Mrs Whiting and her husband's first child. The couple have since had a son, aged two. ""I don't cope very well,"" said Mrs Whiting, ""whenever he's unwell I think the worst."" Ministry of Justice data,externalshowed in 2020, 271 inquests had been open for more than a year and 73 of those had been open for more than two years. That is a 138% rise on the previous year, when a total of 114 had been open for more than a year. Wales has seven coroners. In 2020, the area with the highest average time to process an inquest was Gwent with 46 weeks, followed by North Wales (east and central) at 40 weeks and Ceredigion at 36 weeks. Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire and Swansea and Neath Port Talbot followed, both with average processing times of 32 weeks, South Wales Central at 31 weeks and North West Wales with 28 weeks. Mrs Whiting said: ""Waiting for the inquest to happen or just finding out if there's going to be an inquest is draining, it's absolutely draining.

Stephanie Boyce said: ""Inquest delays are another example of where the general lack of investment in the justice system is creating lengthy delays which will impact all the people involved in the case, including those suffering a bereavement. ""As the coroner's inquest cannot be finalised until the completion of the related criminal trial, the significant backlogs in the criminal courts, which pre-dated the pandemic but have been exacerbated by it, means lengthy delays will inevitably delay the inquest.""

Ryanair: Holiday prices likely to rise sharply soonRyanair boss Michael O'Leary says fewer flights amid spiking demand will lead to higher prices.Business,"The boss of budget airline Ryanair has warned holiday prices are likely to rise sharply next year as consumer demand for travel rebounds. Michael O'Leary toldThe Sunday Times,externalfewer flights, inflation and more taxes would drive airfares up. ""I think there will be a dramatic recovery in holiday tourism within Europe next year,"" he said. ""And the reason why I think prices will be dramatically higher is that there's less capacity."" Ryanair's short-haul rivals had all had to reduce their fleets because of the pandemic, he added. Ryanair predicts rapid rebound in airline travel Seven more destinations are on the green list Air travel yet to fully restart, says UK industry ""Take out Thomas Cook (six million seats), Flybe (eight million seats), Norwegian (nearly 24 million seats)... Alitalia's reducing its fleet by 40%,"" said Mr O'Leary. ""There is going to be about 20% less short-haul capacity in Europe in 2022, with a dramatic recovery in demand."" Ryanair is planning to open a new base at Newcastle International Airport next year, creating at least 60 aviation jobs. Its rival EasyJet meanwhile has closed its basesat Stansted, London Southend and Newcastle airports, and from 1 November,Ryanair will cease all operations at Southend, meaning no passenger planes will use the airport. This comes as economists predict inflation will continue to rise over the rest of the year, which Mr O'Leary said was a factor in increasing airfares, as well asthe threat of increasing environmental taxes. Airlines say bookings have not recovered sufficiently, despite easing Covid restrictions However, to combat this he intended to cut prices for winter 2020 in order to ""grab market share from everywhere"". Airlines have been hit hard by lockdowns and travel restrictions around the world, with many announcing job cuts. EasyJet said in May that itplanned up to 4,500 job cutsas it struggled with the collapse in air travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. It has started to fly passengers again but does not expect 2019 levels of demand to be reached again until 2023. Multiple airlines have warned that thousands more jobs could be at risk if the government's furlough scheme was not extended after 30 September,as bookings have not recovered. They have also criticised the government for its ""confusing"" traffic-light travel list system. Canada, Switzerland and Denmark were among the latest countries to join the UK's green travel list. Meanwhile, the government is planning to overhaul the traffic light system in the coming weeks, the BBC has been told. Tim Alderslade from industry body Airlines UK said: ""There are over half a million direct jobs that rely on aviation and we're now entering the lean winter period. Something may have to give, without the furlough support that is coming to an end this month. ""This summer was such a missed opportunity - alone across Europe we insisted on expensive and complex PCR tests and it's no wonder demand remained weak. Until we stop being such an outlier it will be impossible to get back to anything like 2019 levels of trade."" Ryanair predicts rapid rebound in airline travel How are travel rules being relaxed?

Watchdog urges tougher line on Covid test firms,"The government needs to apply tougher standards to its list of approved Covid travel test providers, the competition watchdog has said. The call comes as part of fresh advice from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) amid concerns that consumers are being ripped off. UK travellers must take PCR tests when they return from abroad, choosing from a list of 400 or more authorised firms. But the CMA said basic standards should be upgraded and enforced. It also said consumers should be able to ""get the information they need to compare providers properly and find the best deals for them"". Last week, the CMA said it hadbegun an investigationinto one firm, Expert Medicals, following complaints that Covid test results had not been provided on time or at all. It has also warned a further 19 firms about advertising misleading prices, following a review that found customers often faced poor service, hidden fees and refund issues. Watchdog will look at Covid test cost immediately Government was told in April of PCR test 'rip-off' In its latest advice, the CMA said there were features of the PCR testing market which meant competition alone would not deliver the right outcomes for consumers. ""There is a risk of a 'race to the bottom', in which providers compete on grounds other than high clinical quality and travellers end up losing out,"" it added. As a result, it said, it was making a number of recommendations to the government, including: Creating a one-stop shop list of quality, approved test providers by significantly improving the basic standards to qualify for the government list Introducing a comprehensive monitoring and enforcement programme to ensure providers on the list meet these basic standards and swiftly removing and sanctioning those that do not Developing the NHS Test and Trace travel test as a benchmark for quality and price to drive higher standards and more competition Monitoring prices and costs on a continuing basis Tests cost about Â£75 per person on average in the UK, but there are reports of some being offered for as little as Â£20, and others for more than Â£500. There have also been reports that some government-authorised providers do not have full accreditation. The government has already issued warnings to 82 firms that they could be removed from its list of authorised providers if they advertise misleading prices. Rory Boland, Which? travel editor, said the CMA's review ""reinforces Which?'s repeated warnings to the government that the current private testing system is not fit for purpose"". ""The government must now urgently set out how it will implement the regulator's recommendations and ensure safe, reliable and affordable tests are available for all travellers,"" he added. Avi Lasarow, EMEA chief executive of Project Screen by Prenetics, which is on the government list of test providers and provides testing at the major UK airports, welcomed the CMA's findings, saying: ""Hopefully this will drive the cowboy testers out of town."" He added: ""Holiday PCR testing will be a way of life for travellers for some time to come as we need to protect the UK from new variants entering the country. ""However, the government could help travellers even more by abolishing VAT on holiday PCR tests, so they can travel safer and cheaper.""

HMRC warns over health tax hit to poorer families,"Plans to raise National Insurance to fund health and social care could lead to the breakdown of struggling families, the UK's tax authority says. Ministers announced the tax hike this week to pay for an Â£86,000 personal cap on lifetime social care costs in England, and tackle NHS backlogs. HMRC analysis has predicted it will have a ""significant"" impact on wages, inflation, and company profits. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was the fairest way to fund investment. But also speaking on Sunday, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth called the proposals a ""punishing unfair tax rise on working people"". Social care changes at-a-glance Landlord tax could help pay for social care - Starmer What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? The 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance (NI), a tax paid by workers and employers, will begin next April, before becoming a separate Health and Social Care Levy from April 2023. Along with a 1.25 percentage point hike in dividend tax from next April, it is expected to raise Â£12bn a year for the next three years. Analysis prepared for the government,externalby HMRC, published after MPs backed the changes last week, said in 2022-23 a worker on the median basic rate taxpayer's income of Â£24,100 would be expected to pay an additional Â£180 per year. Employees on the median higher rate taxpayer's income of Â£67,100 would be expected to pay an additional Â£715, the document added. It added: ""There may be an impact on family formation, stability or breakdown as individuals, who are currently just about managing financially, will see their disposable income reduce."" The analysis also forecast the increase would impact companies' decisions on hiring staff, and setting salaries. And it said turning the NI increase into a separate levy - meaning it would appear as a separate line on workers' pay slips - would mean extra staff costs for HMRC. The majority of the Â£36bn fund raised by the rise over the next three years will go towards tackling the backlog of NHS cases, which has worsened during the Covid pandemic. A smaller portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system. The government has promised the share going to social care will increase after that, but has not specified exactly by how much. Labour has criticised the tax hike as unfair to working people, and said it would not do enough to improve care offered in the social care system. The party said it backed more spending on health and social care - but has been coming under pressure to specify how they would pay for it instead. Leader Sir Keir Starmer recently said the money could be raisedthrough taxing landlords. He has also said it could be funded through ""wealth taxes"", but has not set out details. On Sunday, Mr Ashworth told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that improving care for people in their own homes, so that they did not have to move into a care home, could save Â£2.5bn a year that could be spent on ""the front line"". Speaking on the same programme, Mr Javid defended the tax hike, adding it would make government support for social care ""more generous"" and said paying for the changes through higher borrowing would be ""wrong"". ""The way this has been done, through a broad-based progressive tax, is the fairest way possible to support us all, for our health needs and our care needs,"" he added. After backing the proposals last week, MPs will vote on the legislation to set up the new health and social care levy next week. What is happening to the cap on care costs?

"Accordion tangos light up Last Night of the PromsThe Last Night concert ended with a tribute to the ""healing and uplifting power of music"".","Ksenija Sidorova is the first accordion player to be a soloist at the Last Night of the Proms It may have been her first visit to the BBC Proms, but accordion player Ksenija Sidorova stole the show at the Last Night concert. Expressive and passionate, the Latvian musician's performance of Astor Piazzolla's Libertango brought a packed Royal Albert Hall to its feet. It came halfway through a diverse concert that also paid tribute to the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks. Conductor Sakari Oramo said the night reflected the ""healing power of music"". ""Due to the worldwide Covid pandemic, live music-making was stopped across the world for many months - and in some places it still is,"" he said. ""Music that is core to human expression went silent. The bond between audiences and performers was broken."" Noting that, elsewhere in the world, people's freedom to make and enjoy music was currently being ""threatened and denied"", Oramo concluded that it was ""very special for us all to be here for the Last Night Of The Proms again, with an audience, to celebrate the healing and uplifting power of music"". Conductor Sakari Oramo was helming his 28th Prom - and fifth Last Night The Prommers, bedecked in crowns, bow ties, bowler hats and a mixture of EU and union flags, were typically enthusiastic, especially after missing out on the 2020 season. They bobbed up and down to the Sailor's Hornpipe and sang Land Of Hope And Glory at the top of their lungs- the lyrics performed in full following avery public row over their possible exclusionlast year. And when Oramo paid tribute to Sir Henry Wood, the founder conductor of the Proms back in 1895, one audience member pointed to Wood's statue at the back of the hall and shouted, ""He's behind you!"" The concert opened with a new commission, Mother, by Iranian-American composer Gity Razaz. A restless symphonic piece with an extensive percussion section, it depicted the healing power of nature amid the chaos of modern life. Listen to the Last Night on BBC Sounds Proms conductor: 'We're going to play our hearts out' Proms to bring back audiences and Rule, Britannia! Speaking ahead of the premiere, Razaz said she hoped to capture ""the exquisite majesty of our natural world"" in a way that ""propels us to take more serious, proactive steps towards protecting our planet"". The programme also included a heart-breaking new arrangement of Barber's Adagio For Strings, marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Allow Twitter content?

The adagio was performed at the Last Night in 2001, just four days after the atrocity, with American conductor Leonard Slatkin on the podium. He asked the audience not to applaud at the end. Instead, they held aloft candles. Jonathan Manners' new arrangement was suitably sombre and haunting, incorporating Barber's 1961 choral setting of the Latin text Agnus Dei: ""Lamb Of God that takest away the sins of the world have mercy upon us [and] grant us peace"". The programme also included a recently rediscovered piece by Florence Price - the first African-American woman to have a symphony performed by a major US orchestra - and Ravel's lament for the victims of World War One, Le tombeau de Couperin. Australian tenor Stuart Skelton brought some levity with a spirited performance of Iain Farrington's I Still Call Australia Home, delivered in an eye-catching black sequinned jacket. Later, he led the audience in the traditional chorus of Rule, Britannia! wearing a full Aussie cricket outfit. Stuart Skelton in his full cricketing gear, as he performs Rule, Britannia! Skelton also indulged in his love of Wagner, performing the poignant Wesendonck Lieder with a rich subtlety, before letting rip on the passionate Prize Song, from The Mastersingers of Nuremberg. The 53-year-old, who was also making his debut at the Last Night, said he was still pinching himself after being invited. ""To be considered in that pantheon? You never expect that one. It's one of those bucket list, dreams come true,"" he told the BBC. ""It's like a wrap party for the world's most prestigious music festival."" He evencame up with a bespoke cocktail,externalto celebrate the occasion. Sidorova started playing accordion at the age of six For all his charm, accordion virtuoso Sidorova was the indisputable highlight of the night, introducing the Last Night to two mildly revolutionary elements- the accordion and the tango. She first took the stage in the first half, playing Franck Angelis' ChiquilÃ­n de BachÃ­n (Little Boy at BachÃ­n), a saccharine story of a six-year-old boy who sells flowers outside a cheap restaurant in the heart of Buenos Aires's theatre district. Sat on a piano stool, sporting some impressively voluminous sleeves, Sidorova imbued the piece with a nostalgic quality, deftly swerving maudlin sentimentality. But it was her second-half performance of Libertango - a staple of Strictly Come Dancing - that really showcased her captivating and witty playing style, as she traded riffs back-and-forth with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Viewers and prommers alike lapped up the performance. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The pomp and ceremony of the Last Night - described by Rob Rinder on BBC Radio Three as an ""upmarket stag do"" - marked the end of a triumphant six-week Proms season. Coming a year after the festival was reduced to a two-week, socially-distanced skeleton, this year's event welcomed 2,000 musicians, 30 orchestras and, crucially, tens of thousands of fans. Highlights included the highly-anticipatedconcert debut of John Wilson's Sinfonia of London, who played a soul-stirring and charismatic programme that included Strauss, Ravel and Korngold's filmic Symphony in F sharp major. Chineke - the UK's only black and ethnically diverse orchestra - celebrated diversity in composers as well as performers, playing pieces by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Fela Sowande andFlorence Price. The Aurora orchestra played Igor Stravinsky's 1945 suite from The Firebird from memory (as is their tradition); while the prodigiously talented Kanneh-Mason family joined forces to perform an updated version of Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns's much-loved suite The Carnival of the Animals.

Abortion drama wins top prize at Venice festivalAudrey Diwan's Happening is set in 1960s France but comes amid debate over strict new laws in Texas.Entertainment & Arts,"The winning film was directed by Audrey Diwan A film about illegal abortions in 1960s France has won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. Audrey Diwan's Happening (L'ÃvÃ©nement) is about a woman seeking a termination to continue studying. ""I did this movie with anger, with desire, with my belly, my guts, my heart and my head,"" Diwan said as she accepted the award. The film comes after controversial new laws banning abortion after six weeks were introduced in Texas. What Texas women make of six-week abortion ban The 78th edition of the world's oldest film festival wrapped up on Saturday night, with international celebrities flocking to Venice's red carpet. The ceremony was a stark contrast to last year's event, when guests had to wear masks during screenings and around half of the seats on the Lido waterfront were left empty due to the coronavirus pandemic. The winning film, Happening, is based on an autobiographical novel by Annie Ernaux and portrays a young woman seeking a termination to be able to continue her studies, despite the risk of prison or death. The award was selected by a jury led by Parasite director Bong Joon-Ho. The second prize, the Silver Lion, was presented to Italian director Paolo Sorrentino for The Hand of God, a film about his youth in the southern city of Naples. Other women filmmakers were also honoured during Saturday's ceremony, with New Zealand's Jane Campion picking up the best director award for The Power of the Dog, starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Maggie Gyllenhaal, meanwhile, was awarded the best screenplay prize for The Lost Daughter, which features Olivia Colman. Penelope Cruz won the award for best actress for her role in Parallel Mothers, directed by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. Best Actor went to Filipino actor John Arcilla for his role in crime thriller On the Job: The Missing 8.

Abortion drama wins top prize at Venice festivalAudrey Diwan's Happening is set in 1960s France but comes amid debate over strict new laws in Texas.,"The winning film was directed by Audrey Diwan A film about illegal abortions in 1960s France has won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. Audrey Diwan's Happening (L'ÃvÃ©nement) is about a woman seeking a termination to continue studying. ""I did this movie with anger, with desire, with my belly, my guts, my heart and my head,"" Diwan said as she accepted the award. The film comes after controversial new laws banning abortion after six weeks were introduced in Texas. What Texas women make of six-week abortion ban The 78th edition of the world's oldest film festival wrapped up on Saturday night, with international celebrities flocking to Venice's red carpet. The ceremony was a stark contrast to last year's event, when guests had to wear masks during screenings and around half of the seats on the Lido waterfront were left empty due to the coronavirus pandemic. The winning film, Happening, is based on an autobiographical novel by Annie Ernaux and portrays a young woman seeking a termination to be able to continue her studies, despite the risk of prison or death. The award was selected by a jury led by Parasite director Bong Joon-Ho. The second prize, the Silver Lion, was presented to Italian director Paolo Sorrentino for The Hand of God, a film about his youth in the southern city of Naples. Other women filmmakers were also honoured during Saturday's ceremony, with New Zealand's Jane Campion picking up the best director award for The Power of the Dog, starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Maggie Gyllenhaal, meanwhile, was awarded the best screenplay prize for The Lost Daughter, which features Olivia Colman. Penelope Cruz won the award for best actress for her role in Parallel Mothers, directed by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. Best Actor went to Filipino actor John Arcilla for his role in crime thriller On the Job: The Missing 8. Last year's top prize was given to Nomadland, a US film about a widow living as a nomad after the 2008 financial crisis.

Emotional tributes paid to 9/11 lives lost,"Relatives of people who died on 9/11 have read out victims' names, as the US marks 20 years since the deadliest terror attacks on its soil. Many struggled to hold back tears at the ceremony held at Ground Zero, the site of the Twin Towers destroyed in the attacks by al-Qaeda militants. ""Twenty years feels like an eternity, but it still feels like yesterday,"" cried Lisa Reina who lost her husband. A minute's silence was held at the exact time each hijacked plane crashed. George W Bush, who was the US president at the time, gave a speech in Pennsylvania, where one of the planes crashed into a field after passengers overpowered the hijackers. ""The world was loud with carnage and sirens, and then quiet with missing voices that would never be heard again,"" he said. ""It's hard to describe the mix of feelings we experienced."" Saturday's events as they happened The official memorial in New York started with a minute's silence at 08:46 (12:46 GMT) - the exact moment the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center in 2001. All morning, roses continued to be placed beside the names of the 2,977 victims etched into the Ground Zero memorial. There were five more moments of silence over the next few hours - marking the time when the second plane crashed into the South Tower, when a third jet struck the Pentagon just outside Washington DC, when the fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania, and finally when each tower collapsed. The tributes continued into the night, as two beams of light shone four miles (6.4 km) into the sky. The Tribute in Light was illuminated after sunset. With thousands of names to read out, the list took hours to complete. Mike Low, whose daughter was a flight attendant in the first plane that hit the World Trade Center, started it off. He thanked those who helped his family get through ""the darkest days of our lives"". Mr Low recalled the ""grey and black world"" of New York in the aftermath of the attack, and asked for 9/11 to be remembered ""not as numbers or a date, but the faces of ordinary people"". Lisa Reina was nearly eight months pregnant when her husband Joseph was killed. Fighting back tears, she said: ""Our son is the spitting image of you... Continue to watch over us and your family. Until we meet again, my love."" A generation of relatives has been born since the attacks, and some took to the stage to share in the name-readings. One young girl told her late uncle: ""I never met you, but I really miss you."" This video can not be played How the victims of 9/11 were commemorated on the 20th anniversary At the memorial in New York, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as former First Ladies Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. Mr Biden travelled to all three attack sites on Saturday - New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. In a video released on the eve of the anniversary, he paid tribute to the victims. ""No matter how much time has passed, these commemorations bring everything painfully back as if you just got the news a few seconds ago,"" he said. Vice-President Kamala Harris spoke in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after George W Bush. ""We must challenge ourselves to look back, to remember, for the sake of our children... and for that reason, we must also look forward,"" she said. It is thought that the hijackers of the plane that crashed into the Shanksville field meant to attack the Capitol Building in Washington DC, but passengers and crew fought back. At a wreath-laying ceremony, Mr Biden said they had shown ""genuine heroism"". On Saturday morning, former President Donald Trump released a video statement praising first responders and adding it was a ""sad time for the way our war on those that did such harm to our country ended last week"" -referring to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr Trump did not attend the ceremony in New York, however he did visit a Manhattan police station near Trump Tower. Later on Saturday he was due to provide commentary for a boxing match in Florida with his eldest son, Donald Jr. Other ceremonies included a vigil at the New York Fire Department's memorial wall - a 56-foot bronze wall that honours the 343 firefighters who died on the day of the attacks. In total, 441 first responders were killed, the largest loss of emergency personnel in US history. At the Pentagon outside Washington, a dawn service was held. Two pipers played Amazing Grace as a small group of military leaders looked on in solemnity, the building bathed in blue light. A chapel of remembrance now marks the spot where American Airlines flight 77 crashed into the US defence building.

Why are there food queues in this Indian Ocean island?,"A woman carries food bags in Colombo while people behind her queue outside a state-run supermarket Sri Lanka has seen long queues to buy essential items amid tight lockdown measures to control the spread of Covid-19. Shelves at government-run supermarkets have been running low - some even empty - with very little stock remaining of imported goods like milk powder, cereal and rice. The government denies there are shortages and blames the media for stoking fears. It follows the government declaring a state of emergency and Sri Lanka's Central Bank chief stepping down amid a foreign exchange crisis. On 30 August, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced strict controls on the supply of essential goods. The government said this was needed to prevent traders hoarding food items and control inflation. Sri Lanka is grappling with a depreciating currency, inflation and a crippling foreign debt burden. There has also been a slump in foreign tourism due to the pandemic. The economic slowdown is of particular concern for a country that has been one of the strongest performing in South Asia. In 2019, it was upgraded to an upper middle-income country by the World Bank, but then downgraded the following year. The country's debt burden has also been growing - from 39% of Gross National Income (GNI) in 2010 to69% in 2019, according to the World Bank.,external As a result of the economic crisis, the prices of some essential food items have been rising. In recent months, items such as sugar, onions and lentils have been rising in cost. Meanwhile, after rising in May, the price of rice fell and has continued to drop following the imposition of a retail price cap from the start of September. The emergency regulations allow the government to provide food items and other essentials at fixed prices by buying up stock from traders. In regard to shortages, the country's finance ministry told the BBC in a statement that these were ""artificial"". ""The creation of an artificial shortage by unscrupulous elements will obviously lead to increases in prices of those items."" The government has strongly denied that shortages are imminent. ""We can give a categorical and firm assurance that all essential items would be readily available at all times,"" the finance ministry said in its response to the BBC. State Minister Ajith Nivard Cabraal has blamed the opposition for ""false reports"" about food shortages. However, long queues have been observed for items such as sugar, rice, lentils and milk powder.

In April, the government banned imports of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides, to encourage organic farming. But the move and its implementation have been criticised. ""We are not against organic farming, but against sub-standard chemical fertilisers which were being imported,"" said Namal Karunaratne, national organiser of All Ceylon Farms Federation. However, he added that ""the answer to that is not banning imports overnight."" Some farmers say the rapid switch could significantly cut production. ""The productivity of the organic fertiliser is less than chemical fertilisers, it would decrease our production and make our survival more difficult,"" said HC Hemakumara, President of Ampara district joint farmers association. About 90% of Sri Lanka's farmers use chemicals,according to a survey in July.,external And the highest dependence on chemical fertilisers was among those growing rice, rubber and tea. Tea accounts for 10% of export income, and some producers have said they may lose up to 50% of their crop production. Going organic poses threats to Sri Lanka's tea industry Prof Sabine Zikeli, of the Centre for Organic Farming at the University of Hohenheim in Germany, says a rapid transition to organic could threaten a country's food security. ""You can't simply change these conventional cropping systems, you need transition periods,"" she says. ""In organic farming, the normal transition period to adapt....about three years or even longer, depending on the country."" In 2008, Bhutan introduced a policy of going 100% organic by 2020. But it fell a long way short of achieving this target and a recent studyshows yields from the organic farming it has introduced have been substantially lower,external, leading to a rise in dependence on imports. Sri Lanka could now face a similar situation, Prof Zikeli, who co-authored this study, says. And its current economic crisis could add to the threats to its food security. Despite strict lockdown conditions, long food queues have been reported Sri Lanka is running low on foreign exchange - and the money it has is going towards debt settlement. Its foreign reserves stood at $2.8bn (Â£2bn) at the end of July, down from $7.5bn in November 2019, when the government took office. And it has outstanding payments due on its foreign debt this year in the region of $4bn. And that could affect essential imported items - such as sugar, wheat, dairy products and medical supplies - which might all face growing supply problems.

"Why are there food queues in this Indian Ocean island?With a weak economy and worsening Covid-19 situation, a food emergency has been declared in the country.Asia-Pacific","A woman carries food bags in Colombo while people behind her queue outside a state-run supermarket Sri Lanka has seen long queues to buy essential items amid tight lockdown measures to control the spread of Covid-19. Shelves at government-run supermarkets have been running low - some even empty - with very little stock remaining of imported goods like milk powder, cereal and rice. The government denies there are shortages and blames the media for stoking fears. It follows the government declaring a state of emergency and Sri Lanka's Central Bank chief stepping down amid a foreign exchange crisis. On 30 August, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced strict controls on the supply of essential goods. The government said this was needed to prevent traders hoarding food items and control inflation. Sri Lanka is grappling with a depreciating currency, inflation and a crippling foreign debt burden.
