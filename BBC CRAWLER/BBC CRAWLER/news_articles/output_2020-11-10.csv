"The US president-elect is calling world leaders, even as Donald Trump refuses to concede he lost the poll.","President-elect Joe Biden says Donald Trump's refusal to concede the election ""will not help the president's legacy"" He also spoke in defence of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and said he had spoken to six world leaders President Donald Trump is refusing to admit losing the election, making unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud The US justice department has given federal prosecutors an unusual go-ahead to investigate alleged vote irregularities Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell says the president has every right to pursue legal challenges Democrat Joe Biden was projected as the election's winner, with an unassailable lead, on Saturday Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung This ends today's live coverage of the US 2020 election, and the latest from Trump's and Biden's teams as Biden works on his transition into the White House - only 10 weeks from now. Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy. Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition. You can watch more from Biden here: This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Embarrassment' that Trump has not conceded election The hidden text could be seen after the colours of the image were manipulated The UK government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his victory which also had the name ""Trump"" in the background. The ""Trump"" wording is not immediately obvious in the image inJohnson's tweet,external. However, theGuido Fawkes website,externalfound that by manipulating the colours of the image, the word ""Trump"" could be seen in the background, in a smaller font, in the message to Biden. The message also had the word ""second term"" buried in it, the website added. Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" You can read our full storyhere. It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

President Trump meanwhile tweeted he would ultimately win the race that he has been projected to lose.,"This video can not be played Biden: ""Embarrassment"" that Trump has not conceded the election Joe Biden has said President Donald Trump's refusal to concede victory in last week's White House election is ""an embarrassment"". But the US president-elect - who has been making contact with foreign leaders - insisted nothing would stop the transfer of power. Mr Trump meanwhile tweeted he would ultimately win the race that all major TV networks have forecast he lost. As happens every four years, US media projected the election victor. None of the state-by-state results have yet been certified. Several vote counts are continuing, and the outcome will only be set in stone once the US electoral college meets on 14 December. What Trump could do after leaving the White House What happens now? How is President Trump challenging the result? The electoral collegeis made up of delegates from each state. They are tasked with choosing the next president according to how their state voted. Mr Biden is projected to win more than the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency. The Democrat has a period of transition until his inauguration on 20 January to choose his team and prepare to take the reins of power. The president-elect was asked by a reporter on Tuesday what he thought of President Trump's refusal to acknowledge defeat. ""I just think it's an embarrassment, quite frankly,"" Mr Biden, a Democrat, said in Wilmington, Delaware. ""The only thing that, how can I say this tactfully, I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""At the end of the day, you know, it's all going to come to fruition on January 20,"" he added. Mr Biden has been fielding phone calls with foreign leaders as he prepares to assume office. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were among those he spoke to on Tuesday. Referring to those calls, Mr Biden said: ""I'm letting them know that America is back. We're going to be back in the game."" Election results in maps and charts Johnson congratulates Biden in phone call Americast: The election post-mortem But as he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris forge ahead, a little-known government agency led by a Trump appointee is stalling the handover. The General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. However, it has so far declined to formally recognise Mr Biden as president-elect, which means that the transition team is yet to receive $9.9m in federal funds and has not been able to send its staff to key departments. In a statement, the GSA said its administrator ""ascertains the apparent successful candidate once a winner is clear based on the process laid out in the Constitution"". In past transitions, the GSA recognised the new president soon after victory was declared. The only exception is the disputed vote in 2000 when it waited for a Supreme Court ruling on 14 December which decided the election in favour of George W Bush. Despite the delay, Mr Biden said: ""We don't see anything slowing us down, quite frankly."" This video can not be played Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrates the US vice-president-elect On Tuesday, Mr Trump took to Twitter to fire off several tweets in capital letters about ""massive ballot counting abuse"", asserting: ""We will win!"" His tweets were labelled by the social media network as disputed. The president has been making claims that Mr Biden was only able to win the election through electoral corruption, but no proof has emerged so far to support the allegations. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist, told a news conference at the Department of State on Tuesday that once every ""legal"" vote was counted a ""second Trump administration"" would begin. This video can not be played Mitch McConnell: 'Trump 100 percent within rights to look into election irregularities' Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have largely refrained from acknowledging Mr Biden's projected victory. Asked on Tuesday why he had not congratulated the Democrat, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said: ""Nothing to congratulate him about."" Missouri Senator Roy Blunt said Mr Trump ""may not have been defeated at all"". Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Mr Trump has every right to launch legal challenges to the result in several battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Few Republicans want to attract the ire of the president by publicly accepting that Joe Biden has won. The ones who have spoken out already - Senators Susan Collins, Ben Sasse and Mitt Romney among them - broke with Trump a long time ago. For the rest, the president still has enormous power in the party's base, and he can - and has - wielded it against those he believes are insufficiently loyal. And so, from Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on down, the name of the game is patience. Accept that the president has a right to make his claims, give him time to vent his frustration, but figure that there will be no evidence of sufficient magnitude to change the results of the election. Celebrate Republican down-ballot wins, without acknowledging the absurdity of alleged election-fixing that is massive enough to unseat a president but not to deliver a fully Democratic Congress. Through their actions, if not their words, the president's fellow Republicans are acknowledging that come January, there will be a new president. Mr Trump, too, shall pass. A Pennsylvania postal worker who claimed that officials tampered with mail-in ballots in the swing state has withdrawn his claims, according to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives Oversight Committee. Richard Hopkins alleged that a postmaster in Erie, Pennsylvania, had instructed workers to backdate late votes so they could be counted. He signed a legal statement under oath attesting to his claim, but the oversight committee said Mr Hopkins had disowned the allegation after questioning by a US Postal Service inspector general. A man claiming to be Mr Hopkins later denied retracting his story ina video posted to YouTube,external. ""I did not recant my statement,"" he said. ""That is not what happened and you will find out tomorrow."" Mr Trump retweeted the video, lauding the purported whistleblower as a ""brave patriot"". Mr Hopkins' claim was cited in a letter from Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, to the Department of Justice, urging it to open a federal investigation. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans received a boost on Tuesday in their campaign to keep control of the upper chamber of Congress as a Democratic challenger conceded defeat in a North Carolina race. The state's Republican incumbent Thom Tillis narrowly held on after his Democratic opponent, Cal Cunningham, was engulfed by scandal over an extramarital affair. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" With North Carolina settled, all eyes now turn to Georgia, where the two Senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Last week, Republicans were also able to retake an Alabama Senate seat won by Democrats in 2018, though they lost seats in Colorado and Arizona.

Tougher Covid rules for three Scottish areas,"This video can not be played The first minister says a sharp rise in case numbers has driven the move to Level 3 in three council areas Three Scottish council areas are to have tougher coronavirus rules imposed amid concern over an increase in cases. Fife, Angus and Perth and Kinross will all be moved from level two to level three of Scotland's five-tier system. It means pubs and restaurants in those areas will no longer be allowed to serve alcohol. But up to six people from two households in Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles will be able to meet inside their homes from Friday. Ms Sturgeon said this was possible because cases in the islands were ""very low and sporadic"", but warned that people who have travelled from the mainland should avoid in-house mixing for a time to limit the risk of importing the virus. Has your area changed its Covid alert level? Live reaction to the announcement The existing restrictions in all of the country's other local authority areas will remain unchanged for now - although some level three areas are continuing to see rapid increases in cases and will be closely monitored. Ms Sturgeon said the ""necessary and precautionary"" decision to move Fife, Perth and Kinross and Angus to level three from Friday was taken because cases in all three areas were on a ""sharply rising trajectory"". The most recent data shows that, in the space of a week, the number of cases per 100,000 of the population has increased by 32% in Perth and Kinross, by 40% in Fife, and by 47% in Angus. Medical experts had strongly recommended the move to level three as it was felt that level two may not be enough to reverse increases of that magnitude. The first minister said: ""I know this will be disappointing to residents and businesses in these areas. ""However, by acting now, we can hopefully prevent an even more serious deterioration in the situation."" Councillors David Alexander and David Ross, the co-Leaders of Fife Council, said the decision was not what they had been hoping for, but had been ""based on the facts"". But Dean Banks, director and chef at The Haar restaurant in St Andrews, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that the ban on alcohol sales meant he might have to shut his business again. The former Masterchef finalist said dozens of customers had already cancelled their bookings for the weekend, adding: ""We're not sure what's going on. One week we've had alcohol sales, we've boosted revenue again, and taking that away again just rips us in half. ""People are cancelling their tables, they don't want to come or they want to leave it until later date to enjoy it with a glass of wine. ""How does Covid-19 know if someone's drinking a cup of coffee or a glass of wine? What is the difference there? I don't really understand what the difference is."" Pubs and restaurants in Fife, Angus and Perth and Kinross will no longer be able to serve alcohol Alan Mitchell, the chief executive of Fife Chamber of Commerce, described the decision as ""a bitter pill to swallow"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, a Fife MSP, said it was ""disappointing"" that the first minister was unable to say what had caused the spread of the virus there. He added: ""The testing and tracing team don't seem to have that information for Fife. It is important as we need to understand what has gone wrong. ""It is also disappointing that the government did not use the time we had in the summer better to get on top of the virus, to stop it rising with massive increases in testing and with much faster tracing - hunting it down to wipe it out."" Perth and Kinross Council chief executive Karen Reid said she was disappointed by its move to level three, which she said would have a major impact of many people's lives both during the restrictions and in the aftermath. Level 3- Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, Perth & Kinross, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian. Level 2- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll & Bute, Borders, Dumfries & Galloway. Level 1 -Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles. There are currently no areas of Scotland under the most severe level four restrictions - which would be broadly similar to the national lockdown currently in place across England. But officials are concerned about a sharp rise in cases in Stirling and Inverclyde, and to a lesser extent South Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - which are all already in level three. Their advice has been that moving any of those areas to level four would not currently be merited - but the data will be monitored closely on a daily basis. Ms Sturgeon warned: ""Given the severity of the level four restrictions, we will not take a decision to move any part of the country to that level lightly. ""But nor will we shy away from it if we think it necessary to limit the damage the virus can do, or if we think a short period at level four may be less harmful overall than a prolonged period at level three. ""These are difficult decisions and the week ahead is a particularly crucial juncture."" She also said the number of cases appeared to have stabilised but was remaining ""stubbornly high"" in Glasgow, North and South Lanarkshire, West Lothian and West Dunbartonshire. The difficult question was therefore whether more time at level three will start to reduce cases there, or whether more action will be required. However, the first minister stressed that there were encouraging signs in several other level three areas, which could potentially see them being downgraded to level two if that trend continues. These include East Lothian, Edinburgh, Clackmannanshire, East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Midlothian and North and East Ayrshire. Ms Sturgeon said travel restrictions continued to be ""essential"" but would remain as guidance over the next week rather than being put into law as she has been considering doing. Opposition parties have called for greater transparency about the decision-making process, with Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard saying the announcement ""raises more questions"" about what it would take for areas to move down a level. Mr Leonard added: ""All the evidence must be shared and it must be persuasive"". The Federation of Small Businesses said the announcement of tougher restrictions in Fife, Perth and Kinross and Angus would cause heartache for many employers, and urged the Scottish government not to move any areas to level four ahead of the crucial Christmas period.

No guarantees on vaccine but NHS ready - Hancock,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: âOur plan is working and I am more sure than ever that we will prevail togetherâ The NHS will be ready from December to roll out the new coronavirus vaccine if it gets approved, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock told MPs the news about the vaccine was an important step but ""there are no guarantees"". He also said ""we don't know"" how many people will need to be vaccinated in order for life to return to normal. And he announced that, from Tuesday, NHS staff will begin being tested twice a week. It comes as a further 20,412 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with another 532 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. While the number of deaths recorded is higher than previous days, there is often an increase at the beginning of the week due to delays in weekend reporting. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Will the vaccine be compulsory? And other questions 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection On Monday,early results from the world's firsteffective coronavirus vaccine showed it could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid. The vaccine has been developed by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech and is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. The companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November - and a limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate up to 20 million people, as each person will need two doses for it to work effectively. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned people not to ""rely on this news as a solution"" as it is still ""very, very early days"". Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Hancock said: ""If this or any other vaccine is approved, we will be ready to begin a large-scale vaccination programme. ""We do not yet know whether or when a vaccine is approved, but I have tasked the NHS with being ready from any date from 1 December."" Earlier, Mr Hancock said the bulk of the rollout of a vaccine was always expected to be in the first part of 2021. Asked about how many people would need to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock said: ""The honest truth to that question is we don't know what proportion of the population vaccination needs to reach in order for this to stop the epidemic. ""The reason we don't know that is you can check in a clinical trial for the impact of the vaccine on protecting the individual... what you cannot check is the impact on the transmission of the disease by those people, because you have to have enough of the population, a significant proportion of the population, to have had the vaccine to understand that."" Earlier, Mr Hancock told the BBC that vaccinations would take place in care homes, centres such as sports halls and also clinics that would open seven days a week. He said he was giving GPs an extra Â£150m to help with the roll-out, and he believed NHS staff ""will rise to this challenge of being ready when the science comes good to inject hope into millions of arms this winter"". ""There are many hard days ahead, many hurdles to overcome, but our plan is working and I'm more sure than ever that we will prevail together,"" he added. Mr Hancock also said new rapid swab tests - which give results in less than an hour -will be made available across 67 local areas,after they were used in a mass testing trial in Liverpool. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that we are still in a 'critical moment' of Covid-19 response Older care home residents and care home staff are at the top ofa list from government scientific advisers,externalof who should be immunised first, followed by health workers. Mr Hancock said children would not be vaccinated. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on Mr Hancock to give priority access to relatives of care home residents so they can see their loved ones. And he asked the government to publish a strategy on how the vaccine would be rolled out. The Covid vaccine is the fastest ever vaccine to go from the drawing board to being proven highly effective. It will not be released for use until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. ""Our strong and independent regulator the MHRA will not approve a vaccine until it's clinically safe,"" Mr Hancock said. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said GPs have been told to prepare to give patients two vaccine doses - to be delivered between 21 and 28 days apart - during clinics that could run between 08:00 and 20:00 GMT seven days a week. It added that, due to the logistics and delivery requirements, including the need to store it at very cold temperatures, it was likely that groups of GP practices would need to work together with one ""designated vaccination site"". Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the government there has purchased around 20 large freezers to store the new vaccine at strategic locations. Cautious optimism is the tone of today. Matt Hancock insists the NHS will be ready to start deploying a coronavirus vaccine as soon as humanly possible. If regulators are able to give the green light in the next few weeks, some people could get their jab before Christmas - a most welcome gift for those at highest risk of severe Covid-19 illness. But he doesn't want people to get their hopes up too soon or assume life can now return to ""normal"". It can't. It would be a colossal mistake to relax now and let the virus rip, say leading medical advisers. Until and unless mass vaccination can happen, society needs to use the other weapons at its disposal to fight the virus and stop the spread. That means sticking with the social distancing and face masks, and testing people who may have the virus and asking them to isolate. The UK is still in the second wave and the actions taken by all of us now will influence how it plays out. Data from the UK national statistics agencies also showedthe number of deaths was more than 11% higher than normally expected. It showed 1,597 deaths mentioning Covid on the death certificate in the last week of October - up from 1,126 the week before. Although deaths usually do rise at this time of year, the data shows the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years.

QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? The government is sending 600,000 of the rapid testsout to more than 60 local directors of public health including ""across Yorkshire, the West Midlands, other parts of the North West, and the whole of the North East"".

Cardinal 'protected Church ahead of victims',"The report said the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols had sometimes failed to demonstrate compassion The head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has, at times, shown he cares more about the impact of abuse on the Church's reputation than on the victims, a report says. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse criticised,externalthe leadership of Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, and the Vatican. The cardinal said the church was ""deeply sorry this happened"". A lawyer representing survivors said the cardinal ""must go right away"". Cardinal Nichols told the BBC he had offered to resign on Sunday upon turning 75, as is church law when bishops reach this age, but this was rejected by the Vatican. He said: ""I offered my resignation to Pope Francis. His answer has come back very clear, very unambiguous. He wants me to stay in post, so I will stay because that's where my orders come from, that's where my mandate comes from. ""He wants me to stay - I'm going to stay and continue to work wholeheartedly at these matters."" How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Catholic Church 'shocked to core' by child abuse The inquiry found that between 1970 and 2015 the Church received more than 3,000 complaints of child sexual abuse against more than 900 individuals connected to the Church. Those complaints involved more than 1,750 victims and complainants, though the report said the true scale of abuse was much higher and would likely never be known. It was ""far from a solely historical issue"", the inquiry found, adding that more than 100 allegations of abuse had been reported each year since 2016. The Catholic Church's ""explicit moral purpose has been betrayed by those who sexually abused children, and by those who turned a blind eye and failed to take action against perpetrators"". It said the cardinal, who apologised for the Church's actions when he gave evidence, ""did not always exercise the leadership expected of a senior member of the Church, at times preferring to protect the reputation of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales and in Rome"". It added that Cardinal Nichols had shown ""no acknowledgement of any personal responsibility to lead or influence change"". ""Nor did he demonstrate compassion towards victims in the recent cases which we examined."" The report said that two previous inquiries into abuse in the Church, by Lord Nolan in 2001 and Lady Cumberlege in 2007, had brought change and improvements, but their recommendations had been implemented too slowly and not in full. It highlighted that in 2016, internal correspondence between members of the Diocese of Westminster's safeguarding commission described a victim of sexual abuse as ""manipulative"" and ""needy"". The report states: ""Real and lasting changes to attitudes have some way to go if the Roman Catholic Church is to shake off the failures of the past."" One of the ""repeated failures"" highlighted in the IICSA report was the case of Father James Robinson, a serial paedophile, who was moved to another parish within the Archdiocese of Birmingham after complaints were first made in the 1980s. He later fled to the US but was extradited back to the UK wherehe was convicted in 2010 of 21 sexual offences against four boys and jailed for 21 years. The report said ""appalling sexual abuse"" was inflicted on pupils atAmpleforth Collegein North Yorkshire and its adjoining junior school. Five people connected to the school have been convicted or cautioned in relation to ""offences involving sexual activity with a large number of children, or offences concerning pornography"", the report said. One of them was Father Piers Grant-Ferris who was moved to at least six other parishes after allegations of abuse came to light 1975. He was convicted of indecent assault against 15 boys in 2006. The inquiry also criticised the Vatican, describing its actions as in ""direct contrast with Pope Francis's public statement on child sexual abuse"". In 2019, the Pope called for ""concrete and effective actions that involve everyone in the Church"". The Holy See did not provide a statement to the inquiry and the ambassador at the time refused to give evidence. The report said: ""In responding in this way, the Holy See's stance was contrary to the spirit of its public statements and it missed the opportunity to demonstrate its engagement and leadership on the issue of child sexual abuse."" It added its response ""manifestly did not demonstrate a commitment to taking action"". One abuse survivor said it was bad enough to have been abused but ""to have it dismissed and covered up just takes even more of a toll on you"". Another survivor, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said ""thousands of pounds have been spent by the Diocese of Westminster in employing lawyers to keep me at arm's length"" as they continued to make their case. They added: ""The church needs a seismic shift in culture, especially at the top. If there is any hope at all of real change it will require a relinquishing of power, and a will to treat survivors as human beings."" Richard Scorer, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon who represents 32 survivors in IICSA, said: ""This is an absolutely damning report. ""It highlights the shocking scale of abuse, the disgraceful slowness of the church's response, the abject failures of leadership by Cardinal Nichols, and the Vatican's appalling refusal to cooperate properly with the inquiry. ""Cardinal Nichols needs to go right away - in any other walk of life he would be gone immediately."" Responding to the report, Cardinal Nichols told the BBC: ""The things in this report are in the public sphere, and I'm sure they've been taken into account, but the response I've got is very unambiguous. It is to stay, and stay I will."" He continued: ""I'm not here to defend myself... I am here to say we accept this report, we are grateful to IICSA for bringing the light and giving public space to those who have been abused, we are deeply sorry this happened... ""Today is more about me saying again, on behalf of everybody in the Catholic Church, how deeply, deeply regretful and sorry I am that anybody suffered, and that so many suffered is a terrible shame with which I must live and from which I must learn."" The report follows the publication of a similar inquiry intoabuse in the Church of England, which concluded the church had created a culture where abusers ""could hide"".

Mass Covid testing for 67 local areas in England,"Soldiers have been brought in to help with the mass testing programme in Liverpool Mass testing for coronavirus will be rolled out to 67 more areas in England, the health secretary has said. Areas including Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire and parts of the West Midlands will receive new rapid ""lateral flow"" tests. Matt Hancock said he hoped the new tests would find Covid-19 ""wherever it is, especially in those high prevalence areas"". It follows the launch of amass testing programme of people in Liverpool. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was sending 600,000 of the rapid tests out to directors of public health in 67 areas - listed below - as part of plans to expand asymptomatic testing for Covid-19. Mr Hancock said they would be used to test 10% of an area's community each week. Overall, 70 areas will have the new tests. Mass testing, like any potential vaccine, will be made available to the devolved administrations, and not just in England, the health secretary said. A further 20,412 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with another 532 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. 234,079 coronavirus tests were processed in the UK on Monday. News of the scheme came as the head of England's Test and Trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, told MPs the service was not a ""silver bullet"" to tackle coronavirus. The Conservative peer revealed that preliminary data showed a little over half of people - 54% - who were asked to self-isolate for 14 days said they had complied with the rules. ""Much as I would love that testing and tracing on its own would be a silver bullet to holding back the tide of Covid, unfortunately the evidence in the UK and in every other country in Europe is that's not the case,"" she said. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS was ready to start providingthe new coronavirus vaccine ""as fast as safely possible"". And Covid tests for students in England, so they can go home safely for Christmas,could begin on 30 November, according to a letter from the universities minister to vice chancellors. Where will mass testing be available? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection Mass testing means asking everyone to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. The idea is to find healthy people who may be infected, but not yet displaying symptoms. They can then be told to isolate to avoid spreading the virus. Currently, across most of England, people can only have a test if they already have symptoms. But during the Liverpool pilot, everyone living or working in the city is being offered a voluntary test. More than 23,000 residents and workers in the area have been tested since Friday. As well as the normal swab tests, the mass-testing schemes use rapid ""lateral flow"" tests. These also use a swab but do not need to be sent to a lab and can give results within an hour. In a statement, Mr Hancock said the ""new, rapid"" technology means ""we can detect this virus quicker than ever before, even in people who don't have symptoms"". He added: ""Mass testing is a vital tool to help us control this virus and get life more normal."" TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? As part of the latest plans, each local area will receive a batch of 10,000 lateral flow tests, DHSC said. Local public health directors will then decide how people in the local area are tested, and how to prioritise the allocation of the tests based on the specific needs of their communities. The initial 600,000 batch will then be followed up with a weekly allocation of lateral flow antigen tests. According to DHSC, areas were prioritised for the scheme based on the local prevalence of the virus and expressions of interest to the department.

Liverpool's director of public health, Matt Ashton, on Saturday said the mass testing was showing positive signs after thousands of people were tested on the first day of the pilot scheme. The programme aims to test up to 50,000 people a day once fully operational, he added. The city's mayor, Joe Anderson, on Monday said 23,170 people have been tested for coronavirus in the city since midday on Friday, with 0.7% testing positive.

"Tributes paid to football's famous pie manBrian Murdoch fed Kidderminster Harriers fans for nearly 60 years with the ""match day treats"".Hereford & Worcester","Brian Murdoch, pictured with his wife Joan and grandson Ben, was a dedicated football fan, his family said The family of a man famed for his football stadium pies have been ""overwhelmed"" by tributes following his death at the age of 81. Brian Murdoch, whose family business has fed fans at Kidderminster Harriers for nearly 60 years, died on Saturday, the club said. The lifelong Harriers fan was known for  his ""incomparable character and warmth"", a club spokesman said. His piesregularly topped chartsas the most expensive pie in British football. But some fans defended the cost, saying they were a tasty meal made from fresh ingredients. Club spokesman Matty Paddock said the Harriers Pies and Aggborough Soup had a ""cult following in football"". The family-run business is set to continue selling pies and other food at the ground Speaking in 2012, Mr Murdoch said he would ""not compromise"" on quality. ""Barcelona have Messi, Real Madrid have Ronaldo and Kidderminster have our pies,"" he said. Latest news from the West Midlands Neil Male, Harriers chief executive, said: ""I know how much Brian and his family's food business meant to the fans here - for those coming to matches at Aggborough, he was a constant for many, many years and he'll be sadly missed."" Fans saluted Mr Murdoch on Twitter, with Brighton fan Simon Harris tweeting: ""One of the best things about being a fan of a lower league club is the away days. The local fans and staff at small grounds that have a passion for it that you just don't get at the 'big clubs'."" Mr Murdoch will be ""sadly missed"" at the stadium, the club said BBC Sport journalist Ged Scott said Mr Murdoch was a ""lovely bloke"" who always had time to chat. ""Even sometimes actually during match days at half-time at Aggborough, when it was clearly all hands to the pump behind the scenes in his kiosk,"" he said. Mr Murdoch had been unwell for three years, and leaves his wife Joan, four children and 11 grandchildren. His daughter Helen will continue to run the catering business at Aggborough, once the National League North side is allowed to let supporters back into the stadium.

"NI set for 570,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine","Vaccination for those at most risk from Covid-19 could begin by the end of the year, according to NI's health minister NI is likely to receive about 570,000 doses ofthe new coronavirus vaccineif it passes the next stage of trials and becomes licensed. This means that 285,000 people could potentially be vaccinated for Covid-19. The Department of Health told BBC News NI that the local supply will be part of a UK order and distributed among the regions using the Barnett Formula. It said that the first 20 million doses of the vaccine is scheduled to be in the UK by the end of next March. On Tuesday, theDepartment of Health,externalannounced a further 11 coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland and 514 more positive cases. Sixteen deaths related to Covid-19 were announced in the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday, 14 of which occurred in November, one in October and one that ""remains under investigation"". There were a further 270 confirmed cases of the virus. Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robinson Swann said that while the vaccine was ""good news"", it still needed to officially pass phase three of its trials and be authorised by the regulator. On Monday,he said vaccination for those most at risk from Covid-19 could begin by the end of the year. 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how? Dr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, said the most vulnerable should get the vaccine first. ""We've 146 nursing home outbreaks in Northern Ireland today, so nursing homes have got to be a priority,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""Those over 85, those most vulnerable with underlying conditions and obviously the health care staff, because we've been losing a lot of health care staff to illness and isolation and we'd like to get them it because the intensive care units and the wards are very busy."" Dr Black said the logistics to get 570,000 doses of the vaccine rolled out would take ""some amount of work"" but could be done ""so many at a time - so the first cohort will be the over-85s"". The vaccine - developed by Pfizer and BioNTech - was tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised. Robin Swann said there was ""intense"" pressure on the health service The data shows that two doses, three weeks apart, are needed for the vaccine to work. Meanwhile, the health minister has said the vast majority of track and trace cases are being successfully detected. In the past week, a total of 4,450 cases have been sent to test, trace and protect and 4,023 cases were successfully detected, Robin Swann added. He told the assembly there were a further 9,267 contacts from these cases and that 99% of those were contacted. At-risk groups 'could get vaccine by end of year' 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection The vaccines that work - and the others on the way How soon can we expect a working vaccine?

Johnson congratulates Biden in phone call,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has congratulated Joe Biden on his US election win. Mr Biden called the PM ahead of the leaders of other major European countries. Mr Johnson said he looked forward to ""strengthening the partnership"" between the US and UK. He is also understood to have assured Mr Biden that Brexit would not undermine theGood Friday Agreementon peace in Northern Ireland. In a statement, Mr Biden's office,externalsaid he had ""reaffirmed"" his support for the Good Friday Agreement, which his Democratic predecessor in the White House, President Bill Clinton, played an instrumental role in bringing about. It said he had also expressed his desire to strengthen the historic ""special relationship"" between the two countries and ""redouble co-operation"" on issues of mutual concern, including health security and promoting democracy. The media declared Mr Biden the election winner on Saturday after he passed the threshold of 270electoral college votes. But counting is ongoing in some states, with incumbent President Donald Trump disputing many of the results. PM Biden tweet glitch blamed on technical error What a Biden presidency means for the UK World leaders who haven't congratulated Biden A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had ""warmly congratulated"" Mr Biden and ""conveyed his congratulations"" to Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris. ""They discussed the close and longstanding relationship between our countries and committed to building on this partnership in the years ahead, in areas such as trade and security - including through Nato,"" the No 10 spokesperson added. ""The prime minister and president-elect also looked forward to working closely together on their shared priorities, from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy, and building back better from the coronavirus pandemic."" There is always a clamour to get an early call with a US President-elect. It seems Boris Johnson has fared well - with his phone ringing before other European leaders. Downing Street will hope that's a sign that Joe Biden values the ""special relationship"" and wants to work closely with Mr Johnson. But it's important to note President-elect Biden has been talking tonight about the importance of the Good Friday Agreement in the context of Brexit. It was raised in the call with the UK prime minister, who insisted the peace treaty would be protected by his plans. The controversialInternal Market Bill- which Mr Biden has previously raised questions about - wasn't discussed by name. But the UK knows the sands in the White House are shifting. A Brexit enthusiast is being replaced by a sceptic. The 25-minute conversation came amid concerns that Mr Biden'spreviously stated dislike of Brexit- which Mr Trump, by contrast, supported - could strain relations. It's understood Mr Johnson and Mr Biden discussed the importance of implementing Brexit in a way that upholds the Good Friday Agreement. Mr Johnson assured the President-elect that would be the case. Mr Biden later spoke to Ireland's Taoiseach (PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin, in what Mr Martin's aides described as a ""warm conversation"". ""President-elect Biden recalled his strong Irish roots and his visit to Ireland with his family in 2016,"" the Irish government said in a statement. ""The President-elect reaffirmed his full support for the Good Friday Agreement and they discussed the importance of a Brexit outcome that respects the Good Friday Agreement and ensures no return of a border on the island of Ireland."" The president-elect later spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Macron promised to work with the US to tackle climate change and terrorism, while Mrs Merkel said she wanted a close working relationship with the Biden administration, their spokespeople said. Earlier on Tuesday, the UK government blamed a""technical error""for a tweet from Mr Johnson congratulating Mr Biden on his US election victory which faintly showed the name ""Trump"" in the background.

Biden: Trump refusal to concede 'an embarrassment',"President-elect Joe Biden says Donald Trump's refusal to concede the election ""will not help the president's legacy"" He also spoke in defence of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and said he had spoken to six world leaders President Donald Trump is refusing to admit losing the election, making unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud The US justice department has given federal prosecutors an unusual go-ahead to investigate alleged vote irregularities Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell says the president has every right to pursue legal challenges Democrat Joe Biden was projected as the election's winner, with an unassailable lead, on Saturday Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung This ends today's live coverage of the US 2020 election, and the latest from Trump's and Biden's teams as Biden works on his transition into the White House - only 10 weeks from now. Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy.

The ""Trump"" wording is not immediately obvious in the image inJohnson's tweet,external. However, theGuido Fawkes website,externalfound that by manipulating the colours of the image, the word ""Trump"" could be seen in the background, in a smaller font, in the message to Biden. The message also had the word ""second term"" buried in it, the website added. Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" You can read our full storyhere. It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"".

LiveLiveBiden: Trump refusal to concede 'an embarrassment'15 minutes ago,"President-elect Joe Biden says Donald Trump's refusal to concede the election ""will not help the president's legacy"" He also spoke in defence of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and said he had spoken to six world leaders President Donald Trump is refusing to admit losing the election, making unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud The US justice department has given federal prosecutors an unusual go-ahead to investigate alleged vote irregularities Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell says the president has every right to pursue legal challenges Democrat Joe Biden was projected as the election's winner, with an unassailable lead, on Saturday Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung This ends today's live coverage of the US 2020 election, and the latest from Trump's and Biden's teams as Biden works on his transition into the White House - only 10 weeks from now. Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy. Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition. You can watch more from Biden here: This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Embarrassment' that Trump has not conceded election The hidden text could be seen after the colours of the image were manipulated The UK government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his victory which also had the name ""Trump"" in the background. The ""Trump"" wording is not immediately obvious in the image inJohnson's tweet,external. However, theGuido Fawkes website,externalfound that by manipulating the colours of the image, the word ""Trump"" could be seen in the background, in a smaller font, in the message to Biden. The message also had the word ""second term"" buried in it, the website added. Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" You can read our full storyhere. It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"".

Clarke resigns as FA chairman over languageGreg Clarke resigns as FA chairman following the language he used when talking to MPs about diversity.,"Clarke became Football Association chairman in August 2016 Warning: This report contains offensive language. Football Association chairman Greg Clarke has resigned over the ""unacceptable"" language he used when referring to black players. Clarke said he was ""deeply saddened"" for the offence he had caused by using the term ""coloured footballers"". The comments came as he was talking about the racist abuse of players by trolls on social media to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee via video link. Clarke said,externalhis words were a ""disservice to our game"". He prompted further criticism when referring to gay players making a ""life choice"" and a coach telling him young female players did not like having the ball hit hard at them. He also said there were ""a lot more South Asians than there are Afro-Caribbeans"" in the FA's IT department because ""they have different career interests"". Black FA chairman would be 'huge step' in fight for equality, says England's Mings Newsbeat: why Greg Clarke's language was so offensive (warning - contains offensive language) ""We can confirm that Greg Clarke has stepped down from his role as our chairman,""said an FA statement.,external ""Peter McCormick will step into the role as interim FA chairman with immediate effect and the FA Board will begin the process of identifying and appointing a new chair in due course."" Following his resignation, Clarke said: ""My unacceptable words in front of Parliament were a disservice to our game and to those who watch, play, referee and administer it. This has crystallised my resolve to move on. ""I am deeply saddened that I have offended those diverse communities in football that I and others worked so hard to include."" During the parliamentary hearing, Clarke apologised after being prompted to say sorry by MP Kevin Brennan. Brennan said Clarke's language in reference to black players was the kind that did not encourage inclusion, while fellow committee member Alex Davies-Jones called it ""abhorrent"". Clarke had earlier spoken of the need to attract people into the sport from a diverse range of communities. The equality charity Kick It Out said his remark about black players should be ""consigned to the dustbin of history"" and criticised his comments concerning people from South Asia, gay players and female footballers. Clarke had been called to give evidence to the DCMS committee about the Premier League's potential bailout of English Football League clubs and the structural reforms proposed as part of Project Big Picture. ""As a person who loves football and has given decades of service to our game, it is right that I put the interests of football first,"" added Clarke in the statement confirming his departure. ""2020 has been a challenging year and I have been actively considering standing down for some time to make way for a new chair now our CEO transition is complete and excellent executive leadership under Mark Bullingham is established."" A statement from anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card,externalsaid Clarke's comments ""only serve to demonstrate the power of language and the damage of stereotyping groups of people"". Speaking before the resignation was announced,Sanjay Bhandari,executive chair at Kick It Out, said Clarke's comments to the DCMS were outdated. ""I was particularly concerned by the use of lazy racist stereotypes about South Asians and their supposed career preferences. It reflects similar lazy stereotypes I have heard have been spouted at club academy level,"" he said. ""Being gay is not a 'life choice' as he claimed too. The casual sexism of saying girls do not like balls hit at them hard is staggering from anyone, let alone the leader of our national game. It is completely unacceptable."" Sports MinisterNigel Huddlestonsaid: ""Greg Clarke's comments have caused deep offence and were completely unacceptable. I acknowledge his decades of service to football and his apology, but he was right to stand down as chairman of the FA."" David Bernstein,former FA chairman, told BBC Sport: ""I am just surprised that the chair of any organisation who's got a feel of what's going on in the year 2020 could use those types of words, that sort of language. It's just inappropriate."" Darren Bent,former England striker: ""Slip of the tongue was it? Awful, just awful."" Anton Ferdinand,former West Ham, Sunderland and QPR defender: ""Clearly education is needed at all levels."" Julian Knight,DCMS select committee chairman: ""It's right that Greg Clarke apologised before the committee. However, this isn't the first time that the FA has come to grief over these issues. It makes us question their commitment to diversity."" Alex Davies-Jones,DCMS committee member: ""The language used by Greg Clarke in our meeting this morning was absolutely abhorrent. It speaks volumes about the urgent progress that needs to made in terms of leadership on equalities issues in sport. I can't believe we'restillhere in 2020."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Three years ago - in front of thesame parliamentary committee,Greg Clarke was criticised for referring to institutional racism as ""fluff"". He apologised after being chastised by MPs and reminded that language matters. It appears the message did not get through. Two weeks after the FA launched a new diversity code with the aim of finally tackling racial inequality in the game, such efforts have once again been called into question, despite Clarke always insisting it was one of his priorities. Amid under-representation of BAME managers and board members, many critics will see Clarke's comments as evidence of the attitudes and language that has prevented the organisation from overseeing the progress hoped for in recent years, and it is no surprise that he has decided to step down. There have been other awkward moments. In 2018, LGBT supporters group Pride in Football said it was ""shocked"" after Clarke signed a memorandum of understanding with the FA of Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. In July, he had to backtrack after claiming representatives of the Premier League and EFL had blocked plans to increase racial diversity on the FA Board. Despite having barely been seen since the start of the year, Clarke was already under pressure over his role initiating secret talks over the Project Big Picture plans for a radical overhaul of the English game. Indeed earlier in the committee hearing, he was asked if his authority was ""shot"", something he strongly denied. But then came his comments on diversity. Amid an unprecedented financial crisis for the sport and damaging divisions with fans, leagues and government, the FA chairman has now had to go over yet another controversy.

DUP blocks two-week Covid restrictions extension,"The current coronavirus restrictions are due to end at midnight on Thursday Proposals from the health minister to extend coronavirus restrictions in NI for two more weeks have been blocked after an executive vote. Advice from Robin Swann's officials recommended keeping the measures in place until 27 November. The DUP opposed the move, and triggered a cross-community vote to effectively veto the proposals. The current restrictions are due to end at midnight on Thursday. The hospitality sector is waiting to find outwhether it can resume trading on Friday after a four-week shutdown. It comes after theDepartment of Health,externalannounced a further 11 coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland on Tuesday and 514 more positive cases. Ministers are currently considering alternative proposals from DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds. The talks began shortly after 18:00 GMT and still had not concluded after 23:00, as ministers wrangled over a plan. Mrs Dodds's paper suggests close-contact services such as hair and beauty salons can reopen on Friday, by appointment. It also proposes allowing unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops to reopen on Friday, but licensed restaurants would remain closed until 27 November. It is also understood that a ""safely open group"" could be established if ministers agree the plans, that would cover hospitality. BBC News NI understands that Mrs Dodds's paper also stresses the need for increased visibility of police and environmental health officers to manage enforcement. The minister has previously said she did not want the restrictions to be extended, as it could further damage the economy. It is understood she still holds this view, but recognises that the executive must agree a ""general consensus"". And so the wait for business owners and employees alike goes on, almost a week since health officials first recommended that the restrictions should be extended. There was a distinct sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu emerging tonight, as attempts for the executive to meet were pushed back repeatedly while the parties tried to work out a plan they could feasibly sign up to. DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster was facing much internal pressure not to bow to calls to extend the measures, despite the health advice. It's understood the DUP's use of the cross-community veto did not go down well with the Alliance minister Naomi Long, who is excluded from such votes as her party is neither unionist nor nationalist. Now that the DUP has managed to bring its own proposals to the executive, it may feel that provides its ministers with some political cover to stand over decisions which may end up being made tonight. However, nothing is over the line yet. Some businesses may feel the decisions are coming too late, with many unable to prepare for opening with two days' notice, even if they get the green light. Others will also wonder about the executive's messaging - easing some restrictions at a time when doctors have been calling for ""breathing space"", to keep the rate of infection as low as possible in the run-up to Christmas. A number of DUP backbench MLAs have previously vocally opposed the coronavirus regulations agreed by the power-sharing executive, which the DUP jointly leads with Sinn FÃ©in. Earlier, the executive was accused by DUP MLA Paul Frew of ""letting businesses down by the hour"" by delaying a decision on extending coronavirus restrictions. Hair and beauty salons had to shut for four weeks on 16 October Mr Frew, who has openly criticised his party's decision-making on the coronavirus regulations before, told the assembly on Tuesday that the delay in announcing a decision was ""unbelievable"". ""This is a tremendously harsh time for businesses and yet this executive is causing an act of vandalism to those businesses,"" he said during a debate on the Budget Bill. ""It is a shameful position to be in. ""It is an act of vandalism to not be able to tell a business on the Tuesday that they can open up for sure on the Friday, that they can fill up their fridge, bring in their stock and pay their supply line - it's no way to run a business and no way to run an executive. ""It's an absolute farce we are letting so many people down, who just want to earn a decent living and who provide so much."" Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said he believed the DUP had been ""too strident,"" by suggesting the restrictions would not remain in place longer than four weeks. ""Arlene (Foster) put herself on a hook by saying at an early stage that these restrictions would come to an end before progress was made,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. ""Good progress is being made, but from our point of view it would be reckless now to throw it all away."" He said there was a case to be made for reopening hair and beauty salons, but that restrictions on hospitality should remain in place for another fortnight, as health officials initially recommended. Hair and beauty salons closed on Friday 16 October - it is thought they could reopen with some mitigations Alison Canney, owner of the Spaghetti Junction restaurant in Londonderry, said they are undecided whether they would reopen at all if a limit or a ban is placed on alcohol sales. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, the Derry business owner said: ""It is doable but is it the same? I don't think so. ""People come out to relax and unwind. It's an experience. It's not like alcohol is essential, but people like a glass of wine with an Italian meal."" Hair and beauty salons have also been closed since 16 October. Beautician Carolyn McCauley said First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill needed to ""put on their big girl pants and make decisions"". ""At this stage, it's simply not good enough,"" she said. ""They've had four weeks to make these decisions and now here we are, at the 11th hour, and there's still no decision."" Michael Cafolla, who runs a large cafe in Newtownards, County Down, called on the executive to ""consult with people on the coal face of this industry, look at the evidence and make sure that the evidence backs up the decisions that are made"". Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said there had been ""no direction, leadership or consistent messaging"" for businesses. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party supports extending all of the restrictions for an extra fortnight, to reduce the possibility of further interventions before Christmas. ""We need to look beyond short-term decision making and ensure we achieve a safe Christmas by driving down Covid-19 now,"" he said. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said the executive ""absolutely does need"" to take a decision on Tuesday. ""It would be wrong if the clock was allowed to run down on this and we saw the restrictions almost disappearing by default,"" he said.

Mixed response as 2021 exams in Wales scrapped,"This video can not be played Some pupils are happy with the news but others less so Wales' GCSE, AS and A-level exams in summer 2021 are to be cancelled, with grades based on classroom assessments. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams due to the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic. Head teachers would work on a ""national approach"" to ensure consistency, she said. Assessments will be done under teacher supervision, and will begin in the second half of the spring term. They will be externally set and marked but delivered within the classroom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She added cancelling exams would also give time for teaching to continue through the summer term. Teachers would have flexibility on when to take the assessments, within the ""context of results timelines"". However one teaching union questioned whether the announcement would mean ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Confirming the decision, Ms Williams said: ""The well-being of learners and ensuring fairness across the system is central in our decision making process. ""We remain optimistic that the public health situation will improve, but the primary reason for my decision is down to fairness; the time learners will spend in schools and colleges will vary hugely and, in this situation, it is impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams to take place. ""We have consulted with universities across the UK and they have confirmed that they are used to accepting many different types of qualifications."" Ms Williams said it remained a ""highly challenging year"" but the announcement would remove pressures from learners and provide ""clear time for teaching and learning"". Cerys Harris has had to study at home while self-isolating for a total of four weeks since September A-level student Cerys Harris, 17, from Rhyl, has already had four weeks of self-isolation this term because of cases in her ""bubble"". She wants to start a degree next September in England. Although the education minister said universities are familiar with different qualifications, Cerys said she did not feel reassured, and was looking forward to more detail as to how the system is going to work. ""I've taken from [the announcement] that exams are cancelled, but it's not very straightforward,"" she said. Fellow Rhyl A-level student Jonathon Dawes, who studies at Coleg Cambria and is also a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament, said he welcomed the decision, but was looking forward to getting more detail. ""I'm looking forward to more guidance coming out to make sure it's as fair and transparent as possible, to make sure pupils get the grades they deserve and it's not different from school to school."" Jess Foster says she has had ""stress"" taken away by the announcement Jess Foster, 17, who is taking her A-levels at Bassaleg School in Newport, was ""immediately relieved"". ""I stress out about things personally a lot. To hear that taken off me instantly just felt really good,"" she said. Head teacher Victoria Lambe said the decision ""places trust"" in her profession Her head teacher, Victoria Lambe, welcomed the announcement, describing the move as ""brave"" and the ""fairest"" decision for young people. ""It very much places trust is the teaching profession. I think it will enable us to continue to put robust measures in place for monitoring pupils' progress,"" she said. ""It's been an incredibly stressful period for all members of the school community and this will enable us to really reduce stress levels."" In England, exams are still going ahead but some have beenmoved back by three weeksto allow for more teaching time, and with reduced content in some subjects. In Scotland, the GCSE-equivalentNational 5 exams are cancelled and replaced by teacher assessmentsand coursework, but Higher and Advanced Higher exams will just be delayed by two weeks. Exams in Northern Ireland are still going aheadbut the number of papers in some subjects has been reduced. Downing Street said there was no change to the plan to hold exams in England following Ms Williams's announcement. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We continue to think that exams are the fairest way of judging the students' performance."" The future generations commissioner said GCSEs should be permanently replaced Exam regulator Qualifications Wales, which advised the minister on her decision, said: ""We recognise this has been a difficult decision and there are no easy answers. We are considering the decision and what it could mean in practice. ""In the meantime, we will provide advice to the Independent Design and Delivery Advisory Group."" Wales secretary of the National Education Union David Evans said: ""We must ensure that young people have a consistent assessment process in place which means their abilities are recognised for their next steps. ""But this must not mean extra work for everyone involved - both staff and students alike. The education system is already struggling."" 'I don't want exams to go ahead next year' 'Scrap exams for 2021 after Covid disruption' Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 Children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said Ms Williams had made the right decision. She said: ""This should be a year of learning, not worry. Young people should now rest assured that the decision will enable them to work towards their qualifications."" Her words were echoed by Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, who said it would maximise ""fairness"" for students. ""This is the right decision for our young people,"" she added. ""It recognises the fact that they will have been affected to differing extents by the impact of the pandemic and it allows for as much teaching time as possible to catch-up with lost learning."" But the head of the school leaders' union NAHT raised concerns of ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Ruth Davies said: ""It has been announced that pupils will still be given externally set and marked tests, just in the classroom. ""We can't see how that isn't an exam. There is an awful lot of detail still to be determined, and we await further clarification, but we are worried we will end up with exams in all but name."" Future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said GCSEs should be permanently replaced with assessments which were centred around pupils ""not testing"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian MS said with so much variation in how much education a pupil had received, a ""one size fits all"" approach would not have been fair. The Conservative spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""The critical issue for me is that assessments are externally set and externally marked. This will give them some comparability with previous years' exams and protect teachers against any accusations of unintended bias."" Reform MS Mandy Jones asked the government to review the announcement to allow students to sit exams if they wished. The 2020 exams were cancelled following the start of the first lockdown and results were eventually based on teacher-predicted grades. Ms Williams said her decision for the 2021 exams came after she considered detailed advice from Qualifications Wales on available options as well as interim findings of a review of the 2020 exam process. She also spoke to students, school and college leaders, universities and the children's commissioner. She said: ""In line with the recommendations of both Qualifications Wales and the Independent Review, there will be no exams for GCSE or AS level learners next year. ""A-level students will also not be required to sit exams.""

Clarke resigns as FA chairman over language,"Clarke became Football Association chairman in August 2016 Warning: This report contains offensive language. Football Association chairman Greg Clarke has resigned over the ""unacceptable"" language he used when referring to black players. Clarke said he was ""deeply saddened"" for the offence he had caused by using the term ""coloured footballers"". The comments came as he was talking about the racist abuse of players by trolls on social media to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee via video link. Clarke said,externalhis words were a ""disservice to our game"". He prompted further criticism when referring to gay players making a ""life choice"" and a coach telling him young female players did not like having the ball hit hard at them. He also said there were ""a lot more South Asians than there are Afro-Caribbeans"" in the FA's IT department because ""they have different career interests"". Black FA chairman would be 'huge step' in fight for equality, says England's Mings Newsbeat: why Greg Clarke's language was so offensive (warning - contains offensive language) ""We can confirm that Greg Clarke has stepped down from his role as our chairman,""said an FA statement.,external ""Peter McCormick will step into the role as interim FA chairman with immediate effect and the FA Board will begin the process of identifying and appointing a new chair in due course."" Following his resignation, Clarke said: ""My unacceptable words in front of Parliament were a disservice to our game and to those who watch, play, referee and administer it. This has crystallised my resolve to move on. ""I am deeply saddened that I have offended those diverse communities in football that I and others worked so hard to include."" During the parliamentary hearing, Clarke apologised after being prompted to say sorry by MP Kevin Brennan. Brennan said Clarke's language in reference to black players was the kind that did not encourage inclusion, while fellow committee member Alex Davies-Jones called it ""abhorrent"". Clarke had earlier spoken of the need to attract people into the sport from a diverse range of communities. The equality charity Kick It Out said his remark about black players should be ""consigned to the dustbin of history"" and criticised his comments concerning people from South Asia, gay players and female footballers. Clarke had been called to give evidence to the DCMS committee about the Premier League's potential bailout of English Football League clubs and the structural reforms proposed as part of Project Big Picture. ""As a person who loves football and has given decades of service to our game, it is right that I put the interests of football first,"" added Clarke in the statement confirming his departure. ""2020 has been a challenging year and I have been actively considering standing down for some time to make way for a new chair now our CEO transition is complete and excellent executive leadership under Mark Bullingham is established."" A statement from anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card,externalsaid Clarke's comments ""only serve to demonstrate the power of language and the damage of stereotyping groups of people"". Speaking before the resignation was announced,Sanjay Bhandari,executive chair at Kick It Out, said Clarke's comments to the DCMS were outdated. ""I was particularly concerned by the use of lazy racist stereotypes about South Asians and their supposed career preferences. It reflects similar lazy stereotypes I have heard have been spouted at club academy level,"" he said. ""Being gay is not a 'life choice' as he claimed too. The casual sexism of saying girls do not like balls hit at them hard is staggering from anyone, let alone the leader of our national game. It is completely unacceptable."" Sports MinisterNigel Huddlestonsaid: ""Greg Clarke's comments have caused deep offence and were completely unacceptable. I acknowledge his decades of service to football and his apology, but he was right to stand down as chairman of the FA."" David Bernstein,former FA chairman, told BBC Sport: ""I am just surprised that the chair of any organisation who's got a feel of what's going on in the year 2020 could use those types of words, that sort of language. It's just inappropriate."" Darren Bent,former England striker: ""Slip of the tongue was it? Awful, just awful."" Anton Ferdinand,former West Ham, Sunderland and QPR defender: ""Clearly education is needed at all levels."" Julian Knight,DCMS select committee chairman: ""It's right that Greg Clarke apologised before the committee. However, this isn't the first time that the FA has come to grief over these issues. It makes us question their commitment to diversity."" Alex Davies-Jones,DCMS committee member: ""The language used by Greg Clarke in our meeting this morning was absolutely abhorrent. It speaks volumes about the urgent progress that needs to made in terms of leadership on equalities issues in sport. I can't believe we'restillhere in 2020."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Three years ago - in front of thesame parliamentary committee,Greg Clarke was criticised for referring to institutional racism as ""fluff"". He apologised after being chastised by MPs and reminded that language matters. It appears the message did not get through. Two weeks after the FA launched a new diversity code with the aim of finally tackling racial inequality in the game, such efforts have once again been called into question, despite Clarke always insisting it was one of his priorities. Amid under-representation of BAME managers and board members, many critics will see Clarke's comments as evidence of the attitudes and language that has prevented the organisation from overseeing the progress hoped for in recent years, and it is no surprise that he has decided to step down. There have been other awkward moments. In 2018, LGBT supporters group Pride in Football said it was ""shocked"" after Clarke signed a memorandum of understanding with the FA of Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. In July, he had to backtrack after claiming representatives of the Premier League and EFL had blocked plans to increase racial diversity on the FA Board. Despite having barely been seen since the start of the year, Clarke was already under pressure over his role initiating secret talks over the Project Big Picture plans for a radical overhaul of the English game. Indeed earlier in the committee hearing, he was asked if his authority was ""shot"", something he strongly denied. But then came his comments on diversity. Amid an unprecedented financial crisis for the sport and damaging divisions with fans, leagues and government, the FA chairman has now had to go over yet another controversy.

Anti-lockdown Tory MPs to press for new approach,"Conservative MPs have set up a group to fight any future lockdown in England, arguing it would be ""devastating"" for the economy and ""cost lives"". The Covid Recovery Group, which has around 50 MP members, wants the country to ""live with"" coronavirus after nationwide restrictions end next month. The ""cure"" prescribed by the government ran ""the risk of being worse than the disease"", MP Mark Harper said. But the PM has stressed the NHS faces a ""medical disaster"" without action. A further 20,412 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with another 532 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. No guarantees on vaccine but NHS ready - Hancock Northern England 'worst hit' by Covid-19 pandemic Mass Covid testing for 67 local areas in England How many people could become unemployed? The four-week lockdown in England - which includes the closure of pubs, restaurants and non-essential retail, while curbing household mixing and unnecessary travel - is scheduled to end on 2 December. Parliament overwhelmingly backed the restrictions earlier this month, but 34 Conservative MPs, concerned about civil liberties and the effect on wider health and the economy, rebelled against the government. Another 19, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, abstained. The government says it wants a return to regionalised, tiered restrictions when lockdown ends - and ministers have been warned of an even larger rebellion if they try to extend it into Christmas and the New Year. The Covid Recovery Group - which includes ex-Chief Whip Mr Harper and the chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady - says the ""devastating cycle"" of prohibitions cannot go on. It wants ministers to investigate whether restrictions are costing more lives than they are saving, by stopping cancer and dementia treatments and increasing suicide rates among the under-40s. The group is calling for the ""monopoly"" it says scientists have on advising the government to end, and an assurance that no policies will go before Parliament without three ""independent"" experts backing them first. Figures published on Tuesday showed redundancies rose to a record high of 314,000 in the three months to the end of September, as firms laid off people in anticipation of furlough ending in November. Despite the government extending the wage-subsidy scheme to March, economists say the jobs picture remains bleak. Mr Harper said the country needed to find a ""sustainable way"" of living with Covid until a vaccine was available for mass use to stop ""immense"" economic damage. ""Lockdowns cost lives, whether in undiagnosed cancer treatments, deteriorating mental health, and missed A&E appointments - not to mention the impact it has on young people's education, job prospects and our soaring debts,"" he said. ""The cure we're prescribing runs the risk of being worse than the disease."" The new group, he added, would ""play its part in helping the government to deliver an enduring strategy for living with the virus... command public support, end this devastating cycle of repeated restrictions"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was critical people continued to follow the rules to get the infection rate down, adding that ""our plan is working"". He added that the NHS would be ready to begin the roll-out of a new vaccine from next month, if it gets approval. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people not to ""rely"" on this ""as a solution"" to the medical emergency caused by coronavirus.

'Mother of feminism' statue provokes backlash,"The statue is on display at Newington Green, near the site of the school Mary Wollstonecraft founded A memorial to the ""mother of feminism"" has provoked an online backlash after being unveiled in north London. The sculpture for Mary Wollstonecraft, by artist Maggi Hambling, went on display on Newington Green, Islington, on Tuesday. Born in London in 1759, Wollstonecraft was an 18th Century author and radical who promoted the rights of women. The silvered-bronze sculpture has drawn criticism from some who have queried the inclusion of a naked female figure. Bee Rowlatt, chairwoman of the Mary on the Green campaign for a statue, said: ""Her ideas changed the world. It took courage to fight for human rights and education for all. ""But following her early death in childbirth, her legacy was buried, in a sustained misogynistic attack. Today we are finally putting this injustice to rights. ""Mary Wollstonecraft was a rebel and a pioneer, and she deserves a pioneering work of art. ""This work is an attempt to celebrate her contribution to society with something that goes beyond the Victorian traditions of putting people on pedestals."" The statue is believed to be the world's first memorial sculpture in honour of Mary Wollstonecraft The unveiling is the culmination of a decade of campaigning to raise the Â£143,000 required to create the statue. The statue is already on display, and an unveiling ceremonywas live-streamed.,external It portrays a silver female figure emerging from a swirling mingle of female forms. More than 90% of London's monuments celebrate men, despite the population being 51% women, according to the campaign. However, it has been met with criticism for its symbolic depiction of a female figure, rather than being a lifelike representation of Wollstonecraft. Some have also queried the decision to make the figure naked. Writer Caitlin Moran claimed a better representation of a naked ""everywoman"" would be of ""WollstonecraftÂ dying, at 38, in childbirth, as so many women did back then - ending her revolutionary work."" ""That would make me think, and cry,"" she tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Writer Tracy King tweeted: ""There is no reason to depict Mary naked unless you are trying to be edgy to provoke debate. ""Statues of named men get to be clothed because the focus is on their work and achievements. ""Meanwhile, women walking or jogging through parks experience high rates of sexual harassment because our bodies are considered public property."" Caroline Criado Perez, who campaigned for Jane Austen to appear on the Â£10 note, said the statue ""feels disrespectful to Wollstonecraft herself"". Historian Simon Schama wrote that he ""always wanted a fine monument toÂ Wollstonecraft - this isn't it"". Wollstonecraft was born into prosperity in 1759, but her father, a drunk, squandered the family money. Like her mother, she often suffered abuse at his hands. As a woman, Wollstonecraft received little formal education but she set out to educate herself and at 25 opened a girls' boarding school on Newington Green, near the site of the statue. Wollstonecraft was 33 when she wrote her most famous work ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"" which imagined a social order where women were the equals of men. She mixed with the intellectual radicals of the day - debating with Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine and Joseph Priestley. She died aged 38 following the birth of her daughter, the author Mary Shelley. Ms Hambling has hit back at those who criticise her art work. She said: ""This sculpture encourages a visual conversation with the obstacles Ms Wollstonecraft overcame, the ideals she strived for, and what she made happen."" TheSuffolk-based artistsaid her critics ""are not reading the word, the important word, which is on the plinth, quite clearly 'for' Mary Wollstonecraft, it's not 'of' Mary Wollstonecraft. ""Clothes define people and restrict people, they restrict people's reaction. She's naked and she's every woman. ""Most male historic statues are way over life-size. My point was that the female figure doesn't need to dominate to be powerful. ""It's been compared to a rocket of hope going up to the sky, tracking the fight for female empowerment Wollstonecraft started."" The statue shows a silver female figure emerging from a swirling mingle of female forms Others have praised the statue. On Twitter historian Dr Fern Riddle said she ""loved"" the design. ""It reminds me of Metropolis crossed with the birth of Venus,"" she said. ""I  don't see 'me' in that figure, but I wouldn't see 'me' in a figurine of a fully dressed Mary either. I just like that it's here, and that anyone can interpret it how they want."" Historian Dr Sophie Coulombeau said,externalshe hopes those ""with a very strong opinion"" on the statue would also read Wollstonecraft's work. ""She's a lot weirder and ickier and more surreal than most [people] realise,"" Dr Coulombeau said. ""I think Hambling gets that.""

Manchester-based artist Akse said the mural was close to where the footballer grew up in Old Moat, Withington, before his family moved to Wythenshawe. Rashford's mother provided the quote on the mural, which read: ""Take pride in knowing that your struggle will play the biggest role in your purpose."" ""It's incredible,"" said Ed Wellard of Withington Walls. ""Akse is a world class artist but it's exceeded my expectations. It is amazing."" Akse said he had a video call with 23-year-old Rashford while working on the painting. ""It was very kind of him to take time to chat with me,"" he said.

Technical error blamed for PM's Biden tweet glitch,"The hidden text can be easily seen after the colours of the image are manipulated The government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his US election victory which faintly showed the name ""Trump"" in the background. Social media users commented on the discrepancy while theGuido Fawkes website,externalsaid the message also included the word ""second term"" buried in it. Officials said two messages were prepared before the result was known. The alternative one had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake, they said. Mr Johnson posted the message on Twitter on Saturday,externalafter broadcasters in the US and elsewhere declared the Democratic former vice-president the winner. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. On Monday, the prime minister - who has never met Mr Biden - congratulated him on his victory in a phone conversationwhich the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said lasted about 20 minutes. Mr Johnson said he and the president-elect discussed their ""shared priorities"" and was looking forward to ""strengthening the partnership"" between the two countries. The UK PM is believed to be the first European leader Mr Biden has spoken to since the election. Mr Biden is preparing to assume office in January, although incumbent President Donald Trump is refusing to accept the outcome of the election and is mounting a series of legal challenges in certain states. The message the PM sent on Sunday read: ""Congratulations to Joe Biden on his election as president of the United States and to Kamala Harris on her historic achievement. ""The US is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security."" But the message appeared to include traces of a different one referring to Mr Trump, who has been in office since 2017. Guido Fawkes said the ""remnants"" of this could be seen by adjusting the contrast and brightness levels of the actual message that was posted. This video can not be played UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaking about Joe Biden's victory: ""There's far more that unites us than divides us"" A government spokesperson said: ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" UK ministers have said they are excited about working with Mr Biden on issues such as climate change and trade. In recent days, Mr Biden's team has sought to downplay lingering tensions over Mr Johnson's role in Brexit and past comments he has made about both President Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama. Mr Biden, who has made his opposition to Brexit well known, has insisted maintaining peace in Northern Ireland is paramount in any post-Brexit UK-US trade deal. The president-elect is continuing a ring-round of world leaders, having also spoken to Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. Before news of Mr Biden's conversation with Mr Johnson emerged, the Irish PM Michael Martin posted a Twitter message saying he had just finished a ""positive"" conversation with the president-elect. The message was quickly deleted, after which the Irish government revealed it had been sent in error and although a call had been arranged the two had yet to speak. A few hours later, Mr Martin posted another message saying he had had a ""warm and engaging"" call with Mr Biden.

Will the vaccine be compulsory?,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

Coronavirus: Evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening.,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning. A vaccine could be rolled out by the NHS from 1 Decemberif it gets approval, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs. Mr Hancock updated the Commons on the government's vaccination plans after early results released on Monday showed a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTechcould prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. However, Mr Hancock cautioned that there were still no guarantees it would be approved and questions remained over the impact it would have on the transmission of the virus.You can read more here about who will get a vaccine first. Mr Hancock has also announced thatmass testing is to be rolled out to more than 60 areas across England. The health secretary told MPs that he had written to directors of public health across the country about providing ""10% of their population per week"" with tests. Areas due to receive the lateral flow test kits tests include Birmingham, Bristol, Newcastle, Sunderland, Wolverhampton, Manchester, Luton and several London boroughs. It comes after a mass testing trialbegan in Liverpoolthis month. Some 10,000 tests will be made available to each area to help them start testing priority groups, which will then be followed up with a weekly allocation.Read more about where mass testing will be available. Meanwhile, mass testing of students in Englandcould begin later this monthin order to allow them to return home safely for Christmas, according to a letter from the universities minister to university vice chancellors. The letter, seen by the BBC, promises a fast turnaround for tests and ""results within an hour"", with the aim of stopping students spreading the virus as they return home. A week of testing is proposed between 30 November and 6 December.Here we explore why getting students home for Christmas is a political priority. GCSE, AS and A-levels are to becancelled in Wales next year, with grades based on classroom assessments, the country's education minister has confirmed. Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams due to the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic. Assessments will be done under teacher supervision and will begin in the second half of the spring term. People have been turning to comfort foods during the pandemic, according to the company behind brands including Bisto, Ambrosia and Mr Kipling's cakes. Premier Foods said it had experienced ""exceptional"" demand through lockdown for its products, which had resulted in strong sales and profits for the past six months. Food critic and broadcaster Jay Rayner said the news was no surprise, adding: ""Many of those doing the cooking were kids 20 or so years before, so they are turning to these familiar foods.""

He said the England and Manchester United star's recent successful campaign to extend free school meals inspired the project. Rashford tweeted an image of the finished mural with a ""thank you"".

""It's incredible,"" said Ed Wellard of Withington Walls. ""Akse is a world class artist but it's exceeded my expectations. It is amazing."" Akse said he had a video call with 23-year-old Rashford while working on the painting. ""It was very kind of him to take time to chat with me,"" he said.

'Mother of feminism' statue provokes backlashThe Mary Wollstonecraft memorial draws criticism due to its inclusion of a naked female figure.,"The statue is on display at Newington Green, near the site of the school Mary Wollstonecraft founded A memorial to the ""mother of feminism"" has provoked an online backlash after being unveiled in north London. The sculpture for Mary Wollstonecraft, by artist Maggi Hambling, went on display on Newington Green, Islington, on Tuesday. Born in London in 1759, Wollstonecraft was an 18th Century author and radical who promoted the rights of women. The silvered-bronze sculpture has drawn criticism from some who have queried the inclusion of a naked female figure. Bee Rowlatt, chairwoman of the Mary on the Green campaign for a statue, said: ""Her ideas changed the world. It took courage to fight for human rights and education for all. ""But following her early death in childbirth, her legacy was buried, in a sustained misogynistic attack. Today we are finally putting this injustice to rights. ""Mary Wollstonecraft was a rebel and a pioneer, and she deserves a pioneering work of art. ""This work is an attempt to celebrate her contribution to society with something that goes beyond the Victorian traditions of putting people on pedestals."" The statue is believed to be the world's first memorial sculpture in honour of Mary Wollstonecraft The unveiling is the culmination of a decade of campaigning to raise the Â£143,000 required to create the statue. The statue is already on display, and an unveiling ceremonywas live-streamed.,external It portrays a silver female figure emerging from a swirling mingle of female forms. More than 90% of London's monuments celebrate men, despite the population being 51% women, according to the campaign. However, it has been met with criticism for its symbolic depiction of a female figure, rather than being a lifelike representation of Wollstonecraft. Some have also queried the decision to make the figure naked. Writer Caitlin Moran claimed a better representation of a naked ""everywoman"" would be of ""WollstonecraftÂ dying, at 38, in childbirth, as so many women did back then - ending her revolutionary work."" ""That would make me think, and cry,"" she tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Writer Tracy King tweeted: ""There is no reason to depict Mary naked unless you are trying to be edgy to provoke debate. ""Statues of named men get to be clothed because the focus is on their work and achievements. ""Meanwhile, women walking or jogging through parks experience high rates of sexual harassment because our bodies are considered public property."" Caroline Criado Perez, who campaigned for Jane Austen to appear on the Â£10 note, said the statue ""feels disrespectful to Wollstonecraft herself"". Historian Simon Schama wrote that he ""always wanted a fine monument toÂ Wollstonecraft - this isn't it"". Wollstonecraft was born into prosperity in 1759, but her father, a drunk, squandered the family money. Like her mother, she often suffered abuse at his hands. As a woman, Wollstonecraft received little formal education but she set out to educate herself and at 25 opened a girls' boarding school on Newington Green, near the site of the statue. Wollstonecraft was 33 when she wrote her most famous work ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"" which imagined a social order where women were the equals of men. She mixed with the intellectual radicals of the day - debating with Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine and Joseph Priestley. She died aged 38 following the birth of her daughter, the author Mary Shelley. Ms Hambling has hit back at those who criticise her art work. She said: ""This sculpture encourages a visual conversation with the obstacles Ms Wollstonecraft overcame, the ideals she strived for, and what she made happen."" TheSuffolk-based artistsaid her critics ""are not reading the word, the important word, which is on the plinth, quite clearly 'for' Mary Wollstonecraft, it's not 'of' Mary Wollstonecraft. ""Clothes define people and restrict people, they restrict people's reaction. She's naked and she's every woman. ""Most male historic statues are way over life-size. My point was that the female figure doesn't need to dominate to be powerful. ""It's been compared to a rocket of hope going up to the sky, tracking the fight for female empowerment Wollstonecraft started."" The statue shows a silver female figure emerging from a swirling mingle of female forms Others have praised the statue. On Twitter historian Dr Fern Riddle said she ""loved"" the design. ""It reminds me of Metropolis crossed with the birth of Venus,"" she said. ""I  don't see 'me' in that figure, but I wouldn't see 'me' in a figurine of a fully dressed Mary either. I just like that it's here, and that anyone can interpret it how they want."" Historian Dr Sophie Coulombeau said,externalshe hopes those ""with a very strong opinion"" on the statue would also read Wollstonecraft's work. ""She's a lot weirder and ickier and more surreal than most [people] realise,"" Dr Coulombeau said. ""I think Hambling gets that.""

The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival.

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy. Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition. You can watch more from Biden here: This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Embarrassment' that Trump has not conceded election The hidden text could be seen after the colours of the image were manipulated The UK government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his victory which also had the name ""Trump"" in the background.

It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city

Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy.

Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said.

It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured?

And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in.

Cardinal 'protected Church reputation over victims',"The report said the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols had sometimes failed to demonstrate compassion The head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has, at times, shown he cares more about the impact of abuse on the Church's reputation than on the victims, a report says. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse criticised,externalthe leadership of Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, and the Vatican. The cardinal said the church was ""deeply sorry this happened"". A lawyer representing survivors said the cardinal ""must go right away"". Cardinal Nichols told the BBC he had offered to resign on Sunday upon turning 75, as is church law when bishops reach this age, but this was rejected by the Vatican. He said: ""I offered my resignation to Pope Francis. His answer has come back very clear, very unambiguous. He wants me to stay in post, so I will stay because that's where my orders come from, that's where my mandate comes from. ""He wants me to stay - I'm going to stay and continue to work wholeheartedly at these matters."" How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Catholic Church 'shocked to core' by child abuse The inquiry found that between 1970 and 2015 the Church received more than 3,000 complaints of child sexual abuse against more than 900 individuals connected to the Church. Those complaints involved more than 1,750 victims and complainants, though the report said the true scale of abuse was much higher and would likely never be known. It was ""far from a solely historical issue"", the inquiry found, adding that more than 100 allegations of abuse had been reported each year since 2016. The Catholic Church's ""explicit moral purpose has been betrayed by those who sexually abused children, and by those who turned a blind eye and failed to take action against perpetrators"". It said the cardinal, who apologised for the Church's actions when he gave evidence, ""did not always exercise the leadership expected of a senior member of the Church, at times preferring to protect the reputation of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales and in Rome"". It added that Cardinal Nichols had shown ""no acknowledgement of any personal responsibility to lead or influence change"". ""Nor did he demonstrate compassion towards victims in the recent cases which we examined."" The report said that two previous inquiries into abuse in the Church, by Lord Nolan in 2001 and Lady Cumberlege in 2007, had brought change and improvements, but their recommendations had been implemented too slowly and not in full. It highlighted that in 2016, internal correspondence between members of the Diocese of Westminster's safeguarding commission described a victim of sexual abuse as ""manipulative"" and ""needy"". The report states: ""Real and lasting changes to attitudes have some way to go if the Roman Catholic Church is to shake off the failures of the past."" One of the ""repeated failures"" highlighted in the IICSA report was the case of Father James Robinson, a serial paedophile, who was moved to another parish within the Archdiocese of Birmingham after complaints were first made in the 1980s. He later fled to the US but was extradited back to the UK wherehe was convicted in 2010 of 21 sexual offences against four boys and jailed for 21 years. The report said ""appalling sexual abuse"" was inflicted on pupils atAmpleforth Collegein North Yorkshire and its adjoining junior school. Five people connected to the school have been convicted or cautioned in relation to ""offences involving sexual activity with a large number of children, or offences concerning pornography"", the report said. One of them was Father Piers Grant-Ferris who was moved to at least six other parishes after allegations of abuse came to light 1975. He was convicted of indecent assault against 15 boys in 2006. The inquiry also criticised the Vatican, describing its actions as in ""direct contrast with Pope Francis's public statement on child sexual abuse"". In 2019, the Pope called for ""concrete and effective actions that involve everyone in the Church"". The Holy See did not provide a statement to the inquiry and the ambassador at the time refused to give evidence. The report said: ""In responding in this way, the Holy See's stance was contrary to the spirit of its public statements and it missed the opportunity to demonstrate its engagement and leadership on the issue of child sexual abuse."" It added its response ""manifestly did not demonstrate a commitment to taking action"". One abuse survivor said it was bad enough to have been abused but ""to have it dismissed and covered up just takes even more of a toll on you"". Another survivor, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said ""thousands of pounds have been spent by the Diocese of Westminster in employing lawyers to keep me at arm's length"" as they continued to make their case. They added: ""The church needs a seismic shift in culture, especially at the top. If there is any hope at all of real change it will require a relinquishing of power, and a will to treat survivors as human beings."" Richard Scorer, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon who represents 32 survivors in IICSA, said: ""This is an absolutely damning report. ""It highlights the shocking scale of abuse, the disgraceful slowness of the church's response, the abject failures of leadership by Cardinal Nichols, and the Vatican's appalling refusal to cooperate properly with the inquiry. ""Cardinal Nichols needs to go right away - in any other walk of life he would be gone immediately."" Responding to the report, Cardinal Nichols told the BBC: ""The things in this report are in the public sphere, and I'm sure they've been taken into account, but the response I've got is very unambiguous. It is to stay, and stay I will."" He continued: ""I'm not here to defend myself... I am here to say we accept this report, we are grateful to IICSA for bringing the light and giving public space to those who have been abused, we are deeply sorry this happened... ""Today is more about me saying again, on behalf of everybody in the Catholic Church, how deeply, deeply regretful and sorry I am that anybody suffered, and that so many suffered is a terrible shame with which I must live and from which I must learn."" The report follows the publication of a similar inquiry intoabuse in the Church of England, which concluded the church had created a culture where abusers ""could hide"".

Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival.

""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring.""

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy. Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition. You can watch more from Biden here: This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Embarrassment' that Trump has not conceded election The hidden text could be seen after the colours of the image were manipulated The UK government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his victory which also had the name ""Trump"" in the background. The ""Trump"" wording is not immediately obvious in the image inJohnson's tweet,external. However, theGuido Fawkes website,externalfound that by manipulating the colours of the image, the word ""Trump"" could be seen in the background, in a smaller font, in the message to Biden. The message also had the word ""second term"" buried in it, the website added. Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" You can read our full storyhere. It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Clarke resigns as FA chairman,"Clarke became Football Association chairman in August 2016 Warning: This report contains offensive language. Football Association chairman Greg Clarke has resigned over the ""unacceptable"" language he used when referring to black players. Clarke said he was ""deeply saddened"" for the offence he had caused by using the term ""coloured footballers"". The comments came as he was talking about the racist abuse of players by trolls on social media to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee via video link. Clarke said,externalhis words were a ""disservice to our game"". He prompted further criticism when referring to gay players making a ""life choice"" and a coach telling him young female players did not like having the ball hit hard at them. He also said there were ""a lot more South Asians than there are Afro-Caribbeans"" in the FA's IT department because ""they have different career interests"". Black FA chairman would be 'huge step' in fight for equality, says England's Mings Newsbeat: why Greg Clarke's language was so offensive (warning - contains offensive language) ""We can confirm that Greg Clarke has stepped down from his role as our chairman,""said an FA statement.,external ""Peter McCormick will step into the role as interim FA chairman with immediate effect and the FA Board will begin the process of identifying and appointing a new chair in due course."" Following his resignation, Clarke said: ""My unacceptable words in front of Parliament were a disservice to our game and to those who watch, play, referee and administer it. This has crystallised my resolve to move on. ""I am deeply saddened that I have offended those diverse communities in football that I and others worked so hard to include."" During the parliamentary hearing, Clarke apologised after being prompted to say sorry by MP Kevin Brennan. Brennan said Clarke's language in reference to black players was the kind that did not encourage inclusion, while fellow committee member Alex Davies-Jones called it ""abhorrent"". Clarke had earlier spoken of the need to attract people into the sport from a diverse range of communities. The equality charity Kick It Out said his remark about black players should be ""consigned to the dustbin of history"" and criticised his comments concerning people from South Asia, gay players and female footballers. Clarke had been called to give evidence to the DCMS committee about the Premier League's potential bailout of English Football League clubs and the structural reforms proposed as part of Project Big Picture. ""As a person who loves football and has given decades of service to our game, it is right that I put the interests of football first,"" added Clarke in the statement confirming his departure. ""2020 has been a challenging year and I have been actively considering standing down for some time to make way for a new chair now our CEO transition is complete and excellent executive leadership under Mark Bullingham is established."" A statement from anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card,externalsaid Clarke's comments ""only serve to demonstrate the power of language and the damage of stereotyping groups of people"". Speaking before the resignation was announced,Sanjay Bhandari,executive chair at Kick It Out, said Clarke's comments to the DCMS were outdated. ""I was particularly concerned by the use of lazy racist stereotypes about South Asians and their supposed career preferences. It reflects similar lazy stereotypes I have heard have been spouted at club academy level,"" he said. ""Being gay is not a 'life choice' as he claimed too. The casual sexism of saying girls do not like balls hit at them hard is staggering from anyone, let alone the leader of our national game. It is completely unacceptable."" Sports MinisterNigel Huddlestonsaid: ""Greg Clarke's comments have caused deep offence and were completely unacceptable. I acknowledge his decades of service to football and his apology, but he was right to stand down as chairman of the FA."" David Bernstein,former FA chairman, told BBC Sport: ""I am just surprised that the chair of any organisation who's got a feel of what's going on in the year 2020 could use those types of words, that sort of language. It's just inappropriate."" Darren Bent,former England striker: ""Slip of the tongue was it? Awful, just awful."" Anton Ferdinand,former West Ham, Sunderland and QPR defender: ""Clearly education is needed at all levels."" Julian Knight,DCMS select committee chairman: ""It's right that Greg Clarke apologised before the committee. However, this isn't the first time that the FA has come to grief over these issues. It makes us question their commitment to diversity."" Alex Davies-Jones,DCMS committee member: ""The language used by Greg Clarke in our meeting this morning was absolutely abhorrent. It speaks volumes about the urgent progress that needs to made in terms of leadership on equalities issues in sport. I can't believe we'restillhere in 2020."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Three years ago - in front of thesame parliamentary committee,Greg Clarke was criticised for referring to institutional racism as ""fluff"". He apologised after being chastised by MPs and reminded that language matters. It appears the message did not get through. Two weeks after the FA launched a new diversity code with the aim of finally tackling racial inequality in the game, such efforts have once again been called into question, despite Clarke always insisting it was one of his priorities. Amid under-representation of BAME managers and board members, many critics will see Clarke's comments as evidence of the attitudes and language that has prevented the organisation from overseeing the progress hoped for in recent years, and it is no surprise that he has decided to step down. There have been other awkward moments. In 2018, LGBT supporters group Pride in Football said it was ""shocked"" after Clarke signed a memorandum of understanding with the FA of Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. In July, he had to backtrack after claiming representatives of the Premier League and EFL had blocked plans to increase racial diversity on the FA Board. Despite having barely been seen since the start of the year, Clarke was already under pressure over his role initiating secret talks over the Project Big Picture plans for a radical overhaul of the English game. Indeed earlier in the committee hearing, he was asked if his authority was ""shot"", something he strongly denied. But then came his comments on diversity. Amid an unprecedented financial crisis for the sport and damaging divisions with fans, leagues and government, the FA chairman has now had to go over yet another controversy. This is another grim day for the game, at the worst possible moment. 6 Degrees from Eddie Hearn:Can the boys track down the boxing promoter?

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy. Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition.

The ""Trump"" wording is not immediately obvious in the image inJohnson's tweet,external. However, theGuido Fawkes website,externalfound that by manipulating the colours of the image, the word ""Trump"" could be seen in the background, in a smaller font, in the message to Biden. The message also had the word ""second term"" buried in it, the website added. Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" You can read our full storyhere. It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Johnson congratulates Biden in phone callThe US president-elect rings the UK prime minister following his election victory last week.,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has congratulated Joe Biden on his US election win. Mr Biden called the PM ahead of the leaders of other major European countries. Mr Johnson said he looked forward to ""strengthening the partnership"" between the US and UK. He is also understood to have assured Mr Biden that Brexit would not undermine theGood Friday Agreementon peace in Northern Ireland. In a statement, Mr Biden's office,externalsaid he had ""reaffirmed"" his support for the Good Friday Agreement, which his Democratic predecessor in the White House, President Bill Clinton, played an instrumental role in bringing about. It said he had also expressed his desire to strengthen the historic ""special relationship"" between the two countries and ""redouble co-operation"" on issues of mutual concern, including health security and promoting democracy. The media declared Mr Biden the election winner on Saturday after he passed the threshold of 270electoral college votes. But counting is ongoing in some states, with incumbent President Donald Trump disputing many of the results. PM Biden tweet glitch blamed on technical error What a Biden presidency means for the UK World leaders who haven't congratulated Biden A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had ""warmly congratulated"" Mr Biden and ""conveyed his congratulations"" to Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris. ""They discussed the close and longstanding relationship between our countries and committed to building on this partnership in the years ahead, in areas such as trade and security - including through Nato,"" the No 10 spokesperson added. ""The prime minister and president-elect also looked forward to working closely together on their shared priorities, from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy, and building back better from the coronavirus pandemic."" There is always a clamour to get an early call with a US President-elect. It seems Boris Johnson has fared well - with his phone ringing before other European leaders. Downing Street will hope that's a sign that Joe Biden values the ""special relationship"" and wants to work closely with Mr Johnson. But it's important to note President-elect Biden has been talking tonight about the importance of the Good Friday Agreement in the context of Brexit. It was raised in the call with the UK prime minister, who insisted the peace treaty would be protected by his plans. The controversialInternal Market Bill- which Mr Biden has previously raised questions about - wasn't discussed by name. But the UK knows the sands in the White House are shifting. A Brexit enthusiast is being replaced by a sceptic. The 25-minute conversation came amid concerns that Mr Biden'spreviously stated dislike of Brexit- which Mr Trump, by contrast, supported - could strain relations. It's understood Mr Johnson and Mr Biden discussed the importance of implementing Brexit in a way that upholds the Good Friday Agreement. Mr Johnson assured the President-elect that would be the case. Mr Biden later spoke to Ireland's Taoiseach (PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin, in what Mr Martin's aides described as a ""warm conversation"". ""President-elect Biden recalled his strong Irish roots and his visit to Ireland with his family in 2016,"" the Irish government said in a statement. ""The President-elect reaffirmed his full support for the Good Friday Agreement and they discussed the importance of a Brexit outcome that respects the Good Friday Agreement and ensures no return of a border on the island of Ireland."" The president-elect later spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Macron promised to work with the US to tackle climate change and terrorism, while Mrs Merkel said she wanted a close working relationship with the Biden administration, their spokespeople said. Earlier on Tuesday, the UK government blamed a""technical error""for a tweet from Mr Johnson congratulating Mr Biden on his US election victory which faintly showed the name ""Trump"" in the background.

Rock mining with microbes may aid space explorersUK scientists show how astronauts on the Moon or Mars could one day mine for metals using bacteria.Science & Environment,"The bio-reactor was developed with Italian engineering firm Kayser Italia UK scientists have shown how astronauts on the Moon or Mars could one day mine for important metals using bacteria. In a first-of-its-kind experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), microbes digested rock to release rare-Earth elements (REEs). REEs are incorporated into electronics and alloys, in particular. The researchers tellthe journal Nature Communications,externalthat bio-mining could help make future space exploration become more sustainable. At the moment, everything required to survive on another world has to be carried from Earth - from the air an astronaut would breathe to any materials they might need for repairs. Transporting all that mass is energy-intensive and expensive, which is why there is now increasing focus on trying to find ways to use resources already in place. ""Wherever you are in space, whether you're building a settlement on asteroids, the Moon or Mars - you're going to need elements to build your civilisation,"" said Prof Charles Cockell from the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh. ""What our BioRock experiment has shown is that bio-mining is just one way in which we might go about extracting useful elements from rocks to support a long-term human presence beyond the Earth."" Water on the Moon could sustain a lunar base Project Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond Blast-off for Nasa mission to detect life on Mars The argument for using resources already in place is a compelling one Prof Cockell's team has developed small bio-reactors. These are essentially small boxes containing basalt rock and a community of microbes known to leach metals from minerals. The reactors were sent to the ISS and placed in a centrifuge where they were spun at different speeds to simulate gravity on the Earth and on Mars. A third box was allowed to experience the full, free-floating ""zero-G"" environment of the orbiting lab. The team wanted to find out if micro-organisms that ordinarily pull REEs out of rock here on the ground will also do the same in space. This wasn't obvious. Reduced gravity can stress microbes, making them behave in different ways. And for two species of bacteria in the BioRock experiment, their readiness to remove the metals was much reduced. But for an organism calledSphingomonas desiccabilis- it was unaffected, and happily pulled multiple REEs from the basalt, including neodymium, cerium and lanthanum. ""This is the first time in space that anyone has deliberately removed an economically interesting element from an extraterrestrial analogue material like basalt,"" said Prof Cockell. ""It's really the first mining experiment in space, if you like. We didn't actually create economically useful amounts of rare-Earth elements, but we demonstrated the principle,"" he told BBC News. About 20% of the world's copper and gold is currently extracted with the aid of microbial processes. The Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano runs the BioRock experiment on the ISS There's been much talk in recent years about mining planets and asteroids for raw materials that could then be brought back to Earth. Prof Cockell can't see the economic case for this just yet; it would still be cheaper to prospect for - and extract - ores here on Earth, he says. But the argument for utilisation of in-situ resources on other worlds is a compelling one, he believes. US space agency (Nasa) astronauts will attempt to use buried ice for drinking water when they return to the Moon later this decade. And as soon as next year, the American rover Perseverance will run an experiment that seeksto make oxygen from Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere,external- a potential game-changer for any human settlement on the Red Planet. Also, just this week, the European Space Agency (Esa) gave a contract to the UK company Metalysis to develop its process for pulling oxygen from Moon dust while at the same time yielding aluminium, iron and other metal powders. ""The oxygen that we can liberate could be used as a propellant or to sustain life, or a presence on the Moon. And the metal can be used to build different kinds of structures,"" Ian Mellor, managing director at Metalysis, told the BBC. As for the Edinburgh work -  ways are being sought to improve efficiency. BioRock on the ISS will soon be followed by BioAsteroid - a repeat of the reactor experiment but with crushed-up asteroid material rather than the blocks of Icelandic volcanic rock used in the first study. Prof Cockell said he also expected scientists at some point to look at how mining bacteria could be engineered to raise their productivity of useful products. BioRock received funding from Esa and the UK Space Agency. California's fire death toll doubles as chaos grips LA What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Executive 'letting businesses down by the hour',"The current coronavirus restrictions are due to end at midnight on Thursday Proposals from the health minister to extend coronavirus restrictions in NI for two more weeks have been blocked after an executive vote. Advice from Robin Swann's officials recommended keeping the measures in place until 27 November. The DUP opposed the move, and triggered a cross-community vote to effectively veto the proposals. The current restrictions are due to end at midnight on Thursday. The hospitality sector is waiting to find outwhether it can resume trading on Friday after a four-week shutdown. It comes after theDepartment of Health,externalannounced a further 11 coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland on Tuesday and 514 more positive cases. Ministers are currently considering alternative proposals from DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds. The talks began shortly after 18:00 GMT and still had not concluded after 23:00, as ministers wrangled over a plan. Mrs Dodds's paper suggests close-contact services such as hair and beauty salons can reopen on Friday, by appointment. It also proposes allowing unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops to reopen on Friday, but licensed restaurants would remain closed until 27 November. It is also understood that a ""safely open group"" could be established if ministers agree the plans, that would cover hospitality. BBC News NI understands that Mrs Dodds's paper also stresses the need for increased visibility of police and environmental health officers to manage enforcement. The minister has previously said she did not want the restrictions to be extended, as it could further damage the economy. It is understood she still holds this view, but recognises that the executive must agree a ""general consensus"". And so the wait for business owners and employees alike goes on, almost a week since health officials first recommended that the restrictions should be extended. There was a distinct sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu emerging tonight, as attempts for the executive to meet were pushed back repeatedly while the parties tried to work out a plan they could feasibly sign up to. DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster was facing much internal pressure not to bow to calls to extend the measures, despite the health advice. It's understood the DUP's use of the cross-community veto did not go down well with the Alliance minister Naomi Long, who is excluded from such votes as her party is neither unionist nor nationalist. Now that the DUP has managed to bring its own proposals to the executive, it may feel that provides its ministers with some political cover to stand over decisions which may end up being made tonight. However, nothing is over the line yet. Some businesses may feel the decisions are coming too late, with many unable to prepare for opening with two days' notice, even if they get the green light. Others will also wonder about the executive's messaging - easing some restrictions at a time when doctors have been calling for ""breathing space"", to keep the rate of infection as low as possible in the run-up to Christmas. A number of DUP backbench MLAs have previously vocally opposed the coronavirus regulations agreed by the power-sharing executive, which the DUP jointly leads with Sinn FÃ©in. Earlier, the executive was accused by DUP MLA Paul Frew of ""letting businesses down by the hour"" by delaying a decision on extending coronavirus restrictions. Hair and beauty salons had to shut for four weeks on 16 October Mr Frew, who has openly criticised his party's decision-making on the coronavirus regulations before, told the assembly on Tuesday that the delay in announcing a decision was ""unbelievable"". ""This is a tremendously harsh time for businesses and yet this executive is causing an act of vandalism to those businesses,"" he said during a debate on the Budget Bill. ""It is a shameful position to be in. ""It is an act of vandalism to not be able to tell a business on the Tuesday that they can open up for sure on the Friday, that they can fill up their fridge, bring in their stock and pay their supply line - it's no way to run a business and no way to run an executive. ""It's an absolute farce we are letting so many people down, who just want to earn a decent living and who provide so much."" Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said he believed the DUP had been ""too strident,"" by suggesting the restrictions would not remain in place longer than four weeks. ""Arlene (Foster) put herself on a hook by saying at an early stage that these restrictions would come to an end before progress was made,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. ""Good progress is being made, but from our point of view it would be reckless now to throw it all away."" He said there was a case to be made for reopening hair and beauty salons, but that restrictions on hospitality should remain in place for another fortnight, as health officials initially recommended. Hair and beauty salons closed on Friday 16 October - it is thought they could reopen with some mitigations Alison Canney, owner of the Spaghetti Junction restaurant in Londonderry, said they are undecided whether they would reopen at all if a limit or a ban is placed on alcohol sales. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, the Derry business owner said: ""It is doable but is it the same? I don't think so. ""People come out to relax and unwind. It's an experience. It's not like alcohol is essential, but people like a glass of wine with an Italian meal."" Hair and beauty salons have also been closed since 16 October. Beautician Carolyn McCauley said First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill needed to ""put on their big girl pants and make decisions"". ""At this stage, it's simply not good enough,"" she said. ""They've had four weeks to make these decisions and now here we are, at the 11th hour, and there's still no decision."" Michael Cafolla, who runs a large cafe in Newtownards, County Down, called on the executive to ""consult with people on the coal face of this industry, look at the evidence and make sure that the evidence backs up the decisions that are made"". Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said there had been ""no direction, leadership or consistent messaging"" for businesses. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party supports extending all of the restrictions for an extra fortnight, to reduce the possibility of further interventions before Christmas. ""We need to look beyond short-term decision making and ensure we achieve a safe Christmas by driving down Covid-19 now,"" he said. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said the executive ""absolutely does need"" to take a decision on Tuesday. ""It would be wrong if the clock was allowed to run down on this and we saw the restrictions almost disappearing by default,"" he said.

PM Biden tweet glitch blamed on technical errorBoris Johnson's congratulatory message included the word Trump faintly in background.,"The hidden text can be easily seen after the colours of the image are manipulated The government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his US election victory which faintly showed the name ""Trump"" in the background. Social media users commented on the discrepancy while theGuido Fawkes website,externalsaid the message also included the word ""second term"" buried in it. Officials said two messages were prepared before the result was known. The alternative one had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake, they said.

On Monday, the prime minister - who has never met Mr Biden - congratulated him on his victory in a phone conversationwhich the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said lasted about 20 minutes. Mr Johnson said he and the president-elect discussed their ""shared priorities"" and was looking forward to ""strengthening the partnership"" between the two countries. The UK PM is believed to be the first European leader Mr Biden has spoken to since the election. Mr Biden is preparing to assume office in January, although incumbent President Donald Trump is refusing to accept the outcome of the election and is mounting a series of legal challenges in certain states. The message the PM sent on Sunday read: ""Congratulations to Joe Biden on his election as president of the United States and to Kamala Harris on her historic achievement. ""The US is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security."" But the message appeared to include traces of a different one referring to Mr Trump, who has been in office since 2017. Guido Fawkes said the ""remnants"" of this could be seen by adjusting the contrast and brightness levels of the actual message that was posted. This video can not be played UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaking about Joe Biden's victory: ""There's far more that unites us than divides us"" A government spokesperson said: ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" UK ministers have said they are excited about working with Mr Biden on issues such as climate change and trade. In recent days, Mr Biden's team has sought to downplay lingering tensions over Mr Johnson's role in Brexit and past comments he has made about both President Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama. Mr Biden, who has made his opposition to Brexit well known, has insisted maintaining peace in Northern Ireland is paramount in any post-Brexit UK-US trade deal. The president-elect is continuing a ring-round of world leaders, having also spoken to Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. Before news of Mr Biden's conversation with Mr Johnson emerged, the Irish PM Michael Martin posted a Twitter message saying he had just finished a ""positive"" conversation with the president-elect. The message was quickly deleted, after which the Irish government revealed it had been sent in error and although a call had been arranged the two had yet to speak. A few hours later, Mr Martin posted another message saying he had had a ""warm and engaging"" call with Mr Biden.

Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy. Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition.

It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Student Covid tests for Christmas from 30 November,"Covid tests for students in England, so they can go home safely for Christmas, could begin on 30 November, according to a letter from the universities minister to vice chancellors. A week of mass testing for students is proposed - running between 30 November and 6 December. The letter, seen by the BBC, promises a fast turnaround for tests and ""results within an hour"". The aim is to stop students spreading the virus as they return home. The first week of December, after the lockdown ends, could then become the ""travel window"" for many students to leave university for the Christmas holidays, with face-to-face teaching expected to finish earlier than usual this term. This could mean that by about 9 December many students will have left for home. But those who test positive will have to take another test and, if found to be infectious, have to stay in isolation. Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, said: ""The government have finally listened to our calls to ensure that students can travel home safely for Christmas. ""We particularly welcome this mass-testing approach as it equips students with the knowledge to make informed decisions about travel ahead of the winter break,"" she said. But the University and College Union, which represents university lecturers, said it was not yet clear whether all universities would take part in the testing programme or how many students would be included. ""There are huge hurdles to overcome to manage this process,"" said union leader Jo Grady. Around 1.2 million students are expected to move at Christmas from their university term-time address to a home in another part of the country, where there might be different levels of infection. The pilot tests for getting students home at Christmas Face-to-face university teaching to stop two weeks before end of term Will it be 'go home and stay home' for students after Christmas This has raised concerns among the Sage scientific advisers of a ""significant risk"" that this migration could spread the coronavirus. To prevent this danger, plans are being made for mass testing using so-called ""lateral flow tests"". These nose and throat swabs are self-administered, with no need for tests to be sent to laboratories for results. Pilots for this type of rapid testing have already begunat De Montfort and Durham universities. Other universities have been operating their own testing processes, which could also continue. The tests will be able to provide results within an hour The letter from Universities Minister Michelle Donelan, and its accompanying documents, says: ""The tests we are deploying have a high specificity which means the risk of false positive test results is low. ""Although the test does not detect all positive cases, it works extremely well in finding cases with higher viral loads - which is those who are most infectious. ""As the test is easy to administer and does not require a laboratory, testing can take place on a very regular basis,"" the letter to university leaders said. Accompanying documents show a planning timetable in which sites are prepared for testing from 15 November, ready to operate the following week, with ""pre end-of-term testing"" between 30 November and 6 December. The test kits will be given free to universities, which will have to provide a place for the tests to be carried out, in a way that can process thousands of students within a short time frame. Ministers have already indicated that universities will stop in-person teaching two weeks before the end of term and move online - so when students have been given the all-clear they could be expected to leave their term-time address and go home, in a ""test and release"" process. There are also believed to have been discussions about how the departure of students can be made safe - such as co-ordinating staggered times for leaving between universities in the same city. There could also be calls to avoid public transport - with suggestions of chartering coaches or using private transport, such as parents collecting students, and creating ""travel corridors"" to control traffic away from universities. University leaders have previously raised concerns about why this guidance has been left so close to the end of term - and there will be questions about the capacity of universities to be ready in time for the mass testing. There have also been questions about whether students will return as usual in January or whether there will be a staggered start and more testing, or whether more courses will switch online with some students initially studying from home. Universities UK welcomed the plans for more testing capacity, but warned that universities would ""now need clear assurance of the effectiveness of the tests as well as further details from the government on specific responsibilities under the proposed scheme including the governance, indemnity, resourcing and costs recovery"".

Clarke resigns as FA chairmanGreg Clarke resigns as the chairman of the FA following his language in a reference to black players when talking to MPs about diversity.BBC Sport,"Clarke became Football Association chairman in August 2016 Warning: This report contains offensive language. Football Association chairman Greg Clarke has resigned over the ""unacceptable"" language he used when referring to black players. Clarke said he was ""deeply saddened"" for the offence he had caused by using the term ""coloured footballers"". The comments came as he was talking about the racist abuse of players by trolls on social media to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee via video link. Clarke said,externalhis words were a ""disservice to our game"". He prompted further criticism when referring to gay players making a ""life choice"" and a coach telling him young female players did not like having the ball hit hard at them. He also said there were ""a lot more South Asians than there are Afro-Caribbeans"" in the FA's IT department because ""they have different career interests"". Black FA chairman would be 'huge step' in fight for equality, says England's Mings Newsbeat: why Greg Clarke's language was so offensive (warning - contains offensive language) ""We can confirm that Greg Clarke has stepped down from his role as our chairman,""said an FA statement.,external ""Peter McCormick will step into the role as interim FA chairman with immediate effect and the FA Board will begin the process of identifying and appointing a new chair in due course."" Following his resignation, Clarke said: ""My unacceptable words in front of Parliament were a disservice to our game and to those who watch, play, referee and administer it. This has crystallised my resolve to move on. ""I am deeply saddened that I have offended those diverse communities in football that I and others worked so hard to include."" During the parliamentary hearing, Clarke apologised after being prompted to say sorry by MP Kevin Brennan. Brennan said Clarke's language in reference to black players was the kind that did not encourage inclusion, while fellow committee member Alex Davies-Jones called it ""abhorrent"". Clarke had earlier spoken of the need to attract people into the sport from a diverse range of communities. The equality charity Kick It Out said his remark about black players should be ""consigned to the dustbin of history"" and criticised his comments concerning people from South Asia, gay players and female footballers. Clarke had been called to give evidence to the DCMS committee about the Premier League's potential bailout of English Football League clubs and the structural reforms proposed as part of Project Big Picture. ""As a person who loves football and has given decades of service to our game, it is right that I put the interests of football first,"" added Clarke in the statement confirming his departure. ""2020 has been a challenging year and I have been actively considering standing down for some time to make way for a new chair now our CEO transition is complete and excellent executive leadership under Mark Bullingham is established."" A statement from anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card,externalsaid Clarke's comments ""only serve to demonstrate the power of language and the damage of stereotyping groups of people"". Speaking before the resignation was announced,Sanjay Bhandari,executive chair at Kick It Out, said Clarke's comments to the DCMS were outdated. ""I was particularly concerned by the use of lazy racist stereotypes about South Asians and their supposed career preferences. It reflects similar lazy stereotypes I have heard have been spouted at club academy level,"" he said. ""Being gay is not a 'life choice' as he claimed too. The casual sexism of saying girls do not like balls hit at them hard is staggering from anyone, let alone the leader of our national game. It is completely unacceptable."" Sports MinisterNigel Huddlestonsaid: ""Greg Clarke's comments have caused deep offence and were completely unacceptable. I acknowledge his decades of service to football and his apology, but he was right to stand down as chairman of the FA."" David Bernstein,former FA chairman, told BBC Sport: ""I am just surprised that the chair of any organisation who's got a feel of what's going on in the year 2020 could use those types of words, that sort of language. It's just inappropriate."" Darren Bent,former England striker: ""Slip of the tongue was it? Awful, just awful."" Anton Ferdinand,former West Ham, Sunderland and QPR defender: ""Clearly education is needed at all levels."" Julian Knight,DCMS select committee chairman: ""It's right that Greg Clarke apologised before the committee. However, this isn't the first time that the FA has come to grief over these issues. It makes us question their commitment to diversity."" Alex Davies-Jones,DCMS committee member: ""The language used by Greg Clarke in our meeting this morning was absolutely abhorrent. It speaks volumes about the urgent progress that needs to made in terms of leadership on equalities issues in sport. I can't believe we'restillhere in 2020."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Three years ago - in front of thesame parliamentary committee,Greg Clarke was criticised for referring to institutional racism as ""fluff"". He apologised after being chastised by MPs and reminded that language matters. It appears the message did not get through. Two weeks after the FA launched a new diversity code with the aim of finally tackling racial inequality in the game, such efforts have once again been called into question, despite Clarke always insisting it was one of his priorities. Amid under-representation of BAME managers and board members, many critics will see Clarke's comments as evidence of the attitudes and language that has prevented the organisation from overseeing the progress hoped for in recent years, and it is no surprise that he has decided to step down. There have been other awkward moments. In 2018, LGBT supporters group Pride in Football said it was ""shocked"" after Clarke signed a memorandum of understanding with the FA of Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. In July, he had to backtrack after claiming representatives of the Premier League and EFL had blocked plans to increase racial diversity on the FA Board. Despite having barely been seen since the start of the year, Clarke was already under pressure over his role initiating secret talks over the Project Big Picture plans for a radical overhaul of the English game. Indeed earlier in the committee hearing, he was asked if his authority was ""shot"", something he strongly denied. But then came his comments on diversity. Amid an unprecedented financial crisis for the sport and damaging divisions with fans, leagues and government, the FA chairman has now had to go over yet another controversy.

Cardinal 'protected Church reputation over victims'The head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales is criticised by the child sex abuse inquiry.UK,"The report said the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols had sometimes failed to demonstrate compassion The head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has, at times, shown he cares more about the impact of abuse on the Church's reputation than on the victims, a report says. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse criticised,externalthe leadership of Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, and the Vatican. The cardinal said the church was ""deeply sorry this happened"". A lawyer representing survivors said the cardinal ""must go right away"". Cardinal Nichols told the BBC he had offered to resign on Sunday upon turning 75, as is church law when bishops reach this age, but this was rejected by the Vatican. He said: ""I offered my resignation to Pope Francis. His answer has come back very clear, very unambiguous. He wants me to stay in post, so I will stay because that's where my orders come from, that's where my mandate comes from. ""He wants me to stay - I'm going to stay and continue to work wholeheartedly at these matters."" How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Catholic Church 'shocked to core' by child abuse The inquiry found that between 1970 and 2015 the Church received more than 3,000 complaints of child sexual abuse against more than 900 individuals connected to the Church. Those complaints involved more than 1,750 victims and complainants, though the report said the true scale of abuse was much higher and would likely never be known. It was ""far from a solely historical issue"", the inquiry found, adding that more than 100 allegations of abuse had been reported each year since 2016. The Catholic Church's ""explicit moral purpose has been betrayed by those who sexually abused children, and by those who turned a blind eye and failed to take action against perpetrators"". It said the cardinal, who apologised for the Church's actions when he gave evidence, ""did not always exercise the leadership expected of a senior member of the Church, at times preferring to protect the reputation of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales and in Rome"". It added that Cardinal Nichols had shown ""no acknowledgement of any personal responsibility to lead or influence change"". ""Nor did he demonstrate compassion towards victims in the recent cases which we examined."" The report said that two previous inquiries into abuse in the Church, by Lord Nolan in 2001 and Lady Cumberlege in 2007, had brought change and improvements, but their recommendations had been implemented too slowly and not in full. It highlighted that in 2016, internal correspondence between members of the Diocese of Westminster's safeguarding commission described a victim of sexual abuse as ""manipulative"" and ""needy"". The report states: ""Real and lasting changes to attitudes have some way to go if the Roman Catholic Church is to shake off the failures of the past."" One of the ""repeated failures"" highlighted in the IICSA report was the case of Father James Robinson, a serial paedophile, who was moved to another parish within the Archdiocese of Birmingham after complaints were first made in the 1980s. He later fled to the US but was extradited back to the UK wherehe was convicted in 2010 of 21 sexual offences against four boys and jailed for 21 years. The report said ""appalling sexual abuse"" was inflicted on pupils atAmpleforth Collegein North Yorkshire and its adjoining junior school. Five people connected to the school have been convicted or cautioned in relation to ""offences involving sexual activity with a large number of children, or offences concerning pornography"", the report said. One of them was Father Piers Grant-Ferris who was moved to at least six other parishes after allegations of abuse came to light 1975. He was convicted of indecent assault against 15 boys in 2006. The inquiry also criticised the Vatican, describing its actions as in ""direct contrast with Pope Francis's public statement on child sexual abuse"". In 2019, the Pope called for ""concrete and effective actions that involve everyone in the Church"". The Holy See did not provide a statement to the inquiry and the ambassador at the time refused to give evidence. The report said: ""In responding in this way, the Holy See's stance was contrary to the spirit of its public statements and it missed the opportunity to demonstrate its engagement and leadership on the issue of child sexual abuse."" It added its response ""manifestly did not demonstrate a commitment to taking action"". One abuse survivor said it was bad enough to have been abused but ""to have it dismissed and covered up just takes even more of a toll on you"". Another survivor, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said ""thousands of pounds have been spent by the Diocese of Westminster in employing lawyers to keep me at arm's length"" as they continued to make their case. They added: ""The church needs a seismic shift in culture, especially at the top. If there is any hope at all of real change it will require a relinquishing of power, and a will to treat survivors as human beings."" Richard Scorer, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon who represents 32 survivors in IICSA, said: ""This is an absolutely damning report. ""It highlights the shocking scale of abuse, the disgraceful slowness of the church's response, the abject failures of leadership by Cardinal Nichols, and the Vatican's appalling refusal to cooperate properly with the inquiry. ""Cardinal Nichols needs to go right away - in any other walk of life he would be gone immediately."" Responding to the report, Cardinal Nichols told the BBC: ""The things in this report are in the public sphere, and I'm sure they've been taken into account, but the response I've got is very unambiguous. It is to stay, and stay I will."" He continued: ""I'm not here to defend myself... I am here to say we accept this report, we are grateful to IICSA for bringing the light and giving public space to those who have been abused, we are deeply sorry this happened... ""Today is more about me saying again, on behalf of everybody in the Catholic Church, how deeply, deeply regretful and sorry I am that anybody suffered, and that so many suffered is a terrible shame with which I must live and from which I must learn."" The report follows the publication of a similar inquiry intoabuse in the Church of England, which concluded the church had created a culture where abusers ""could hide"".

LiveLiveRepublicans back Trump as he refuses to concede26 minutes ago,"President-elect Joe Biden says Donald Trump's refusal to concede the election ""will not help the president's legacy"" He also spoke in defence of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and said he had spoken to six world leaders President Donald Trump is refusing to admit losing the election, making unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud The US justice department has given federal prosecutors an unusual go-ahead to investigate alleged vote irregularities Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell says the president has every right to pursue legal challenges Democrat Joe Biden was projected as the election's winner, with an unassailable lead, on Saturday Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung This ends today's live coverage of the US 2020 election, and the latest from Trump's and Biden's teams as Biden works on his transition into the White House - only 10 weeks from now. Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition. You can watch more from Biden here: This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Embarrassment' that Trump has not conceded election The hidden text could be seen after the colours of the image were manipulated The UK government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his victory which also had the name ""Trump"" in the background. The ""Trump"" wording is not immediately obvious in the image inJohnson's tweet,external. However, theGuido Fawkes website,externalfound that by manipulating the colours of the image, the word ""Trump"" could be seen in the background, in a smaller font, in the message to Biden. The message also had the word ""second term"" buried in it, the website added. Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" You can read our full storyhere. It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Top Palestinian figure Saeb Erekat dies of CovidThe 65-year-old was in the public eye for decades as the Palestinians' chief negotiator with Israel.Middle East,"Saeb Erekat served as the Palestinians' chief negotiator in peace talks with Israel for the past two and a half decades One of the most prominent Palestinian political figures, Saeb Erekat, has died with Covid-19, officials say. The 65-year-old passed away in Jerusalem at Hadassah Medical Center, where he had been admitted last month after being diagnosed with the disease. Erekat led the Palestinians in on-off peace talks with Israel for many years. Describing Erekat as a ""brother"" and a ""fighter"", Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared three days of national mourning. Erekat was secretary general of the main Palestinian movement, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), and an adviser to Mr Abbas. He helped negotiate the landmark Oslo Accords in 1993, which created the Palestinian Authority and gave Palestinians limited self-governance in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the first time since Israel occupied the territories in 1967. Gazans struggle with pandemic and blockade Read more about the Palestinian territories President Abbas said the death of ""our dear brother and friend, the great fighter, Dr Saeb Erekat, represents a great loss for Palestine and our people"". Erekat announced on 8 October that he had tested positive for coronavirus but his condition deteriorated and he was transferred to the Israeli hospital from his home in Jericho in the West Bank 11 days later. Doctors said that treating him was a ""huge challenge"" because he had undergone a lung transplant three years ago and had a ""weakened immune system and bacterial infection, in addition to coronavirus"". Saeb Erekat believed in a two-state solution and condemned the recent normalisation of ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates Before his death he was put on a ventilator and placed in a medically induced coma. Erekat was a proponent of the so-called two-state solution - an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel - to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and recently condemned moves by Arab states to normalise relations with Israel without it. He calledthe UAE's decision in August to formalise ties with Israelas ""a killer to the two-state solution"" and said the US was ""part of the problem and becoming more irrelevant in the Middle East"" over its support for Israel under President Donald Trump. Israel opens tentative new chapter with Gulf Arabs Explainer: Israel, annexation and the West Bank Erekat also called for international sanctions on Israel over its occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, and for a boycott of Israeli companies operating in the occupied territories. His face was instantly recognisable. In the past three decades, when Palestinian and Israeli leaders met - in Madrid, Oslo, Washington, Camp David or Jerusalem - Saeb Erekat had a prominent place on negotiation teams. As a fluent English speaker, he often briefed international diplomats and journalists, summoning us to his office in Ramallah or his home in Jericho. Palestinians will feel his loss deeply at a time when relations with Israel are at a new low - and prospects for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, the goal of his life's work, look increasingly dim. However, on social media, some have also commented bitterly on the fact he died in an Israeli hospital. In recent months, Saeb Erekat was closely involved as the Palestinian leadership decided to halt its long-standing co-operation with Israel on security and civil matters in response to its plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. This meant the Palestinian Authority had stopped arranging transfers of ordinary Palestinian patients to East Jerusalem and paying for their treatment in Israel. Saeb Erekat was born in Jerusalem in 1955 but grew up in Jericho. In 1972, he moved to the US for university, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in international relations from San Francisco State University. He returned to the West Bank to teach at Al-Najah University in Nablus, before winning a scholarship to do a PhD in conflict resolution and peace studies at the University of Bradford in the UK. President Bill Clinton, left, speaking with Saeb Erekat, centre, and Yasser Arafat, right, at Camp David After graduating in 1983, he began writing articles for the Palestinian newspaper al-Quds that called for dialogue between Palestinians and Israeli academics. He also invited Israeli students to attend his lectures at al-Najah. Both moves caused considerable controversy at the time. Erekat began a new career as a peace negotiator in 1991, when he was asked by the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to be vice-chair of the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid Conference - an unprecedented summit between Israel and its Arab neighbours. Why Israel's peace deals with Gulf states matter What does Trumpâs Mid-East plan say on key issues? After helping to craft the historic Oslo peace accords of 1993 and 1995, Erekat became chief Palestinian negotiator. He attended the Camp David summit with Arafat in 2000, represented the Palestinians at the Taba Negotiations in 2001, and worked with Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas at the Annapolis Conference in 2007. All of the meetings ended without agreement on the ""final status"" issues that the Oslo accords had left aside for later negotiation, such as borders, Jerusalem and refugees. This video can not be played Behind the handshake that paved the way for a peace accord In addition to his role as a negotiator, Erekat also served as minister for local government in the Palestinian Authority and represented Jericho in the Palestinian Legislative Council. In 2009, he was elected to both the PLO Executive Committee - its top decision-making body - and the Central Committee of Mr Abbas' Fatah movement. Six years later he became the PLO's secretary general. Erekat had grappled with health problems for several years. He suffered a heart attack in 2012, and underwent a lung transplant at a hospital in the US state of Virginia in 2017. He was married, and had four children - twin daughters and two sons.

Amazon charged with abusing EU competition rules,"The European Commission has charged Amazon with abusing its dominant position in online retail to gain an unfair advantage over competitors. It said Amazon had used data on third-party sellers that use its marketplace to boost sales of its own-label goods. The Commission also launched a fresh probe into the possible preferential treatment of sellers that use the tech giant's logistics services. Amazon rejected the charges, saying no firm ""cared more"" for small businesses. It faces a potential fine as high as 10% of its global turnover if it is found guilty of breaching competition law - about Â£15bn ($19bn). In a statement, the EU's Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said it was vital that platforms with ""market power"" did not ""distort competition"". ""Data on the activity of third party sellers should not be used to the benefit of Amazon when it acts as a competitor to these sellers,"" she added. Amazon v EU: Has the online giant met its match? US tech giants accused of 'monopoly power' Amazon's Jeff Bezos: The richest person in the world ""With e-commerce booming, and Amazon being the leading e-commerce platform, a fair and undistorted access to consumers online is important for all sellers."" The European Commission has been investigating Amazon since July last year, following complaints from traders. It says the tech giant accesses sensitive data from small and medium-sized companies that use its platform, such as sales figures, page visits or shipping information. It then uses this to help with sales of its own-label products, or in choosing suppliers, the Commission says. In a press conference on Tuesday, Ms Vestager said: ""We do not take issue with the success of Amazon or its size."" Margrethe Vestager is the European Union's competition commissioner In a statement Amazon insisted that - far from being anti-competitive - its private-label products were good for customers and offered more choice. ""Amazon represents less than 1% of the global retail market, and there are larger retailers in every country in which we operate,"" it said. ""No company cares more about small businesses or has done more to support them over the past two decades than Amazon."" It also pointed out that there are more than 150,000 European businesses selling through its online marketplace. The charges come asthe coronavirus crisis has driven huge sales for the retailer, as people increasingly turn to online shopping. In August, boss Jeff Bezos became the richest man in the world with a fortune of more than $200bn after the firm's share price rocketed in the early months of the pandemic. She has led the way in tightening the regulatory screw on the US tech giants, taking on both Google and Apple. Now Europe's Competition supremo Margrethe Vestager has Amazon in her sights - and once again this case is about platform power. Her concern is that tech giants which own a platform - Apple's iOS operating system, Google's Android or Amazon's Marketplace - can have great power over the businesses that are completely dependent on it. In Amazon's case, her focus is also on its access to huge amounts of data about which products from the third-party sellers on its Marketplace are selling well. Commissioner Vestager says Amazon is ""a highly automated company, where business decisions are based on algorithmic tools"", and she believes those tools are used by the company to compete unfairly against its own business customers. This case won't be settled quickly - Amazon claims it makes more money from third-party sellers than from its own products. There will also be questions about whether there is any real harm to consumers. But don't expect this to be the only investigation into the might of Amazon - a Biden administration in the United States looks eager to follow Europe's lead in tackling the power of the platforms. Ms Vestager has taken a tough stance on US tech firms and what she sees as their grip on the digital landscape. Search engine Google, for example, has been fined more than â¬8bn in three separate cases, all relating to alleged abuses of power in the EU. Meanwhile, in the United States,a report backed by Democratic lawmakers recently urged changesthat could lead to the break-up of some of the country's biggest tech companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The report found that Amazon possessed ""significant and durable market power"" in online shopping, which it furthered in part by ""anticompetitive conduct in its treatment of third-party sellers"". In OctoberAmazon hit back in a blog post on its website,external: ""The fact that third parties having the opportunity to sell right alongside a retailer's products is the very competition that most benefits consumers and has made the marketplace model so successful for third-party sellers"".

Top Palestinian figure Saeb Erekat dies of Covid,"Saeb Erekat served as the Palestinians' chief negotiator in peace talks with Israel for the past two and a half decades One of the most prominent Palestinian political figures, Saeb Erekat, has died with Covid-19, officials say. The 65-year-old passed away in Jerusalem at Hadassah Medical Center, where he had been admitted last month after being diagnosed with the disease. Erekat led the Palestinians in on-off peace talks with Israel for many years. Describing Erekat as a ""brother"" and a ""fighter"", Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared three days of national mourning. Erekat was secretary general of the main Palestinian movement, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), and an adviser to Mr Abbas. He helped negotiate the landmark Oslo Accords in 1993, which created the Palestinian Authority and gave Palestinians limited self-governance in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the first time since Israel occupied the territories in 1967. Gazans struggle with pandemic and blockade Read more about the Palestinian territories President Abbas said the death of ""our dear brother and friend, the great fighter, Dr Saeb Erekat, represents a great loss for Palestine and our people"". Erekat announced on 8 October that he had tested positive for coronavirus but his condition deteriorated and he was transferred to the Israeli hospital from his home in Jericho in the West Bank 11 days later. Doctors said that treating him was a ""huge challenge"" because he had undergone a lung transplant three years ago and had a ""weakened immune system and bacterial infection, in addition to coronavirus"". Saeb Erekat believed in a two-state solution and condemned the recent normalisation of ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates Before his death he was put on a ventilator and placed in a medically induced coma. Erekat was a proponent of the so-called two-state solution - an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel - to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and recently condemned moves by Arab states to normalise relations with Israel without it. He calledthe UAE's decision in August to formalise ties with Israelas ""a killer to the two-state solution"" and said the US was ""part of the problem and becoming more irrelevant in the Middle East"" over its support for Israel under President Donald Trump. Israel opens tentative new chapter with Gulf Arabs Explainer: Israel, annexation and the West Bank Erekat also called for international sanctions on Israel over its occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, and for a boycott of Israeli companies operating in the occupied territories. His face was instantly recognisable. In the past three decades, when Palestinian and Israeli leaders met - in Madrid, Oslo, Washington, Camp David or Jerusalem - Saeb Erekat had a prominent place on negotiation teams. As a fluent English speaker, he often briefed international diplomats and journalists, summoning us to his office in Ramallah or his home in Jericho. Palestinians will feel his loss deeply at a time when relations with Israel are at a new low - and prospects for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, the goal of his life's work, look increasingly dim. However, on social media, some have also commented bitterly on the fact he died in an Israeli hospital. In recent months, Saeb Erekat was closely involved as the Palestinian leadership decided to halt its long-standing co-operation with Israel on security and civil matters in response to its plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. This meant the Palestinian Authority had stopped arranging transfers of ordinary Palestinian patients to East Jerusalem and paying for their treatment in Israel. Saeb Erekat was born in Jerusalem in 1955 but grew up in Jericho. In 1972, he moved to the US for university, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in international relations from San Francisco State University. He returned to the West Bank to teach at Al-Najah University in Nablus, before winning a scholarship to do a PhD in conflict resolution and peace studies at the University of Bradford in the UK. President Bill Clinton, left, speaking with Saeb Erekat, centre, and Yasser Arafat, right, at Camp David After graduating in 1983, he began writing articles for the Palestinian newspaper al-Quds that called for dialogue between Palestinians and Israeli academics. He also invited Israeli students to attend his lectures at al-Najah. Both moves caused considerable controversy at the time. Erekat began a new career as a peace negotiator in 1991, when he was asked by the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to be vice-chair of the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid Conference - an unprecedented summit between Israel and its Arab neighbours. Why Israel's peace deals with Gulf states matter What does Trumpâs Mid-East plan say on key issues? After helping to craft the historic Oslo peace accords of 1993 and 1995, Erekat became chief Palestinian negotiator. He attended the Camp David summit with Arafat in 2000, represented the Palestinians at the Taba Negotiations in 2001, and worked with Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas at the Annapolis Conference in 2007. All of the meetings ended without agreement on the ""final status"" issues that the Oslo accords had left aside for later negotiation, such as borders, Jerusalem and refugees. This video can not be played Behind the handshake that paved the way for a peace accord In addition to his role as a negotiator, Erekat also served as minister for local government in the Palestinian Authority and represented Jericho in the Palestinian Legislative Council. In 2009, he was elected to both the PLO Executive Committee - its top decision-making body - and the Central Committee of Mr Abbas' Fatah movement. Six years later he became the PLO's secretary general. Erekat had grappled with health problems for several years. He suffered a heart attack in 2012, and underwent a lung transplant at a hospital in the US state of Virginia in 2017. He was married, and had four children - twin daughters and two sons.

FA's Clarke sorry for remark about black players,"Clarke has been chairman of the Football Association for more than four years Warning: This report contains offensive language. Football Association chairman Greg Clarke has apologised for a reference to black players when talking to MPs about diversity. Clarke said it was inappropriate for him to have used the term ""coloured footballers"". He had been talking by video link to members of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. ""If I said it, I deeply apologise,"" said Clarke, 63, after being prompted to say sorry by MP Kevin Brennan. ""I am a product of having worked overseas, in the USA for many years, where I was required to use the term 'people of colour' because that was a product of their diversity legislature. Sometimes I trip over my words."" Brennan said it was the kind of language that did not encourage inclusion, while fellow committee member Alex Davies-Jones called it ""abhorrent"". The equality charity Kick It Out said his remark should be ""consigned to the dustbin of history"" and criticised further comments by Clarke concerning people from South Asia, gay players and female footballers. An FA spokesperson said afterwards that Clarke acknowledged his language was inappropriate. ""Greg Clarke is deeply apologetic for the language he used to reference members of the ethnic minority community during the select committee hearing today,"" said the spokesperson. BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat on why the term is so offensive Clarke had been talking about racist abuse of players by trolls on social media. ""People can see if you're black and if they don't like black people because they are filthy racists, they can abuse you anonymously online,"" he said. He had earlier spoken of the need to attract people into the sport from a range of communities. ""If you go to the IT department of the FA, there's a lot more South Asians than there are Afro-Caribbeans. They have different career interests,"" said Clarke. Clarke had actually been called to give evidence to the DCMS committee about the Premier League's potential bailout of English Football League clubs and the structural reforms proposed as part of 'Project Big Picture'. But he prompted further criticism when referring to gay players making a ""life choice"" and a coach telling him young female players did not like having the ball hit hard at them. Sanjay Bhandari,executive chair at Kick It Out, said Clarke's comments were outdated. ""I was particularly concerned by the use of lazy racist stereotypes about South Asians and their supposed career preferences. It reflects similar lazy stereotypes I have heard have been spouted at club academy level,"" he said. ""Being gay is not a 'life choice' as he claimed too. The casual sexism of saying 'girls' do not like balls hit at them hard, is staggering from anyone, let alone the leader of our national game. It is completely unacceptable."" David Bernstein,former FA chairman, told BBC Sport: ""I am just surprised that the chair of any organisation who's got a feel of what's going on in the year 2020 could use those types of words, that sort of language. It's just inappropriate."" Darren Bent,former England striker: ""Slip of the tongue was it? Awful, just awful."" Anton Ferdinand,former West Ham, Sunderland and QPR defender: ""Clearly education is needed at all levels."" Julian Knight,DCMS select committee chairman: ""It's right that Greg Clarke apologised before the committee. However, this isn't the first time that the FA has come to grief over these issues. It makes us question their commitment to diversity."" Alex Davies-Jones,committee member: ""The language used by Greg Clarke in our meeting this morning was absolutely abhorrent. It speaks volumes about the urgent progress that needs to made in terms of leadership on equalities issues in sport. I can't believe we'restillhere in 2020."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Three years ago - in front of thesame parliamentary committee,Greg Clarke was criticised for referring to institutional racism as ""fluff"". He apologised after being chastised by MPs and reminded that language matters. It appears the message did not get through. Two weeks after the Football Association launched a new diversity code with the aim of finally tackling racial inequality in the game, the governing body's commitment to diversity has once again been called into question. Amid BAME under-representation at board and management level within the FA, many critics will see Clarke's comments as evidence of the attitudes and language that has prevented the organisation from overseeing the progress hoped for in recent years, and he could now face calls to step down. Despite having barely been seen since the start of the year, Clarke was already under pressure over his role initiating secret talks over the Project Big Picture plans for a radical overhaul of the English game. Indeed earlier in the committee hearing, he was asked if his authority was ""shot"", something he strongly denied. But then came his comments on diversity and use of language that Kick it Out said should ""remain consigned to the dustbin of history"". Amid an unprecedented financial crisis for the sport and damaging divisions with fans, leagues and government, the FA chairman is now embroiled in another controversy. This is another grim day for his leadership, and for the game, at the worst possible moment.""

PM Biden tweet glitch blamed on technical error,"The hidden text can be easily seen after the colours of the image are manipulated The government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his US election victory which faintly showed the name ""Trump"" in the background. Social media users commented on the discrepancy while theGuido Fawkes website,externalsaid the message also included the word ""second term"" buried in it. Officials said two messages were prepared before the result was known. The alternative one had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake, they said. Mr Johnson posted the message on Twitter on Saturday,externalafter broadcasters in the US and elsewhere declared the Democratic former vice-president the winner. Allow Twitter content?

On Monday, the prime minister - who has never met Mr Biden - congratulated him on his victory in a phone conversationwhich the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said lasted about 20 minutes. Mr Johnson said he and the president-elect discussed their ""shared priorities"" and was looking forward to ""strengthening the partnership"" between the two countries. The UK PM is believed to be the first European leader Mr Biden has spoken to since the election. Mr Biden is preparing to assume office in January, although incumbent President Donald Trump is refusing to accept the outcome of the election and is mounting a series of legal challenges in certain states. The message the PM sent on Sunday read: ""Congratulations to Joe Biden on his election as president of the United States and to Kamala Harris on her historic achievement. ""The US is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security."" But the message appeared to include traces of a different one referring to Mr Trump, who has been in office since 2017. Guido Fawkes said the ""remnants"" of this could be seen by adjusting the contrast and brightness levels of the actual message that was posted. This video can not be played UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaking about Joe Biden's victory: ""There's far more that unites us than divides us"" A government spokesperson said: ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" UK ministers have said they are excited about working with Mr Biden on issues such as climate change and trade. In recent days, Mr Biden's team has sought to downplay lingering tensions over Mr Johnson's role in Brexit and past comments he has made about both President Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama. Mr Biden, who has made his opposition to Brexit well known, has insisted maintaining peace in Northern Ireland is paramount in any post-Brexit UK-US trade deal. The president-elect is continuing a ring-round of world leaders, having also spoken to Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. Before news of Mr Biden's conversation with Mr Johnson emerged, the Irish PM Michael Martin posted a Twitter message saying he had just finished a ""positive"" conversation with the president-elect. The message was quickly deleted, after which the Irish government revealed it had been sent in error and although a call had been arranged the two had yet to speak. A few hours later, Mr Martin posted another message saying he had had a ""warm and engaging"" call with Mr Biden.

UK unemployment rate continues to surge,"The UK's unemployment rate rose to 4.8% in the three months to September, up from 4.5%, as coronavirus continued to hit the jobs market. Redundancies rose to a record high of 314,000 in the same period, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Firms made more workers redundant in anticipation of the end of the furlough scheme, which was originally supposed to finish at the end of October. It has now been extended until the end of March. Analysts said the extension had come ""too late in the day"" to save some jobs and further big rises in unemployment were likely in the coming months. The number of people out of work rose by 243,000 in the three-month period, the largest increase since May 2009. The redundancy figure was higher, however, because it included people who may have lost their jobs and then retired or decided to stop looking for work. The ONS figures also showed there was a big rise in the number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work. The unemployment rate among young people is far higher than the overall rate. How many people could become unemployed? Local lockdowns 'stifling jobs recovery' Self-employed people 'are being left in the dark' ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow told the BBC: ""We're seeing a continuation of a weakening of the labour market, fewer people on the payrolls and fewer people employed overall. That is now passing through to increasing unemployment altogether."" He said the UK was starting to see people fall out of work in quite large numbers. However, there were still about 2.5 million people on furlough, with ""quite a lot of uncertainty"" about what would happen to them. ""We might see furlough creep up again and that might mean we don't see any further big increases in redundancies or unemployment, but it's way too early to tell what will happen,"" he added. Mr Athow said vacancies continued to recover from the very low numbers seen earlier in the year, but those figures predated the reintroduction of lockdown restrictions in many parts of the UK. Justin Miller was made redundant as a lifeguard in July. He is a graduate who has applied for more than 100 jobs, but has not once been invited to an interview. ""I've been looking for opportunities, but I just haven't had any luck with anything I've been doing,"" he told the BBC. ""There's a lot of jobs out there locally with local shops, but I've been competing against other people that could have been made redundant with 10, 20 years' experience, so I've got no chance of getting those jobs. ""Most of the time I'm not even hearing anything back. It's just been really difficult,"" he says. ""It definitely plays on your mental health. There's a lot of thoughts that go on in your head because you've had so much rejection. ""It's a question of keeping myself motivated and not letting it get me down too much."" If you keep getting rejection emails, ask them why, says Claire Valoti, a boss at social media company Snap. ""Not everyone is going to give you feedback, but some will. The important thing is to figure out what's not working and how you can better sell yourself."" ""Be bold,"" she says. Ask a recruiter or someone in your industry, since job applications and interviews are things at which you can improve, she recommends. How to get a job: Top bosses share their secrets Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said the pandemic continued to bring ""turbulence"" to the UK jobs market. ""The extension of the furlough scheme through to March is welcome as it has given directors certainty to plan ahead for their staff. Unfortunately, the change appears to have come too late in the day for some."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""While there was a rise in the number of job vacancies, this is more likely to reflect a temporary bounce as the economy reopened before recent restrictions were reintroduced, rather than a meaningful upturn in demand for labour. He said the extension to the furlough scheme would safeguard a significant number of jobs in the short term. ""However, with firms facing another wave of severely diminished cashflow and revenue and with gaps in government support persisting, further substantial rises in unemployment remain likely in the coming months."" Given the scale of the economic shock we've been through, the impact of the pandemic on the official unemployment rate remains mild. A level of 4.8%, encompassing 1.62 million people, is low by historic standards. And current predictions that unemployment will peak at 7-8% also look modest, given the fact that we're now in an economic double-dip of unprecedented proportions. That won't be any consolation to the record 314,000 people made redundant from July to September. Fully informed by scientists about the risks of a second wave, Chancellor Rishi Sunak spent four months telling the nation he was against extending the furlough scheme beyond October (""I cannot save every business. I cannot save every job""). Indeed, the chancellor said in his winter economy plan in September it was ""fundamentally wrong"" to hold people in jobs that only exist inside the furlough and only changed his mind with hours to go. There can be no doubt that a large chunk of those people made redundant would still be in work, had their employers known the government would throw its policy into reverse at the last minute. But with 2.5 million workers still reliant on furlough (according to the ONS), there are many more who can be glad the government executed that U-turn. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures underlined ""the scale of the challenge"" that the country was facing. ""I know that this is a tough time for those who have sadly already lost their jobs, and I want to reassure anyone that is worried about the coming winter months that we will continue to support those affected and protect the lives and livelihoods of people across this country,"" he added. The government had extended the furlough scheme to protect jobs and launched the Â£2bn Kickstart programme to help young people, he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said people had lost their livelihoods because of the government's ""failure to face up to the scale of this jobs crisis in time"". ""We've had enough last-minute changes and bluster from this government,"" he added. The chancellor needs to urgently provide support to those who have lost their jobs and get Britain back to work - including through a green recovery to help create hundreds of thousands of low-carbon jobs.""

Top US lawyer quits over 'vote fraud' memo,"This video can not be played Mitch McConnell: 'Trump 100% within rights to look into election irregularities' US attorney general William Barr has allowed federal prosecutors to probe alleged irregularities in the presidential election, prompting a top justice department official to quit. The official, Richard Pilger, would have overseen such investigations. Any such cases would normally be the remit of individual states, but Mr Barr said this was not a hard and fast rule. Donald Trump refuses to accept Joe Biden's projected victory, and has made unsubstantiated fraud claims. The president's campaign is seeking an emergency injunction in Pennsylvania to prevent Mr Biden's victory being certified in the state. The president-elect's projected win there on Saturday took him over the threshold of 270 electoral college votes needed to secure victory nationwide. What happens now? Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is US first lady-designate Jill Biden? The attorney general wrote that inquiries could be made by federal prosecutors,external""if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State"". Mr Barr warned against investigating ""fanciful"" claims Mr Barr said prosecutors should only look into ""substantial allegations"" of irregularities. He acknowledged that individual states had the primary responsibility for the conduct of elections but said the justice department had ""an obligation to ensure that federal elections are conducted in such a way that the American people can have full confidence in their electoral process and their government"". The department would normally only go beyond preliminary investigations after an election had been concluded and the results certified, but Mr Barr said this could result in situations where ""misconduct cannot realistically be rectified"". Mr Pilger said he had quit in response to Mr Barr's memo. ""Having familiarised myself with the new policy and its ramifications... I must regretfully resign from my role,"" he wrote in an email to colleagues. Mr Pilger became head of the department's Election Crimes Branch in 2010. This branch, and Mr Pilger himself, were previously in the public eye at the time of a row about extra scrutiny of political groups seeking tax exemption. He was reported to have had discussions about the issue with Lois Lerner,the tax official at the centre of the row. Bill Barr's memorandum authorising federal election fraud investigations is yet another example of the attorney general's skill at pleasing his boss, the president, while dancing on the edge of propriety within the justice department he runs. The document gives Donald Trump what he wants - proof that the government is looking into unproven claims of widespread electoral illegalities in several states he lost by tens of thousands of votes. The attorney general, however, couches the memo with conditions and cautions that prosecutors only focus on specific ""irregularities"" and avoid pursuing ""specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims"". Despite all the caveats, Mr Barr's memo will provide fodder to Trump and his supporters, who insist that the election was stolen from them (never mind that other Republican candidates had fairly successful results). As the protest resignation of the head of the justice department's election crimes department indicates, this is the equivalent of pulling the pin from a political hand grenade. It may not go off immediately, but the device is one step closer to exploding - thrown on purpose or accidentally dropped. There are safeguards in place to prevent political meddling in criminal investigations, particularly around elections. Some of those safeguards have now been removed. Since media projected on Saturday that Mr Biden had won the critical state of Pennsylvania, accumulating enough votes to claim the White House, the president-elect has forged ahead with his plans to take the reins of power. Biden tells Americans: I implore you, wear a mask Election results in maps and charts Mr Trump took to Twitter again on Monday to dispute the outcome, making unsubstantiated claims of ""unthinkable and illegal"" activity in the vote. The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages federal agencies, has held off on allowing Biden aides to formally begin the transition, saying no ""ascertainment"" on an election winner had yet been made. The GSA is tasked with formally recognising the president-elect, and providing the funds and access to federal agencies that Mr Biden's transition team needs. In previous elections it has mostly acted promptly after the winner was declared, with the exception of the disputed election in 2000 when it waited until a Supreme Court ruling decided the result on 14 December. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, says the Biden team is considering its legal options if the Trump administration continues to stall the handover. White House reporters have been saying that despite his objections, Mr Trump is expected to leave office begrudgingly in January and is already talking about running for the White House again in 2024. Mr Trump's spokeswoman vowed the legal battle to contest Mr Biden's victory was only just beginning. ""This election is not over,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a news conference on Monday. ""Far from it."" Ms McEnany and Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel cited allegations of electoral corruption, while urging reporters to help investigate the unverified claims. Conservative channel Fox News cut away from the event, citing the lack of evidence. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" ""Whoa, whoa, whoa,"" said presenter Neil Cavuto. ""Unless she [Ms McEnany] has more details to back that up, I can't in good countenance continue to show you this."" Ms McEnany told reporters: ""We have only begun the process of obtaining an accurate, honest vote count."" Five viral vote claims fact-checked Donald Trump's speech fact-checked Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud? She said Republican poll watchers had not been granted adequate access to vote counts in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, both Republican and Democratic election monitors were kept from 13ft to 100ft (4m to 30m) away from tables where votes were being tallied in the city, and local election officials cited coronavirus prevention needs for the distancing. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for unity in victory speeches Ms McEnany also said election officials in that key state had allowed a disproportionate number of Democrats to correct, or ""cure"", inaccurately filled-out ballots. According to the Inquirer, some Pennsylvania counties allowed voters to amend such mistakes, while others did not. Ms McDaniel said they had collected 131 affidavits, or signed legal statements under oath, in Michigan as part of their investigation into alleged election irregularities. ""If the shoe were on the other foot,"" she said, ""if it were this close the other way, if President Trump was in the lead in all these states... the media would be screaming, 'This isn't over'."" Results in last Tuesday's presidential election from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding. In Georgia, where the tally is continuing and Mr Biden leads, its secretary of state hit back on Monday at fellow Republicans who had criticised his handling of the election. The women changing the face of US politics The woman behind biggest surprise in Biden win Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said: ""Was there illegal voting? I am sure there was. And my office is investigating all of it. ""Does it rise to the numbers or margin necessary to change the outcome to where President Trump is, given Georgia's electoral votes? That is unlikely."" Separately, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit on Monday in a Pennsylvania federal court, seeking an emergency injunction to stop state officials from certifying Mr Biden's victory in the state. The state's attorney general, Josh Shapiro, called the lawsuit ""meritless"". Prosecutors in Republican-controlled states meanwhile threw their weight behind the president's challenge to the election results. Ten state attorneys general filed a so-called amicus brief at the US Supreme Court backing the Trump campaign's case in Pennsylvania. States must resolve recounts and court contests over the results by 8 December. The outcome will be finalised when members of the US Electoral College meet on 14 December. Senior members of the president's party have largely refused to pressure Mr Trump to concede. On Monday Senate leader Mitch McConnell criticised Democrats over the matter. ""Let's not have any lectures, no lectures,"" the Kentucky senator said on the floor of the upper chamber, ""about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election and who insinuated that this one would be illegitimate too if they lost again - only if they lost."" He added: ""The president has every right to look into allegations and to request recounts under the law and notably the constitution gives no role in this process to wealthy media corporations."" 8 December:All recounts and certification of results to be completed by states 14 December:Electoral college members meet in state capitals to formally cast their ballots for president and vice president 6 January:Joint session of House of Representatives and Senate to count electoral votes 20 January: New president sworn in Watch the moment BBC projects Biden victory What happens now?

People 'turn to custard and gravy' in the pandemic,"The company behind foods such as gravy brand Bisto, custard-maker Ambrosia and Mr Kipling's cakes says people turned to comfort foods during the pandemic. Premier Foods credited ""exceptional"" demand throughout lockdown for strong sales and profit figures for the past six months. It said it had gained over a million new customers during the period. Premier said it was benefitting from the latest lockdown in England, which meant more people were eating at home. Profits for the six months to September were up 50% at Â£47.7m. Premier said that consumers had ""turned to brands they recognise and trust"". It also said people had been trying to expand their repertoire of meals cooked in their own kitchens, particularly as new restrictions on eating out had been introduced, which had helped sales of its cooking ingredients. The food critic and broadcaster, Jay Rayner, said the news was no surprise: ""All of us are having to cook many more meals in lockdown - prior to that 30% of our calories were eaten outside the house. ""Many of those doing the cooking were kids 20 or so years before so they are turning to these familiar foods."" Premier Foods' Cadbury's mini rolls were another stand out performer, as it put it, selling in ""very robust volumes"". Chief executive Alex Whitehouse said: ""The longevity of this increased demand is likely to be linked to the duration of these new measures."" The company said it expected to continue to see its income grow and forecast that its full-year profits would beat analysts' predictions. Premier Foods update came as market research firm Kantar Worldpanel produced its latest update of supermarket sales. It said these grew by 9.4% across the UK in the four weeks to 1 November. It said that while sales were higher than the same period a year ago, unlike in March, there had been no noticeable spike in the stockpiling of goods this time round.

GCSE and A-level exams in Wales cancelled for 2021,"This video can not be played Some pupils are happy with the news but others less so Wales' GCSE, AS and A-level exams in summer 2021 are to be cancelled, with grades based on classroom assessments. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams due to the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic. Head teachers would work on a ""national approach"" to ensure consistency, she said. Assessments will be done under teacher supervision, and will begin in the second half of the spring term. They will be externally set and marked but delivered within the classroom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She added cancelling exams would also give time for teaching to continue through the summer term. Teachers would have flexibility on when to take the assessments, within the ""context of results timelines"". However one teaching union questioned whether the announcement would mean ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Confirming the decision, Ms Williams said: ""The well-being of learners and ensuring fairness across the system is central in our decision making process. ""We remain optimistic that the public health situation will improve, but the primary reason for my decision is down to fairness; the time learners will spend in schools and colleges will vary hugely and, in this situation, it is impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams to take place. ""We have consulted with universities across the UK and they have confirmed that they are used to accepting many different types of qualifications."" Ms Williams said it remained a ""highly challenging year"" but the announcement would remove pressures from learners and provide ""clear time for teaching and learning"". Cerys Harris has had to study at home while self-isolating for a total of four weeks since September A-level student Cerys Harris, 17, from Rhyl, has already had four weeks of self-isolation this term because of cases in her ""bubble"". She wants to start a degree next September in England. Although the education minister said universities are familiar with different qualifications, Cerys said she did not feel reassured, and was looking forward to more detail as to how the system is going to work. ""I've taken from [the announcement] that exams are cancelled, but it's not very straightforward,"" she said. Fellow Rhyl A-level student Jonathon Dawes, who studies at Coleg Cambria and is also a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament, said he welcomed the decision, but was looking forward to getting more detail. ""I'm looking forward to more guidance coming out to make sure it's as fair and transparent as possible, to make sure pupils get the grades they deserve and it's not different from school to school."" Jess Foster says she has had ""stress"" taken away by the announcement Jess Foster, 17, who is taking her A-levels at Bassaleg School in Newport, was ""immediately relieved"". ""I stress out about things personally a lot. To hear that taken off me instantly just felt really good,"" she said. Head teacher Victoria Lambe said the decision ""places trust"" in her profession Her head teacher, Victoria Lambe, welcomed the announcement, describing the move as ""brave"" and the ""fairest"" decision for young people. ""It very much places trust is the teaching profession. I think it will enable us to continue to put robust measures in place for monitoring pupils' progress,"" she said. ""It's been an incredibly stressful period for all members of the school community and this will enable us to really reduce stress levels."" In England, exams are still going ahead but some have beenmoved back by three weeksto allow for more teaching time, and with reduced content in some subjects. In Scotland, the GCSE-equivalentNational 5 exams are cancelled and replaced by teacher assessmentsand coursework, but Higher and Advanced Higher exams will just be delayed by two weeks. Exams in Northern Ireland are still going aheadbut the number of papers in some subjects has been reduced. Downing Street said there was no change to the plan to hold exams in England following Ms Williams's announcement. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We continue to think that exams are the fairest way of judging the students' performance."" The future generations commissioner said GCSEs should be permanently replaced Exam regulator Qualifications Wales, which advised the minister on her decision, said: ""We recognise this has been a difficult decision and there are no easy answers. We are considering the decision and what it could mean in practice. ""In the meantime, we will provide advice to the Independent Design and Delivery Advisory Group."" Wales secretary of the National Education Union David Evans said: ""We must ensure that young people have a consistent assessment process in place which means their abilities are recognised for their next steps. ""But this must not mean extra work for everyone involved - both staff and students alike. The education system is already struggling."" 'I don't want exams to go ahead next year' 'Scrap exams for 2021 after Covid disruption' Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 Children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said Ms Williams had made the right decision. She said: ""This should be a year of learning, not worry. Young people should now rest assured that the decision will enable them to work towards their qualifications."" Her words were echoed by Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, who said it would maximise ""fairness"" for students. ""This is the right decision for our young people,"" she added. ""It recognises the fact that they will have been affected to differing extents by the impact of the pandemic and it allows for as much teaching time as possible to catch-up with lost learning."" But the head of the school leaders' union NAHT raised concerns of ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Ruth Davies said: ""It has been announced that pupils will still be given externally set and marked tests, just in the classroom. ""We can't see how that isn't an exam. There is an awful lot of detail still to be determined, and we await further clarification, but we are worried we will end up with exams in all but name."" Future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said GCSEs should be permanently replaced with assessments which were centred around pupils ""not testing"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian MS said with so much variation in how much education a pupil had received, a ""one size fits all"" approach would not have been fair. The Conservative spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""The critical issue for me is that assessments are externally set and externally marked. This will give them some comparability with previous years' exams and protect teachers against any accusations of unintended bias."" Reform MS Mandy Jones asked the government to review the announcement to allow students to sit exams if they wished. The 2020 exams were cancelled following the start of the first lockdown and results were eventually based on teacher-predicted grades. Ms Williams said her decision for the 2021 exams came after she considered detailed advice from Qualifications Wales on available options as well as interim findings of a review of the 2020 exam process. She also spoke to students, school and college leaders, universities and the children's commissioner. She said: ""In line with the recommendations of both Qualifications Wales and the Independent Review, there will be no exams for GCSE or AS level learners next year. ""A-level students will also not be required to sit exams.""

How lockdown created domestic abuse 'perfect storm',"This video can not be played Alannah left her abusive relationship in London in 2013 ""Stay at home"" was at the core of public health advice in tackling Covid-19, the world over. But home is not a place of safety for all. Domestic violence and abuse is at a 15-year high in Northern Ireland, with more than 32,000 incidents reported to the PSNI from June 2019 to July 2020. Restrictions to reduce the spread of Covid-19 have forced people to spend much more time at home and created the ""perfect storm"" for abusers. BBC NI Spotlight went behind the scenes at Foyle Women's Aid to find out what it's like for some of those offering help to women and families in danger. At the time we started filming, the tree-lined avenue to one of their refuges was paved with a blaze of autumnal yellow and red leaves. The magnificent scene appeared in sharp contrast to the trauma that makes it necessary for women and children to take sanctuary in the refuge carefully protected by security gates. ""Nobody wants to be in a refuge and we would rather we weren't here but if somebody comes here, they are very well taken care of,"" says Marie Brown, chief executive of Foyle Women's Aid. Calls to the organisationincreased by 25% during the lockdown in the Spring, reflecting a trend across the UK, and Marie Brown believes that the current further restrictions will bring another surge. ""I do believe that we'll have a spike even in women contacting us. We're heading into Christmas. Christmas is not a good time for domestic violence."" The National Domestic Abuse Helpline can be contacted online as well as by phone The pandemic heralded huge changes in how everyone works in the centre. Roisin Hamill, the manager of the onsite creche, finds one of the new regulations particularly difficult when dealing with families as part of their outreach programme. ""When you're out delivering packs to families, you know they've been isolated at home for so long and that look on their face seeing somebody for the first time and you can't go and give them a hug - that's really difficult for us. ""We do explain to children and we explain to mummies that this will be a socially-distanced visit, it isn't our 'normal' and we can't wait to see you back again and we can't wait to give you that big hug."" The centre is more than a refuge. Those dealing with the aftermath of an abusive relationship can also avail of support courses run by the organisation. Alannah suffered abuse in a former relationship in London, which she broke free from in 2013. She undertook a group course on the recommendation of a counsellor. ""There's a stereotype around what it means to be a victim of abuse,"" she tells Spotlight. ""Growing up, I would always have said: 'Sure I wouldn't stay with somebody, sure if they lifted their hand to you, why would you stay? What kind of woman would stay? It's stupid.' And it was only after my own experience that I realised it's not about why women stay. ""Quite often they are staying because they believe they can fix that broken person because people who perpetrate abuse, they're very clever, they're very manipulative."" Alannah says that it took her time to realise that she needed to break free from the man who was doing harm to her. ""The first few times that there was physical violence, I was very concerned - obviously - for my own well-being but these people are manipulative, I was more concerned for his well-being. And that's just crazy to think that, but you do. You end up feeling sorry for that person. ""Only when I genuinely thought that I could die, and I imagined my family, and the impact that would have on them, that for me was the last straw and that was the moment that I realised I had to leave and that I couldn't fix that person."" Back in one of Foyle Women's Aid offices, Margaret Patterson, a referral co-ordinator, is rarely off the phone. ""Some people want to tell you their whole story, some people don't want to tell you their story. And some people need encouragement just to get the basic information. We've had people who phoned who wouldn't even tell us their names. They just want someone to talk to."" Margaret takes the initial calls from women and then a support worker is assigned to them. But Covid-19 restrictions have also made it more difficult for support workers, like Marie Crossan, to meet service-users and, in particular, to check in with those who may still be living in the same home as their abusers. ""You know your clients, you know if there's clients still in that relationship and you know that it's going to be particularly difficult to get speaking to them. ""You have to rely on them getting out for five minutes and giving you a call. ""Maybe their partner is off work so things are quite intense because the kids are at home. Women are trying to protect the kids and trying to keep things calm at home."" Alannah says she, along with many others, is testament to the fact that there is life after an abusive relationship. ""I genuinely didn't believe that I would ever be in a long-term relationship again. ""So then actually meeting my partner and becoming involved in a loving, healthy relationship, it was at the beginning and it still is - it amazes me some days just how nice life can be. ""Someone asked me one time, they asked me what did it feel like to be free? And I thought, 'well I don't know'. At that point I didn't really feel like I was. ""I was getting there but freedom doesn't happen when you leave the relationship. It's not this miraculous thing that people sometimes expect, 'oh she's left him now she should be happy'. ""That battle will rage in your head for a long time after you've left. Overcoming those battles is not an easy thing - but you can."" In Northern Ireland, a domestic abuse call is made to the PSNI on average every 17 minutes. Resources like housing, aid and legislation are among a raft of measures that deal with the aftermath of domestic abuse but preventing it, is for Alannah, something that needs to start in the home. ""I have a boy and a girl. Raising your daughter to be aware of it and to recognise red flags and leave and speak out - and that's one thing but if everybody just teaches their daughters to leave, we're not handling the problem, we need to teach our sons as well. ""We need to instil in them the values and the importance of respecting women and respecting themselves and opening up if they are struggling."" Information and support: If you or someone you know needs support for issues about domestic abuse,these organisations may be able to help.

"Breaking|Breaking newsTougher Covid rules for three Scottish areasFife, Angus and Perth and Kinross will be moved from level two to level three of Scotland's five-tier system.ScotlandComments","This video can not be played The first minister says a sharp rise in case numbers has driven the move to Level 3 in three council areas Three Scottish council areas are to have tougher coronavirus rules imposed amid concern over an increase in cases. Fife, Angus and Perth and Kinross will all be moved from level two to level three of Scotland's five-tier system. It means pubs and restaurants in those areas will no longer be allowed to serve alcohol. But up to six people from two households in Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles will be able to meet inside their homes from Friday. Ms Sturgeon said this was possible because cases in the islands were ""very low and sporadic"", but warned that people who have travelled from the mainland should avoid in-house mixing for a time to limit the risk of importing the virus. Has your area changed its Covid alert level? Live reaction to the announcement The existing restrictions in all of the country's other local authority areas will remain unchanged for now - although some level three areas are continuing to see rapid increases in cases and will be closely monitored. Ms Sturgeon said the ""necessary and precautionary"" decision to move Fife, Perth and Kinross and Angus to level three from Friday was taken because cases in all three areas were on a ""sharply rising trajectory"". The most recent data shows that, in the space of a week, the number of cases per 100,000 of the population has increased by 32% in Perth and Kinross, by 40% in Fife, and by 47% in Angus. Medical experts had strongly recommended the move to level three as it was felt that level two may not be enough to reverse increases of that magnitude. The first minister said: ""I know this will be disappointing to residents and businesses in these areas. ""However, by acting now, we can hopefully prevent an even more serious deterioration in the situation."" Councillors David Alexander and David Ross, the co-Leaders of Fife Council, said the decision was not what they had been hoping for, but had been ""based on the facts"". But Dean Banks, director and chef at The Haar restaurant in St Andrews, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that the ban on alcohol sales meant he might have to shut his business again. The former Masterchef finalist said dozens of customers had already cancelled their bookings for the weekend, adding: ""We're not sure what's going on. One week we've had alcohol sales, we've boosted revenue again, and taking that away again just rips us in half. ""People are cancelling their tables, they don't want to come or they want to leave it until later date to enjoy it with a glass of wine. ""How does Covid-19 know if someone's drinking a cup of coffee or a glass of wine? What is the difference there? I don't really understand what the difference is."" Pubs and restaurants in Fife, Angus and Perth and Kinross will no longer be able to serve alcohol Alan Mitchell, the chief executive of Fife Chamber of Commerce, described the decision as ""a bitter pill to swallow"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, a Fife MSP, said it was ""disappointing"" that the first minister was unable to say what had caused the spread of the virus there. He added: ""The testing and tracing team don't seem to have that information for Fife. It is important as we need to understand what has gone wrong. ""It is also disappointing that the government did not use the time we had in the summer better to get on top of the virus, to stop it rising with massive increases in testing and with much faster tracing - hunting it down to wipe it out."" Perth and Kinross Council chief executive Karen Reid said she was disappointed by its move to level three, which she said would have a major impact of many people's lives both during the restrictions and in the aftermath. Level 3- Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, Perth & Kinross, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian. Level 2- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll & Bute, Borders, Dumfries & Galloway. Level 1 -Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles. There are currently no areas of Scotland under the most severe level four restrictions - which would be broadly similar to the national lockdown currently in place across England. But officials are concerned about a sharp rise in cases in Stirling and Inverclyde, and to a lesser extent South Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - which are all already in level three. Their advice has been that moving any of those areas to level four would not currently be merited - but the data will be monitored closely on a daily basis. Ms Sturgeon warned: ""Given the severity of the level four restrictions, we will not take a decision to move any part of the country to that level lightly. ""But nor will we shy away from it if we think it necessary to limit the damage the virus can do, or if we think a short period at level four may be less harmful overall than a prolonged period at level three. ""These are difficult decisions and the week ahead is a particularly crucial juncture."" She also said the number of cases appeared to have stabilised but was remaining ""stubbornly high"" in Glasgow, North and South Lanarkshire, West Lothian and West Dunbartonshire. The difficult question was therefore whether more time at level three will start to reduce cases there, or whether more action will be required. However, the first minister stressed that there were encouraging signs in several other level three areas, which could potentially see them being downgraded to level two if that trend continues. These include East Lothian, Edinburgh, Clackmannanshire, East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Midlothian and North and East Ayrshire. Ms Sturgeon said travel restrictions continued to be ""essential"" but would remain as guidance over the next week rather than being put into law as she has been considering doing. Opposition parties have called for greater transparency about the decision-making process, with Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard saying the announcement ""raises more questions"" about what it would take for areas to move down a level. Mr Leonard added: ""All the evidence must be shared and it must be persuasive"". The Federation of Small Businesses said the announcement of tougher restrictions in Fife, Perth and Kinross and Angus would cause heartache for many employers, and urged the Scottish government not to move any areas to level four ahead of the crucial Christmas period.

"Mass Covid testing for local areas in EnglandAreas including Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire and parts of the West Midlands will receive new rapid tests.UK","Soldiers have been brought in to help with the mass testing programme in Liverpool Mass testing for coronavirus will be rolled out to 67 more areas in England, the health secretary has said. Areas including Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire and parts of the West Midlands will receive new rapid ""lateral flow"" tests. Matt Hancock said he hoped the new tests would find Covid-19 ""wherever it is, especially in those high prevalence areas"". It follows the launch of amass testing programme of people in Liverpool. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was sending 600,000 of the rapid tests out to directors of public health in 67 areas - listed below - as part of plans to expand asymptomatic testing for Covid-19. Mr Hancock said they would be used to test 10% of an area's community each week. Overall, 70 areas will have the new tests. Mass testing, like any potential vaccine, will be made available to the devolved administrations, and not just in England, the health secretary said. A further 20,412 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with another 532 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. 234,079 coronavirus tests were processed in the UK on Monday. News of the scheme came as the head of England's Test and Trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, told MPs the service was not a ""silver bullet"" to tackle coronavirus. The Conservative peer revealed that preliminary data showed a little over half of people - 54% - who were asked to self-isolate for 14 days said they had complied with the rules. ""Much as I would love that testing and tracing on its own would be a silver bullet to holding back the tide of Covid, unfortunately the evidence in the UK and in every other country in Europe is that's not the case,"" she said. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS was ready to start providingthe new coronavirus vaccine ""as fast as safely possible"". And Covid tests for students in England, so they can go home safely for Christmas,could begin on 30 November, according to a letter from the universities minister to vice chancellors. Where will mass testing be available? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection Mass testing means asking everyone to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. The idea is to find healthy people who may be infected, but not yet displaying symptoms. They can then be told to isolate to avoid spreading the virus. Currently, across most of England, people can only have a test if they already have symptoms. But during the Liverpool pilot, everyone living or working in the city is being offered a voluntary test. More than 23,000 residents and workers in the area have been tested since Friday. As well as the normal swab tests, the mass-testing schemes use rapid ""lateral flow"" tests. These also use a swab but do not need to be sent to a lab and can give results within an hour. In a statement, Mr Hancock said the ""new, rapid"" technology means ""we can detect this virus quicker than ever before, even in people who don't have symptoms"".

The initial 600,000 batch will then be followed up with a weekly allocation of lateral flow antigen tests.

Lockdown children forget how to use knife and fork,"The pandemic has seen most children in England slipping back with their learning - and some have gone significantly back with their social skills, says Ofsted. A report from the education watchdog warns some young children have forgotten how to use a knife and fork or have regressed back to nappies. Older children have lost their ""stamina"" for reading, say inspectors. The Department for Education says it shows the need to keep schools open. Ofsted has examined the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on children, based on visits to 900 schools and early years providers this autumn - and found that it has been a very divided experience. The chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, says there are three ""broad groups"" to describe what has happened: The ""hardest-hit"" group of young children have suffered from time out of school, going backwards on words and numbers and with ""regression back into nappies among potty-trained children"" or losing ""basic skills"" such as using a knife and fork. The majority of children in the middle ""have slipped back in their learning to varying degrees since schools were closed to most children and movement restricted"" and the report says: ""Lost learning is unarguable, but it is hard to assess."" There are also children who found the lockdown a positive experience - these children, from supportive but not necessarily well off backgrounds, might have benefited from a greater sense of togetherness with parents and ""quality time"" as a family But Ms Spielman says this did not divide along the lines of advantage and deprivation, but instead factors such as whether parents were able to spend time with children and families having what she described as ""good support structures"". Among older children, Ofsted warns of a loss of concentration among those returning to school and that ""online squabbles"" that started on social media during the lockdown are now ""being played out in the classroom"". Catch-up tuition funding for schools Children have fallen three months behind, say teachers Pupils sent home in half of secondary schools There are also reports of a loss of physical fitness, while other pupils are showing ""signs of mental distress"", with concerns over eating disorders and self-harm. There are concerns about pupils who have so far not returned to school - and in a third of schools there has been an ""increase in children being removed from school to be educated at home"". But inspectors say schools are still ""firefighting"" practical problems about keeping going during the pandemic, with the challenge of operating bubbles and responding to Covid outbreaks. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the report ""starkly shows the educational and emotional impact of school closures, and why we need to do everything possible to keep schools open"". But he warned that it was becoming financially unsustainable to keep schools running, with the cost of safety measures and the need to pay for supply staff when teachers had to self-isolate. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The government has been clear that getting all pupils and students back into full-time education is a national priority."" She said  the Â£1bn catch-up fund, including support for tutoring, would help to make up for lost learning.

"LiveLiveRepublicans back Trump as he refuses to concedePresident Trump is refusing to admit losing the election to Joe Biden, making unsubstantiated fraud claims.US Election 2020","President-elect Joe Biden says Donald Trump's refusal to concede the election ""will not help the president's legacy"" He also spoke in defence of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and said he had spoken to six world leaders President Donald Trump is refusing to admit losing the election, making unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud The US justice department has given federal prosecutors an unusual go-ahead to investigate alleged vote irregularities Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell says the president has every right to pursue legal challenges Democrat Joe Biden was projected as the election's winner, with an unassailable lead, on Saturday Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung This ends today's live coverage of the US 2020 election, and the latest from Trump's and Biden's teams as Biden works on his transition into the White House - only 10 weeks from now. Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy. Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition. You can watch more from Biden here: This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Embarrassment' that Trump has not conceded election The hidden text could be seen after the colours of the image were manipulated The UK government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his victory which also had the name ""Trump"" in the background. The ""Trump"" wording is not immediately obvious in the image inJohnson's tweet,external. However, theGuido Fawkes website,externalfound that by manipulating the colours of the image, the word ""Trump"" could be seen in the background, in a smaller font, in the message to Biden. The message also had the word ""second term"" buried in it, the website added. Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" You can read our full storyhere. It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel. Trump never had much time for her, and things got worse whenshe reportedly baulked at his request,externalto declassify documents relating to the Russia investigation.Describing it as a âRussia Hoaxâ,external, Trump wanted people to see for themselves what was in the material. Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to. Trump hoped Wray would get rid of some of the individuals who had investigated his campaign aides in 2016 during the Russia investigation. But everyone is vulnerable.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once said,externalhe would remain in his job till the president âtweets me out of officeâ. Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views.

""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Mass Covid testing for 66 local areas in England,"Soldiers have been brought in to help with the mass testing programme in Liverpool Mass testing for coronavirus will be rolled out to 67 more areas in England, the health secretary has said. Areas including Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire and parts of the West Midlands will receive new rapid ""lateral flow"" tests. Matt Hancock said he hoped the new tests would find Covid-19 ""wherever it is, especially in those high prevalence areas"". It follows the launch of amass testing programme of people in Liverpool. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was sending 600,000 of the rapid tests out to directors of public health in 67 areas - listed below - as part of plans to expand asymptomatic testing for Covid-19. Mr Hancock said they would be used to test 10% of an area's community each week. Overall, 70 areas will have the new tests. Mass testing, like any potential vaccine, will be made available to the devolved administrations, and not just in England, the health secretary said. A further 20,412 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with another 532 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. 234,079 coronavirus tests were processed in the UK on Monday. News of the scheme came as the head of England's Test and Trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, told MPs the service was not a ""silver bullet"" to tackle coronavirus. The Conservative peer revealed that preliminary data showed a little over half of people - 54% - who were asked to self-isolate for 14 days said they had complied with the rules. ""Much as I would love that testing and tracing on its own would be a silver bullet to holding back the tide of Covid, unfortunately the evidence in the UK and in every other country in Europe is that's not the case,"" she said. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS was ready to start providingthe new coronavirus vaccine ""as fast as safely possible"". And Covid tests for students in England, so they can go home safely for Christmas,could begin on 30 November, according to a letter from the universities minister to vice chancellors. Where will mass testing be available? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection Mass testing means asking everyone to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. The idea is to find healthy people who may be infected, but not yet displaying symptoms. They can then be told to isolate to avoid spreading the virus. Currently, across most of England, people can only have a test if they already have symptoms. But during the Liverpool pilot, everyone living or working in the city is being offered a voluntary test. More than 23,000 residents and workers in the area have been tested since Friday. As well as the normal swab tests, the mass-testing schemes use rapid ""lateral flow"" tests. These also use a swab but do not need to be sent to a lab and can give results within an hour. In a statement, Mr Hancock said the ""new, rapid"" technology means ""we can detect this virus quicker than ever before, even in people who don't have symptoms"". He added: ""Mass testing is a vital tool to help us control this virus and get life more normal."" TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? As part of the latest plans, each local area will receive a batch of 10,000 lateral flow tests, DHSC said. Local public health directors will then decide how people in the local area are tested, and how to prioritise the allocation of the tests based on the specific needs of their communities. The initial 600,000 batch will then be followed up with a weekly allocation of lateral flow antigen tests. According to DHSC, areas were prioritised for the scheme based on the local prevalence of the virus and expressions of interest to the department.

Source:DHSC,external On Friday, queues built up outside the new test centres in Liverpool, which opened at midday, with people waiting around 45 minutes outside the city's Tennis Centre - one of the six facilities - before it opened. Liverpool's director of public health, Matt Ashton, on Saturday said the mass testing was showing positive signs after thousands of people were tested on the first day of the pilot scheme. The programme aims to test up to 50,000 people a day once fully operational, he added. The city's mayor, Joe Anderson, on Monday said 23,170 people have been tested for coronavirus in the city since midday on Friday, with 0.7% testing positive.

Scooby-Doo co-creator Ken Spears dies aged 82,"Ken Spears, the co-creator of the cartoon series Scooby-Doo, has died at the age of 82. Spears, who created the animated characters alongside his creative partner Joe Ruby, died of complications from Lewy body dementia. Their original show, Scooby Doo, Where Are You!, only ran for two series from 1969-1970, but established a template that spawned 50 years of stories. Spears' death comes three months after that of his co-creator, Ruby. His son Kevinconfirmed to The Hollywood Reporter,externalthat Spears died in Los Angeles on Friday. Warner Bros president Sam Register said in a statement: ""Warner Bros Animation is saddened to learn of the passing of Ken Spears and we send our warmest thoughts to his loved ones.

Ken Spears was born in Los Angeles on 12 March 1938, and met Ruby when both were sound editors and staff writers at animation studio Hanna Barbera. While there, the pair created Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, which debuted on CBS in September 1969. It followed the adventures of a cowardly but good-natured Great Dane, Scooby, who travelled the US solving spooky mysteries with a group of plucky teenagers -  Daphne, Fred, Velma and his slacker sidekick, Shaggy. Spears and Ruby wrote and story-edited all but four of the first 25 episodes. The pair went on to create characters including Dynomutt, Dog Wonder and Jabberjaw and were asked to supervise the Saturday morning cartoon line-up at CBS, and later did the same job at ABC. In 1977, ABC set up Ruby-Spears Productions, which went on to spawn series such as Mister T and Alvin and the Chipmunks.

Amazon charged over abusing EU competition rules,"The European Commission has charged Amazon with abusing its dominant position in online retail to gain an unfair advantage over competitors. It said Amazon had used data on third-party sellers that use its marketplace to boost sales of its own-label goods. The Commission also launched a fresh probe into the possible preferential treatment of sellers that use the tech giant's logistics services. Amazon rejected the charges, saying no firm ""cared more"" for small businesses. It faces a potential fine as high as 10% of its global turnover if it is found guilty of breaching competition law - about Â£15bn ($19bn). In a statement, the EU's Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said it was vital that platforms with ""market power"" did not ""distort competition"". ""Data on the activity of third party sellers should not be used to the benefit of Amazon when it acts as a competitor to these sellers,"" she added. Amazon v EU: Has the online giant met its match? US tech giants accused of 'monopoly power' Amazon's Jeff Bezos: The richest person in the world ""With e-commerce booming, and Amazon being the leading e-commerce platform, a fair and undistorted access to consumers online is important for all sellers."" The European Commission has been investigating Amazon since July last year, following complaints from traders. It says the tech giant accesses sensitive data from small and medium-sized companies that use its platform, such as sales figures, page visits or shipping information. It then uses this to help with sales of its own-label products, or in choosing suppliers, the Commission says. In a press conference on Tuesday, Ms Vestager said: ""We do not take issue with the success of Amazon or its size."" Margrethe Vestager is the European Union's competition commissioner In a statement Amazon insisted that - far from being anti-competitive - its private-label products were good for customers and offered more choice. ""Amazon represents less than 1% of the global retail market, and there are larger retailers in every country in which we operate,"" it said. ""No company cares more about small businesses or has done more to support them over the past two decades than Amazon."" It also pointed out that there are more than 150,000 European businesses selling through its online marketplace. The charges come asthe coronavirus crisis has driven huge sales for the retailer, as people increasingly turn to online shopping. In August, boss Jeff Bezos became the richest man in the world with a fortune of more than $200bn after the firm's share price rocketed in the early months of the pandemic. She has led the way in tightening the regulatory screw on the US tech giants, taking on both Google and Apple. Now Europe's Competition supremo Margrethe Vestager has Amazon in her sights - and once again this case is about platform power. Her concern is that tech giants which own a platform - Apple's iOS operating system, Google's Android or Amazon's Marketplace - can have great power over the businesses that are completely dependent on it. In Amazon's case, her focus is also on its access to huge amounts of data about which products from the third-party sellers on its Marketplace are selling well. Commissioner Vestager says Amazon is ""a highly automated company, where business decisions are based on algorithmic tools"", and she believes those tools are used by the company to compete unfairly against its own business customers. This case won't be settled quickly - Amazon claims it makes more money from third-party sellers than from its own products. There will also be questions about whether there is any real harm to consumers. But don't expect this to be the only investigation into the might of Amazon - a Biden administration in the United States looks eager to follow Europe's lead in tackling the power of the platforms. Ms Vestager has taken a tough stance on US tech firms and what she sees as their grip on the digital landscape. Search engine Google, for example, has been fined more than â¬8bn in three separate cases, all relating to alleged abuses of power in the EU. Meanwhile, in the United States,a report backed by Democratic lawmakers recently urged changesthat could lead to the break-up of some of the country's biggest tech companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The report found that Amazon possessed ""significant and durable market power"" in online shopping, which it furthered in part by ""anticompetitive conduct in its treatment of third-party sellers"". In OctoberAmazon hit back in a blog post on its website,external: ""The fact that third parties having the opportunity to sell right alongside a retailer's products is the very competition that most benefits consumers and has made the marketplace model so successful for third-party sellers"".

Government suffers Lords defeat over Brexit bill,"The government has suffered a heavy defeat in the House of Lords over its controversial Brexit legislation. The Internal Market Bill contains measures that overrule parts of the UK's Brexit agreement with the EU. Peers voted overwhelmingly to remove a section of the bill that would allow ministers to break international law - by 433 votes to 165. The government said it would reinstate the clauses when the bill returns to the House of Commons next month. It comes as trade talks continue between EU and UK officials in London as they try to reach an agreement over a future economic partnership. Brexit: What is the Internal Market Bill? Brexit will be 'brutal' for UK, warns ex-PM Major Seven things that will change on 1 January Former Conservative Party leader Lord Howard was among 44 Conservative peers who voted against the government on Monday night. He led the calls for the prime minister to ""think again"" and remove the contentious parts of the UK Internal Market Bill, warning that the government was using the language of ""law breakers"" everywhere. Peers also voted to remove another clause, allowing ministers to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement relating to Northern Ireland, by 407 votes to 148. Other clauses in the controversial section of the bill were removed without a vote. A government spokesman said in a statement: ""We will retable these clauses when the bill returns to the Commons. ""We've been consistently clear that the clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK's internal market and the huge gains of the peace process. ""We expect the House of Lords to recognise that we have an obligation to the people of Northern Ireland to make sure they continue to have unfettered access to the UK under all circumstances."" The Internal Market Bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after 1 January - when the post-Brexit transition period runs out. It gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of Brexit made earlier this year. Ministers say the bill would provide a ""safety net"" in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the section on Northern Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. The section -known as the protocol- is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The thumping rejection of the government's plan is a reminder that there is significant discomfort in Parliament that ministers are prepared to break international law. A number of Conservative grandees were among those voting to remove controversial clauses in the internal market bill - which has been heavily criticised by the EU. Even the US President-elect Joe Biden has raised concerns. The bill will now go back to the Commons - where the government has confirmed it will retable the controversial elements removed by peers. The government insisted the clauses were a crucial safety net and said it had a duty to ensure that Northern Ireland's businesses and producers continued to have unfettered access to the UK. MPs are unlikely to discuss the legislation again until December. However, by that point it should be clearer whether a post-Brexit free trade deal can be struck. UK's five living former prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May - have all spoken out against the bill. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the EU argue that - in allowing the government to undo parts of a treaty signed by the EU and UK - it could damage the country's international reputation and standing. Labour's leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Angela Smith, said the government ""should see sense"" and accept the removal ""of these offending clauses"". She added: ""I am sure some in government will initially react with bravado and try to dismiss tonight's historic votes in the Lords. To do so, however, would underestimate the genuine and serious concerns across the UK and beyond about ministers putting themselves above and beyond the rule of law."" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC Newsnight it was ""not a surprise"" that the bill was ""essentially being rejected"" by the House of Lords, adding: ""It's as controversial a piece of legislation within the UK as it is outside of the UK."" He said the government's ""tactic"" of legislating to give British ministers ""the powers to do what they want to do anyway"" has undermined trust in the UK's trade negotiations with the EU.

Scientists unearth skull of human ancestor 'cousin',"The two-million-year-old skull is a Paranthropus robustus specimen Australian researchers say the discovery of a two-million-year-old skull in South Africa throws more light on human evolution. The skull was a maleParanthropus robustus, a ""cousin species"" toHomo erectus- a species thought to be direct ancestors of modern humans. The two species lived around the same time, butParanthropus robustusdied out earlier. The research team described the find as exciting. ""Most of the fossil record is just a single tooth here and there so to have something like this is very rare, very lucky,"" Dr Angeline Leece told the BBC. The researchers, from Melbourne's La Trobe University, found the skull's fragments in 2018 at the Drimolen archaeological site north of Johannesburg. It was uncovered just metres away from a spot where a similarly agedHomo erectusskull of a child was discovered in 2015. The fossil was found in the Drimolen quarry near Johannesburg Archaeologists then spent the past few years piecing together and analysing the fossil.Their findings were published in the Nature, Ecology and Evolution journal,externalon Tuesday. Co-researcher Jesse Martin told the BBC that handling the fossil pieces was like working with ""wet cardboard"", adding he had used plastic straws to suck the last traces of dirt off them. It is thought thatthree hominins (human-like creatures) species lived in South Africaat the same time in competition with each other. As such the skull discovery presented a rare example of ""microevolution"" within human lineage, Mr Martin said. Paranthropus robustushad large teeth and small brains, differing fromHomo erectuswhich had large brains and small teeth. It is believed the former's diet involved eating mainly tough plants, like tubers and bark. The skull took over 300 hours to piece together ""Through time,Paranthropus robustuslikely evolved to generate and withstand higher forces produced during biting and chewing food that was hard or mechanically challenging to process with their jaws and teeth,"" said Dr Leece. The scientists said it was possible that a wetter environment caused by climate change may have reduced the food available to them. MeanwhileHomo erectus, with their smaller teeth, was more likely to have eaten both plants and meat. ""These two vastly different species... represent divergent evolutionary experiments,"" Dr Leece said. ""While we were the lineage that won out in the end, two million years ago the fossil record suggests thatParanthropus robustuswas much more common than Homo erectus on the landscape.""

People turn to custard and gravy amid the pandemic,"The company behind foods such as gravy brand Bisto, custard-maker Ambrosia and Mr Kipling's cakes says people turned to comfort foods during the pandemic. Premier Foods credited ""exceptional"" demand throughout lockdown for strong sales and profit figures for the past six months. It said it had gained over a million new customers during the period. Premier said it was benefitting from the latest lockdown in England, which meant more people were eating at home. Profits for the six months to September were up 50% at Â£47.7m. Premier said that consumers had ""turned to brands they recognise and trust"". It also said people had been trying to expand their repertoire of meals cooked in their own kitchens, particularly as new restrictions on eating out had been introduced, which had helped sales of its cooking ingredients. The food critic and broadcaster, Jay Rayner, said the news was no surprise: ""All of us are having to cook many more meals in lockdown - prior to that 30% of our calories were eaten outside the house. ""Many of those doing the cooking were kids 20 or so years before so they are turning to these familiar foods."" Premier Foods' Cadbury's mini rolls were another stand out performer, as it put it, selling in ""very robust volumes"". Chief executive Alex Whitehouse said: ""The longevity of this increased demand is likely to be linked to the duration of these new measures."" The company said it expected to continue to see its income grow and forecast that its full-year profits would beat analysts' predictions. Premier Foods update came as market research firm Kantar Worldpanel produced its latest update of supermarket sales. It said these grew by 9.4% across the UK in the four weeks to 1 November. It said that while sales were higher than the same period a year ago, unlike in March, there had been no noticeable spike in the stockpiling of goods this time round.

Covid 'raises new psychiatric disorders risk',"One in every 17 people who have had Covid-19 could be diagnosed with anxiety, depression or insomnia for the first time, a study of millions of US patient health records suggests. That is about double the risk from other illnesses, the researchers say. Unexpectedly, they also found existing psychiatric patients were 65% more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19. This could be linked to their physical health or drugs prescribed to treat disorders, the researchers speculated. They should be given appropriate care, the Oxford team said. But they stopped short of asking psychiatric patients to shield or think of themselves as extremely vulnerable. Lockdown had 'major impact' on mental health Severe mental health problems rise amid pandemic Covid: What is the mental health cost to the young? University of Oxford psychiatry professor Paul Harrison, the lead study author, said people who had had Covid-19 ""will be at greater risk of mental health problems"". Even those not admitted to hospital with Covid had a higher risk. And the results,published in the Lancet Psychiatry,external, were likely to be ""underestimates of the actual number of cases"", although the experiences of patients in other countries could differ. The researchers tracked 62,000 people with Covid for three months after diagnosis and compared them with thousands of people with other conditions, such as flu, kidney stones and broken bones. The proportions diagnosed with a psychiatric illness were: 18% of those with Covid 13% of those with flu 12.7% of those with a fracture Excluding those who had previously been diagnosed with a disorder and relapsed, they were: 5.8% of those with Covid 2.8% of those with flu 2.5% of those with a fracture The most common diagnosis was anxiety, which included: adjustment disorder generalised anxiety disorder post-traumatic stress disorder Mood disorders were slightly less common. ""We urgently need research to investigate the causes and identify new treatments,"" Prof Harrison said. Dr Michael Bloomfield, from University College London, said the link was probably due to ""a combination of the psychological stressors associated with this particular pandemic and the physical effects of the illness"". TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Prof Dame Til Wykes, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, at King's College London said: ""The increase in mental health disorders in people who have developed Covid-19 mirrors the increases reported in the UK general population."" It was ""clearly the tip of an iceberg"", she added, saying many accessible forms of mental health support were needed to provide treatment for the mental health conditions. But Jo Daniels, from the University of Bath, said further research was needed before coming to any conclusions. ""We should be aware that poorer psychological outcomes are common in those who experience physical health problems of any nature,"" she said. ""Being acutely or chronically unwell is simply a difficult experience.""

'Inhuman' use of restraint on disabled patients,"Prone restraint, demonstrated here, can result in serious injury - and was used more than 4,000 times in 2019 Every 15 minutes, on average, a patient with learning disabilities was restrained in hospital last year, new BBCFile on 4analysis shows. In 2019, restraint was used just over 38,000 times in England. In 2017, there were 22,000 reports of restraint. Harriet Harman, chairwoman of the House of Commons joint select committee on human rights, said this suggested ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment. The Department of Health said restraint ""should only be used as a last resort"". The data, provided by NHS Digital and analysed by the BBC, also shows the use of prone restraint - or holding people face down - remains high, despite being against government guidelines. Last year, it was used more than 4,000 times. Seclusion - where people are locked in a room on their own - also remains high. In 2019, there were 3,225 reported cases of seclusion, and 850 of those involved children. In the first seven months of this year alone, there were more than 2,000 incidents of seclusion. Restraint is used to manage someone's behaviour when they are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. NHS England says it has ""driven an increase in the reporting of restraint"" and ""lowered the bar"". But not all hospitals and treatment units regularly provide complete data. Ms Harman said the treatment ""was basically a human rights abuse"". ""People are not supposed to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment - and routine solitary confinement and physical restraint is exactly that,"" she said. ""We clearly don't even know the half of it, since many providers of these institutions don't give the information that they should about what's going on."" Dan Scorer, head of policy at learning disability charity Mencap, said prone restraint ""should not be happening in any kind of planned way"" and could result in ""serious injury, and potentially death"". The figures come despite pledges to reduce restraint use, which includes seclusion, after a 2018 File on 4 programme first uncovered numbers of reported restraint had risen by 50% between 2016 and 2017. Bethany has ""massively improved"" since moving to a new community placement The case of autistic 19-year-old Bethany -  whoFile on 4 revealedhad been in seclusion for 21 months - drew a personal apology from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, and prompted the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to investigate the issue of restraint. The CQC's findings,released last month, were described as ""deeply concerning"" by Health Minister Helen Whately. Bethany was kept in a room with just a foam mattress and a chair, and fed through a hatch, at St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton. Last December,she was finally found a place in a specialist unitrun by Merseycare NHS Trust. She said: ""Since I've been here, the staff have been absolutely amazing. My behaviour's settled down and my anger's settled.  And I've not done any self-harming for five or six months."" She now has her own bedroom, plays the piano, goes out for walks and shopping, and is learning circus skills. Andrea Attree and her autistic daughter Dannielle, who has spent more than two years being secluded and segregated in hospitals Dannielle Attree from Kent, who is also autistic, was in the same hospital as Bethany for 19 months, where she spent time in seclusion after first being admitted following a period of poor mental health. Now she's in Littlebrook Hospital, run by Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, where she has been in segregation for nine months. She is sometimes locked in. Dannielle's mum Andrea Attree told File on 4: ""Dannielle doesn't know how to be able to be anywhere but in seclusion now, because it's been going on for so long. ""Her mental health has declined to the lowest I've ever seen. Her self-harm has been off the scale."" The government strategy Transforming Care was launched in 2012 following theWinterbourne View scandal. It set a target to reduce the number of inpatients with learning disabilities in England by at least 35% by March 2019. This target was then moved to March 2020. It wasn't met, and a new target has now been set to move 50% of patients by March 2024. In 2018, there were 2,400 people with learning disabilities and autism in hospital in England. Latest figures show there are still 2,060. Ms Harman said there was a need for a ""sense of urgency"", and that a special unit in the prime minister's office should be established to tackle the issue. The Department for Health and Social Care said a new unit would ""duplicate services"". ""Our priority is always to ensure people with a learning disability and autistic people receive safe and high-quality care, and that they are treated with dignity and respect,"" it added. ""Government policy is that any kind of restraint should only be used as a last resort, and there is active work to reduce use of restrictive practice in mental health settings."" Figures for restraint in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland aren't collated. But there are more than 600 people with learning disabilities and autism in hospital in those three countries. Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust said it agreed with Dannielle and Andrea that ""highly specialist services for people with autism nationally are not where we all want them to be"". It added: ""Our role has been to make sure that whilst we worked with Dannielle and her mum to find the right care setting for her, Dannielle is supported, cared for and cared about in what we all agree was never set up as a long-term placement."" St Andrew's Hospital said Dannielle had made good progress while she was there, that seclusion was only ever used as a last resort, and that guidelines were followed. It added that Bethany had been there ""longer than anyone wanted"", and it had worked with the NHS to transfer her to a community placement as soon as was possible.

Cardinal 'protected church reputation over victims',"The report said the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols had sometimes failed to demonstrate compassion The head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has, at times, shown he cares more about the impact of abuse on the Church's reputation than on the victims, a report says. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse criticised,externalthe leadership of Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, and the Vatican. The cardinal said the church was ""deeply sorry this happened"". A lawyer representing survivors said the cardinal ""must go right away"". Cardinal Nichols told the BBC he had offered to resign on Sunday upon turning 75, as is church law when bishops reach this age, but this was rejected by the Vatican. He said: ""I offered my resignation to Pope Francis. His answer has come back very clear, very unambiguous. He wants me to stay in post, so I will stay because that's where my orders come from, that's where my mandate comes from. ""He wants me to stay - I'm going to stay and continue to work wholeheartedly at these matters."" How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Catholic Church 'shocked to core' by child abuse The inquiry found that between 1970 and 2015 the Church received more than 3,000 complaints of child sexual abuse against more than 900 individuals connected to the Church. Those complaints involved more than 1,750 victims and complainants, though the report said the true scale of abuse was much higher and would likely never be known. It was ""far from a solely historical issue"", the inquiry found, adding that more than 100 allegations of abuse had been reported each year since 2016. The Catholic Church's ""explicit moral purpose has been betrayed by those who sexually abused children, and by those who turned a blind eye and failed to take action against perpetrators"". It said the cardinal, who apologised for the Church's actions when he gave evidence, ""did not always exercise the leadership expected of a senior member of the Church, at times preferring to protect the reputation of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales and in Rome"". It added that Cardinal Nichols had shown ""no acknowledgement of any personal responsibility to lead or influence change"". ""Nor did he demonstrate compassion towards victims in the recent cases which we examined."" The report said that two previous inquiries into abuse in the Church, by Lord Nolan in 2001 and Lady Cumberlege in 2007, had brought change and improvements, but their recommendations had been implemented too slowly and not in full. It highlighted that in 2016, internal correspondence between members of the Diocese of Westminster's safeguarding commission described a victim of sexual abuse as ""manipulative"" and ""needy"". The report states: ""Real and lasting changes to attitudes have some way to go if the Roman Catholic Church is to shake off the failures of the past."" One of the ""repeated failures"" highlighted in the IICSA report was the case of Father James Robinson, a serial paedophile, who was moved to another parish within the Archdiocese of Birmingham after complaints were first made in the 1980s. He later fled to the US but was extradited back to the UK wherehe was convicted in 2010 of 21 sexual offences against four boys and jailed for 21 years. The report said ""appalling sexual abuse"" was inflicted on pupils atAmpleforth Collegein North Yorkshire and its adjoining junior school. Five people connected to the school have been convicted or cautioned in relation to ""offences involving sexual activity with a large number of children, or offences concerning pornography"", the report said. One of them was Father Piers Grant-Ferris who was moved to at least six other parishes after allegations of abuse came to light 1975. He was convicted of indecent assault against 15 boys in 2006. The inquiry also criticised the Vatican, describing its actions as in ""direct contrast with Pope Francis's public statement on child sexual abuse"". In 2019, the Pope called for ""concrete and effective actions that involve everyone in the Church"". The Holy See did not provide a statement to the inquiry and the ambassador at the time refused to give evidence. The report said: ""In responding in this way, the Holy See's stance was contrary to the spirit of its public statements and it missed the opportunity to demonstrate its engagement and leadership on the issue of child sexual abuse."" It added its response ""manifestly did not demonstrate a commitment to taking action"". One abuse survivor said it was bad enough to have been abused but ""to have it dismissed and covered up just takes even more of a toll on you"". Another survivor, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said ""thousands of pounds have been spent by the Diocese of Westminster in employing lawyers to keep me at arm's length"" as they continued to make their case. They added: ""The church needs a seismic shift in culture, especially at the top. If there is any hope at all of real change it will require a relinquishing of power, and a will to treat survivors as human beings."" Richard Scorer, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon who represents 32 survivors in IICSA, said: ""This is an absolutely damning report. ""It highlights the shocking scale of abuse, the disgraceful slowness of the church's response, the abject failures of leadership by Cardinal Nichols, and the Vatican's appalling refusal to cooperate properly with the inquiry. ""Cardinal Nichols needs to go right away - in any other walk of life he would be gone immediately."" Responding to the report, Cardinal Nichols told the BBC: ""The things in this report are in the public sphere, and I'm sure they've been taken into account, but the response I've got is very unambiguous. It is to stay, and stay I will."" He continued: ""I'm not here to defend myself... I am here to say we accept this report, we are grateful to IICSA for bringing the light and giving public space to those who have been abused, we are deeply sorry this happened... ""Today is more about me saying again, on behalf of everybody in the Catholic Church, how deeply, deeply regretful and sorry I am that anybody suffered, and that so many suffered is a terrible shame with which I must live and from which I must learn."" The report follows the publication of a similar inquiry intoabuse in the Church of England, which concluded the church had created a culture where abusers ""could hide"".

"Biden tells Americans: I implore you, wear a mask","This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'I implore you, wear a mask' US President-elect Joe Biden has appealed to Americans to wear a mask as the best way to ""turn this pandemic around"". Mr Biden said the US faced a ""very dark winter"" and the ""worst wave yet"", and Americans had to put aside political differences to tackle Covid-19. He has named a new task force and vowed to ""follow the science"" as he puts together his transition team. Donald Trump still refuses to concede defeat and is challenging key results. He is taking legal action in several states. Mr Biden's victory was declared on Saturday but it remains a projection, with a number of states still counting ballot papers. He leads Mr Trump in the nationwide vote by about 4.5 million. Follow all the latest live updates Election results in maps and charts Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris have launcheda website for the transition,external, saying the team will also focus on climate change, the economy and tackling racism. But the president-elect will need the help of an agency called the General Services Administration to begin the transition process and its Trump-appointed head has given no indication when that will happen. On Monday, Mr Bidenset out the blueprints for his Transition Covid-19 Advisory Board,external. In a TV address, he said ""I implore you, wear a mask"", calling it the ""single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of Covid"". He added: ""A mask is not a political statement but it is a good way to start pulling the country together."" During the election campaign, his mask-wearing was markedly different to President Trump, whose attitude to it has varied considerably. They have differed too on how to follow scientific advice. Mr Biden said on Monday there would be a ""bedrock of science"" to his policy. President Trump's comments on Covid-19 have often conflicted with scientists, including leading infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci. Covid-19 cases in the US have passed 10 million and Joe Biden says tackling the pandemic is his main priority Mr Biden said that, as president, he would improve contact-tracing and supplies of protective equipment, and address the racial disparity of coronavirus infections. ""This is a crisis that affects everyone and I will be a president for everyone,"" he said. ""We can get this virus under control, I promise you."" He earlier named three co-chairs and 10 members of his task force. Among the co-chairs named is Vivek Murthy, who was appointed US surgeon-general by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. One member is immunologist Rick Bright, who says he was ignored and then removed by the Trump administration over his early warnings on Covid. Mr Biden also welcomed the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that preliminary analysis showed their vaccine in development could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection But he also warned it was ""important to understand that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away"". He plans to speak in Delaware on Tuesday about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the healthcare reform law that extended healthcare access for millions. BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says that Mr Biden's choice to address the pandemic as the first public event for his new transition team afforded him an opportunity to look and act like a man who will soon be president, despite Donald Trump's decision to not concede defeat. Read more: Could the election be decided in courts? 'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win On Monday, Covid cases in the US since the epidemic began passed 10 million, and there have been more than 237,000 deaths recorded so far,Johns Hopkins research shows,external. Donald Trump also welcomed the vaccine statement, tweeting it was ""such great news"". They reportedly include a slew of executive orders -written orders issued by the presidentto the federal government that do not require congressional approval - aimed at reversing controversial Trump policies. They are in draft form and cannot be issued until Mr Biden takes office. According to US media: Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization He will end thetravel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children Mr Biden also aims to make addressing racism a key policy, including better access to affordable housing for black and minority communities. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for unity in victory speeches Mr Biden wants to transform US policing, including banning the use of chokeholds, and to reduce the US prison population, which at more than two million people is the biggest in the world. Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? However, for the transition process to begin, the support of the General Services Administration is needed to access government funds and communicate with the federal agencies it will be staffing. Its administrator, Emily Murphy, has not started the process nor indicated when she will do so, sparking concern among some Democrats that Mr Trump will try to impede the transition process. The vast majority of the president's tweets have continued to call the electoral process into question. Mr Trump, the first president to lose a re-election bid since 1992, has launched an array of lawsuits backing claims of fraud for which no evidence has yet been presented. Five US voters who changed the race Being with Trump the day he lost the election One of his lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, on Monday said there were ""unlawful votes"" in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and Nevada. ""We will prove it all,"" he said. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" Mr Trump still plans rallies to back his challenge, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. Most Republicans have remained silent on Mr Biden's projected election victory, favouring the unveiling of full results. The New York Times said advisers had told Mr Trump the chances of legal success were not high but that he was not yet ready to accept the loss. Mr Trump has vowed to take legal action as far as the Supreme Court. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to argue this in state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. Former President George W Bush was one Republican who did congratulate Mr Biden, calling him a ""good man"". Votes in some states continue to be counted and results are never official until final certification in the weeks following the election. This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in state capitals to vote on 14 December. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.

Breaking|Breaking newsAll Welsh GCSE and A-level exams in 2021 cancelledAssessments done under teacher supervision will replace exams.Wales,"This video can not be played Some pupils are happy with the news but others less so Wales' GCSE, AS and A-level exams in summer 2021 are to be cancelled, with grades based on classroom assessments. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams due to the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic. Head teachers would work on a ""national approach"" to ensure consistency, she said. Assessments will be done under teacher supervision, and will begin in the second half of the spring term. They will be externally set and marked but delivered within the classroom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She added cancelling exams would also give time for teaching to continue through the summer term. Teachers would have flexibility on when to take the assessments, within the ""context of results timelines"". However one teaching union questioned whether the announcement would mean ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Confirming the decision, Ms Williams said: ""The well-being of learners and ensuring fairness across the system is central in our decision making process. ""We remain optimistic that the public health situation will improve, but the primary reason for my decision is down to fairness; the time learners will spend in schools and colleges will vary hugely and, in this situation, it is impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams to take place. ""We have consulted with universities across the UK and they have confirmed that they are used to accepting many different types of qualifications."" Ms Williams said it remained a ""highly challenging year"" but the announcement would remove pressures from learners and provide ""clear time for teaching and learning"". Cerys Harris has had to study at home while self-isolating for a total of four weeks since September A-level student Cerys Harris, 17, from Rhyl, has already had four weeks of self-isolation this term because of cases in her ""bubble"". She wants to start a degree next September in England. Although the education minister said universities are familiar with different qualifications, Cerys said she did not feel reassured, and was looking forward to more detail as to how the system is going to work. ""I've taken from [the announcement] that exams are cancelled, but it's not very straightforward,"" she said. Fellow Rhyl A-level student Jonathon Dawes, who studies at Coleg Cambria and is also a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament, said he welcomed the decision, but was looking forward to getting more detail. ""I'm looking forward to more guidance coming out to make sure it's as fair and transparent as possible, to make sure pupils get the grades they deserve and it's not different from school to school."" Jess Foster says she has had ""stress"" taken away by the announcement Jess Foster, 17, who is taking her A-levels at Bassaleg School in Newport, was ""immediately relieved"". ""I stress out about things personally a lot. To hear that taken off me instantly just felt really good,"" she said. Head teacher Victoria Lambe said the decision ""places trust"" in her profession Her head teacher, Victoria Lambe, welcomed the announcement, describing the move as ""brave"" and the ""fairest"" decision for young people. ""It very much places trust is the teaching profession. I think it will enable us to continue to put robust measures in place for monitoring pupils' progress,"" she said. ""It's been an incredibly stressful period for all members of the school community and this will enable us to really reduce stress levels."" In England, exams are still going ahead but some have beenmoved back by three weeksto allow for more teaching time, and with reduced content in some subjects. In Scotland, the GCSE-equivalentNational 5 exams are cancelled and replaced by teacher assessmentsand coursework, but Higher and Advanced Higher exams will just be delayed by two weeks. Exams in Northern Ireland are still going aheadbut the number of papers in some subjects has been reduced. Downing Street said there was no change to the plan to hold exams in England following Ms Williams's announcement. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We continue to think that exams are the fairest way of judging the students' performance."" The future generations commissioner said GCSEs should be permanently replaced Exam regulator Qualifications Wales, which advised the minister on her decision, said: ""We recognise this has been a difficult decision and there are no easy answers. We are considering the decision and what it could mean in practice. ""In the meantime, we will provide advice to the Independent Design and Delivery Advisory Group."" Wales secretary of the National Education Union David Evans said: ""We must ensure that young people have a consistent assessment process in place which means their abilities are recognised for their next steps.

'I don't want exams to go ahead next year' 'Scrap exams for 2021 after Covid disruption' Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 Children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said Ms Williams had made the right decision. She said: ""This should be a year of learning, not worry. Young people should now rest assured that the decision will enable them to work towards their qualifications."" Her words were echoed by Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, who said it would maximise ""fairness"" for students. ""This is the right decision for our young people,"" she added. ""It recognises the fact that they will have been affected to differing extents by the impact of the pandemic and it allows for as much teaching time as possible to catch-up with lost learning."" But the head of the school leaders' union NAHT raised concerns of ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Ruth Davies said: ""It has been announced that pupils will still be given externally set and marked tests, just in the classroom. ""We can't see how that isn't an exam.

Future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said GCSEs should be permanently replaced with assessments which were centred around pupils ""not testing"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian MS said with so much variation in how much education a pupil had received, a ""one size fits all"" approach would not have been fair. The Conservative spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""The critical issue for me is that assessments are externally set and externally marked. This will give them some comparability with previous years' exams and protect teachers against any accusations of unintended bias."" Reform MS Mandy Jones asked the government to review the announcement to allow students to sit exams if they wished. The 2020 exams were cancelled following the start of the first lockdown and results were eventually based on teacher-predicted grades. Ms Williams said her decision for the 2021 exams came after she considered detailed advice from Qualifications Wales on available options as well as interim findings of a review of the 2020 exam process. She also spoke to students, school and college leaders, universities and the children's commissioner. She said: ""In line with the recommendations of both Qualifications Wales and the Independent Review, there will be no exams for GCSE or AS level learners next year.

'Lockdown' declared Collins word of the yearUnsurprisingly the list is dominated by pandemic-related terms including furlough and key worker.UK,"""Lockdown"" has been declared the word of the year for 2020 by Collins Dictionary, after a sharp rise in its usage during the pandemic. It ""encapsulates the shared experience of billions of people"", Collins said. Lexicographers registered more than 250,000 usages of ""lockdown"" during 2020, up from just 4,000 last year. Other pandemic-linked terms on the 10-strong list include ""furlough"", ""key worker"", ""self-isolate"" and ""social distancing"" as well as ""coronavirus"". According to the dictionary, lockdown is defined as ""the imposition of stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces"". It came into common parlance as governments around the world responded to the spread of Covid-19 in early 2020 by placing strict measure to stop transmission of the virus. Non-virus related words to make the list reflect the social and political upheavals of 2020. Following the death of the unarmed black man George Floyd in the US the abbreviation ""BLM"", for the Black Lives Matter movement, features having registered a 581% increase in usage, according to Collins. Black Lives Matter protests saw BLM added to the word of the year list ""Megxit"", the term modelled on the word Brexit which was used for the withdrawal of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from royal duties also makes the list. Social media also plays its part with ""TikToker"", describing someone who shares content on platform TikTok and ""mukbang"" - a term originating in South Korea which describes a host who broadcasts videos of themselves eating large quantities of food. Helen Newstead, language content consultant at Collins, said: ""Language is a reflection of the world around us and 2020 has been dominated by the global pandemic. ""Lockdown has affected the way we work, study, shop, and socialize. ""With many countries entering a second lockdown, it is not a word of the year to celebrate but it is, perhaps, one that sums up the year for most of the world."" Climate strike was chosen as the 2019 word of the year after campaigns by activists such as Greta Thunberg Last year's Collinsword of the yearwas ""climate strike"", marking a year in which 17-year-old Greta Thunberg led a global environmental movement. 2019:Climate strike 2018:Single-use 2017:Fake news 2016:,externalBrexit 2015:,externalBinge-watch 2014:,externalPhotobomb 2013:,externalGeek The Oxford English Dictionary also choose their own word of the year, opting for""climate emergency""in 2019, ""toxic"" in 2018, ""youthquake"" in 2017 and ""post-truth"" in 2016.

Breaking|Breaking newsAll Welsh GCSE and A-level exams in 2021 cancelledAssessments done under teacher supervision will replace exams.WalesHow lockdown created domestic abuse 'perfect storm'Domestic violence is at a 15-year high in Northern Ireland as families have spent more time at home.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Some pupils are happy with the news but others less so Wales' GCSE, AS and A-level exams in summer 2021 are to be cancelled, with grades based on classroom assessments. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams due to the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic. Head teachers would work on a ""national approach"" to ensure consistency, she said. Assessments will be done under teacher supervision, and will begin in the second half of the spring term. They will be externally set and marked but delivered within the classroom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She added cancelling exams would also give time for teaching to continue through the summer term. Teachers would have flexibility on when to take the assessments, within the ""context of results timelines"". However one teaching union questioned whether the announcement would mean ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Confirming the decision, Ms Williams said: ""The well-being of learners and ensuring fairness across the system is central in our decision making process. ""We remain optimistic that the public health situation will improve, but the primary reason for my decision is down to fairness; the time learners will spend in schools and colleges will vary hugely and, in this situation, it is impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams to take place. ""We have consulted with universities across the UK and they have confirmed that they are used to accepting many different types of qualifications."" Ms Williams said it remained a ""highly challenging year"" but the announcement would remove pressures from learners and provide ""clear time for teaching and learning"". Cerys Harris has had to study at home while self-isolating for a total of four weeks since September A-level student Cerys Harris, 17, from Rhyl, has already had four weeks of self-isolation this term because of cases in her ""bubble"". She wants to start a degree next September in England. Although the education minister said universities are familiar with different qualifications, Cerys said she did not feel reassured, and was looking forward to more detail as to how the system is going to work. ""I've taken from [the announcement] that exams are cancelled, but it's not very straightforward,"" she said. Fellow Rhyl A-level student Jonathon Dawes, who studies at Coleg Cambria and is also a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament, said he welcomed the decision, but was looking forward to getting more detail. ""I'm looking forward to more guidance coming out to make sure it's as fair and transparent as possible, to make sure pupils get the grades they deserve and it's not different from school to school."" Jess Foster says she has had ""stress"" taken away by the announcement Jess Foster, 17, who is taking her A-levels at Bassaleg School in Newport, was ""immediately relieved"". ""I stress out about things personally a lot. To hear that taken off me instantly just felt really good,"" she said. Head teacher Victoria Lambe said the decision ""places trust"" in her profession Her head teacher, Victoria Lambe, welcomed the announcement, describing the move as ""brave"" and the ""fairest"" decision for young people. ""It very much places trust is the teaching profession. I think it will enable us to continue to put robust measures in place for monitoring pupils' progress,"" she said. ""It's been an incredibly stressful period for all members of the school community and this will enable us to really reduce stress levels."" In England, exams are still going ahead but some have beenmoved back by three weeksto allow for more teaching time, and with reduced content in some subjects. In Scotland, the GCSE-equivalentNational 5 exams are cancelled and replaced by teacher assessmentsand coursework, but Higher and Advanced Higher exams will just be delayed by two weeks.

How lockdown created domestic abuse 'perfect storm'Domestic violence is at a 15-year high in Northern Ireland as families have spent more time at home.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Alannah left her abusive relationship in London in 2013 ""Stay at home"" was at the core of public health advice in tackling Covid-19, the world over. But home is not a place of safety for all. Domestic violence and abuse is at a 15-year high in Northern Ireland, with more than 32,000 incidents reported to the PSNI from June 2019 to July 2020. Restrictions to reduce the spread of Covid-19 have forced people to spend much more time at home and created the ""perfect storm"" for abusers. BBC NI Spotlight went behind the scenes at Foyle Women's Aid to find out what it's like for some of those offering help to women and families in danger. At the time we started filming, the tree-lined avenue to one of their refuges was paved with a blaze of autumnal yellow and red leaves. The magnificent scene appeared in sharp contrast to the trauma that makes it necessary for women and children to take sanctuary in the refuge carefully protected by security gates. ""Nobody wants to be in a refuge and we would rather we weren't here but if somebody comes here, they are very well taken care of,"" says Marie Brown, chief executive of Foyle Women's Aid. Calls to the organisationincreased by 25% during the lockdown in the Spring, reflecting a trend across the UK, and Marie Brown believes that the current further restrictions will bring another surge. ""I do believe that we'll have a spike even in women contacting us. We're heading into Christmas. Christmas is not a good time for domestic violence."" The National Domestic Abuse Helpline can be contacted online as well as by phone The pandemic heralded huge changes in how everyone works in the centre. Roisin Hamill, the manager of the onsite creche, finds one of the new regulations particularly difficult when dealing with families as part of their outreach programme. ""When you're out delivering packs to families, you know they've been isolated at home for so long and that look on their face seeing somebody for the first time and you can't go and give them a hug - that's really difficult for us. ""We do explain to children and we explain to mummies that this will be a socially-distanced visit, it isn't our 'normal' and we can't wait to see you back again and we can't wait to give you that big hug."" The centre is more than a refuge. Those dealing with the aftermath of an abusive relationship can also avail of support courses run by the organisation. Alannah suffered abuse in a former relationship in London, which she broke free from in 2013. She undertook a group course on the recommendation of a counsellor. ""There's a stereotype around what it means to be a victim of abuse,"" she tells Spotlight. ""Growing up, I would always have said: 'Sure I wouldn't stay with somebody, sure if they lifted their hand to you, why would you stay? What kind of woman would stay? It's stupid.' And it was only after my own experience that I realised it's not about why women stay. ""Quite often they are staying because they believe they can fix that broken person because people who perpetrate abuse, they're very clever, they're very manipulative."" Alannah says that it took her time to realise that she needed to break free from the man who was doing harm to her. ""The first few times that there was physical violence, I was very concerned - obviously - for my own well-being but these people are manipulative, I was more concerned for his well-being. And that's just crazy to think that, but you do. You end up feeling sorry for that person. ""Only when I genuinely thought that I could die, and I imagined my family, and the impact that would have on them, that for me was the last straw and that was the moment that I realised I had to leave and that I couldn't fix that person."" Back in one of Foyle Women's Aid offices, Margaret Patterson, a referral co-ordinator, is rarely off the phone. ""Some people want to tell you their whole story, some people don't want to tell you their story. And some people need encouragement just to get the basic information. We've had people who phoned who wouldn't even tell us their names. They just want someone to talk to."" Margaret takes the initial calls from women and then a support worker is assigned to them. But Covid-19 restrictions have also made it more difficult for support workers, like Marie Crossan, to meet service-users and, in particular, to check in with those who may still be living in the same home as their abusers. ""You know your clients, you know if there's clients still in that relationship and you know that it's going to be particularly difficult to get speaking to them. ""You have to rely on them getting out for five minutes and giving you a call. ""Maybe their partner is off work so things are quite intense because the kids are at home. Women are trying to protect the kids and trying to keep things calm at home."" Alannah says she, along with many others, is testament to the fact that there is life after an abusive relationship. ""I genuinely didn't believe that I would ever be in a long-term relationship again. ""So then actually meeting my partner and becoming involved in a loving, healthy relationship, it was at the beginning and it still is - it amazes me some days just how nice life can be. ""Someone asked me one time, they asked me what did it feel like to be free? And I thought, 'well I don't know'. At that point I didn't really feel like I was. ""I was getting there but freedom doesn't happen when you leave the relationship. It's not this miraculous thing that people sometimes expect, 'oh she's left him now she should be happy'. ""That battle will rage in your head for a long time after you've left. Overcoming those battles is not an easy thing - but you can."" In Northern Ireland, a domestic abuse call is made to the PSNI on average every 17 minutes. Resources like housing, aid and legislation are among a raft of measures that deal with the aftermath of domestic abuse but preventing it, is for Alannah, something that needs to start in the home. ""I have a boy and a girl. Raising your daughter to be aware of it and to recognise red flags and leave and speak out - and that's one thing but if everybody just teaches their daughters to leave, we're not handling the problem, we need to teach our sons as well. ""We need to instil in them the values and the importance of respecting women and respecting themselves and opening up if they are struggling."" Information and support: If you or someone you know needs support for issues about domestic abuse,these organisations may be able to help.

Here's a recap of the main developments from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by our teams in London and Washington DC. The writers were Mal Siret, Penny Spiller, Sean Fanning, Alix Kroeger, Ritu Prasad, Yaroslav Lukov and Max Matza, and the editors were Vicky Baker, Boer Deng and Helier Cheung. The White House budget office is directing government agencies to put togetherTrump's proposed federal budget,externalfor fiscal year 2022, which is due to go into effect two weeks after Biden will take office. The move by the Office of Management and Budget meshes with other moves from the Trump campaign to deny that Biden will be president in 10 weeks and stall the transition as Trump fights the election in the courts. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

We covered President-elect Biden's press conference a little earlier, where he described President Trump's refusal to concede as ""an embarrassment"" that would ""not help"" Trump's legacy. Biden said the foreign leaders he had already spoken to were hopeful that America's democratic institutions would be viewed once again as strong and enduring after the transition. You can watch more from Biden here: This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Embarrassment' that Trump has not conceded election The hidden text could be seen after the colours of the image were manipulated The UK government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his victory which also had the name ""Trump"" in the background. The ""Trump"" wording is not immediately obvious in the image inJohnson's tweet,external. However, theGuido Fawkes website,externalfound that by manipulating the colours of the image, the word ""Trump"" could be seen in the background, in a smaller font, in the message to Biden. The message also had the word ""second term"" buried in it, the website added. Government officials later admitted two separate messages had been prepared before the US election result was known, and the alternative had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake. ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election,"" a government spokesman said. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" You can read our full storyhere. It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage. A short clip that has been widely shared on Twitter shows the vote tallies for both candidates in the swing state of Pennsylvania at the bottom of the screen. When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members. It was quickly fixed and the accurate report was restored,â according to a CNN source. âThis is normal and occasionally happens throughout states on election nights.â One of the videos in circulation on Twitter now has 1.3 million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times, another version on YouTube claims âmassive fraudâ. Reports by pro-Trump news sites suggest itâs evidence that votes are being âswappedâ between the two candidates. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks on the phone to US President-elect Joe Biden As we reported earlier, Biden on Tuesday held separate phone talks with several European leaders. The US president-elect's transition team has now provided read-outs of those conversations: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter, saying he was âterminatedâ. It is unusual to make such personnel changes during a presidential transition. So whoâs next? Many here in Washington think it could be CIA Director Gina Haspel.

Others say FBI Director Chris Wray is next,external: among other offences, Wray apparently did not fire people in the way the president wanted him to.

Working for the president means a high level of uncertainty about oneâs position. For some, the job also involves doomscrolling on Twitter and wondering when they will hear about the next sacking. Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said
2016 ... Please understand that
folks are very, very tired,"" they said when we queried it.] Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in May 2020 for Memorial Day Trump will tomorrow make his first public appearance since Biden's victory was projected on Saturday. He and his wife Melania will visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The event, which normally draws thousands, will not be open to the public this year due to the pandemic. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is due to attend. His planned annual speech for Veterans Day wascancelled today,externalafter it was confirmed that he met face-to-face last week with Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Wilkie tested negative for the virus on Monday. Trump held no public events on Monday or Tuesday. He was pictured golfing on Saturday when the news of Biden's victory was announced and returned to the Virginia golf club on Sunday. His last public remarks were on Thursday, when he delivered a post-election briefing from the White House. He has been on Twitter frequently since then, tweeting today: ""WE WILL WIN!"" Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the US as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Owner Dan Bongino said over the weekend the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"". But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. Read our full story here US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village has been celebrating her election victory. Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lockdown children forget how to use knife and forkThe pandemic has seen children slipping back in learning and social skills, Ofsted inspectors warn.Family & Education","The pandemic has seen most children in England slipping back with their learning - and some have gone significantly back with their social skills, says Ofsted. A report from the education watchdog warns some young children have forgotten how to use a knife and fork or have regressed back to nappies. Older children have lost their ""stamina"" for reading, say inspectors. The Department for Education says it shows the need to keep schools open. Ofsted has examined the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on children, based on visits to 900 schools and early years providers this autumn - and found that it has been a very divided experience. The chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, says there are three ""broad groups"" to describe what has happened: The ""hardest-hit"" group of young children have suffered from time out of school, going backwards on words and numbers and with ""regression back into nappies among potty-trained children"" or losing ""basic skills"" such as using a knife and fork. The majority of children in the middle ""have slipped back in their learning to varying degrees since schools were closed to most children and movement restricted"" and the report says: ""Lost learning is unarguable, but it is hard to assess."" There are also children who found the lockdown a positive experience - these children, from supportive but not necessarily well off backgrounds, might have benefited from a greater sense of togetherness with parents and ""quality time"" as a family But Ms Spielman says this did not divide along the lines of advantage and deprivation, but instead factors such as whether parents were able to spend time with children and families having what she described as ""good support structures"". Among older children, Ofsted warns of a loss of concentration among those returning to school and that ""online squabbles"" that started on social media during the lockdown are now ""being played out in the classroom"". Catch-up tuition funding for schools Children have fallen three months behind, say teachers Pupils sent home in half of secondary schools There are also reports of a loss of physical fitness, while other pupils are showing ""signs of mental distress"", with concerns over eating disorders and self-harm. There are concerns about pupils who have so far not returned to school - and in a third of schools there has been an ""increase in children being removed from school to be educated at home"". But inspectors say schools are still ""firefighting"" practical problems about keeping going during the pandemic, with the challenge of operating bubbles and responding to Covid outbreaks. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the report ""starkly shows the educational and emotional impact of school closures, and why we need to do everything possible to keep schools open"". But he warned that it was becoming financially unsustainable to keep schools running, with the cost of safety measures and the need to pay for supply staff when teachers had to self-isolate. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The government has been clear that getting all pupils and students back into full-time education is a national priority."" She said  the Â£1bn catch-up fund, including support for tutoring, would help to make up for lost learning.

It ""encapsulates the shared experience of billions of people"", Collins said. Lexicographers registered more than 250,000 usages of ""lockdown"" during 2020, up from just 4,000 last year. Other pandemic-linked terms on the 10-strong list include ""furlough"", ""key worker"", ""self-isolate"" and ""social distancing"" as well as ""coronavirus"". According to the dictionary, lockdown is defined as ""the imposition of stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces"". It came into common parlance as governments around the world responded to the spread of Covid-19 in early 2020 by placing strict measure to stop transmission of the virus. Non-virus related words to make the list reflect the social and political upheavals of 2020.

Helen Newstead, language content consultant at Collins, said: ""Language is a reflection of the world around us and 2020 has been dominated by the global pandemic. ""Lockdown has affected the way we work, study, shop, and socialize.

Breaking|Breaking newsAll Welsh GCSE and A-level exams in 2021 cancelledAssessments done under teacher supervision will replace exams.,"This video can not be played Some pupils are happy with the news but others less so Wales' GCSE, AS and A-level exams in summer 2021 are to be cancelled, with grades based on classroom assessments. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams due to the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic. Head teachers would work on a ""national approach"" to ensure consistency, she said. Assessments will be done under teacher supervision, and will begin in the second half of the spring term. They will be externally set and marked but delivered within the classroom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She added cancelling exams would also give time for teaching to continue through the summer term. Teachers would have flexibility on when to take the assessments, within the ""context of results timelines"". However one teaching union questioned whether the announcement would mean ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Confirming the decision, Ms Williams said: ""The well-being of learners and ensuring fairness across the system is central in our decision making process. ""We remain optimistic that the public health situation will improve, but the primary reason for my decision is down to fairness; the time learners will spend in schools and colleges will vary hugely and, in this situation, it is impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams to take place. ""We have consulted with universities across the UK and they have confirmed that they are used to accepting many different types of qualifications."" Ms Williams said it remained a ""highly challenging year"" but the announcement would remove pressures from learners and provide ""clear time for teaching and learning"". Cerys Harris has had to study at home while self-isolating for a total of four weeks since September A-level student Cerys Harris, 17, from Rhyl, has already had four weeks of self-isolation this term because of cases in her ""bubble"". She wants to start a degree next September in England. Although the education minister said universities are familiar with different qualifications, Cerys said she did not feel reassured, and was looking forward to more detail as to how the system is going to work. ""I've taken from [the announcement] that exams are cancelled, but it's not very straightforward,"" she said. Fellow Rhyl A-level student Jonathon Dawes, who studies at Coleg Cambria and is also a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament, said he welcomed the decision, but was looking forward to getting more detail. ""I'm looking forward to more guidance coming out to make sure it's as fair and transparent as possible, to make sure pupils get the grades they deserve and it's not different from school to school."" Jess Foster says she has had ""stress"" taken away by the announcement Jess Foster, 17, who is taking her A-levels at Bassaleg School in Newport, was ""immediately relieved"". ""I stress out about things personally a lot. To hear that taken off me instantly just felt really good,"" she said. Head teacher Victoria Lambe said the decision ""places trust"" in her profession Her head teacher, Victoria Lambe, welcomed the announcement, describing the move as ""brave"" and the ""fairest"" decision for young people. ""It very much places trust is the teaching profession. I think it will enable us to continue to put robust measures in place for monitoring pupils' progress,"" she said. ""It's been an incredibly stressful period for all members of the school community and this will enable us to really reduce stress levels."" In England, exams are still going ahead but some have beenmoved back by three weeksto allow for more teaching time, and with reduced content in some subjects. In Scotland, the GCSE-equivalentNational 5 exams are cancelled and replaced by teacher assessmentsand coursework, but Higher and Advanced Higher exams will just be delayed by two weeks. Exams in Northern Ireland are still going aheadbut the number of papers in some subjects has been reduced. Downing Street said there was no change to the plan to hold exams in England following Ms Williams's announcement. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We continue to think that exams are the fairest way of judging the students' performance."" The future generations commissioner said GCSEs should be permanently replaced Exam regulator Qualifications Wales, which advised the minister on her decision, said: ""We recognise this has been a difficult decision and there are no easy answers. We are considering the decision and what it could mean in practice. ""In the meantime, we will provide advice to the Independent Design and Delivery Advisory Group."" Wales secretary of the National Education Union David Evans said: ""We must ensure that young people have a consistent assessment process in place which means their abilities are recognised for their next steps. ""But this must not mean extra work for everyone involved - both staff and students alike. The education system is already struggling."" 'I don't want exams to go ahead next year' 'Scrap exams for 2021 after Covid disruption' Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 Children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said Ms Williams had made the right decision. She said: ""This should be a year of learning, not worry. Young people should now rest assured that the decision will enable them to work towards their qualifications."" Her words were echoed by Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, who said it would maximise ""fairness"" for students. ""This is the right decision for our young people,"" she added. ""It recognises the fact that they will have been affected to differing extents by the impact of the pandemic and it allows for as much teaching time as possible to catch-up with lost learning."" But the head of the school leaders' union NAHT raised concerns of ending up with ""exams by stealth"". Ruth Davies said: ""It has been announced that pupils will still be given externally set and marked tests, just in the classroom. ""We can't see how that isn't an exam. There is an awful lot of detail still to be determined, and we await further clarification, but we are worried we will end up with exams in all but name."" Future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said GCSEs should be permanently replaced with assessments which were centred around pupils ""not testing"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian MS said with so much variation in how much education a pupil had received, a ""one size fits all"" approach would not have been fair. The Conservative spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""The critical issue for me is that assessments are externally set and externally marked. This will give them some comparability with previous years' exams and protect teachers against any accusations of unintended bias."" Reform MS Mandy Jones asked the government to review the announcement to allow students to sit exams if they wished. The 2020 exams were cancelled following the start of the first lockdown and results were eventually based on teacher-predicted grades. Ms Williams said her decision for the 2021 exams came after she considered detailed advice from Qualifications Wales on available options as well as interim findings of a review of the 2020 exam process. She also spoke to students, school and college leaders, universities and the children's commissioner. She said: ""In line with the recommendations of both Qualifications Wales and the Independent Review, there will be no exams for GCSE or AS level learners next year. ""A-level students will also not be required to sit exams.""

A week of mass testing for students is proposed - running between 30 November and 6 December. The letter, seen by the BBC, promises a fast turnaround for tests and ""results within an hour"". The aim is to stop students spreading the virus as they return home. The first week of December, after the lockdown ends, could then become the ""travel window"" for many students to leave university for the Christmas holidays, with face-to-face teaching expected to finish earlier than usual this term. This could mean that by about 9 December many students will have left for home. But those who test positive will have to take another test and, if found to be infectious, have to stay in isolation. Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, said: ""The government have finally listened to our calls to ensure that students can travel home safely for Christmas. ""We particularly welcome this mass-testing approach as it equips students with the knowledge to make informed decisions about travel ahead of the winter break,"" she said. But the University and College Union, which represents university lecturers, said it was not yet clear whether all universities would take part in the testing programme or how many students would be included. ""There are huge hurdles to overcome to manage this process,"" said union leader Jo Grady. Around 1.2 million students are expected to move at Christmas from their university term-time address to a home in another part of the country, where there might be different levels of infection. The pilot tests for getting students home at Christmas Face-to-face university teaching to stop two weeks before end of term Will it be 'go home and stay home' for students after Christmas This has raised concerns among the Sage scientific advisers of a ""significant risk"" that this migration could spread the coronavirus. To prevent this danger, plans are being made for mass testing using so-called ""lateral flow tests"". These nose and throat swabs are self-administered, with no need for tests to be sent to laboratories for results. Pilots for this type of rapid testing have already begunat De Montfort and Durham universities. Other universities have been operating their own testing processes, which could also continue. The tests will be able to provide results within an hour The letter from Universities Minister Michelle Donelan, and its accompanying documents, says: ""The tests we are deploying have a high specificity which means the risk of false positive test results is low. ""Although the test does not detect all positive cases, it works extremely well in finding cases with higher viral loads - which is those who are most infectious. ""As the test is easy to administer and does not require a laboratory, testing can take place on a very regular basis,"" the letter to university leaders said. Accompanying documents show a planning timetable in which sites are prepared for testing from 15 November, ready to operate the following week, with ""pre end-of-term testing"" between 30 November and 6 December. The test kits will be given free to universities, which will have to provide a place for the tests to be carried out, in a way that can process thousands of students within a short time frame. Ministers have already indicated that universities will stop in-person teaching two weeks before the end of term and move online - so when students have been given the all-clear they could be expected to leave their term-time address and go home, in a ""test and release"" process. There are also believed to have been discussions about how the departure of students can be made safe - such as co-ordinating staggered times for leaving between universities in the same city. There could also be calls to avoid public transport - with suggestions of chartering coaches or using private transport, such as parents collecting students, and creating ""travel corridors"" to control traffic away from universities. University leaders have previously raised concerns about why this guidance has been left so close to the end of term - and there will be questions about the capacity of universities to be ready in time for the mass testing. There have also been questions about whether students will return as usual in January or whether there will be a staggered start and more testing, or whether more courses will switch online with some students initially studying from home. Universities UK welcomed the plans for more testing capacity, but warned that universities would ""now need clear assurance of the effectiveness of the tests as well as further details from the government on specific responsibilities under the proposed scheme including the governance, indemnity, resourcing and costs recovery"".

Emmerdale defends Down's syndrome storylineTwo characters will be seen terminating their pregnancy after their unborn child's diagnosis.Entertainment & Arts,"Laurel (Charlotte Bellamy) and Jai (Chris Bisson) will be seen deciding to terminate their pregnancy Emmerdale producers have defended a forthcoming storyline which will see a couple terminate their pregnancy after being told their unborn child has Down's syndrome. The announcement of the storyline last week prompted a backlash from some viewers, who said the ITV soap was adding to stigma around the condition. But series producer Laura Shaw has said the storyline had been well researched. She also urged people to watch the scenes when they air later this year. A forthcoming plotline will see Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) and Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson) delighted when they unexpectedly get pregnant. But an early scan will show the pregnancy isn't developing as expected and there is the possibility the baby has a chromosomal condition. 'We were offered 15 terminations of our baby girl' A world without Down's syndrome? Down's syndrome abortions 'need 24-week limit' They decide to have a CVS (chorionic villus sampling) test, which is used to determine chromosomal or genetic disorders in a foetus. The result they receive tells them the baby has Down's syndrome. Laurel and Jai will then be seen agonising over what to do, before ultimately deciding to end the pregnancy. Emmerdale already has one character with Down's syndrome - Rhona and Marlon's nine-year-old son Leo. Some Emmerdale fans and Down's syndrome campaigners said the ITV soap was perpetuating the idea that those with Down's syndrome do not lead lives worth living. Tim Reid, the co-creator and co-writer of Car Share,tweeted:,external""Dear Emmerdale, are you confident you've tackled this story in a way your audience with Down's syndrome deserve? Have you taken the same approach you would if characters were choosing to end a pregnancy for reason of gender, race or physical disability?"" Wendy O'Carroll, the founder of support charity Ups and Downs Southwest, voiced her concerns in an open letter to Emmerdale which waswidely shared on Facebook.,external ""Your proposed story will further serve to encourage and confirm the opinion that ending the life of a baby just because it has Down syndrome is perfectly acceptable and understandable because maybe it would be better if fewer people 'like them' were in the world,"" she said. ""Have you considered for even a moment, how children and adults with Down syndrome who follow your programme will react to two of their favourite characters discovering excitedly that they are to have a baby, and then deciding to terminate the life of that child because it has Down syndrome?"" Emmerdale won the National Television Award for best serial drama earlier this year Laura Shaw, the series producer for the soap, told journalists on Monday the storyline had been thoroughly researched in collaboration with Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC), medical professionals and people with lived experience. ""We're confident that what we've produced has been done in a really balanced and sensitive way,"" she said. ""We haven't gone into this blindly, we've spoken to as many people as we possibly can. We've got the research, this is based on real life, and I think people will see that. ""You're going to feel uncomfortable at times watching it, but I hope that people will then, as they watch it, understand why we've done it."" She said she knew it would be ""contentious"" but added that was partly what made it ""such an important story to tell"". ""I'm sure we'll get some mixed reactions, I'm well aware that it's a hugely emotive subject. But I do honestly think that once everyone has watched the episodes play out, they're going to feel huge sympathy for what an impossible and difficult choice these couples face, and an understanding,"" she said. ""And what you'll see through Jai and Laurel's story is how that decision goes on to affect their lives for years to come."" The producers worked with Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC) while the storyline was in development. Its director, Jane Fisher, said: ""Soaps in general tend to be keen on high drama, so I was a bit nervous about how it would be presented. But once I saw the script, all those anxieties went out the window, because it was clear from early stages that such a lot of thought and care had been put into getting this right. So our job as advisers was fairly straightforward."" She added: ""I think it's really important that peoplecanspeak about this, not that they must, because for many people this is a very painful and private experience. And that's fine, they may not want to talk about it openly. But thy need to know that they can, and at the moment many people feel reticent to talk about what's happened to them because they fear judgement."" Fisher said some parents who deal opt for an abortion ""very sadly don't feel they have permission to grieve for the baby they've lost, because they feel implicated in that loss"". She acknowledged the contentious nature of the storyline, and said: ""There are going to be people, however well this is portrayed, who are always going to have strong views.

Covid 'raises new psychiatric disorders risk'Anxiety was most commonly diagnosed in a study of US patients for 90 days after their diagnosis.Health,"One in every 17 people who have had Covid-19 could be diagnosed with anxiety, depression or insomnia for the first time, a study of millions of US patient health records suggests. That is about double the risk from other illnesses, the researchers say. Unexpectedly, they also found existing psychiatric patients were 65% more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19. This could be linked to their physical health or drugs prescribed to treat disorders, the researchers speculated. They should be given appropriate care, the Oxford team said. But they stopped short of asking psychiatric patients to shield or think of themselves as extremely vulnerable. Lockdown had 'major impact' on mental health Severe mental health problems rise amid pandemic Covid: What is the mental health cost to the young? University of Oxford psychiatry professor Paul Harrison, the lead study author, said people who had had Covid-19 ""will be at greater risk of mental health problems"". Even those not admitted to hospital with Covid had a higher risk. And the results,published in the Lancet Psychiatry,external, were likely to be ""underestimates of the actual number of cases"", although the experiences of patients in other countries could differ. The researchers tracked 62,000 people with Covid for three months after diagnosis and compared them with thousands of people with other conditions, such as flu, kidney stones and broken bones. The proportions diagnosed with a psychiatric illness were: 18% of those with Covid 13% of those with flu 12.7% of those with a fracture Excluding those who had previously been diagnosed with a disorder and relapsed, they were: 5.8% of those with Covid 2.8% of those with flu 2.5% of those with a fracture The most common diagnosis was anxiety, which included: adjustment disorder generalised anxiety disorder post-traumatic stress disorder Mood disorders were slightly less common. ""We urgently need research to investigate the causes and identify new treatments,"" Prof Harrison said. Dr Michael Bloomfield, from University College London, said the link was probably due to ""a combination of the psychological stressors associated with this particular pandemic and the physical effects of the illness"". TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Prof Dame Til Wykes, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, at King's College London said: ""The increase in mental health disorders in people who have developed Covid-19 mirrors the increases reported in the UK general population."" It was ""clearly the tip of an iceberg"", she added, saying many accessible forms of mental health support were needed to provide treatment for the mental health conditions. But Jo Daniels, from the University of Bath, said further research was needed before coming to any conclusions. ""We should be aware that poorer psychological outcomes are common in those who experience physical health problems of any nature,"" she said. ""Being acutely or chronically unwell is simply a difficult experience.""

China's Covid vaccine trial halted in Brazil,"China's Sinovac vaccine has been administered in late-stage trials in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey President Jair Bolsonaro has declared the suspension of a Brazilian trial for a Chinese covid vaccine as a ""victory"". The trial was halted after a ""severe adverse incident"" - reported to be the death of a volunteer. Brazilian health regulator Anvisa said the incident had taken place on 29 October but gave no further details. However the head of the institute conducting the trials has told local media the person's death was not linked to the medical trial itself. President Bolsonaro has long criticised the vaccine because of its Chinese links and said it would not be purchased by his country. He has also engaged in a political fight with the governor of SÃ£o Paulo, Joao Doria, who has publicly backed the trial. Writing on Facebook, the president said the halt of the CoronaVac trial was ""another victory for Jair Bolsonaro"". The vaccine, developed by Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, is one of several in final-stage testing globally. Sinovac says it is ""confident in the safety of the vaccine"". The firm has already been using it to immunise thousands of people at home in an emergency use programme. Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by coronavirus, recording more than 5.6m confirmed cases - the third highest tally in the world after the US and India - and nearly 163,000 deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. On Monday Anvisa said it had ""ruled to interrupt the clinical trial of the CoronaVac vaccine after a serious adverse incident"". It did not reveal what had happened, nor where it had taken place. Late-stage trials for the Sinovac vaccine are also being conducted in Indonesia and Turkey, but neither of these countries have announced a suspension. Indonesia's state-owned Bio Farma said on Tuesday that its own Sinovac vaccine trials were ""going smoothly"", according to Reuters news agency. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? Dimas Covas, head of the Butantan institute conducting the trials, told local media that the trial's suspension was related to a death, but insisted that the death was not linked to the vaccine. This was backed up by Jean Gorinchteyn, Health Secretary for the state of SÃ£o Paulo, who told a news conference that the death was an ""external event"" that was not related to the vaccine. Mr Covas said that there had been no adverse reactions to the vaccine. ""We found this Anvisa decision strange, because it is unrelated to the vaccine. There are more than 10,000 volunteers at this moment,"" Mr Covas told TV Cultura. He said the suspension had caused ""indignation"" and that the organisers of the trials had not been consulted. In a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Covas said he hoped trials would resume soon. Sinovac said on Tuesday that it was communicating with Brazil about the reported incident. ""We learned the head of Butantan Institute believed that this serious adverse event [SAE] is not related to the vaccine,"" it said in a statement. ""The clinical study in Brazil is strictly carried out in accordance with GCP [Good Clinical Practice] requirements and we are confident in the safety of the vaccine."" A pause in a clinical trial is not unusual. In September, the UK paused trials for another Covid-19 vaccine after a participant had a suspected adverse reaction. The trials for the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University were resumed a few dayslater after regulators said it was safe to continue. Brazil's president has been open about his preference for the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca, saying his government would not buy a Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccine. Is the decision by Anvisa based on science or politics? That's the question many people are asking here because the issue of the vaccine - indeed, Covid-19 itself - is deeply political in Brazil. From the very start, Jair Bolsonaro played down the virus, insisting the country remain open, that coronavirus was just the sniffles. But that approach was at odds with many of the country's regional leaders - even people he used to count as friends. JoÃ£o Doria is the governor of Brazil's most populous (and wealthy) state. In 2018, he backed Mr Bolsonaro to become president. But the two men have since fallen out - badly. When Covid-19 hit, Mr Doria led the way among state governors in introducing quarantine, advising people to stay at home. And that irritated Mr Bolsonaro. The governor's backing of the Sinovac vaccine has also grated. But it's a rivalry that won't be going away any time soon. Mr Doria is expected to throw his hat in the ring for the 2022 elections too - which is why, perhaps, Mr Bolsonaro is feeling a little bit competitive. CoronaVac is one of around a dozen vaccines in the final stage of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - around the world. This is a crucial point in vaccine development, where some experimental vaccines will fail. The news of its suspension in Brazil came shortly after a rival vaccine developer,the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer, said its own vaccine candidate had shown 90% effectiveness. Last month the Oxford vaccine trialreviewed the death of a volunteer in Brazil, saying an assessment had revealed no safety concerns. Separate to the phase 3 trials being held overseas, China is also administering experimental Covid-19 vaccines at home. CoronaVac is among three experimental coronavirus vaccines China has been using to inoculate hundreds of thousands of people under an emergency use programme. This video can not be played The BBC filmed hundreds of people queuing in Yiwu, China to get the experimental Sinovac vaccine last month Sinovac has previously said almost all of its employees and their families have received the vaccine. And a Chinese health official earlier said that serious side effects have not been observed in clinical trials. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people?

The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has also declined to acknowledge Biden's victory, making it impossible for his transition team to get the funds needed to physically move office and to obtain access to sensitive government documents. âIf President Trump wants to waste time and resources on a budget that will never see the light of day, thatâs his decision,""  Alexandra Weinroth, spokeswoman for the Democratic-led House Budget Committeetold Politico,external. âBut we look forward to receiving the budget of our 46th President, Joe Biden, in February.â Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has posted the letter George HW Bush left for Bill Clinton in the White House on his inauguration day on 20 January 1993 after losing the presidential election to his bitter rival. ""Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you,"" Bush stated in the letter. Clinton, who herself was defeated by Trump in the 2016 White House race, described that letter as ""gracious"" ina post on her Instagram page.,external ""Hereâs how itâs done in America,"" she said. ""Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power. That's what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring."" Clinton's post does not name Trump - but it's still a clear criticism of Trump's refusal to concede the election, and support a transition, so far.    â£ Allow Instagram content?

It's well known that throughout the Trump presidency, Fox News was Trump's outlet of choice. He's often phoned in to the station's programmes and Fox's opinion show hosts have been ardent Trump defenders. But has that relationship now soured? In recent months, Trump has remarked that Fox has changed. And then the outlet drew the ire of the president when it became the first to call Arizona for Biden - at 23:20 local time on election night, with just 73% of the vote in. (Note that the BBC still has not projected the result for Arizona, as we consider it too early.) Trump was reportedly enraged by the projection and had his staff call the Fox election desk to get them to roll back, according tothe Washington Post,external. A few days later, Fox News ended up calling the presidency for Biden, just minutes after CNN led the way. And then on Monday, Fox cut away from a briefing by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she mentioned ""illegal votes"", without providing any evidence. However, it's also worth noting that even as the channel seems to have moved away from the president's good graces, many Fox opinion programme anchors have still backed the president and his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check YouTubers have been posting screenshots of the glitch as ""evidence"" of fraud Rumours that votes have somehow been stolen from Donald Trump continue to flourish on social media and the latest story centres around footage from CNNâs election night coverage.

When Pennsylvania flashes back up seconds later, Joe Bidenâs total has risen by close to 20,000 votes and exactly the same number has been subtracted from Donald Trump. The clip is genuine but CNN says it simply shows an error that was quickly fixed. âFor one brief moment, the Trump votes and Biden votes in Armstrong County, PA were transposed in the data feed that went to CNN and all NEP [National Election Pool] members.

Thom Tillis pictured at a Trump rally on 2 November North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has narrowly held his Senate seat after his Democratic challenger conceded one week after the election. ""I just called Senator Tillis to congratulate him on winning re-election to a second term in the US Senate and wished him and his family the best in their continued service in the months and years ahead,â Cal Cunningham said in a statement. ""The voters have spoken and I respect their decision,â he added. The race became the most expensive in US Senate history, according to the Associated Press. Both campaigns and outside groups spent about $282m (Â£212m) in total. Cunningham out-fundraised his opponent but sank in the polls after an extramarital affair with a public relations consultant was revealed. With North Carolina settled, all eyes will now turn to Georgia, where the two senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election. in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Reality Check Joe Frazier, a boxing champion, died in 2011 At a recent press conference in
Philadelphia, Rudy Giuliani, President Trumpâs lawyer, accused the
Democratic-leaning city of having a long history of voter fraud. He claimed that noted Philadelphia
residents were voting long after they died. âJoe Frazierâ, the world champion
boxer who died in 2011, âis still voting hereâ, said Mr Giuliani. He went on to say that actor Will
Smithâs late father âhas voted here twice since he died.â We contacted the Philadelphia city
government, and were told both claims were false. The cityâs Law Department checked
their voter files and found that âneither is registered nor activeâ and that Joe Frazier did not vote after he
passed away. The case of Mr Smith Snr is a bit
more complicated.  We were told that ahead of elections in the city in
2016, he sent in an absentee ballot and then died one day prior to the
election. According to the Philadelphia city
government, the 2016 election code allowed these votes to be counted. There is
no record of Smith Snr having voted after this. Itâs not
clear where this story came from originally, but an article about Mr Frazier
and Mr Smith appeared in a pro-Trump blog on 6 November. The author claimed to
have seen records not publicly accessible. [This post was amended after publication. The original statement the Philadelphia city government provided to us referred to a 2017 election. ""It should have said

But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users - some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx.

Thulasendrapuram, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was the home of Ms Harris' maternal grandfather. People lit firecrackers and walked with pictures of Harris, who visited the village in her childhood. Ms Harris will be the first South Asian-American and first black vice president of the United States. This video can not be played US election: Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrate vice-president-elect Biden is asked after his address what message Trump is sending by not conceding that he lost the race. ""I think it's just an embarrassment quite frankly,"" Biden says. ""How can I say this tactfully?"" he pauses, adding: ""I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong,"" he continues. ""I think at the end of the day it's all gonna come to fruition on 20 January,"" he says, adding that Republican senators will soon come to recognise his victory. Biden is asked what his plan is if the Trump administration does not co-operate with a transition of power for now. ""It would be nice to have it but it's not critical,"" he says, adding that no legal action is planned by his team at the moment. The Trump administration has not approved the process of handing over the reins of government, meaning the Biden team has not yet been able to move in or begin examining sensitive information. ""We're going to do exactly what we're doing if he had conceded,"" he continues. Asked about his message to Trump if he is listening right now, Biden says with a grin: ""Mr President, I look forward to speaking with you."" He says he has not yet had a chance to speak with Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who he worked with for decades in Washington before joining the White House under Obama. Biden adds that he has already spoken to six world leaders to let ""them know America's back"". ""We're going to be back in the game,"" he says, calling the conversations ""very fulsome [and] energetic"". ""Obamacare is the law that every American should be proud of,"" says Biden about the law that is loathed by conservatives. He goes on to tout the effects of the law on the American economy and society. ""It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to 20 million Americans who did not have coverage. It's a law that reduced prescription drug cost for nearly 12 million seniors."" He adds: ""If you're sick, if you struggling, if you're worried about how you're going to get going or go through the day, we will not abandon you. ""That is a promise. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone,"" he adds. Biden begins his speech by blaming ""far right ideologues"" for trying to ""strip healthcare access away from the American people"". ""I'm not naive to the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided the American people in the past,"" he acknowledges, adding that the healthcare act known as Obamacare is still quite popular. He says 58% of Americans support keeping it in place, while 38% support removing it. He says that the law he and President Obama helped pass has allowed Americans to think less about the costs of their treatment ""and has spared countless families from financial ruin"". ""The Affordable Care Act was developed to bring a stop to that inhumanity,"" he says, calling removing it ""cruel and needlessly divisive"". Read more about how the law affects Americans:The lives that can be shaped by the Supreme Court  Harris is now speaking live from Delaware about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare reform law that extended healthcare coverage to millions of Americans. Her address comes as the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could see the healthcare law dismantled. The suit, brought by 18 Republican states, aims to rule the law unconstitutional. According to the Urban Institute think tank, over 20 million Americans could lose their healthcare coverage if Obamacare is overturned. ""Each and every vote for Biden was a vote to expand the healthcare act, not take it away during a global pandemic,"" Harris says. Biden is speaking next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has drawn scrutiny after refusing to answer questions during a press conference about a transition of power. *There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,"" he said, when asked about how the process was going. He continued: ""The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure the state department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who is in office on 20 January - a minute after noon - will also be successful."" Critics argue that the top US diplomat's words sound somewhat different to statements he has made about other countries' elections - he has urged leaders to accept election results and commit to the democratic process. Yesterday, Pompeo had this to say about Myamar's elections: ""The United States will continue to closely monitor the electoral process. We call on all relevant authorities to ensure tabulation of votes and resolution of complaints is undertaken in a transparent and credible manner.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Government suffers Lords defeat over Brexit billPeers vote overwhelmingly to remove a section that would allow ministers to break international law.,"The government has suffered a heavy defeat in the House of Lords over its controversial Brexit legislation. The Internal Market Bill contains measures that overrule parts of the UK's Brexit agreement with the EU. Peers voted overwhelmingly to remove a section of the bill that would allow ministers to break international law - by 433 votes to 165. The government said it would reinstate the clauses when the bill returns to the House of Commons next month. It comes as trade talks continue between EU and UK officials in London as they try to reach an agreement over a future economic partnership. Brexit: What is the Internal Market Bill? Brexit will be 'brutal' for UK, warns ex-PM Major Seven things that will change on 1 January Former Conservative Party leader Lord Howard was among 44 Conservative peers who voted against the government on Monday night. He led the calls for the prime minister to ""think again"" and remove the contentious parts of the UK Internal Market Bill, warning that the government was using the language of ""law breakers"" everywhere. Peers also voted to remove another clause, allowing ministers to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement relating to Northern Ireland, by 407 votes to 148. Other clauses in the controversial section of the bill were removed without a vote. A government spokesman said in a statement: ""We will retable these clauses when the bill returns to the Commons. ""We've been consistently clear that the clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK's internal market and the huge gains of the peace process. ""We expect the House of Lords to recognise that we have an obligation to the people of Northern Ireland to make sure they continue to have unfettered access to the UK under all circumstances."" The Internal Market Bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after 1 January - when the post-Brexit transition period runs out. It gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of Brexit made earlier this year. Ministers say the bill would provide a ""safety net"" in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the section on Northern Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. The section -known as the protocol- is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The thumping rejection of the government's plan is a reminder that there is significant discomfort in Parliament that ministers are prepared to break international law. A number of Conservative grandees were among those voting to remove controversial clauses in the internal market bill - which has been heavily criticised by the EU. Even the US President-elect Joe Biden has raised concerns. The bill will now go back to the Commons - where the government has confirmed it will retable the controversial elements removed by peers. The government insisted the clauses were a crucial safety net and said it had a duty to ensure that Northern Ireland's businesses and producers continued to have unfettered access to the UK. MPs are unlikely to discuss the legislation again until December. However, by that point it should be clearer whether a post-Brexit free trade deal can be struck. UK's five living former prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May - have all spoken out against the bill. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the EU argue that - in allowing the government to undo parts of a treaty signed by the EU and UK - it could damage the country's international reputation and standing. Labour's leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Angela Smith, said the government ""should see sense"" and accept the removal ""of these offending clauses"". She added: ""I am sure some in government will initially react with bravado and try to dismiss tonight's historic votes in the Lords. To do so, however, would underestimate the genuine and serious concerns across the UK and beyond about ministers putting themselves above and beyond the rule of law."" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC Newsnight it was ""not a surprise"" that the bill was ""essentially being rejected"" by the House of Lords, adding: ""It's as controversial a piece of legislation within the UK as it is outside of the UK."" He said the government's ""tactic"" of legislating to give British ministers ""the powers to do what they want to do anyway"" has undermined trust in the UK's trade negotiations with the EU.

Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future,"The government has suggested it will reject calls for another referendum but unionists worry how sustainable this is Supporters of the Union are nervous. A number of recent polls on Scottish independence suggest there is now a majority in support of leaving the UK. The SNP have started calling independence the ""settled will of the Scottish people"". The issue is set to dominate the run-up to the Holyrood election in May. Polls also suggest the SNP are on for a comfortable win - which will make calls for another vote on independence even louder. In this situation, the SNP will have gone into the election arguing it should have the power to hold another referendum - and will have won. So what is Westminster going to do? The immediate answer is a simple one. It will say no. UK ministers reject indyref2 'for a generation' Is Scotland moving towards independence? Why are more Scots supporting independence? Last week the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told the BBC there shouldn't be another referendum for a generation - adding that could be as long as 40 years. Although some Tories have discussed the prospect of a snap referendum - both publicly and privately - senior figures in government intend on rejecting calls for indyref2 next year, whatever the outcome of the Holyrood vote. And as things stand, they hold a trump card. Although some in the SNP are itching for a Plan B (which we'll revisit in the coming weeks) - Nicola Sturgeon wants an agreed, legal process with Westminster so that if Scotland votes for it, independence is seen as legitimate. But the debate doesn't end there. As ever with politics - the full story is more complicated. In the corridors of power in London, some believe unionists are losing the argument. They accept polls are likely to get worse for them - with support for independence increasing in the coming months. They accept many ""soft unionists"" are unhappy with Brexit and the way the UK government has pursued it. Opinion polls suggest growing support for independence but an SNP majority in May's election is far from guaranteed Some acknowledge privately that Nicola Sturgeon's handling of the coronavirus crisis has made her more popular - and impressed Scots who may have not been convinced about independence before. Sir John Major - who has long warned Brexit would make independence more likely - has argued that saying no to another referendum after an SNP victory may well help their case. He suggested two referendums; one on independence and one on the terms. His intervention shows some in Conservative circles are thinking about what to do next. The fear that saying no is unsustainable is shared by some in government. They worry that if the SNP wins comfortably in May, refusing to engage on an independence vote will look anti-democratic - alienating Scots who voted against independence in 2014 but are now on the fence. Some hope that by stopping the SNP winning a majority - which is a big ask under the electoral system anyway - they can argue the mandate isn't there. But that argument will be a lot harder to make if the SNP do dominate in May - and independence supporters already argue even if they don't get over the line and win 50% of seats, Holyrood could still vote in favour of another referendum with the support of the Scottish Greens. The government's strategy is focussed on telling Scottish voters more about its role in Scottish life. It wants to persuade people of the ""broad shoulders of the union"" - pointing to the huge financial support the Treasury has provided during the Covid crisis and arguing that wouldn't be possible as an independent country (an argument rubbished by the SNP, who believe the Treasury has made decisions based on England rather than the needs of parts of the union). The government is keen to stress the practical economic benefits that Scotland derives from the union Senior figures in government believe that the economic picture in May is likely to be grim. Unemployment could be rising, the health picture may still be uncertain. They think people will want certainty and will argue staying in the UK can provide it. Constitutional matters, they argue, will be far from top of people's minds. Even though people in government acknowledge support for independence is increasing, they believe it's ""soft"". Internal polling suggests people have other priorities and even among those who believe another referendum should happen there is a view that it's not the immediate priority. The last time the Scottish government called for the power to hold another referendum, after the Brexit vote, Theresa May's argument was a nuanced no - ""now is not the time"". That answer - or some form of it - is likely to be the same next year if the SNP do win power again. But more than last time, there is nervousness about how that answer will go down - and how long it can be sustained.

Top US lawyer quits over 'vote fraud' inquiry order,"This video can not be played Mitch McConnell: 'Trump 100% within rights to look into election irregularities' US attorney general William Barr has allowed federal prosecutors to probe alleged irregularities in the presidential election, prompting a top justice department official to quit. The official, Richard Pilger, would have overseen such investigations. Any such cases would normally be the remit of individual states, but Mr Barr said this was not a hard and fast rule. Donald Trump refuses to accept Joe Biden's projected victory, and has made unsubstantiated fraud claims. The president's campaign is seeking an emergency injunction in Pennsylvania to prevent Mr Biden's victory being certified in the state. The president-elect's projected win there on Saturday took him over the threshold of 270 electoral college votes needed to secure victory nationwide. What happens now? Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is US first lady-designate Jill Biden? The attorney general wrote that inquiries could be made by federal prosecutors,external""if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State"". Mr Barr warned against investigating ""fanciful"" claims Mr Barr said prosecutors should only look into ""substantial allegations"" of irregularities. He acknowledged that individual states had the primary responsibility for the conduct of elections but said the justice department had ""an obligation to ensure that federal elections are conducted in such a way that the American people can have full confidence in their electoral process and their government"". The department would normally only go beyond preliminary investigations after an election had been concluded and the results certified, but Mr Barr said this could result in situations where ""misconduct cannot realistically be rectified"". Mr Pilger said he had quit in response to Mr Barr's memo. ""Having familiarised myself with the new policy and its ramifications... I must regretfully resign from my role,"" he wrote in an email to colleagues. Mr Pilger became head of the department's Election Crimes Branch in 2010. This branch, and Mr Pilger himself, were previously in the public eye at the time of a row about extra scrutiny of political groups seeking tax exemption. He was reported to have had discussions about the issue with Lois Lerner,the tax official at the centre of the row. Bill Barr's memorandum authorising federal election fraud investigations is yet another example of the attorney general's skill at pleasing his boss, the president, while dancing on the edge of propriety within the justice department he runs. The document gives Donald Trump what he wants - proof that the government is looking into unproven claims of widespread electoral illegalities in several states he lost by tens of thousands of votes. The attorney general, however, couches the memo with conditions and cautions that prosecutors only focus on specific ""irregularities"" and avoid pursuing ""specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims"". Despite all the caveats, Mr Barr's memo will provide fodder to Trump and his supporters, who insist that the election was stolen from them (never mind that other Republican candidates had fairly successful results). As the protest resignation of the head of the justice department's election crimes department indicates, this is the equivalent of pulling the pin from a political hand grenade. It may not go off immediately, but the device is one step closer to exploding - thrown on purpose or accidentally dropped. There are safeguards in place to prevent political meddling in criminal investigations, particularly around elections. Some of those safeguards have now been removed. Since media projected on Saturday that Mr Biden had won the critical state of Pennsylvania, accumulating enough votes to claim the White House, the president-elect has forged ahead with his plans to take the reins of power. Biden tells Americans: I implore you, wear a mask Election results in maps and charts Mr Trump took to Twitter again on Monday to dispute the outcome, making unsubstantiated claims of ""unthinkable and illegal"" activity in the vote. The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages federal agencies, has held off on allowing Biden aides to formally begin the transition, saying no ""ascertainment"" on an election winner had yet been made. The GSA is tasked with formally recognising the president-elect, and providing the funds and access to federal agencies that Mr Biden's transition team needs. In previous elections it has mostly acted promptly after the winner was declared, with the exception of the disputed election in 2000 when it waited until a Supreme Court ruling decided the result on 14 December. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, says the Biden team is considering its legal options if the Trump administration continues to stall the handover. White House reporters have been saying that despite his objections, Mr Trump is expected to leave office begrudgingly in January and is already talking about running for the White House again in 2024. Mr Trump's spokeswoman vowed the legal battle to contest Mr Biden's victory was only just beginning. ""This election is not over,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a news conference on Monday. ""Far from it."" Ms McEnany and Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel cited allegations of electoral corruption, while urging reporters to help investigate the unverified claims. Conservative channel Fox News cut away from the event, citing the lack of evidence. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" ""Whoa, whoa, whoa,"" said presenter Neil Cavuto. ""Unless she [Ms McEnany] has more details to back that up, I can't in good countenance continue to show you this."" Ms McEnany told reporters: ""We have only begun the process of obtaining an accurate, honest vote count."" Five viral vote claims fact-checked Donald Trump's speech fact-checked Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud? She said Republican poll watchers had not been granted adequate access to vote counts in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, both Republican and Democratic election monitors were kept from 13ft to 100ft (4m to 30m) away from tables where votes were being tallied in the city, and local election officials cited coronavirus prevention needs for the distancing. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for unity in victory speeches Ms McEnany also said election officials in that key state had allowed a disproportionate number of Democrats to correct, or ""cure"", inaccurately filled-out ballots. According to the Inquirer, some Pennsylvania counties allowed voters to amend such mistakes, while others did not. Ms McDaniel said they had collected 131 affidavits, or signed legal statements under oath, in Michigan as part of their investigation into alleged election irregularities. ""If the shoe were on the other foot,"" she said, ""if it were this close the other way, if President Trump was in the lead in all these states... the media would be screaming, 'This isn't over'."" Results in last Tuesday's presidential election from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding. In Georgia, where the tally is continuing and Mr Biden leads, its secretary of state hit back on Monday at fellow Republicans who had criticised his handling of the election. The women changing the face of US politics The woman behind biggest surprise in Biden win Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said: ""Was there illegal voting? I am sure there was. And my office is investigating all of it. ""Does it rise to the numbers or margin necessary to change the outcome to where President Trump is, given Georgia's electoral votes? That is unlikely."" Separately, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit on Monday in a Pennsylvania federal court, seeking an emergency injunction to stop state officials from certifying Mr Biden's victory in the state. The state's attorney general, Josh Shapiro, called the lawsuit ""meritless"". Prosecutors in Republican-controlled states meanwhile threw their weight behind the president's challenge to the election results. Ten state attorneys general filed a so-called amicus brief at the US Supreme Court backing the Trump campaign's case in Pennsylvania. States must resolve recounts and court contests over the results by 8 December. The outcome will be finalised when members of the US Electoral College meet on 14 December. Senior members of the president's party have largely refused to pressure Mr Trump to concede. On Monday Senate leader Mitch McConnell criticised Democrats over the matter. ""Let's not have any lectures, no lectures,"" the Kentucky senator said on the floor of the upper chamber, ""about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election and who insinuated that this one would be illegitimate too if they lost again - only if they lost."" He added: ""The president has every right to look into allegations and to request recounts under the law and notably the constitution gives no role in this process to wealthy media corporations."" 8 December:All recounts and certification of results to be completed by states 14 December:Electoral college members meet in state capitals to formally cast their ballots for president and vice president 6 January:Joint session of House of Representatives and Senate to count electoral votes 20 January: New president sworn in Watch the moment BBC projects Biden victory What happens now?

Three men on trial over Barcelona jihadist attack,"The victims of the attacks included people from Australia, Germany, Italy and the US Three men have gone on trial in Spain over two deadly jihadist attacks that killed 16 people and injured 140 in and around Barcelona in 2017. The trio are accused of helping the perpetrators, who were all shot dead by police, carry out the attacks. One of the perpetrators rammed a van into pedestrians in Barcelona's Las Ramblas tourist area, before a twin attack was launched in a nearby town. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attacks. The three defendants appeared, under heavy security, at the high court near Madrid on Tuesday. The Barcelona jihadists and the hunt for a second gang Who were the victims? Written on the trees of the Ramblas Mohamed Houli Chemlal, a 23-year-old Spanish national, and 31-year-old Moroccan national Driss Oukabir are accused of belonging to the jihadist cell that orchestrated the attacks. Another Moroccan national, Ben Iazza, 27, is accused of collaborating with them. All three defendants were seated in a thick glass box, wearing masks, as the trial got under way, an AFP correspondent at the scene reports. The court was shown video footage of cell members - including the van driver Younes Abouyaaqoub - joking around with explosive belts prior to the 2017 attack, the report says. Mr Chemlal and Mr Oukabir face charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, manufacturing and storing explosives, and attempting to cause widespread destruction. Prosecutors are seeking jail terms of 41 and 36 years respectively. The charges relate to an accidental explosion at a house in the small town of Alcanar, which is 200km (124 miles) south of Barcelona, that happened the day before the attacks began. Explosives and gas canisters were stored in the building, and Mr Chemlal later told investigators the cell had been planning attacks ""on an even greater scale"". Butane and propane gas canisters were found at the scene of an explosion in Alcanar The material they were planning to use was destroyed in the blast, police say. The explosion also killed the group's leader, a 44-year-old imam. Mr Oukabir is also accused of renting the van that was used in the Barcelona attack, but his lawyer has said he will seek an acquittal. ""The fact that he hired a van doesn't mean he knew it was going to be used to carry out the attack,"" Luis Alvarez Collado told  AFP news agency last week. Meanwhile, Ben Iazza is accused of collaborating with the jihadist cell and lending them his van and identification documents. Prosecutors are seeking an eight-year sentence for the Moroccan national. Driss Oukabir (left) and Mohamed Houli Chemlal (right), pictured after their arrest in 2017, are accused of belonging to the jihadist cell behind the attacks But they have not charged any of the suspects with direct involvement in the attacks, prompting anger from victim support groups. A lawyer for the victims, Antonio Guerrero, told AFP as he went into court that all three should be in the dock for ""terrorist murder"". The trial is expected to last until 16 December. On 17 August 2017, a rented white van was driven down Barcelona's busy Las Ramblas avenue at high speed. It careered into pedestrians along the packed street which sits at the heart of the city's tourist area. Fourteen people were killed and more than 100 were injured. The victims included people from Australia, Germany, Italy, Portugal and the US. After driving the van, 22-year-old Abouyaaqoub, then abandoned the vehicle and fled the scene on foot. He later hijacked a car and killed the driver. The following day, five members of the jihadist cell drove to Cambrils which is 100km (62 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. The launched a knife attack on the promenade and one woman was killed. All five men were shot dead by police. Abouyaaqoub was also killed by police on 21 August after spending several days on the run. What do we know about the victims? Who was behind the terror attacks on the West?

Mark Baker, who founded the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, said he originally ignored the broadcaster's email. But ITV got back in touch and the show is movingfrom Australia to Gwrych Castle in Abergele, Conwy,this year. It will host celebrities including Sir Mo Farah and Victoria Derbyshire. Mr Baker told the Radio Times: ""It mentioned a major proposal for a television programme, asking me to call urgently. ""But in my job I get loads of strange emails from people claiming to be princes of Egypt with millions of pounds. ""I thought it was one of those, so I just left it."" Gwrych Castle will host I'm A Celebrity.. Get Me Out Of Here! Mr Baker said he had never seen I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! so is not sure how the new site will compare to the old one.

'Inhuman' use of restraint on disabled adults,"Prone restraint, demonstrated here, can result in serious injury - and was used more than 4,000 times in 2019 Every 15 minutes, on average, a patient with learning disabilities was restrained in hospital last year, new BBCFile on 4analysis shows. In 2019, restraint was used just over 38,000 times in England. In 2017, there were 22,000 reports of restraint. Harriet Harman, chairwoman of the House of Commons joint select committee on human rights, said this suggested ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment. The Department of Health said restraint ""should only be used as a last resort"". The data, provided by NHS Digital and analysed by the BBC, also shows the use of prone restraint - or holding people face down - remains high, despite being against government guidelines. Last year, it was used more than 4,000 times. Seclusion - where people are locked in a room on their own - also remains high. In 2019, there were 3,225 reported cases of seclusion, and 850 of those involved children. In the first seven months of this year alone, there were more than 2,000 incidents of seclusion. Restraint is used to manage someone's behaviour when they are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. NHS England says it has ""driven an increase in the reporting of restraint"" and ""lowered the bar"". But not all hospitals and treatment units regularly provide complete data. Ms Harman said the treatment ""was basically a human rights abuse"". ""People are not supposed to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment - and routine solitary confinement and physical restraint is exactly that,"" she said. ""We clearly don't even know the half of it, since many providers of these institutions don't give the information that they should about what's going on."" Dan Scorer, head of policy at learning disability charity Mencap, said prone restraint ""should not be happening in any kind of planned way"" and could result in ""serious injury, and potentially death"". The figures come despite pledges to reduce restraint use, which includes seclusion, after a 2018 File on 4 programme first uncovered numbers of reported restraint had risen by 50% between 2016 and 2017. Bethany has ""massively improved"" since moving to a new community placement The case of autistic 19-year-old Bethany -  whoFile on 4 revealedhad been in seclusion for 21 months - drew a personal apology from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, and prompted the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to investigate the issue of restraint. The CQC's findings,released last month, were described as ""deeply concerning"" by Health Minister Helen Whately. Bethany was kept in a room with just a foam mattress and a chair, and fed through a hatch, at St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton. Last December,she was finally found a place in a specialist unitrun by Merseycare NHS Trust. She said: ""Since I've been here, the staff have been absolutely amazing. My behaviour's settled down and my anger's settled.  And I've not done any self-harming for five or six months."" She now has her own bedroom, plays the piano, goes out for walks and shopping, and is learning circus skills. Andrea Attree and her autistic daughter Dannielle, who has spent more than two years being secluded and segregated in hospitals Dannielle Attree from Kent, who is also autistic, was in the same hospital as Bethany for 19 months, where she spent time in seclusion after first being admitted following a period of poor mental health. Now she's in Littlebrook Hospital, run by Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, where she has been in segregation for nine months. She is sometimes locked in. Dannielle's mum Andrea Attree told File on 4: ""Dannielle doesn't know how to be able to be anywhere but in seclusion now, because it's been going on for so long. ""Her mental health has declined to the lowest I've ever seen. Her self-harm has been off the scale."" The government strategy Transforming Care was launched in 2012 following theWinterbourne View scandal. It set a target to reduce the number of inpatients with learning disabilities in England by at least 35% by March 2019. This target was then moved to March 2020. It wasn't met, and a new target has now been set to move 50% of patients by March 2024. In 2018, there were 2,400 people with learning disabilities and autism in hospital in England. Latest figures show there are still 2,060. Ms Harman said there was a need for a ""sense of urgency"", and that a special unit in the prime minister's office should be established to tackle the issue. The Department for Health and Social Care said a new unit would ""duplicate services"". ""Our priority is always to ensure people with a learning disability and autistic people receive safe and high-quality care, and that they are treated with dignity and respect,"" it added. ""Government policy is that any kind of restraint should only be used as a last resort, and there is active work to reduce use of restrictive practice in mental health settings."" Figures for restraint in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland aren't collated. But there are more than 600 people with learning disabilities and autism in hospital in those three countries. Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust said it agreed with Dannielle and Andrea that ""highly specialist services for people with autism nationally are not where we all want them to be"". It added: ""Our role has been to make sure that whilst we worked with Dannielle and her mum to find the right care setting for her, Dannielle is supported, cared for and cared about in what we all agree was never set up as a long-term placement."" St Andrew's Hospital said Dannielle had made good progress while she was there, that seclusion was only ever used as a last resort, and that guidelines were followed. It added that Bethany had been there ""longer than anyone wanted"", and it had worked with the NHS to transfer her to a community placement as soon as was possible.

McDonald's to introduce plant-based burgers,"Fast food giant McDonald's has announced it will introduce a line of plant-based meat alternatives called ""McPlant"" in 2021. McDonald's said it would offer plant-based burgers, chicken substitutes and breakfast sandwiches. Barclays Bank forecasts that consumption of meat alternatives might be worth $140bn (Â£106bn) by 2029. McDonald's has tested out a plant-based burger in Canada with Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat. However, shares of Beyond Meat plummeted after the announcement by McDonald's as it was not clear who would supply the fast-food chain with the meat alternative. The move towards meat substitutes has been driven primarily by concerns over meat's effects on health, the environment and animal welfare.

Beyond Meat insists it is still involved. ""Beyond Meat and McDonald's co-created the plant-based patty which will be available as part of their McPlant platform,"" the company said.

"'Inhuman' use of restraint on disabled adultsEvery 15 minutes, an inpatient with learning disabilities is restrained, new data shows.UK","Prone restraint, demonstrated here, can result in serious injury - and was used more than 4,000 times in 2019 Every 15 minutes, on average, a patient with learning disabilities was restrained in hospital last year, new BBCFile on 4analysis shows. In 2019, restraint was used just over 38,000 times in England. In 2017, there were 22,000 reports of restraint. Harriet Harman, chairwoman of the House of Commons joint select committee on human rights, said this suggested ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment. The Department of Health said restraint ""should only be used as a last resort"". The data, provided by NHS Digital and analysed by the BBC, also shows the use of prone restraint - or holding people face down - remains high, despite being against government guidelines. Last year, it was used more than 4,000 times. Seclusion - where people are locked in a room on their own - also remains high. In 2019, there were 3,225 reported cases of seclusion, and 850 of those involved children. In the first seven months of this year alone, there were more than 2,000 incidents of seclusion. Restraint is used to manage someone's behaviour when they are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. NHS England says it has ""driven an increase in the reporting of restraint"" and ""lowered the bar"". But not all hospitals and treatment units regularly provide complete data. Ms Harman said the treatment ""was basically a human rights abuse"". ""People are not supposed to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment - and routine solitary confinement and physical restraint is exactly that,"" she said. ""We clearly don't even know the half of it, since many providers of these institutions don't give the information that they should about what's going on."" Dan Scorer, head of policy at learning disability charity Mencap, said prone restraint ""should not be happening in any kind of planned way"" and could result in ""serious injury, and potentially death"".

Election court fight just began - Trump camp,"This video can not be played Mitch McConnell: 'Trump 100% within rights to look into election irregularities' US attorney general William Barr has allowed federal prosecutors to probe alleged irregularities in the presidential election, prompting a top justice department official to quit. The official, Richard Pilger, would have overseen such investigations. Any such cases would normally be the remit of individual states, but Mr Barr said this was not a hard and fast rule. Donald Trump refuses to accept Joe Biden's projected victory, and has made unsubstantiated fraud claims. The president's campaign is seeking an emergency injunction in Pennsylvania to prevent Mr Biden's victory being certified in the state. The president-elect's projected win there on Saturday took him over the threshold of 270 electoral college votes needed to secure victory nationwide. What happens now? Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is US first lady-designate Jill Biden? The attorney general wrote that inquiries could be made by federal prosecutors,external""if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State"". Mr Barr warned against investigating ""fanciful"" claims Mr Barr said prosecutors should only look into ""substantial allegations"" of irregularities. He acknowledged that individual states had the primary responsibility for the conduct of elections but said the justice department had ""an obligation to ensure that federal elections are conducted in such a way that the American people can have full confidence in their electoral process and their government"". The department would normally only go beyond preliminary investigations after an election had been concluded and the results certified, but Mr Barr said this could result in situations where ""misconduct cannot realistically be rectified"". Mr Pilger said he had quit in response to Mr Barr's memo. ""Having familiarised myself with the new policy and its ramifications... I must regretfully resign from my role,"" he wrote in an email to colleagues. Mr Pilger became head of the department's Election Crimes Branch in 2010. This branch, and Mr Pilger himself, were previously in the public eye at the time of a row about extra scrutiny of political groups seeking tax exemption. He was reported to have had discussions about the issue with Lois Lerner,the tax official at the centre of the row. Bill Barr's memorandum authorising federal election fraud investigations is yet another example of the attorney general's skill at pleasing his boss, the president, while dancing on the edge of propriety within the justice department he runs. The document gives Donald Trump what he wants - proof that the government is looking into unproven claims of widespread electoral illegalities in several states he lost by tens of thousands of votes. The attorney general, however, couches the memo with conditions and cautions that prosecutors only focus on specific ""irregularities"" and avoid pursuing ""specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims"". Despite all the caveats, Mr Barr's memo will provide fodder to Trump and his supporters, who insist that the election was stolen from them (never mind that other Republican candidates had fairly successful results). As the protest resignation of the head of the justice department's election crimes department indicates, this is the equivalent of pulling the pin from a political hand grenade. It may not go off immediately, but the device is one step closer to exploding - thrown on purpose or accidentally dropped. There are safeguards in place to prevent political meddling in criminal investigations, particularly around elections. Some of those safeguards have now been removed. Since media projected on Saturday that Mr Biden had won the critical state of Pennsylvania, accumulating enough votes to claim the White House, the president-elect has forged ahead with his plans to take the reins of power. Biden tells Americans: I implore you, wear a mask Election results in maps and charts Mr Trump took to Twitter again on Monday to dispute the outcome, making unsubstantiated claims of ""unthinkable and illegal"" activity in the vote. The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages federal agencies, has held off on allowing Biden aides to formally begin the transition, saying no ""ascertainment"" on an election winner had yet been made. The GSA is tasked with formally recognising the president-elect, and providing the funds and access to federal agencies that Mr Biden's transition team needs. In previous elections it has mostly acted promptly after the winner was declared, with the exception of the disputed election in 2000 when it waited until a Supreme Court ruling decided the result on 14 December. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, says the Biden team is considering its legal options if the Trump administration continues to stall the handover. White House reporters have been saying that despite his objections, Mr Trump is expected to leave office begrudgingly in January and is already talking about running for the White House again in 2024. Mr Trump's spokeswoman vowed the legal battle to contest Mr Biden's victory was only just beginning. ""This election is not over,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a news conference on Monday. ""Far from it."" Ms McEnany and Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel cited allegations of electoral corruption, while urging reporters to help investigate the unverified claims. Conservative channel Fox News cut away from the event, citing the lack of evidence. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" ""Whoa, whoa, whoa,"" said presenter Neil Cavuto. ""Unless she [Ms McEnany] has more details to back that up, I can't in good countenance continue to show you this."" Ms McEnany told reporters: ""We have only begun the process of obtaining an accurate, honest vote count."" Five viral vote claims fact-checked Donald Trump's speech fact-checked Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud? She said Republican poll watchers had not been granted adequate access to vote counts in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, both Republican and Democratic election monitors were kept from 13ft to 100ft (4m to 30m) away from tables where votes were being tallied in the city, and local election officials cited coronavirus prevention needs for the distancing. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for unity in victory speeches Ms McEnany also said election officials in that key state had allowed a disproportionate number of Democrats to correct, or ""cure"", inaccurately filled-out ballots. According to the Inquirer, some Pennsylvania counties allowed voters to amend such mistakes, while others did not. Ms McDaniel said they had collected 131 affidavits, or signed legal statements under oath, in Michigan as part of their investigation into alleged election irregularities. ""If the shoe were on the other foot,"" she said, ""if it were this close the other way, if President Trump was in the lead in all these states... the media would be screaming, 'This isn't over'."" Results in last Tuesday's presidential election from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding. In Georgia, where the tally is continuing and Mr Biden leads, its secretary of state hit back on Monday at fellow Republicans who had criticised his handling of the election. The women changing the face of US politics The woman behind biggest surprise in Biden win Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said: ""Was there illegal voting? I am sure there was. And my office is investigating all of it. ""Does it rise to the numbers or margin necessary to change the outcome to where President Trump is, given Georgia's electoral votes? That is unlikely."" Separately, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit on Monday in a Pennsylvania federal court, seeking an emergency injunction to stop state officials from certifying Mr Biden's victory in the state. The state's attorney general, Josh Shapiro, called the lawsuit ""meritless"". Prosecutors in Republican-controlled states meanwhile threw their weight behind the president's challenge to the election results. Ten state attorneys general filed a so-called amicus brief at the US Supreme Court backing the Trump campaign's case in Pennsylvania. States must resolve recounts and court contests over the results by 8 December. The outcome will be finalised when members of the US Electoral College meet on 14 December. Senior members of the president's party have largely refused to pressure Mr Trump to concede. On Monday Senate leader Mitch McConnell criticised Democrats over the matter. ""Let's not have any lectures, no lectures,"" the Kentucky senator said on the floor of the upper chamber, ""about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election and who insinuated that this one would be illegitimate too if they lost again - only if they lost."" He added: ""The president has every right to look into allegations and to request recounts under the law and notably the constitution gives no role in this process to wealthy media corporations."" 8 December:All recounts and certification of results to be completed by states 14 December:Electoral college members meet in state capitals to formally cast their ballots for president and vice president 6 January:Joint session of House of Representatives and Senate to count electoral votes 20 January: New president sworn in Watch the moment BBC projects Biden victory What happens now?

Scotland's Covid restriction levels to be reviewed,"This video can not be played The first minister says a sharp rise in case numbers has driven the move to Level 3 in three council areas Three Scottish council areas are to have tougher coronavirus rules imposed amid concern over an increase in cases. Fife, Angus and Perth and Kinross will all be moved from level two to level three of Scotland's five-tier system. It means pubs and restaurants in those areas will no longer be allowed to serve alcohol. But up to six people from two households in Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles will be able to meet inside their homes from Friday. Ms Sturgeon said this was possible because cases in the islands were ""very low and sporadic"", but warned that people who have travelled from the mainland should avoid in-house mixing for a time to limit the risk of importing the virus. Has your area changed its Covid alert level? Live reaction to the announcement The existing restrictions in all of the country's other local authority areas will remain unchanged for now - although some level three areas are continuing to see rapid increases in cases and will be closely monitored. Ms Sturgeon said the ""necessary and precautionary"" decision to move Fife, Perth and Kinross and Angus to level three from Friday was taken because cases in all three areas were on a ""sharply rising trajectory"". The most recent data shows that, in the space of a week, the number of cases per 100,000 of the population has increased by 32% in Perth and Kinross, by 40% in Fife, and by 47% in Angus. Medical experts had strongly recommended the move to level three as it was felt that level two may not be enough to reverse increases of that magnitude. The first minister said: ""I know this will be disappointing to residents and businesses in these areas. ""However, by acting now, we can hopefully prevent an even more serious deterioration in the situation."" Councillors David Alexander and David Ross, the co-Leaders of Fife Council, said the decision was not what they had been hoping for, but had been ""based on the facts"". But Dean Banks, director and chef at The Haar restaurant in St Andrews, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that the ban on alcohol sales meant he might have to shut his business again. The former Masterchef finalist said dozens of customers had already cancelled their bookings for the weekend, adding: ""We're not sure what's going on. One week we've had alcohol sales, we've boosted revenue again, and taking that away again just rips us in half. ""People are cancelling their tables, they don't want to come or they want to leave it until later date to enjoy it with a glass of wine. ""How does Covid-19 know if someone's drinking a cup of coffee or a glass of wine? What is the difference there? I don't really understand what the difference is."" Pubs and restaurants in Fife, Angus and Perth and Kinross will no longer be able to serve alcohol Alan Mitchell, the chief executive of Fife Chamber of Commerce, described the decision as ""a bitter pill to swallow"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, a Fife MSP, said it was ""disappointing"" that the first minister was unable to say what had caused the spread of the virus there. He added: ""The testing and tracing team don't seem to have that information for Fife. It is important as we need to understand what has gone wrong. ""It is also disappointing that the government did not use the time we had in the summer better to get on top of the virus, to stop it rising with massive increases in testing and with much faster tracing - hunting it down to wipe it out."" Perth and Kinross Council chief executive Karen Reid said she was disappointed by its move to level three, which she said would have a major impact of many people's lives both during the restrictions and in the aftermath. Level 3- Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, Perth & Kinross, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian. Level 2- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll & Bute, Borders, Dumfries & Galloway. Level 1 -Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles. There are currently no areas of Scotland under the most severe level four restrictions - which would be broadly similar to the national lockdown currently in place across England. But officials are concerned about a sharp rise in cases in Stirling and Inverclyde, and to a lesser extent South Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - which are all already in level three. Their advice has been that moving any of those areas to level four would not currently be merited - but the data will be monitored closely on a daily basis. Ms Sturgeon warned: ""Given the severity of the level four restrictions, we will not take a decision to move any part of the country to that level lightly. ""But nor will we shy away from it if we think it necessary to limit the damage the virus can do, or if we think a short period at level four may be less harmful overall than a prolonged period at level three. ""These are difficult decisions and the week ahead is a particularly crucial juncture."" She also said the number of cases appeared to have stabilised but was remaining ""stubbornly high"" in Glasgow, North and South Lanarkshire, West Lothian and West Dunbartonshire. The difficult question was therefore whether more time at level three will start to reduce cases there, or whether more action will be required. However, the first minister stressed that there were encouraging signs in several other level three areas, which could potentially see them being downgraded to level two if that trend continues. These include East Lothian, Edinburgh, Clackmannanshire, East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Midlothian and North and East Ayrshire. Ms Sturgeon said travel restrictions continued to be ""essential"" but would remain as guidance over the next week rather than being put into law as she has been considering doing. Opposition parties have called for greater transparency about the decision-making process, with Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard saying the announcement ""raises more questions"" about what it would take for areas to move down a level. Mr Leonard added: ""All the evidence must be shared and it must be persuasive"". The Federation of Small Businesses said the announcement of tougher restrictions in Fife, Perth and Kinross and Angus would cause heartache for many employers, and urged the Scottish government not to move any areas to level four ahead of the crucial Christmas period.

Ten-fold increase in patients waiting for treatment,"This video can not be played Llandudno woman still waiting for surgery after 19 months At least 49,000 patients in Wales had been waiting for more than a year for NHS treatment in September, according to new figures. For six out of the seven health boards, the figures also show at least half of those were awaiting surgery. It represents a 10-fold increase for all treatments compared to September 2019. The Welsh Government said ""difficult decisions"" were made to cancel surgery due to the coronavirus pandemic. Routine surgery lists have increased six-fold Covid cancer delays 'could cause 2,000 deaths' Covid hotspot ICU staff 'broken' by deaths The figures, obtained by BBC Wales Investigates under the Freedom of Information Act, showed there were more than 18,000 people waiting for any kind of treatment at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. That is double the number at the Swansea Bay and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boards, which both had 9,000 patients waiting. Swansea Bay had the most waiting for surgery - 7,801 - with Betsi Cadwaladr just behind on 7,620. Figures for the Cardiff and Vale health board have not been included as its data is not comparable. Gaye Moran has been left in a lot of pain Former B&B owner Gaye Moran, 74, from Llandudno has been waiting for vascular and hip surgery for more than 19 months. She said she was placed on the ""priority list"" for both a hip and a vascular operation in March 2019, after problems with a previous hip operation caused her a lot of pain. She was ready for surgery just as the pandemic struck. ""It's despairing me,"" she said. ""I can't just put it to one side and leave it because it's there all the time, I can't get away from it, and you just think 'oh please give me a date for an operation'."" Ms Moran said she had great admiration for the job the NHS was doing, but not knowing when her operations may happen, and news that waiting list backlogs may take years to clear, were leaving her anxious. ""This lockdown doesn't help because you dwell on things,"" she added. ""As soon as Covid is done, we need to show the same type of impetus with backlogs as we have with the Nightingale hospitals and pandemic response."" Ms Moran is now one of 7,620 people who have been waiting more than a year in the Betsi Cadwaladr area. The health board said elective surgery capacity was currently at about 60%, but pain management services were considered ""essential"" and had been maintained. Its acting deputy chief executive, Teresa Owen, said she ""fully recognised"" it was a worrying time for those waiting for treatment. ""In the short term, we are looking at performing more outpatient appointments and theatres activity over the evenings and weekends,"" she said. ""We are also working to introduce modular buildings away from acute hospital sites, from which diagnostic tests, endoscopies and day case surgery can be performed."" Vaughan Gething accepted ""poorer outcomes"" would result from the decisions made Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there were ""no easy choices"" in dealing with both the pandemic and other NHS services. ""Because the choices we've made, it's undoubtedly the case we'll see poorer outcomes and that does mean more people having avoidable disability, more people potentially losing their lives with non-Covid care,"" he said. ""But if we did nothing, we know that in the middle of March, we could have been like northern Italy was... the health service was overrun, we wouldn't have been able to expand that critical care capacity."" Senedd Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""Regrettably, waiting list targets were being missed before the pandemic started with the Welsh Labour-led government consistently letting down patients. ""Coronavirus has led to NHS waiting lists growing longer but the pandemic has only put a spotlight on how bad things were before, and all we get from Labour's health minister is excuses.""

Decision due on Wales A-level and GCSE exams,"Some pupils have faced more disruption than others due to self-isolating A decision on whether GCSE and A-level exams will go ahead next summer will be announced later. There have already been strong indications that GCSE exams will be replaced by grades based on coursework and assessments. Two recent sets of recommendationsto Education Minister Kirsty Williams said either all or some exams at A-level should also be cancelled. It comes amid ongoing disruption to schools as a result of coronavirus. Schools need 'urgent clarity' over 2021 exams 'Scrap exams for 2021 after Covid disruption' 'I don't want exams to go ahead next year' There is also concernsome pupils have faced more disruption than others. Plaid Cymru called for a decision to be made quickly to remove anxiety. Courses have already been modified because of the learning time lost over the summer term. But since schools returned full-time in September, many pupils have had to self-isolate for a fortnight or more because of positive cases of Covid-19 in their ""bubble"". Public Health Wales figures show82% of secondary schools have registered at least one case since September. This video can not be played ""Three years of GCSEs has come down to nothing"" This year's exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March, but the system of awarding ""standardised"" grades descended into chaos. Ultimately thegrades decided by schools and colleges were awarded. Decisions on exams have already been announced elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, National 5 exams - the equivalent to GCSEs - have been replaced by coursework and teacher assessments but Highers will go ahead. Exams are still scheduled in England and Northern Ireland but they will be held later in the summer. In its advice to Wales' education minister, regulator Qualifications Wales saidthere should be no GCSE exams this summer, with grades for both GCSE and AS-levels based on coursework and assessments set and marked by the exam board WJEC. At A-level, it recommended one timetabled exam per subject, with a second opportunity for pupils to sit if they were self-isolating. Coursework and set tasks would also be taken into account. A separate report by an expert panel said all exams should be axed, with grades based on nationally agreed assessments done in schools and colleges. Cerys Harris has had to study at home while self-isolating for a total of four weeks since September Seventeen-year-old A-level student Cerys Harris from Rhyl has had to self-isolate for four weeks in total since September. She lives with three family members who have been furloughed, so it has been ""hard to find space around the house"". While under normal circumstances she would like to sit her exams, she thinks it would be best to cancel them because of the disruption. ""It's been really worrying. It will be good to know what the decision is,"" she said. ""We've been told to think about our Ucas [university application] forms. It's hard to make a decision for the rest of your life not knowing if you're even sitting the exam."" Year 13 A-level student Jonathon Dawes, who studies at Coleg Cambria in Rhyl, said there was now ""a disparity between so many young people."" ""Some of my friends have been in every day, others have had to self-isolate for four weeks, sit at home and do virtual learning, it's put them behind on their classmates. ""If all the four nations do take different routes, ultimately it will leave young people advantaged and disadvantaged when moving on and applying for jobs,"" he said. The NASUWT teaching union agrees exams cannot go ahead as normal for safety, but it is worried aboutthe potential for a ""massive increase"" in teacher workload. Its national official for Wales Neil Butler said there was a lot of work to be done in a short space of time and it would be ""highly inappropriate"" and ""unfair and unwise""to place an extra burden on schools. ""Schools at the moment are having to work in extraordinary conditions, and they're struggling with that,"" he said. ""[It] must be done by the exam board and Qualifications Wales."" Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders in Wales said exams could not go ahead as in 2019. ""We feel there is certainly merit in having a distinctive approach for Wales which recognises the expertise of our teachers. ""What we need is a B grade in a school in Llandudno needs to be the same as a B grade in Swansea - now that is not the job of individual teachers in those schools, that is the job of the regulator,"" she said. Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said a decision should be made quickly. ""The longer this is dragged out, the more uncertainty it brings to our learners, most of whom have already had a disrupted educational year, and many of whom are still experiencing the anxiety that comes from living through a global pandemic,"" she said.

China Covid vaccine trial halted in Brazil,"China's Sinovac vaccine has been administered in late-stage trials in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey President Jair Bolsonaro has declared the suspension of a Brazilian trial for a Chinese covid vaccine as a ""victory"". The trial was halted after a ""severe adverse incident"" - reported to be the death of a volunteer. Brazilian health regulator Anvisa said the incident had taken place on 29 October but gave no further details. However the head of the institute conducting the trials has told local media the person's death was not linked to the medical trial itself. President Bolsonaro has long criticised the vaccine because of its Chinese links and said it would not be purchased by his country. He has also engaged in a political fight with the governor of SÃ£o Paulo, Joao Doria, who has publicly backed the trial. Writing on Facebook, the president said the halt of the CoronaVac trial was ""another victory for Jair Bolsonaro"". The vaccine, developed by Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, is one of several in final-stage testing globally. Sinovac says it is ""confident in the safety of the vaccine"". The firm has already been using it to immunise thousands of people at home in an emergency use programme. Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by coronavirus, recording more than 5.6m confirmed cases - the third highest tally in the world after the US and India - and nearly 163,000 deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. On Monday Anvisa said it had ""ruled to interrupt the clinical trial of the CoronaVac vaccine after a serious adverse incident"". It did not reveal what had happened, nor where it had taken place. Late-stage trials for the Sinovac vaccine are also being conducted in Indonesia and Turkey, but neither of these countries have announced a suspension. Indonesia's state-owned Bio Farma said on Tuesday that its own Sinovac vaccine trials were ""going smoothly"", according to Reuters news agency. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? Dimas Covas, head of the Butantan institute conducting the trials, told local media that the trial's suspension was related to a death, but insisted that the death was not linked to the vaccine. This was backed up by Jean Gorinchteyn, Health Secretary for the state of SÃ£o Paulo, who told a news conference that the death was an ""external event"" that was not related to the vaccine. Mr Covas said that there had been no adverse reactions to the vaccine. ""We found this Anvisa decision strange, because it is unrelated to the vaccine. There are more than 10,000 volunteers at this moment,"" Mr Covas told TV Cultura. He said the suspension had caused ""indignation"" and that the organisers of the trials had not been consulted. In a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Covas said he hoped trials would resume soon. Sinovac said on Tuesday that it was communicating with Brazil about the reported incident. ""We learned the head of Butantan Institute believed that this serious adverse event [SAE] is not related to the vaccine,"" it said in a statement. ""The clinical study in Brazil is strictly carried out in accordance with GCP [Good Clinical Practice] requirements and we are confident in the safety of the vaccine."" A pause in a clinical trial is not unusual. In September, the UK paused trials for another Covid-19 vaccine after a participant had a suspected adverse reaction. The trials for the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University were resumed a few dayslater after regulators said it was safe to continue. Brazil's president has been open about his preference for the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca, saying his government would not buy a Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccine. Is the decision by Anvisa based on science or politics? That's the question many people are asking here because the issue of the vaccine - indeed, Covid-19 itself - is deeply political in Brazil. From the very start, Jair Bolsonaro played down the virus, insisting the country remain open, that coronavirus was just the sniffles. But that approach was at odds with many of the country's regional leaders - even people he used to count as friends. JoÃ£o Doria is the governor of Brazil's most populous (and wealthy) state. In 2018, he backed Mr Bolsonaro to become president. But the two men have since fallen out - badly. When Covid-19 hit, Mr Doria led the way among state governors in introducing quarantine, advising people to stay at home. And that irritated Mr Bolsonaro. The governor's backing of the Sinovac vaccine has also grated. But it's a rivalry that won't be going away any time soon. Mr Doria is expected to throw his hat in the ring for the 2022 elections too - which is why, perhaps, Mr Bolsonaro is feeling a little bit competitive. CoronaVac is one of around a dozen vaccines in the final stage of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - around the world. This is a crucial point in vaccine development, where some experimental vaccines will fail. The news of its suspension in Brazil came shortly after a rival vaccine developer,the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer, said its own vaccine candidate had shown 90% effectiveness. Last month the Oxford vaccine trialreviewed the death of a volunteer in Brazil, saying an assessment had revealed no safety concerns. Separate to the phase 3 trials being held overseas, China is also administering experimental Covid-19 vaccines at home. CoronaVac is among three experimental coronavirus vaccines China has been using to inoculate hundreds of thousands of people under an emergency use programme. This video can not be played The BBC filmed hundreds of people queuing in Yiwu, China to get the experimental Sinovac vaccine last month Sinovac has previously said almost all of its employees and their families have received the vaccine. And a Chinese health official earlier said that serious side effects have not been observed in clinical trials. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people?

Three men face trial over Barcelona terror attacks,"The victims of the attacks included people from Australia, Germany, Italy and the US Three men have gone on trial in Spain over two deadly jihadist attacks that killed 16 people and injured 140 in and around Barcelona in 2017. The trio are accused of helping the perpetrators, who were all shot dead by police, carry out the attacks. One of the perpetrators rammed a van into pedestrians in Barcelona's Las Ramblas tourist area, before a twin attack was launched in a nearby town. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attacks. The three defendants appeared, under heavy security, at the high court near Madrid on Tuesday. The Barcelona jihadists and the hunt for a second gang Who were the victims? Written on the trees of the Ramblas Mohamed Houli Chemlal, a 23-year-old Spanish national, and 31-year-old Moroccan national Driss Oukabir are accused of belonging to the jihadist cell that orchestrated the attacks. Another Moroccan national, Ben Iazza, 27, is accused of collaborating with them. All three defendants were seated in a thick glass box, wearing masks, as the trial got under way, an AFP correspondent at the scene reports. The court was shown video footage of cell members - including the van driver Younes Abouyaaqoub - joking around with explosive belts prior to the 2017 attack, the report says. Mr Chemlal and Mr Oukabir face charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, manufacturing and storing explosives, and attempting to cause widespread destruction. Prosecutors are seeking jail terms of 41 and 36 years respectively. The charges relate to an accidental explosion at a house in the small town of Alcanar, which is 200km (124 miles) south of Barcelona, that happened the day before the attacks began. Explosives and gas canisters were stored in the building, and Mr Chemlal later told investigators the cell had been planning attacks ""on an even greater scale"". Butane and propane gas canisters were found at the scene of an explosion in Alcanar The material they were planning to use was destroyed in the blast, police say. The explosion also killed the group's leader, a 44-year-old imam. Mr Oukabir is also accused of renting the van that was used in the Barcelona attack, but his lawyer has said he will seek an acquittal. ""The fact that he hired a van doesn't mean he knew it was going to be used to carry out the attack,"" Luis Alvarez Collado told  AFP news agency last week. Meanwhile, Ben Iazza is accused of collaborating with the jihadist cell and lending them his van and identification documents. Prosecutors are seeking an eight-year sentence for the Moroccan national. Driss Oukabir (left) and Mohamed Houli Chemlal (right), pictured after their arrest in 2017, are accused of belonging to the jihadist cell behind the attacks But they have not charged any of the suspects with direct involvement in the attacks, prompting anger from victim support groups. A lawyer for the victims, Antonio Guerrero, told AFP as he went into court that all three should be in the dock for ""terrorist murder"". The trial is expected to last until 16 December. On 17 August 2017, a rented white van was driven down Barcelona's busy Las Ramblas avenue at high speed. It careered into pedestrians along the packed street which sits at the heart of the city's tourist area. Fourteen people were killed and more than 100 were injured. The victims included people from Australia, Germany, Italy, Portugal and the US. After driving the van, 22-year-old Abouyaaqoub, then abandoned the vehicle and fled the scene on foot. He later hijacked a car and killed the driver. The following day, five members of the jihadist cell drove to Cambrils which is 100km (62 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. The launched a knife attack on the promenade and one woman was killed. All five men were shot dead by police. Abouyaaqoub was also killed by police on 21 August after spending several days on the run. What do we know about the victims? Who was behind the terror attacks on the West?

NI Executive meeting again over Covid restrictions,"The current coronavirus restrictions are due to end at midnight on Thursday Proposals from the health minister to extend coronavirus restrictions in NI for two more weeks have been blocked after an executive vote. Advice from Robin Swann's officials recommended keeping the measures in place until 27 November. The DUP opposed the move, and triggered a cross-community vote to effectively veto the proposals. The current restrictions are due to end at midnight on Thursday. The hospitality sector is waiting to find outwhether it can resume trading on Friday after a four-week shutdown. It comes after theDepartment of Health,externalannounced a further 11 coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland on Tuesday and 514 more positive cases. Ministers are currently considering alternative proposals from DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds. The talks began shortly after 18:00 GMT and still had not concluded after 23:00, as ministers wrangled over a plan. Mrs Dodds's paper suggests close-contact services such as hair and beauty salons can reopen on Friday, by appointment. It also proposes allowing unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops to reopen on Friday, but licensed restaurants would remain closed until 27 November. It is also understood that a ""safely open group"" could be established if ministers agree the plans, that would cover hospitality. BBC News NI understands that Mrs Dodds's paper also stresses the need for increased visibility of police and environmental health officers to manage enforcement. The minister has previously said she did not want the restrictions to be extended, as it could further damage the economy. It is understood she still holds this view, but recognises that the executive must agree a ""general consensus"". And so the wait for business owners and employees alike goes on, almost a week since health officials first recommended that the restrictions should be extended. There was a distinct sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu emerging tonight, as attempts for the executive to meet were pushed back repeatedly while the parties tried to work out a plan they could feasibly sign up to. DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster was facing much internal pressure not to bow to calls to extend the measures, despite the health advice. It's understood the DUP's use of the cross-community veto did not go down well with the Alliance minister Naomi Long, who is excluded from such votes as her party is neither unionist nor nationalist. Now that the DUP has managed to bring its own proposals to the executive, it may feel that provides its ministers with some political cover to stand over decisions which may end up being made tonight. However, nothing is over the line yet. Some businesses may feel the decisions are coming too late, with many unable to prepare for opening with two days' notice, even if they get the green light. Others will also wonder about the executive's messaging - easing some restrictions at a time when doctors have been calling for ""breathing space"", to keep the rate of infection as low as possible in the run-up to Christmas. A number of DUP backbench MLAs have previously vocally opposed the coronavirus regulations agreed by the power-sharing executive, which the DUP jointly leads with Sinn FÃ©in. Earlier, the executive was accused by DUP MLA Paul Frew of ""letting businesses down by the hour"" by delaying a decision on extending coronavirus restrictions. Hair and beauty salons had to shut for four weeks on 16 October Mr Frew, who has openly criticised his party's decision-making on the coronavirus regulations before, told the assembly on Tuesday that the delay in announcing a decision was ""unbelievable"". ""This is a tremendously harsh time for businesses and yet this executive is causing an act of vandalism to those businesses,"" he said during a debate on the Budget Bill. ""It is a shameful position to be in. ""It is an act of vandalism to not be able to tell a business on the Tuesday that they can open up for sure on the Friday, that they can fill up their fridge, bring in their stock and pay their supply line - it's no way to run a business and no way to run an executive. ""It's an absolute farce we are letting so many people down, who just want to earn a decent living and who provide so much."" Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said he believed the DUP had been ""too strident,"" by suggesting the restrictions would not remain in place longer than four weeks. ""Arlene (Foster) put herself on a hook by saying at an early stage that these restrictions would come to an end before progress was made,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. ""Good progress is being made, but from our point of view it would be reckless now to throw it all away."" He said there was a case to be made for reopening hair and beauty salons, but that restrictions on hospitality should remain in place for another fortnight, as health officials initially recommended. Hair and beauty salons closed on Friday 16 October - it is thought they could reopen with some mitigations Alison Canney, owner of the Spaghetti Junction restaurant in Londonderry, said they are undecided whether they would reopen at all if a limit or a ban is placed on alcohol sales. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, the Derry business owner said: ""It is doable but is it the same? I don't think so. ""People come out to relax and unwind. It's an experience. It's not like alcohol is essential, but people like a glass of wine with an Italian meal."" Hair and beauty salons have also been closed since 16 October. Beautician Carolyn McCauley said First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill needed to ""put on their big girl pants and make decisions"". ""At this stage, it's simply not good enough,"" she said. ""They've had four weeks to make these decisions and now here we are, at the 11th hour, and there's still no decision."" Michael Cafolla, who runs a large cafe in Newtownards, County Down, called on the executive to ""consult with people on the coal face of this industry, look at the evidence and make sure that the evidence backs up the decisions that are made"". Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said there had been ""no direction, leadership or consistent messaging"" for businesses. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party supports extending all of the restrictions for an extra fortnight, to reduce the possibility of further interventions before Christmas. ""We need to look beyond short-term decision making and ensure we achieve a safe Christmas by driving down Covid-19 now,"" he said. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said the executive ""absolutely does need"" to take a decision on Tuesday. ""It would be wrong if the clock was allowed to run down on this and we saw the restrictions almost disappearing by default,"" he said.

How lockdown created 'perfect storm' for domestic abuse,"This video can not be played Alannah left her abusive relationship in London in 2013 ""Stay at home"" was at the core of public health advice in tackling Covid-19, the world over. But home is not a place of safety for all. Domestic violence and abuse is at a 15-year high in Northern Ireland, with more than 32,000 incidents reported to the PSNI from June 2019 to July 2020. Restrictions to reduce the spread of Covid-19 have forced people to spend much more time at home and created the ""perfect storm"" for abusers. BBC NI Spotlight went behind the scenes at Foyle Women's Aid to find out what it's like for some of those offering help to women and families in danger. At the time we started filming, the tree-lined avenue to one of their refuges was paved with a blaze of autumnal yellow and red leaves. The magnificent scene appeared in sharp contrast to the trauma that makes it necessary for women and children to take sanctuary in the refuge carefully protected by security gates. ""Nobody wants to be in a refuge and we would rather we weren't here but if somebody comes here, they are very well taken care of,"" says Marie Brown, chief executive of Foyle Women's Aid. Calls to the organisationincreased by 25% during the lockdown in the Spring, reflecting a trend across the UK, and Marie Brown believes that the current further restrictions will bring another surge. ""I do believe that we'll have a spike even in women contacting us. We're heading into Christmas. Christmas is not a good time for domestic violence."" The National Domestic Abuse Helpline can be contacted online as well as by phone The pandemic heralded huge changes in how everyone works in the centre. Roisin Hamill, the manager of the onsite creche, finds one of the new regulations particularly difficult when dealing with families as part of their outreach programme. ""When you're out delivering packs to families, you know they've been isolated at home for so long and that look on their face seeing somebody for the first time and you can't go and give them a hug - that's really difficult for us. ""We do explain to children and we explain to mummies that this will be a socially-distanced visit, it isn't our 'normal' and we can't wait to see you back again and we can't wait to give you that big hug."" The centre is more than a refuge. Those dealing with the aftermath of an abusive relationship can also avail of support courses run by the organisation. Alannah suffered abuse in a former relationship in London, which she broke free from in 2013. She undertook a group course on the recommendation of a counsellor. ""There's a stereotype around what it means to be a victim of abuse,"" she tells Spotlight. ""Growing up, I would always have said: 'Sure I wouldn't stay with somebody, sure if they lifted their hand to you, why would you stay? What kind of woman would stay? It's stupid.' And it was only after my own experience that I realised it's not about why women stay. ""Quite often they are staying because they believe they can fix that broken person because people who perpetrate abuse, they're very clever, they're very manipulative."" Alannah says that it took her time to realise that she needed to break free from the man who was doing harm to her. ""The first few times that there was physical violence, I was very concerned - obviously - for my own well-being but these people are manipulative, I was more concerned for his well-being. And that's just crazy to think that, but you do. You end up feeling sorry for that person. ""Only when I genuinely thought that I could die, and I imagined my family, and the impact that would have on them, that for me was the last straw and that was the moment that I realised I had to leave and that I couldn't fix that person."" Back in one of Foyle Women's Aid offices, Margaret Patterson, a referral co-ordinator, is rarely off the phone. ""Some people want to tell you their whole story, some people don't want to tell you their story. And some people need encouragement just to get the basic information. We've had people who phoned who wouldn't even tell us their names. They just want someone to talk to."" Margaret takes the initial calls from women and then a support worker is assigned to them. But Covid-19 restrictions have also made it more difficult for support workers, like Marie Crossan, to meet service-users and, in particular, to check in with those who may still be living in the same home as their abusers. ""You know your clients, you know if there's clients still in that relationship and you know that it's going to be particularly difficult to get speaking to them. ""You have to rely on them getting out for five minutes and giving you a call. ""Maybe their partner is off work so things are quite intense because the kids are at home. Women are trying to protect the kids and trying to keep things calm at home."" Alannah says she, along with many others, is testament to the fact that there is life after an abusive relationship. ""I genuinely didn't believe that I would ever be in a long-term relationship again. ""So then actually meeting my partner and becoming involved in a loving, healthy relationship, it was at the beginning and it still is - it amazes me some days just how nice life can be. ""Someone asked me one time, they asked me what did it feel like to be free? And I thought, 'well I don't know'. At that point I didn't really feel like I was. ""I was getting there but freedom doesn't happen when you leave the relationship. It's not this miraculous thing that people sometimes expect, 'oh she's left him now she should be happy'. ""That battle will rage in your head for a long time after you've left. Overcoming those battles is not an easy thing - but you can."" In Northern Ireland, a domestic abuse call is made to the PSNI on average every 17 minutes. Resources like housing, aid and legislation are among a raft of measures that deal with the aftermath of domestic abuse but preventing it, is for Alannah, something that needs to start in the home. ""I have a boy and a girl. Raising your daughter to be aware of it and to recognise red flags and leave and speak out - and that's one thing but if everybody just teaches their daughters to leave, we're not handling the problem, we need to teach our sons as well. ""We need to instil in them the values and the importance of respecting women and respecting themselves and opening up if they are struggling.""

"'Inhuman' use of restraint on disabled adultsEvery 15 minutes, an inpatient with learning disabilities is restrained, new data shows.","Prone restraint, demonstrated here, can result in serious injury - and was used more than 4,000 times in 2019 Every 15 minutes, on average, a patient with learning disabilities was restrained in hospital last year, new BBCFile on 4analysis shows. In 2019, restraint was used just over 38,000 times in England. In 2017, there were 22,000 reports of restraint. Harriet Harman, chairwoman of the House of Commons joint select committee on human rights, said this suggested ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment. The Department of Health said restraint ""should only be used as a last resort"". The data, provided by NHS Digital and analysed by the BBC, also shows the use of prone restraint - or holding people face down - remains high, despite being against government guidelines. Last year, it was used more than 4,000 times. Seclusion - where people are locked in a room on their own - also remains high. In 2019, there were 3,225 reported cases of seclusion, and 850 of those involved children. In the first seven months of this year alone, there were more than 2,000 incidents of seclusion. Restraint is used to manage someone's behaviour when they are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. NHS England says it has ""driven an increase in the reporting of restraint"" and ""lowered the bar"". But not all hospitals and treatment units regularly provide complete data. Ms Harman said the treatment ""was basically a human rights abuse"". ""People are not supposed to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment - and routine solitary confinement and physical restraint is exactly that,"" she said. ""We clearly don't even know the half of it, since many providers of these institutions don't give the information that they should about what's going on."" Dan Scorer, head of policy at learning disability charity Mencap, said prone restraint ""should not be happening in any kind of planned way"" and could result in ""serious injury, and potentially death"". The figures come despite pledges to reduce restraint use, which includes seclusion, after a 2018 File on 4 programme first uncovered numbers of reported restraint had risen by 50% between 2016 and 2017. Bethany has ""massively improved"" since moving to a new community placement The case of autistic 19-year-old Bethany -  whoFile on 4 revealedhad been in seclusion for 21 months - drew a personal apology from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, and prompted the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to investigate the issue of restraint. The CQC's findings,released last month, were described as ""deeply concerning"" by Health Minister Helen Whately. Bethany was kept in a room with just a foam mattress and a chair, and fed through a hatch, at St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton. Last December,she was finally found a place in a specialist unitrun by Merseycare NHS Trust. She said: ""Since I've been here, the staff have been absolutely amazing. My behaviour's settled down and my anger's settled.  And I've not done any self-harming for five or six months."" She now has her own bedroom, plays the piano, goes out for walks and shopping, and is learning circus skills. Andrea Attree and her autistic daughter Dannielle, who has spent more than two years being secluded and segregated in hospitals Dannielle Attree from Kent, who is also autistic, was in the same hospital as Bethany for 19 months, where she spent time in seclusion after first being admitted following a period of poor mental health. Now she's in Littlebrook Hospital, run by Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, where she has been in segregation for nine months. She is sometimes locked in. Dannielle's mum Andrea Attree told File on 4: ""Dannielle doesn't know how to be able to be anywhere but in seclusion now, because it's been going on for so long. ""Her mental health has declined to the lowest I've ever seen. Her self-harm has been off the scale."" The government strategy Transforming Care was launched in 2012 following theWinterbourne View scandal. It set a target to reduce the number of inpatients with learning disabilities in England by at least 35% by March 2019. This target was then moved to March 2020. It wasn't met, and a new target has now been set to move 50% of patients by March 2024. In 2018, there were 2,400 people with learning disabilities and autism in hospital in England. Latest figures show there are still 2,060. Ms Harman said there was a need for a ""sense of urgency"", and that a special unit in the prime minister's office should be established to tackle the issue. The Department for Health and Social Care said a new unit would ""duplicate services"". ""Our priority is always to ensure people with a learning disability and autistic people receive safe and high-quality care, and that they are treated with dignity and respect,"" it added. ""Government policy is that any kind of restraint should only be used as a last resort, and there is active work to reduce use of restrictive practice in mental health settings."" Figures for restraint in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland aren't collated. But there are more than 600 people with learning disabilities and autism in hospital in those three countries. Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust said it agreed with Dannielle and Andrea that ""highly specialist services for people with autism nationally are not where we all want them to be"". It added: ""Our role has been to make sure that whilst we worked with Dannielle and her mum to find the right care setting for her, Dannielle is supported, cared for and cared about in what we all agree was never set up as a long-term placement."" St Andrew's Hospital said Dannielle had made good progress while she was there, that seclusion was only ever used as a last resort, and that guidelines were followed. It added that Bethany had been there ""longer than anyone wanted"", and it had worked with the NHS to transfer her to a community placement as soon as was possible.

Trump camp vows election court fight just began,"This video can not be played Mitch McConnell: 'Trump 100% within rights to look into election irregularities' US attorney general William Barr has allowed federal prosecutors to probe alleged irregularities in the presidential election, prompting a top justice department official to quit. The official, Richard Pilger, would have overseen such investigations. Any such cases would normally be the remit of individual states, but Mr Barr said this was not a hard and fast rule. Donald Trump refuses to accept Joe Biden's projected victory, and has made unsubstantiated fraud claims. The president's campaign is seeking an emergency injunction in Pennsylvania to prevent Mr Biden's victory being certified in the state. The president-elect's projected win there on Saturday took him over the threshold of 270 electoral college votes needed to secure victory nationwide. What happens now? Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is US first lady-designate Jill Biden? The attorney general wrote that inquiries could be made by federal prosecutors,external""if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State"". Mr Barr warned against investigating ""fanciful"" claims Mr Barr said prosecutors should only look into ""substantial allegations"" of irregularities. He acknowledged that individual states had the primary responsibility for the conduct of elections but said the justice department had ""an obligation to ensure that federal elections are conducted in such a way that the American people can have full confidence in their electoral process and their government"". The department would normally only go beyond preliminary investigations after an election had been concluded and the results certified, but Mr Barr said this could result in situations where ""misconduct cannot realistically be rectified"". Mr Pilger said he had quit in response to Mr Barr's memo. ""Having familiarised myself with the new policy and its ramifications... I must regretfully resign from my role,"" he wrote in an email to colleagues. Mr Pilger became head of the department's Election Crimes Branch in 2010. This branch, and Mr Pilger himself, were previously in the public eye at the time of a row about extra scrutiny of political groups seeking tax exemption. He was reported to have had discussions about the issue with Lois Lerner,the tax official at the centre of the row. Bill Barr's memorandum authorising federal election fraud investigations is yet another example of the attorney general's skill at pleasing his boss, the president, while dancing on the edge of propriety within the justice department he runs. The document gives Donald Trump what he wants - proof that the government is looking into unproven claims of widespread electoral illegalities in several states he lost by tens of thousands of votes. The attorney general, however, couches the memo with conditions and cautions that prosecutors only focus on specific ""irregularities"" and avoid pursuing ""specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims"". Despite all the caveats, Mr Barr's memo will provide fodder to Trump and his supporters, who insist that the election was stolen from them (never mind that other Republican candidates had fairly successful results). As the protest resignation of the head of the justice department's election crimes department indicates, this is the equivalent of pulling the pin from a political hand grenade. It may not go off immediately, but the device is one step closer to exploding - thrown on purpose or accidentally dropped. There are safeguards in place to prevent political meddling in criminal investigations, particularly around elections. Some of those safeguards have now been removed. Since media projected on Saturday that Mr Biden had won the critical state of Pennsylvania, accumulating enough votes to claim the White House, the president-elect has forged ahead with his plans to take the reins of power. Biden tells Americans: I implore you, wear a mask Election results in maps and charts Mr Trump took to Twitter again on Monday to dispute the outcome, making unsubstantiated claims of ""unthinkable and illegal"" activity in the vote. The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages federal agencies, has held off on allowing Biden aides to formally begin the transition, saying no ""ascertainment"" on an election winner had yet been made. The GSA is tasked with formally recognising the president-elect, and providing the funds and access to federal agencies that Mr Biden's transition team needs. In previous elections it has mostly acted promptly after the winner was declared, with the exception of the disputed election in 2000 when it waited until a Supreme Court ruling decided the result on 14 December. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, says the Biden team is considering its legal options if the Trump administration continues to stall the handover. White House reporters have been saying that despite his objections, Mr Trump is expected to leave office begrudgingly in January and is already talking about running for the White House again in 2024. Mr Trump's spokeswoman vowed the legal battle to contest Mr Biden's victory was only just beginning. ""This election is not over,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a news conference on Monday. ""Far from it."" Ms McEnany and Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel cited allegations of electoral corruption, while urging reporters to help investigate the unverified claims. Conservative channel Fox News cut away from the event, citing the lack of evidence. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" ""Whoa, whoa, whoa,"" said presenter Neil Cavuto. ""Unless she [Ms McEnany] has more details to back that up, I can't in good countenance continue to show you this."" Ms McEnany told reporters: ""We have only begun the process of obtaining an accurate, honest vote count."" Five viral vote claims fact-checked Donald Trump's speech fact-checked Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud? She said Republican poll watchers had not been granted adequate access to vote counts in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, both Republican and Democratic election monitors were kept from 13ft to 100ft (4m to 30m) away from tables where votes were being tallied in the city, and local election officials cited coronavirus prevention needs for the distancing. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for unity in victory speeches Ms McEnany also said election officials in that key state had allowed a disproportionate number of Democrats to correct, or ""cure"", inaccurately filled-out ballots. According to the Inquirer, some Pennsylvania counties allowed voters to amend such mistakes, while others did not. Ms McDaniel said they had collected 131 affidavits, or signed legal statements under oath, in Michigan as part of their investigation into alleged election irregularities. ""If the shoe were on the other foot,"" she said, ""if it were this close the other way, if President Trump was in the lead in all these states... the media would be screaming, 'This isn't over'."" Results in last Tuesday's presidential election from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding. In Georgia, where the tally is continuing and Mr Biden leads, its secretary of state hit back on Monday at fellow Republicans who had criticised his handling of the election. The women changing the face of US politics The woman behind biggest surprise in Biden win Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said: ""Was there illegal voting? I am sure there was. And my office is investigating all of it. ""Does it rise to the numbers or margin necessary to change the outcome to where President Trump is, given Georgia's electoral votes? That is unlikely."" Separately, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit on Monday in a Pennsylvania federal court, seeking an emergency injunction to stop state officials from certifying Mr Biden's victory in the state. The state's attorney general, Josh Shapiro, called the lawsuit ""meritless"". Prosecutors in Republican-controlled states meanwhile threw their weight behind the president's challenge to the election results. Ten state attorneys general filed a so-called amicus brief at the US Supreme Court backing the Trump campaign's case in Pennsylvania. States must resolve recounts and court contests over the results by 8 December. The outcome will be finalised when members of the US Electoral College meet on 14 December. Senior members of the president's party have largely refused to pressure Mr Trump to concede. On Monday Senate leader Mitch McConnell criticised Democrats over the matter. ""Let's not have any lectures, no lectures,"" the Kentucky senator said on the floor of the upper chamber, ""about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election and who insinuated that this one would be illegitimate too if they lost again - only if they lost."" He added: ""The president has every right to look into allegations and to request recounts under the law and notably the constitution gives no role in this process to wealthy media corporations."" 8 December:All recounts and certification of results to be completed by states 14 December:Electoral college members meet in state capitals to formally cast their ballots for president and vice president 6 January:Joint session of House of Representatives and Senate to count electoral votes 20 January: New president sworn in Watch the moment BBC projects Biden victory What happens now?

"No decision made on changes to Covid restrictionsAlcohol-only pubs will remain shut for another two weeks, under plans being considered by Stormont.Northern Ireland","Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland closed their doors to sit-in customers in mid-October The NI Executive has failed to reach a decision on whether to extend or change Covid-19 restrictions regarding the hospitality sector. Ministers held a series of meetings throughout Monday but were unable to agree what steps to take. One option being considered would be to allow cafes to open but licensed premises would remain closed. It is understood hairdressers and beauticians would be allowed to open with certain restrictions in place. Ten further coronavirus-related deaths were reported by Stormont's Department of Health on Monday, along with 471 more cases. Of the 10 deaths, nine occurred within the most recent 24-hour reporting period, while one happened prior to it. In the Republic of Ireland, one further coronavirus-related death was reported on Monday and there have been 270 new confirmed cases. The Republic's death toll now stands at 1,948 since the pandemic began and a total of 65,659 cases of the disease have been diagnosed. Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Irelandclosed their doors to sit-in customers on Friday 16 October under stricter Covid-19 restrictions. Hair and beauty salons also had to shut for four weeks. The first minister had said the current coronavirus restrictions would end at midnight on Thursday. It had been expected that ministers were going to agree a partial reopening of the sector, allowing restaurants to open but unable to serve booze and keeping alcohol-only pubs shut for another fortnight. On Sunday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neillsaid the sale of alcohol was a factor in reaching a decision because ""defences come down when alcohol is taken"". Ms O'Neill said cafes and coffee shops were a different matter. In other coronavirus developments on Monday: Health Minister Robin Swann has welcomed thenews about a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTechand says there is apossibility that vaccination of at-risk people in NI could begin by the end of this year Millcroft Care Home in Enniskillen says six of his residents have now died after contracting the virus. Twenty-one residents have tested positive - three are still in hospital - and 12 staff have been affected.News of the outbreakfirst emerged at the weekend. Police say they have now issued 1,983 penalty notices (fines) in NI since March and 48 Â£1,000 fines for people who have failed to self-isolate. Five hundred premises - 86 commercial and 414 private - have received prohibition notices 561 PSNI staff are currently absent from duty because of coronavirus - 477 of them are in self-isolation. Ms O'Neill said the executive was looking at reopening some areas of the hospitality industry Belfast restaurant owner Michael Deane said he was appalled at the idea not to allow premises to serve alcohol, He appealed to the executive to ""stop making us the bogeyman"". He told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that his business had lost close to Â£2m. ""I think they should just tell us to close until this is all over, fund the hospitality business and leave it at that,"" he added. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill urged the first and deputy first ministers to ""make the right call to save thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses"" by allowing licensed premises to reopen on 13 November. ""We really need the executive to make sure that the focus is on getting the entire hospitality sector back up and running again this Friday to save a significant amount of jobs and businesses,"" he said. ""We now face a really important part of the year and although we are live to the fact that this will be an extremely challenging trading period, we need to have the doors open. ""Hundreds of businesses are struggling and now in debt as they try to keep staff in the face of mounting bills and a lack of financial aid from the government, which covers very little in reality."" Hair and beauty salons also had to shut for four weeks on 17 October Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, urged ministers to reconsider their decision to give businesses ""a fighting chance"" to remain open. Speaking to Good Morning Ulster, he said: ""Suggesting that alcohol will not be allowed to be sold in premises is one which no logic or evidence has been offered for, and would suggest there is a lack of understanding around the viability of businesses like restaurants."" He said he has spoken to many businesses that do not believe it will be viable to open with the new restrictions. He added that grant support launched by the executive several weeks ago has not been paid to businesses yet and many that were forced to close will not be able to avail of it. Meanwhile Justice Minister Naomi Long is self isolating after developing a persistent cough. The Alliance leader took to social media to say she had booked a test for Covid-19. She said on Twitter: ""Hopefully, with a clear test and 10 days isolation, we'll be able to get it back on track next week. Still, very frustrating but has to be done."" Ms Long said she was following the official advice she had received. Department of Health guidance says if a person has a negative test, they are not required to self-isolate, as long aseveryone they live with who has symptoms has tested negative; they feel well enough; and are not a close contact of a confirmed case.,external Ms Long is the latest executive minister to self isolate and follows assembly members including Conor Murphy, Pam Cameron, John Stewart andMichelle O'Neill who have all had stay at home in recent weeks.

Donald Trump fires Defence Secretary Mark Esper,"Defence Secretary Mark Esper is the latest in a series of officials sacked by Donald Trump President Donald Trump has sacked Defence Secretary Mark Esper, announcing on Twitter that the top US official has been ""terminated"". Christopher Miller, the current head of the National Counterterrorism Center, will take on the role immediately. It follows a public falling-out between Mr Trump and Mr Esper in recent weeks. Mr Trump has so far not conceded the US election to President-elect Joe Biden, and has vowed to challenge the projected result in court. In the weeks before Mr Biden takes office on 20 January, Mr Trump is still empowered to make decisions. President Trump announced Christopher Miller would immediately become defence secretary Mr Miller was seen entering the Department of Defense headquarters at the Pentagon on Monday shortly after Mr Trump announced the dismissal. The former Special Forces soldier served on President Trump's National Security Council before becoming head of the Counterterrorism Centre in August. In a resignation letter, Mr Esper thanked members of the Armed Forces and said he was proud of his achievements in 18 months of service at the Pentagon. ""I serve my country in deference to the Constitution, so I accept your decision to replace me,"" he wrote. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi criticised the decision. ""The abrupt firing of Secretary Esper is disturbing evidence that President Trump is intent on using his final days in office to sow chaos in our American Democracy and around the world,"" said the speaker of the House of Representatives. Mr Esper clashed with the presidentover the White House's attitude to the military during protests over racial injustice earlier this year. As protests rocked the US following the death of black man George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May, Mr Trump threatened to use troops to suppress unrest. In June, Mr Esper, a former army officer, said the use of active-duty forces was unnecessary, in remarks that were known to have displeased the White House. Following the clash, it was widely-speculated that the president would fire the defence secretary, although on Monday Mr Trump gave no reason for his dismissal. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Joe Biden has won the election. What happens now? Mr Esper has also disagreed with Mr Trump over the president's dismissive attitude towards Nato. In an interview with Military Times last week,external, Mr Esper said that despite the difficult relationship with the White House, he didn't believe quitting was the right thing to do. ""The president's going to â he's very transparent in terms of what he wants. And he's been very clear about his views â¦ I'm not trying to make anybody happy,"" he told the website. ""What I'm trying to do is, fulfil what he wants â I mean, he's the duly elected commander in chief â and make the best out of it."" He also rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Mr Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. ""My frustration is I sit here and say, 'Hmm, 18 Cabinet members. Who's pushed back more than anybody?' Name another Cabinet secretary that's pushed back,"" he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, 'Under the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?'""' President Trump has fired a significant number of his officials and advisers during his tenure, often using Twitter to announce the dismissal. Mr Esper's predecessor was James Mattis, who resigned in 2018 over differences with the president including about the war in Syria. In June, as racial injustice protests were ongoing, Mr Mattis criticised Donald Trump as the ""first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us."" This video can not be played In June, police dispersed a peaceful protest next to the White House The White House revolving door: Who's gone? What happens now?

McDonald's to debut plant-based burgers,"Fast food giant McDonald's has announced it will introduce a line of plant-based meat alternatives called ""McPlant"" in 2021. McDonald's said it would offer plant-based burgers, chicken substitutes and breakfast sandwiches. Barclays Bank forecasts that consumption of meat alternatives might be worth $140bn (Â£106bn) by 2029. McDonald's has tested out a plant-based burger in Canada with Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat. However, shares of Beyond Meat plummeted after the announcement by McDonald's as it was not clear who would supply the fast-food chain with the meat alternative. The move towards meat substitutes has been driven primarily by concerns over meat's effects on health, the environment and animal welfare.

Russia brokers Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal,"This video can not be played What a peace deal means for Nagorno-Karabakh Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia have signed an agreement to end military conflict over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the deal ""incredibly painful both for me and both for our people"". It follows six weeks of fighting between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians. The region is internationally recognised as Azerbaijani but has been run by ethnic Armenians since 1994. A Russian-brokered truce was signed at the end of the war in the early 1990s but there was no peace deal. Although both sides took steps to reduce tensions last year, fighting erupted at the end of September and several attempts to end the conflict failed. The new ceasefire agreement prompted anger in Armenia, as protesters stormed the parliament, beating up the speaker and reportedly looting the prime minister's office. The peace deal, which was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenia's prime minister, took effect on Tuesday from 01:00 local time (21:00 GMT Monday). Under the deal, Azerbaijan will hold on to areas of Nagorno-Karabakh that it has taken during the conflict. Armenia has also agreed to withdraw from several other adjacent areas over the next few weeks. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Disinformation spreads amid Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict 'Execution' video prompts Karabakh war crime probe The BBC's Orla Guerin in Baku says that, overall, the deal should be read as a victory for Azerbaijan and a defeat for Armenia. During a televised online address, President Putin said that Russian peacekeepers would be deployed to patrol the front line. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that 1,960 personnel would be involved and reports said planes had left an airbase at Ulyanovsk on Tuesday carrying peacekeepers and armoured personnel carriers to Karabakh. Part of their role will be to guard the ""Lachin corridor"", which links the Karabakh capital, Stepanakert, to Armenia. Turkey will also take part in the peacekeeping process, according to Azerbaijan's president, who joined President Putin during the address. This video can not be played Armenians on the front line in Nagorno-Karabakh President Putin said the agreement would include an exchange of war prisoners, with ""all economical and transport contacts to be unblocked."" By Orla Guerin, BBC News, Baku There is a mood of national celebration in Baku. At Martyrs' Alley - a memorial to Azerbaijan's fallen soldiers - there are surging crowds among a sea of flags. There is a real sense here that a key victory has been achieved after a very long fight. Groups are breaking out in chants and singing the national anthem. There were street celebrations in Baku in response to the peace deal Two young students are holding a homemade sign that reads: ""Tell the world we are coming home."" It is a home they have never seen. Their parents were driven from Nagorno-Karabakh almost 30 years ago, but now they intend to move there to build a new life. Asked if they could imagine living side by side with Armenians, one replied that this might take decades. ""Our children may see this,"" she told me. President Aliyev said the agreement was of ""historic importance,"" and amounted to a ""capitulation"" by Armenia. Armenian separatist forces have steadily lost territory to Azerbaijan since fighting broke out Armenia's prime minister said that his decision had been based on ""deep analyses of the combat situation and in discussion with best experts of the field"". ""This is not a victory but there is not defeat until you consider yourself defeated,"" Mr Pashinyan said. In protest at the deal, large crowds stormed the government headquarters in Yerevan The Armenian leader in Nagorno-Karabakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, said a ceasefire had been unavoidable after the loss of Karabakh's second biggest town, Shusha (known as Shushi in Armenian). Battles were already taking place on the outskirts of Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert, and if the conflict had continued the whole of Karabakh would have been lost, he said on Facebook. ""We would have far more losses,"" he said. In the Armenian capital Yerevan, a large crowd gathered to protest against the agreement, according to local media.  They broke into parliament and government buildings, shouting ""We will not give it up."" Protesters ransacked the prime minister's official residence and Mr Pashinyan said they ""stole a computer, a clock, perfume, drivers licence and other items"". By Yuri Vendik, BBC Russian, Yerevan It was a night of unrest and upset in Armenia's capital, where crowds of protesters stormed government buildings and the country's parliament. But by Tuesday morning, that anger appeared to have died down. Leading politicians, with the exception of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, are in talks to find a way out of this deep crisis. And this is a crisis: the defeat in Nagorno-Karabakh is a devastating one The protesters who gathered here overnight accused the government of betrayal. They believed the fighting should have continued until the end and they were confident of victory. But in Nagorno-Karabakh itself there was no such optimism. The leadership of the enclave earlier admitted that, had the fighting continued, the main city of Stepanakert would have been lost within days. The Armenians steadily lost territory and significantly over the weekend Azerbaijani forces took over Shusha. Azerbaijan also admitted to mistakenly shooting down a Russian military helicopter over Armenia, killing two crew members and injuring a third. Both sides have accused each other of shelling civilian areas It is unclear exactly how many have died. Both sides deny targeting civilians but accuse the other of doing so. Nagorno-Karabakh's authorities say nearly 1,200 of its defence forces have died in the fighting, and civilians have also been killed or injured. Azerbaijan has not released its military casualty figures but has said more than 80 civilians were killed in the fighting - including 21 in a missile strike on the town of Barda last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that almost 5,000 people had been killed in the fighting. Russia has a military base in Armenia, and the two countries are members of the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organization. The treaty envisages Russia's military support if Armenia is attacked - but it does not include Nagorno-Karabakh or the other Azerbaijani regions around it seized by Armenian forces. At the same time, Moscow also has strong ties to Azerbaijan, which is being openly backed by Turkey, a Nato member. Russia has been selling weapons to both Armenia and Azerbaijan.

PM warns of 'several more hurdles' for vaccine,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that we are still in a 'critical moment' of Covid-19 response The development of a coronavirus vaccine has ""cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go"", Boris Johnson has said. The PM saidearly findings showing a jab could prevent 90% of people getting Covid-19were positive, but added it was ""very, very early days"". He warned people not to ""rely on this news as a solution"" to the pandemic. ""The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at a critical moment,"" he said. It came as a further 21,350 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Monday, along with 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Stock markets rocket on Covid vaccine hopes Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how? England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said he was ""hopeful"" the first vaccine could be seen by Christmas and there would be a ""much better horizon"" by spring. Speaking alongside Mr Johnson at a Downing Street news conference, Prof Van-Tam said there was more work to be done before it became available to the public. ""This is a very important scientific breakthrough. I am certain of that,"" he said. He said age would be the ""biggest priority"" when drawing up a list of who would be able to access the new vaccine. Older care home residents and care home staff are at the top of apreliminary priority list published,externalby the government, followed by health workers. Prof Van-Tam described the development as similar to ""getting to the end of the playoff final, it's gone to penalties, the first player goes up and scores a goal"". ""You haven't won the cup yet, but what it does is it tells you that the goalkeeper can be beaten,"" he said. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? The prime minister said ""if and when"" the vaccine was approved for use, the UK ""will be ready to use it"". He said 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate up to 20 million people - had been ordered, putting the UK near the front of the queue of countries in securing the jab. Mr Johnson said he had talked for a long time about ""the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill"" with a solution. ""I can tell you that tonight that toot of the bugle is louder, but it's still some way off, we absolutely cannot rely on this news as a solution,"" he said. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means The vaccine - developed by Pfizer and German-based BioNTech - has been hailed as a ""milestone"" by many scientists. It has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries with no safety concerns raised. Prof Van-Tam warned it was not yet known whether any vaccine would prevent someone passing on coronavirus to someone else. Dr Charlie Weller, a vaccines specialist at the Wellcome Trust, said the speed of the vaccine's progress was ""phenomenal"" but warned no single jab would be a silver bullet against the virus. She added that the technology behind the vaccine, so-called messenger RNA, had not been proved effective in jabs before. It has been suggested it could lead to safer vaccines for many types of viruses in future. Meanwhile, Surrey Police chief constable Gavin Stephens confirmed discussions with the Army were under way to determine the location of mass Covid-19 vaccination centres. He said there was a question over whether vaccinations should happen in the same place as testing and how many sites would be needed to meet capacity. GPs in England have been told to prepare to give patients two vaccine doses - to be delivered between 21 and 28 days apart - during clinics that could run between 08:00 and 20:00 GMT seven days a week as early as December, according to the British Medical Association (BMA). The BMA, which represents doctors, said it expects ""vaccine availability to be limited to begin with, meaning only small numbers of vaccine may be given in December and most vaccinations taking place in early 2021"". Managing expectations seemed to be a key theme of Monday's televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam were at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The PM said we must not ""slacken our resolve"", while Prof Van-Tam said it would not make ""any difference"" for the second wave this winter. Their message was simple - do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But the announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, the jab's ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain, and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome - and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. It could be that one of the many other vaccines being trialled proves more effective in the long-term. But, as Prof Van-Tam said, Monday's news showed the opponent could be beaten. Mr Johnson said levels of Covid-19 remained significant and were doubling in many areas, with recent data showing one in 90 people in England currently has the virus. ""There is a long way before we have got this thing beat,"" he said. He reiterated the government's intention to end England's current lockdown on 2 December and replace it with tiered regional restrictions.

Seven-day-a-week Covid vaccine clinics proposed,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: âOur plan is working and I am more sure than ever that we will prevail togetherâ The NHS will be ready from December to roll out the new coronavirus vaccine if it gets approved, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock told MPs the news about the vaccine was an important step but ""there are no guarantees"". He also said ""we don't know"" how many people will need to be vaccinated in order for life to return to normal. And he announced that, from Tuesday, NHS staff will begin being tested twice a week. It comes as a further 20,412 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with another 532 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. While the number of deaths recorded is higher than previous days, there is often an increase at the beginning of the week due to delays in weekend reporting. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Will the vaccine be compulsory? And other questions 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection On Monday,early results from the world's firsteffective coronavirus vaccine showed it could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid. The vaccine has been developed by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech and is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. The companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November - and a limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate up to 20 million people, as each person will need two doses for it to work effectively. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned people not to ""rely on this news as a solution"" as it is still ""very, very early days"". Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Hancock said: ""If this or any other vaccine is approved, we will be ready to begin a large-scale vaccination programme. ""We do not yet know whether or when a vaccine is approved, but I have tasked the NHS with being ready from any date from 1 December."" Earlier, Mr Hancock said the bulk of the rollout of a vaccine was always expected to be in the first part of 2021. Asked about how many people would need to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock said: ""The honest truth to that question is we don't know what proportion of the population vaccination needs to reach in order for this to stop the epidemic. ""The reason we don't know that is you can check in a clinical trial for the impact of the vaccine on protecting the individual... what you cannot check is the impact on the transmission of the disease by those people, because you have to have enough of the population, a significant proportion of the population, to have had the vaccine to understand that."" Earlier, Mr Hancock told the BBC that vaccinations would take place in care homes, centres such as sports halls and also clinics that would open seven days a week. He said he was giving GPs an extra Â£150m to help with the roll-out, and he believed NHS staff ""will rise to this challenge of being ready when the science comes good to inject hope into millions of arms this winter"". ""There are many hard days ahead, many hurdles to overcome, but our plan is working and I'm more sure than ever that we will prevail together,"" he added. Mr Hancock also said new rapid swab tests - which give results in less than an hour -will be made available across 67 local areas,after they were used in a mass testing trial in Liverpool. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that we are still in a 'critical moment' of Covid-19 response Older care home residents and care home staff are at the top ofa list from government scientific advisers,externalof who should be immunised first, followed by health workers. Mr Hancock said children would not be vaccinated. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on Mr Hancock to give priority access to relatives of care home residents so they can see their loved ones. And he asked the government to publish a strategy on how the vaccine would be rolled out. The Covid vaccine is the fastest ever vaccine to go from the drawing board to being proven highly effective. It will not be released for use until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. ""Our strong and independent regulator the MHRA will not approve a vaccine until it's clinically safe,"" Mr Hancock said. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said GPs have been told to prepare to give patients two vaccine doses - to be delivered between 21 and 28 days apart - during clinics that could run between 08:00 and 20:00 GMT seven days a week. It added that, due to the logistics and delivery requirements, including the need to store it at very cold temperatures, it was likely that groups of GP practices would need to work together with one ""designated vaccination site"". Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the government there has purchased around 20 large freezers to store the new vaccine at strategic locations. Cautious optimism is the tone of today. Matt Hancock insists the NHS will be ready to start deploying a coronavirus vaccine as soon as humanly possible. If regulators are able to give the green light in the next few weeks, some people could get their jab before Christmas - a most welcome gift for those at highest risk of severe Covid-19 illness. But he doesn't want people to get their hopes up too soon or assume life can now return to ""normal"". It can't. It would be a colossal mistake to relax now and let the virus rip, say leading medical advisers. Until and unless mass vaccination can happen, society needs to use the other weapons at its disposal to fight the virus and stop the spread. That means sticking with the social distancing and face masks, and testing people who may have the virus and asking them to isolate. The UK is still in the second wave and the actions taken by all of us now will influence how it plays out. Data from the UK national statistics agencies also showedthe number of deaths was more than 11% higher than normally expected. It showed 1,597 deaths mentioning Covid on the death certificate in the last week of October - up from 1,126 the week before. Although deaths usually do rise at this time of year, the data shows the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years.

'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection,"The first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows. The developers - Pfizer and BioNTech - described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"". Their vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised. The companies plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of the month. No vaccine has gone from the drawing board to being proven highly effective in such a short period of time. There are still huge challenges ahead, but the announcement has been warmly welcomed with scientists describing themselves smiling ""ear to ear"" and some suggesting life could be back to normal by spring. ""I am probably the first guy to say that, but I will say that with some confidence,"" said Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University. Stock markets rocket on Covid vaccine hopes Analysis: Have we finally got a vaccine? Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how? A vaccine - alongside better treatments - is seen as the best way of getting out of the restrictions that have been imposed on all our lives. The data shows that two doses, three weeks apart, are needed. The trials - in US, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Turkey - show 90% protection is achieved seven days after the second dose. However, the data presented is not the final analysis as it is based on only the first 94 volunteers to develop Covid so the precise effectiveness of the vaccine may change when the full results are analysed. Dr Albert Bourla, the chairman of Pfizer, said: ""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis."" Prof Ugur Sahin, one of the founders of BioNTech, described the results as a ""milestone"". This video can not be played Sarah Montague reacted with excitement upon hearing Professor Bell's views on the significance of today's vaccine news A limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. Pfizer and BioNTech say they will have enough safety data by the third week of November to take their vaccine to regulators. Until it has been approved it will not be possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns. The two companies say they will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Each person needs two doses. The UK should get 10 million doses by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. Not everyone will get the vaccine straight away and countries are each deciding who should be prioritised. Hospital staff and care home workers will be near the top of every list because of the vulnerable people they work with, as will the elderly who are most at risk of severe disease. The UK is likely to prioritise older resident in care homes and the people that work there. But it saysa final decision has not been made,external, saying it will depend on how well the vaccine works in different age-groups and how the virus is spreading. People under 50 and with no medical problems are likely to be last in the queue. There are still many unanswered questions as this is only interim data. We do not know if the vaccine stops you spreading the virus or just from developing symptoms. Or if it works equally well in high-risk elderly people. The biggest question - how long does immunity last - will take months or potentially years to answer. There are also massive manufacturing and logistical challenges in immunising huge numbers of people, as the vaccine has to be kept in ultra-cold storage at below minus 80C. The vaccine appears safe from the large trials so far but nothing, including paracetamol, is 100% safe. There are around a dozen vaccines in the final stages of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - but this is the first to show any results. It uses a completely experimental approach - that involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code - in order to train the immune system. Previous trials have shown the vaccine trains the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus. The UK's chief medical advisor Prof Chris Whitty said the results showed the ""power of science"" and was a ""reason for optimism"" for 2021. Allow Twitter content?

Fines issued after 600-strong anti-lockdown demo,"Some protesters travelled from as far as Cumbria The organiser of an anti-lockdown demonstration attended by 600 people in Manchester has been fined Â£10,000. The protest in Piccadilly Gardens was condemned by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) as ""irresponsible"" after new Covid rules came into force. Police officers suffered minor injuries at Sunday's event, which included protesters who had travelled from Cumbria, said GMP. The force said the organiser ignored its pleas to call off the event. The 40-year-old man from Trafford was issued with a Â£10,000 fixed penalty notice. Three men, aged 40, 32 and 30, and a 23-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of public order offences have all been fined Â£200 and 25 protesters have been issued with Â£200 fines. GMP's Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain, said: ""Ahead of Sunday, officers attempted to engage with the person organising this gathering - warning him of the likely consequences and advising, for his and everyone else's sake, to abandon his plans. ""However, he decided to ignore this advice and pressed ahead with a reckless and completely irresponsible course of action."" Protesters held up anti-lockdown banners Mr Hussain said during the protest officers also tried to engage with the organisers and attendees to ""explain the restrictions and encourage compliance"", but this was ignored, too. ""Whilst responding to this gathering, a number of officers were injured,"" he said. ""This is unacceptable behaviour towards officers who were simply doing their job and protecting people."" He said work was continuing to identify other people in attendance who blatantly breached government restrictions. GMP Federation chairman Stu Berry said: ""The scenes witnessed in Manchester this weekend were simply a stupidity contest with approximately 600 participants.

Boyega says dad was stopped by police after church,"Boyega plays a police officer who wanted to change things from the inside British actor John Boyega has recalled the time his Pentecostal minister father was stopped by police on his way back from church. The Star Wars actor, who was a prominent figure in the Black Lives Matter protests in London this summer, plays a police officer in Sir Steve McQueen's new film series, Small Axe. His real-life character, Leroy Logan, was also an anti-racism reformer. Boyega stressed that black Britons had experienced the ""darkest scenarios"". ""I've been stopped and searched,"" the Londoner told the Radio Times. ""And my dad, who was a Pentecostal minister, got stopped on the way back from church. I was little. ""Everybody knows, especially if you grew up in Peckham, somebody who's gone through the darkest scenarios with the police,"" he added. ""I do. I know a few people."" His Small Axe film, entitled Red, White and Blue, follows Leroy as he attempts to reform the police force from within after seeing his own father assaulted by two officers.

"Brexit will be 'brutal' for UK, warns ex-PM MajorThe UK will be worse off from 2021 due to the government's inflexibility, the ex-PM says.UK Politics","Brexit may be ""even more brutal than expected"" due to the UK's negotiating ""failures"", Sir John Major has said. In a speech in London, the ex-prime minister said the UK's ""inflexibility"" and ""threats"" towards the EU would make future trade ""less profitable"". And he warned of the ""corrosive"" impact to the UK's reputation of a proposed law giving ministers the power to over-ride aspects of the Brexit agreement. It came asthe House of Lords rejectedparts of the Internal Market Bill. Peers removed a series of clauses which would give the UK the right to disregard obligations in the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in relation to Northern Ireland, defeating the government twice by huge margins. Ministers have said they do not intend to use the powers but they are needed as a ""safety net"" in case disputes over the agreement's implementation cannot be resolved by other means. The government said it would seek to re-insert the measures when the bill returns to the House of Commons, where they have already been approved. UK-EU trade talks resume in London 'Significant differences' in Brexit talks, says PM Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future Sir John, who was an outspoken critic of the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January, said this ""was a slippery slope down which no democratic government should ever travel"". In a pre-recorded lecture at Middle Temple, Sir John - who led the UK from 1990 to 1997 - urged Parliament to resist measures in the bill which he said threatened essential liberties and could place ministers above the law. ""This action is unprecedented in all our history - and for good reason. It has damaged our reputation around the world,"" he said. ""Lawyers everywhere are incredulous that the UK - often seen as the very cradle of the rule of law - could give themselves the power to break the law."" Sir John said he was not optimistic about the prospects for trade talks between the UK and EU, which resumed in London on Monday, saying the UK was not being ""frank"" about the possible outcomes. The UK and EU are in a race against the clock to secure an agreement before 31 December, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of the post-Brexit transition period. The UK has said it is hopeful of securing a comprehensive deal modelled on the EU's arrangement with Canada, but Sir John said it was ""disingenuous"" of ministers to pretend they were not seeking far deeper commitments in key areas, such as energy and aviation. He said he feared, as a result, the process would end up either with no deal or a ""flimsy and bare-bones"" agreement that created new barriers to trade and would be a ""wretched betrayal"" of the promises made to British voters during the 2016 referendum. ""These costs and complexities are the certain legacy of Brexit,"" he said. ""This is as a result of our negotiating failure - and it is a failure. ""Because of our bombast, our blustering, our threats and our inflexibility - our trade will be less profitable, our Treasury poorer, our jobs fewer, and our future less prosperous."" He added: ""It now seems that on 1 January next year, Brexit may be even more brutal than anyone expected."" Sir John also warned that Brexit divisions increased the risk of the United Kingdom breaking up. While he remained an avowed unionist, he said the UK government could find it difficult to stave off demands for another independence referendum in Scotland and should consider a two-stage process, where a vote on the principle of independence was followed by another on the terms of separation offered to the Scottish people. The ex-PM said demands for another Scottish independence referendum may be hard to ignore In his speech, recorded before Joe Biden's election as US president was confirmed on Saturday, Sir John also warned that the UK's departure from the EU made it ""less relevant"" to its oldest and strongest ally. While the UK had enormous strengths and assets, he said it was ""no longer a great power"" in a world dominated by the US, China and the EU and was struggling to ""punch above its weight"" on the international stage. ""Our hefty international influence rested on our history and reputation, buttressed by our membership of the European Union and our close alliance with the United States. ""Suddenly, we are no longer an irreplaceable bridge between Europe and America."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is looking forward to workingwith President-elect Biden to uphold the two countries ""common values and interests"". On post-Brexit trade talks, he said on Sunday that the ""outlines"" of an agreement were clear and a deal was ""there to be done"". Sir John's warning about the future of the union was welcomed by former Tory cabinet minister David Lidington, who told the BBC the government needed a ""positive story to tell"" if it wanted to avoid Scottish independence. ""The government has not paid the attention to the union - and the threat to the union - that in an ideal world and in different circumstances they would have wanted to,"" he said. But Mr Lidington - who was responsible for relations with the devolved administrations in Theresa May's government - said he believed Sir John was mistaken to raise the possibility of multiple referendums as this ""took the debate onto the territory the SNP want"".

Aldi extends click and collect to 200 more shopsThe discount supermarket chain is expanding its trial as it faces growing competition from rivals.BusinessComments,"Aldi began the click and trial earlier this year Discount supermarket Aldi is to extend its trial click-and-collect shopping service to 200 more UK stores as it faces growing competition from rivals. It means about 25% of its 900 shops will offer the service by Christmas, compared with 18 now. Aldi and discount rival Lidl, which have challenged the big supermarket rivals on price, have missed out in the pandemic as more sales go online. By contrast traditional grocers such as Tesco have seen their sales accelerate. Aldi first launched its click and collect service to customers at a single store in the Midlands in September, before extending the trial last month. Shoppers can choose from a full range of grocery items online, then collect them in their cars ""contact-free"" at their local stores. Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent The German discounter has expanded rapidly over the past decade, largely by outcompeting traditional chains on price. However, it has seen growth slow since March as online grocery shopping has doubled its share of the UK market to around 14%. Analysts say mounting competition from traditional retailers with established online shopping services will make it harder for Aldi and Lidl to expand as quickly as they once did. Tesco has benefitted from the shift to online shopping For example, in the 12 weeks to May, Tesco and Sainsbury's increased sales at a faster rate than Aldi for the first time in a decade as the pandemic spurred weekly shops and more online ordering.Aldi has been rolling out new online options in response. In April, Aldi started selling online food parcels to help self-isolating and vulnerable customers and has also started a rapid delivery service in partnership with Deliveroo. Giles Hurley, boss of Aldi UK and Ireland, said its click and collect trial had been ""hugely popular"" so far. ""By extending it to hundreds of new stores, we're making Aldi accessible to thousands of shoppers who might never have visited one of our stores before.""

"Biden tells Americans: I implore you, wear a maskThe US president-elect says a mask is ""not a political statement"" and can help turn Covid-19 around.US Election 2020","This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'I implore you, wear a mask' US President-elect Joe Biden has appealed to Americans to wear a mask as the best way to ""turn this pandemic around"". Mr Biden said the US faced a ""very dark winter"" and the ""worst wave yet"", and Americans had to put aside political differences to tackle Covid-19. He has named a new task force and vowed to ""follow the science"" as he puts together his transition team. Donald Trump still refuses to concede defeat and is challenging key results. He is taking legal action in several states. Mr Biden's victory was declared on Saturday but it remains a projection, with a number of states still counting ballot papers. He leads Mr Trump in the nationwide vote by about 4.5 million. Follow all the latest live updates Election results in maps and charts Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris have launcheda website for the transition,external, saying the team will also focus on climate change, the economy and tackling racism. But the president-elect will need the help of an agency called the General Services Administration to begin the transition process and its Trump-appointed head has given no indication when that will happen. On Monday, Mr Bidenset out the blueprints for his Transition Covid-19 Advisory Board,external. In a TV address, he said ""I implore you, wear a mask"", calling it the ""single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of Covid"". He added: ""A mask is not a political statement but it is a good way to start pulling the country together."" During the election campaign, his mask-wearing was markedly different to President Trump, whose attitude to it has varied considerably. They have differed too on how to follow scientific advice. Mr Biden said on Monday there would be a ""bedrock of science"" to his policy. President Trump's comments on Covid-19 have often conflicted with scientists, including leading infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci. Covid-19 cases in the US have passed 10 million and Joe Biden says tackling the pandemic is his main priority Mr Biden said that, as president, he would improve contact-tracing and supplies of protective equipment, and address the racial disparity of coronavirus infections. ""This is a crisis that affects everyone and I will be a president for everyone,"" he said. ""We can get this virus under control, I promise you."" He earlier named three co-chairs and 10 members of his task force. Among the co-chairs named is Vivek Murthy, who was appointed US surgeon-general by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. One member is immunologist Rick Bright, who says he was ignored and then removed by the Trump administration over his early warnings on Covid. Mr Biden also welcomed the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that preliminary analysis showed their vaccine in development could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection But he also warned it was ""important to understand that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away"". He plans to speak in Delaware on Tuesday about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the healthcare reform law that extended healthcare access for millions. BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says that Mr Biden's choice to address the pandemic as the first public event for his new transition team afforded him an opportunity to look and act like a man who will soon be president, despite Donald Trump's decision to not concede defeat.

'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win On Monday, Covid cases in the US since the epidemic began passed 10 million, and there have been more than 237,000 deaths recorded so far,Johns Hopkins research shows,external. Donald Trump also welcomed the vaccine statement, tweeting it was ""such great news"". They reportedly include a slew of executive orders -written orders issued by the presidentto the federal government that do not require congressional approval - aimed at reversing controversial Trump policies. They are in draft form and cannot be issued until Mr Biden takes office. According to US media: Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization He will end thetravel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children Mr Biden also aims to make addressing racism a key policy, including better access to affordable housing for black and minority communities. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for unity in victory speeches Mr Biden wants to transform US policing, including banning the use of chokeholds, and to reduce the US prison population, which at more than two million people is the biggest in the world. Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? However, for the transition process to begin, the support of the General Services Administration is needed to access government funds and communicate with the federal agencies it will be staffing. Its administrator, Emily Murphy, has not started the process nor indicated when she will do so, sparking concern among some Democrats that Mr Trump will try to impede the transition process. The vast majority of the president's tweets have continued to call the electoral process into question. Mr Trump, the first president to lose a re-election bid since 1992, has launched an array of lawsuits backing claims of fraud for which no evidence has yet been presented. Five US voters who changed the race Being with Trump the day he lost the election One of his lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, on Monday said there were ""unlawful votes"" in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and Nevada. ""We will prove it all,"" he said. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" Mr Trump still plans rallies to back his challenge, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. Most Republicans have remained silent on Mr Biden's projected election victory, favouring the unveiling of full results. The New York Times said advisers had told Mr Trump the chances of legal success were not high but that he was not yet ready to accept the loss. Mr Trump has vowed to take legal action as far as the Supreme Court. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to argue this in state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. Former President George W Bush was one Republican who did congratulate Mr Biden, calling him a ""good man"". Votes in some states continue to be counted and results are never official until final certification in the weeks following the election. This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in state capitals to vote on 14 December. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.

Peace deal signed over Nagorno-Karabakh,"This video can not be played What a peace deal means for Nagorno-Karabakh Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia have signed an agreement to end military conflict over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the deal ""incredibly painful both for me and both for our people"". It follows six weeks of fighting between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians. The region is internationally recognised as Azerbaijani but has been run by ethnic Armenians since 1994. A Russian-brokered truce was signed at the end of the war in the early 1990s but there was no peace deal. Although both sides took steps to reduce tensions last year, fighting erupted at the end of September and several attempts to end the conflict failed. The new ceasefire agreement prompted anger in Armenia, as protesters stormed the parliament, beating up the speaker and reportedly looting the prime minister's office. The peace deal, which was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenia's prime minister, took effect on Tuesday from 01:00 local time (21:00 GMT Monday). Under the deal, Azerbaijan will hold on to areas of Nagorno-Karabakh that it has taken during the conflict. Armenia has also agreed to withdraw from several other adjacent areas over the next few weeks. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Disinformation spreads amid Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict 'Execution' video prompts Karabakh war crime probe The BBC's Orla Guerin in Baku says that, overall, the deal should be read as a victory for Azerbaijan and a defeat for Armenia. During a televised online address, President Putin said that Russian peacekeepers would be deployed to patrol the front line. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that 1,960 personnel would be involved and reports said planes had left an airbase at Ulyanovsk on Tuesday carrying peacekeepers and armoured personnel carriers to Karabakh. Part of their role will be to guard the ""Lachin corridor"", which links the Karabakh capital, Stepanakert, to Armenia. Turkey will also take part in the peacekeeping process, according to Azerbaijan's president, who joined President Putin during the address. This video can not be played Armenians on the front line in Nagorno-Karabakh President Putin said the agreement would include an exchange of war prisoners, with ""all economical and transport contacts to be unblocked."" By Orla Guerin, BBC News, Baku There is a mood of national celebration in Baku. At Martyrs' Alley - a memorial to Azerbaijan's fallen soldiers - there are surging crowds among a sea of flags. There is a real sense here that a key victory has been achieved after a very long fight. Groups are breaking out in chants and singing the national anthem. There were street celebrations in Baku in response to the peace deal Two young students are holding a homemade sign that reads: ""Tell the world we are coming home."" It is a home they have never seen. Their parents were driven from Nagorno-Karabakh almost 30 years ago, but now they intend to move there to build a new life. Asked if they could imagine living side by side with Armenians, one replied that this might take decades. ""Our children may see this,"" she told me. President Aliyev said the agreement was of ""historic importance,"" and amounted to a ""capitulation"" by Armenia. Armenian separatist forces have steadily lost territory to Azerbaijan since fighting broke out Armenia's prime minister said that his decision had been based on ""deep analyses of the combat situation and in discussion with best experts of the field"". ""This is not a victory but there is not defeat until you consider yourself defeated,"" Mr Pashinyan said. In protest at the deal, large crowds stormed the government headquarters in Yerevan The Armenian leader in Nagorno-Karabakh, Arayik Harutyunyan, said a ceasefire had been unavoidable after the loss of Karabakh's second biggest town, Shusha (known as Shushi in Armenian). Battles were already taking place on the outskirts of Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert, and if the conflict had continued the whole of Karabakh would have been lost, he said on Facebook. ""We would have far more losses,"" he said. In the Armenian capital Yerevan, a large crowd gathered to protest against the agreement, according to local media.  They broke into parliament and government buildings, shouting ""We will not give it up."" Protesters ransacked the prime minister's official residence and Mr Pashinyan said they ""stole a computer, a clock, perfume, drivers licence and other items"". By Yuri Vendik, BBC Russian, Yerevan It was a night of unrest and upset in Armenia's capital, where crowds of protesters stormed government buildings and the country's parliament. But by Tuesday morning, that anger appeared to have died down. Leading politicians, with the exception of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, are in talks to find a way out of this deep crisis. And this is a crisis: the defeat in Nagorno-Karabakh is a devastating one The protesters who gathered here overnight accused the government of betrayal. They believed the fighting should have continued until the end and they were confident of victory. But in Nagorno-Karabakh itself there was no such optimism. The leadership of the enclave earlier admitted that, had the fighting continued, the main city of Stepanakert would have been lost within days. The Armenians steadily lost territory and significantly over the weekend Azerbaijani forces took over Shusha. Azerbaijan also admitted to mistakenly shooting down a Russian military helicopter over Armenia, killing two crew members and injuring a third. Both sides have accused each other of shelling civilian areas It is unclear exactly how many have died. Both sides deny targeting civilians but accuse the other of doing so. Nagorno-Karabakh's authorities say nearly 1,200 of its defence forces have died in the fighting, and civilians have also been killed or injured. Azerbaijan has not released its military casualty figures but has said more than 80 civilians were killed in the fighting - including 21 in a missile strike on the town of Barda last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that almost 5,000 people had been killed in the fighting. Russia has a military base in Armenia, and the two countries are members of the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organization. The treaty envisages Russia's military support if Armenia is attacked - but it does not include Nagorno-Karabakh or the other Azerbaijani regions around it seized by Armenian forces. At the same time, Moscow also has strong ties to Azerbaijan, which is being openly backed by Turkey, a Nato member. Russia has been selling weapons to both Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Parler tops app charts in wake of Trump defeat,"Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the United States as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Prominent investor Dan Bongino said the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"" on Sunday. But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users. Some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Parler founder John Matze said the app had added two million new users in a day, and increased its daily active users four-fold over the weekend. ""Don't worry, the app isn't normally this slow,"" he promised new arrivals. Some of Parler's most popular users are Republicans and media personalities While Mr Trump himself is not a user, the platform already features several high-profile contributors following earlier bursts of growth this year. Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts 2.6 million followers on the platform, while Fox News hosts Mark Levin and Sean Hannity each have more than two million. Newsmax, a conservative-leaning news outlet, also crept near the top of the charts at the same time. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. It is one of a handful of start-up social networks - such as MeWe or Gab - trying to appeal to disgruntled users of the biggest platforms. Parler is ahead of bigger, better-funded apps in Apple's US download charts Mr Trump has been among Twitter's most vocal critics and has seenmany of his tweets hidden and labelled as misleadingduring the election period. Named after the French verb ""to speak"", the app has very similar functions to Twitter. Posts can be replied to with comments, ""echoed"" in a way similar to retweeting, and upvoted instead of liked. Is social media really biased against Republicans? How a misleading post made it to Trump's Twitter Parler says it keeps bans to an ""absolute minimum"", and does not fact-check posts. Parler does, however, ban some things, including pornography, threats of violence, and support for terrorism. Following Joe Biden's projected win in the presidential election - and Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud - many conservatives encouraged each other to leave Twitter and Facebook for Parler. On Facebook, multiple events and groups with thousands of members are encouraging a ""mass exit"" from Facebook to Parler from Friday 13 November. The planned exodus has been mocked by left-leaning Twitter users as an escape to a ""safe space"" devoid of challenge or criticism. The light-touch approach to content moderation means that misinformation can spread more easily on the platform than on those with stricter rules. By Shayan Sardarizadeh, disinformation reporter The first ""mass migration"" of right-wing users from major social networks to Parler happened in June, after a number of accounts that posted misleading content about Covid-19 and George Floyd protests got banned from the bigger social media sites. Thousands of supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory have joined in in the last few weeks, after Facebook, Instagram and YouTube took sweeping action against them in early October. Followers believe President Trump is waging a secret war against a ""deep state"" elite of Satan-worshipping paedophiles. Facebook's ban on organisations that promote violence has also forced groups such as the Proud Boys and Boogaloo Bois to rebuild on Parler. Who are Boogaloo Bois, antifa and Proud Boys? Proud Boys becomes LGBT trend on social media However, platforms like Parler have become an echo-chamber for a relatively limited group of like-minded users. That's why many users who have migrated to Parler make repeated attempts to create new accounts to return to major networks - as they know that's where their content can get widespread traction. While the content posted on Parler is usually not as extreme as other self-proclaimed ""free speech"" platforms like Gab and MeWe, it is the home of many posts that would either be flagged as misleading or removed by major platforms - on topics like the election, Covid-19, child trafficking and vaccines. Senator Cruz,who recently lambasted Twitter boss Jack Dorseyat a congressional committee hearing,said in June that he had joined Parler,externalbecause social networks use their power ""to silence conservatives and promote their radical left-wing agenda"". This video can not be played ""Who put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report?"" Twitter's Jack Dorsey is quizzed by Senator Ted Cruz Tweeting on Sunday, Mr Levin encouraged his followers to ""hurry"" and join Parler because ""I may not stay at Facebook or Twitter if they continue censoring me"". But technology analyst Benedict Evans questioned how long-standing such a shift would be. ""How many core Trump voters will now think that Fox is too left-wing and Twitter or Facebook too controlled?"" he said. ""And even if that's a lot of people, will these stick - or will the scale effect of the mainstream networks pull them back?""

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.

David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature.

The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results.

Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden.

Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"".

Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out.

"Biden tells Americans: I implore you, wear a maskThe US president-elect says a mask is ""not a political statement"" and can help turn Covid-19 around.","This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'I implore you, wear a mask' US President-elect Joe Biden has appealed to Americans to wear a mask as the best way to ""turn this pandemic around"". Mr Biden said the US faced a ""very dark winter"" and the ""worst wave yet"", and Americans had to put aside political differences to tackle Covid-19. He has named a new task force and vowed to ""follow the science"" as he puts together his transition team. Donald Trump still refuses to concede defeat and is challenging key results. He is taking legal action in several states. Mr Biden's victory was declared on Saturday but it remains a projection, with a number of states still counting ballot papers. He leads Mr Trump in the nationwide vote by about 4.5 million. Follow all the latest live updates Election results in maps and charts Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris have launcheda website for the transition,external, saying the team will also focus on climate change, the economy and tackling racism. But the president-elect will need the help of an agency called the General Services Administration to begin the transition process and its Trump-appointed head has given no indication when that will happen. On Monday, Mr Bidenset out the blueprints for his Transition Covid-19 Advisory Board,external. In a TV address, he said ""I implore you, wear a mask"", calling it the ""single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of Covid"". He added: ""A mask is not a political statement but it is a good way to start pulling the country together."" During the election campaign, his mask-wearing was markedly different to President Trump, whose attitude to it has varied considerably. They have differed too on how to follow scientific advice. Mr Biden said on Monday there would be a ""bedrock of science"" to his policy. President Trump's comments on Covid-19 have often conflicted with scientists, including leading infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci. Covid-19 cases in the US have passed 10 million and Joe Biden says tackling the pandemic is his main priority Mr Biden said that, as president, he would improve contact-tracing and supplies of protective equipment, and address the racial disparity of coronavirus infections. ""This is a crisis that affects everyone and I will be a president for everyone,"" he said. ""We can get this virus under control, I promise you."" He earlier named three co-chairs and 10 members of his task force. Among the co-chairs named is Vivek Murthy, who was appointed US surgeon-general by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. One member is immunologist Rick Bright, who says he was ignored and then removed by the Trump administration over his early warnings on Covid. Mr Biden also welcomed the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that preliminary analysis showed their vaccine in development could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection But he also warned it was ""important to understand that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away"". He plans to speak in Delaware on Tuesday about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the healthcare reform law that extended healthcare access for millions. BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says that Mr Biden's choice to address the pandemic as the first public event for his new transition team afforded him an opportunity to look and act like a man who will soon be president, despite Donald Trump's decision to not concede defeat.

'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win On Monday, Covid cases in the US since the epidemic began passed 10 million, and there have been more than 237,000 deaths recorded so far,Johns Hopkins research shows,external. Donald Trump also welcomed the vaccine statement, tweeting it was ""such great news"". They reportedly include a slew of executive orders -written orders issued by the presidentto the federal government that do not require congressional approval - aimed at reversing controversial Trump policies. They are in draft form and cannot be issued until Mr Biden takes office. According to US media: Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization He will end thetravel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children Mr Biden also aims to make addressing racism a key policy, including better access to affordable housing for black and minority communities. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Kamala Harris call for unity in victory speeches Mr Biden wants to transform US policing, including banning the use of chokeholds, and to reduce the US prison population, which at more than two million people is the biggest in the world. Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? However, for the transition process to begin, the support of the General Services Administration is needed to access government funds and communicate with the federal agencies it will be staffing. Its administrator, Emily Murphy, has not started the process nor indicated when she will do so, sparking concern among some Democrats that Mr Trump will try to impede the transition process. The vast majority of the president's tweets have continued to call the electoral process into question. Mr Trump, the first president to lose a re-election bid since 1992, has launched an array of lawsuits backing claims of fraud for which no evidence has yet been presented. Five US voters who changed the race Being with Trump the day he lost the election One of his lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, on Monday said there were ""unlawful votes"" in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and Nevada. ""We will prove it all,"" he said. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" Mr Trump still plans rallies to back his challenge, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. Most Republicans have remained silent on Mr Biden's projected election victory, favouring the unveiling of full results. The New York Times said advisers had told Mr Trump the chances of legal success were not high but that he was not yet ready to accept the loss. Mr Trump has vowed to take legal action as far as the Supreme Court. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to argue this in state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. Former President George W Bush was one Republican who did congratulate Mr Biden, calling him a ""good man"". Votes in some states continue to be counted and results are never official until final certification in the weeks following the election. This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in state capitals to vote on 14 December. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?
