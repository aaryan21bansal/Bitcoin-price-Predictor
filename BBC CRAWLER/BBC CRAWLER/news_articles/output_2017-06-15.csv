PM orders public inquiry into tower fire,"This video can not be played Victim's brother recounts final call: ""He said: 'Why did you leave me?'."" Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered a full public inquiry into the fire that engulfed a west London block of flats, killing at least 17 people. That figure is expected to rise, as fire chiefs do not expect to find any more survivors in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington. The PM said people ""deserve answers"" as to why the fire spread so rapidly. The first victim has been named by the Syria Solidarity Campaign asSyrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali, 23. Six victims of the blaze have been provisionally identified, Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said, but ""there is a risk that sadly we may not be able to identify everybody"". Asked about the number of dead, Cdr Cundy said: ""I hope it is not triple figures, but I can't be drawn on the numbers."" In a statement, the Syria Solidarity Campaign said Mr Alhajali, a civil engineering student, had been in a flat on the 14th floor when the fire broke out, and had spent two hours on the phone to a friend in Syria. He had been trying to get through to his family while he was waiting to be rescued. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far The group said: ""Mohammed bid his friend goodbye, saying that the fire had reached him. He asked his friend to pass on the message to his family... ""Mohammed undertook a dangerous journey to flee war and death in Syria, only to meet it here in the UK, in his own home. ""Mohammed came to this country for safety and the UK failed to protect him."" His older brother, Omar, told the BBC he had lost Mohammed on the way out of the building. The prime minister spoke to fire commissioner Dany Cotton as she surveyed the damage Earlier, Mrs May made a private visit to the scene, where she spoke to Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton and members of the emergency services. She said: ""[They] told me that the way this fire had spread and took hold of the building was rapid, it was ferocious, it was unexpected. ""So it is right that, in addition to the immediate fire report that will be produced and any potential police investigation, that we do have a full public inquiry to get to the bottom of this."" This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited the site and spoke to locals Number 10 confirmed the public inquiry will be judge-led. Sources say the government hopes to announce the name of the judge ""soon"", the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said one of the issues the inquiry would consider was whether the tower block had been refurbished in a safe way. This video can not be played Watch: London Mayor Sadiq Khan heckled at tower Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also visited the site, meeting residents affected by the fire. He told community leaders ""the truth has to come out"". The Labour MP Harriet Harman criticised Mrs May for not meeting residents,writing on Twitter,external: ""She should have been prepared to listen to them."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May's team believed the decision not to visit residents was made for the right reasons. ""They didn't want to get in the way, they wanted to allow the emergency effort to carry on unimpeded and, frankly, it is just not her style to have TV cameras trailing her every move,"" she said. But she said the decision could ""prove to be a miscalculation"" because events like this ""can require real displays of empathy"". By Brian Wheeler, BBC News Public inquiries are set up for many reasons. Sometimes they are designed to expose the truth after a controversy, or apportion blame to individuals. More often, they simply produce recommendations, which the government can choose to follow or not. Recent examples include Leveson, into press standards, and Chilcot, into the Iraq war. They differ from police investigations or probes by official bodies because they are conducted, in part at least, in public. They might even be televised. They can be run by a judge, with witnesses giving evidence under oath, but there is no fixed model. Much depends on the ""terms of reference"". They can also drag on for years and cost millions of pounds, although the government says it wants the Grenfell Tower inquiry to ""move with speed"". Rydon, the company that carried out the Â£8.6m refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, said it welcomed the announcement of the public inquiry. It said it had carried out a partial refurbishment which ""met all required building regulations as well as fire regulation and health and safety standards"". This video can not be played One eyewitness said he saw people blinking lights within the building The tower is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation on behalf of the council. In its latest statement,external, it offered its ""sincere and heartfelt condolences"" to those affected and said its immediate concern and focus was working with the council to assist the residents of the tower block. Baby 'dropped to safety from tower' Eyewitnesses recall harrowing night Philip Hammond pulls out of Mansion House speech One of the first images from inside the tower shows a small fire still burning inside one flat Housing minister Alok Sharma said the government was working with the local authority to ensure that  ""every single family will be re-housed in the local area"". Fire minister Nick Hurd called the fire a ""national tragedy"" and said there was ""no room for plodding bureaucracy"". He said there should be ""no stone unturned on this because we completely understand the shock, the concern, the anger, the frustration, the fear that is out there"". Sniffer dogs have been sent in to search for evidence Firefighters were called to the 24-storey residential tower in the early hours of Wednesday, at a time when hundreds of people were inside, most of them sleeping. Many were woken by neighbours, or shouts from below, and fled the building. 'Donations turned away' as people rally round Grenfell Tower residents MPs demand answers over tower fire What you can do to help Fire crews rescued 65 adults and children, but some stayed in their homes, trapped by smoke and flames. Thirty people remain in hospital - 15 of whom are in a critical condition. The Queen said her ""thoughts and prayers"" were with families. By Mario Cacciottolo, BBC News Father Bisrat Berhanu, 55, is an Orthodox priest and lives in Lancaster Way. He's been in the area for 19 years. He would visit people in Grenfell Tower, knew families there, and is shocked at what's happened. ""The community is dynamic, it's close,"" he says. ""The people in the tower blocks knew each other, they were like a family. I've met people who lived there. We've cried together. ""We're feeling shock and shock. Everyone's been ringing me, even people from overseas, asking just what has happened."" Read more from Mario On Thursday morning, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said a brief search of all floors in the tower had been carried out, but ""a good half"" of the building had yet to be searched in detail. The cause of the fire, which took more than 24 hours to bring under control, remains unknown. Hundreds of pairs of donated shoes have been laid out in the Westway Sports Centre Photographs and messages in English and Arabic have been left for loved ones on a wall of condolence near the tower block. Alongside them are words of anger and calls for justice, with people saying their safety concerns were not listened to. Student helps Grenfell residents before exam The man who filmed the Grenfell fire The government has said checks were now planned on tower blocks that have gone through a similar upgrade. An emergency number -0800 0961 233- has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. Those who have reported someone as missing, but have since found them, are also asked to get in touch with police.

Fragile government facing huge challenge,"Theresa May met firefighters but not residents of Grenfell Tower Any government trying to deal with a terrible event like theGrenfell Tower disasterneeds sensitivity and nimbleness. Ministers have a complicated ""to do"" list - make sure help gets to where it is required, turn on the taps for emergency cash and show that it is willing and brave enough to work out how it could have happened, in order to give any credible answer to the common cry of ""something must be done"". PM orders public inquiry into tower fire Corbyn 'angry' over Grenfell fire What we know so far But this government is already so fragile, facing pressure on many fronts, the PM still reeling from the election result only a week ago. This is a huge political challenge that would test the most secure and most deft team, not least because the grim expectation at Westminster is that any inquiry may suggest that over the years, successive generations of politicians have just not paid enough attention to social housing. There are layers of accountability here, the housing association, the developers, the council, the government, but few expect the political class will be covered in glory. And while the prime minister's decision not to visit victims but fire crews and volunteers instead was made, Number 10 believes, for the right reasons, it may, in time prove to be a miscalculation. Moments like this can require empathy, not just getting on with the almost impossible job.

'Sorrow at tower fire turns to anger',"The UK's national front pages are again dominated by the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Against the backdrop of the charred building, the Daily Mirror's headline reads simply: ""Criminal"". ""We need answers. We need change,"" the paper says. ""Now the anger,"" is the headline on the Sun's front page, which says ""sadness has given way to fury as angry locals demand to know how the inferno was allowed to happen."" The Daily Telegraph talks ofa ""litany of failings"",external, whilethe Daily Mail says,externalministers are facing three disturbing questions: was the lethal cladding chosen to meet environmental targets; why were families told to stay in their flats; and how many other ""tinder box towers"" are there? The i newspaper quotes from the planning application submitted before the block's recent refurbishment. It said cladding would improve the environmental performance of the building and its appearance. Meanwhile,the Sun says,externalthe cladding covers thousands of homes and offices across Britain; numerous schemes have made use of it ""to get green energy ticks"". The Times reports,externalthat particular type of cladding used on Grenfell Tower is banned in the US on buildings taller than 40ft (12m) - for fire safety reasons. It says the manufacturer makes two fire-resistant alternatives, but they are more expensive. The paper calculates the difference in cost at Grenfell Tower would have amounted to less than Â£5,000 for the entire building. There were also further heart-rending accounts of the horrors at Grenfell Tower - as well as the heroism. The Sun says,externalone father got his pregnant wife and youngest daughter down the smoke-filled stairs from the 21st floor, climbing over bodies on the way. Marcio Gomes, an Ofsted inspector, says he and his family had been instructed to stay put for two hours by emergency operators; but by 04:30 BST the blaze had reached his windows and he realised he had to act to save his family. Another woman tells the paper she saved her family by running a bath and letting it flood the floors; it kept the flames at bay until crews reached her flat at 03:00. The Daily Mail tells,externalhow a young Italian couple who were engaged to be married phoned their parents from their flat on the 23rd floor to say goodbye. The architecture graduates moved to London three months ago to look for work and were captivated by the views of the capital from their flat, often posting pictures on social media. One had shown a rainbow across the city skyline, with the word: ""Spectacular"". Away from the North Kensington fire, several papers round on shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has reportedly called for a million protesters to take to the streets to call for Theresa May to leave Downing Street. ""Our democracy has no place for the mob,"" says theDaily Telegraph in a lengthy editorial,external. ""We had an election last week,""says the Daily Express,,externaladding that ""whichever way you cut it, Labour lost"". There's a similar message in the Daily Mail, which tells Mr McDonnell: ""We live in a democracy and our arguments are settled in Westminster."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Student loan debt in the UK has risen to more than Â£100bn,according to the Guardian,external- a rise of almost 17% in a single year. The figures come from the Student Loans Company and show that England accounts for more than Â£89bn of the total. The average amount of debt accrued by each student on graduation is more than Â£32,000. Meanwhile,the Times reports,externalthat almost a dozen universities have given their vice chancellors big pay rises - despite suffering a significant fall in student numbers. It says ""university chiefs received an average package of Â£280,877 including pension contributions"". A report by the British Council - the UK's international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations - suggests that school foreign exchange trips are being killed off by excessive red tape. There is confusion over child protection rules, according to the Times. The problem is said to be contributing to a big slump in pupils taking foreign languages at GCSE level.

'Monumental U-turn' on cancer drug,"A pioneering and life-extending drug repeatedly deemed too expensive will now be offered on the NHS in England. It is the result of a confidential deal between the health service and the drug company Roche. Kadcyla, the undiscounted cost of which had been Â£90,000 per patient, adds an average of six months of life to women with a form of terminal breast cancer. Campaigners have praised the ""monumental"" U-turn, which  will benefit about 1,200 women a year. ""Tough negotiation and flexibility between the NHS and Roche means both patients and taxpayers are getting a good deal,"" said NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens. Kadcyla,  a combination of two drugs, is used to treat people with HER2-positive tumours that have spread to other parts of the body and cannot be surgically removed. Scotland decided in April to pay for the drug, but it had been deemed too expensive by the rest of the UK. In order for a drug to be approved by the regulatory body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), it has to pass a cost-effectiveness test. The full price drug worked out at Â£166,000 for every ""quality adjusted life year"" of good health. It is not clear how much of a discount has been offered, but it is understood the cost per quality adjusted life year is down to about Â£50,000. That is in line with other drugs that extend the life of terminally ill patients. Richard Erwin, general manager at Roche, said: ""Close collaboration between Roche, NHS England and NICE has resulted in NICE recommending Kadcyla as a cost-effective treatment. ""This is a positive example of how solutions can be reached when all parties show flexibility."" The Welsh government expects to offer Kadcyla as soon as an equivalent deal is agreed with Roche. And the decision could allow the drug to be prescribed in Northern Ireland too. Baroness Delyth Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: ""This is exceptionally good news... we are absolutely delighted."" She added: ""Today's landmark decision bodes well for patients looking for reassurances that modern cancer treatments can get through to NHS patients more quickly and can bring transformational improvements in patient outcomes for the future."" A petition by the charity to get Kadcyla funded had amassed more than 115,000 signatures in less than a month. Gunes Kalkan, from Breast Cancer Care, said: ""This U-turn decision is monumental. ""This proves innovative treatments can be made widely available, and it is hugely frustrating this agreement did not come sooner.""

Syrian refugee is first fire victim named,"This video can not be played Victim's brother recounts final call: ""He said: 'Why did you leave me?'."" The first victim of the fire at Grenfell Tower in London has been named by a charity as a Syrian refugee. Mohammed Alhajali, who was reported to be 23, came to the UK in 2014 and was studying civil engineering while living in North Kensington. Syria Solidarity Campaign said: ""[He] undertook a dangerous journey to flee war and death in Syria, only to meet it here in the UK, in his own home."" At least 17 people died in the fire which started early on Wednesday. The charity said he had been in a flat on the 14th floor with his brother, Omar, and the pair had tried to escape, but lost each other on the way downstairs. PM orders public inquiry into tower fire London fire: What we know so far What you can do to help Omar was rescued by firefighters, but Mohammed returned to his flat and tried to call family members back in Syria. ""Mohammed was on the phone for two hours with a friend in Syria, waiting to be rescued,"" said a statement from the charity. ""He was trying to reach his family... but he could not get connected to them due to the situation in Syria. He had not seen his family for four years. ""When the fire reached his flat... Mohammed bid his friend goodbye. He asked his friend to pass on the message to his family."" Emergency services believe that 17 people have died so far as a result of the fire Both Mohammed and Omar had been due to join the charity with another brother on Saturday as part of The Great Get Together - celebrating the life of murdered MP Jo Cox - and Refugee Week. Now the event will be used to pay tribute to Mohammed and the others who lost their lives in the fire. The charity called for a ""thorough investigation"" into building regulations, adding: ""Mohammed came to this country for safety and the UK failed to protect him."" Mohammed's family told the BBC that Omar was being treated in King's College Hospital and was improving. They are trying to get UK visas for their parents so they can come from Damascus to see Mohammed's body.

Prince Andrew: Make the most of Brexit,"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Brexit glass half full UK businesses face several years of uncertainty and upheaval due to Brexit, the Duke of York has told the BBC. However, businesses should make the most of new international opportunities, Prince Andrew said. He added that he is ""as much in the dark as anyone else"" about Brexit. It is highly unusual for members of the Royal Family to comment publicly on contentious political issues and Prince Andrew is the first senior member of his family to address Brexit. He told the BBC's Sharanjit Leyl that firms were cautious about Brexit, but that the UK ""should be engaging with as many different markets as we possibly can and looking at the best of things rather than necessarily the worst of things"". The prince added: ""You can either look at it as a glass half-empty - which is: 'Oh my God, why have we done this?' ""Or you could look at it as a glass half-full, which is: 'Ok, that's where we are. There are opportunities that we've got to make.' ""So... you may lose one thing but you may gain something else. ""The world is your oyster."" There are business opportunities in the 52 Commonwealth nations, as well as China and the US, the duke said. ""We've been concentrating on 27 countries, if you take that as an internal market. ""There's an external market that's a lot bigger, and many businesses hadn't looked over that garden fence to some extent. ""And in my experience recently, businesses that look over the garden fence have gone: ""Hmm, [the] grass is not quite as dark and unforgiving as you might expect. ""And actually, getting over the fence, there might be some fresh grass out there."" The Queen's son was in Singapore to attend a Commonwealth science conference. He was also hosting Pitch@Palace, a programme he started to support entrepreneurs from the UK and around the world. Prince Andrew was a trade envoy for the UK from 2001 until mid-2011, when he stepped down. His remit was to promote UK business interests abroad. Following the general election last week, business leaders said theywanted a new direction for Brexit negotiations, with a renewed focus, and more specifics. Manufacturers called on the UK governmentto adopt a more pro-business stance, or face political instability that may force more firms to alter their plans ""away from the UK"". In his Mansion House speech on Thursday, which was cancelled following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, Chancellor Philip Hammond had been expected to reassure businesses that the governmentwas ready to step in with extra financial support, as the Brexit deal is negotiated, if needed. And at a joint news conference this week, French President Emmanuel Macron said the possibility of the UK remaining in the European Unionis an option until Brexit negotiations have concluded.

Top university under cyber-attack,"University College London says it faced a ""widespread ransomware attack"" University College London, one of the world's leading universities, has been hit by a major cyber-attack. The university describes it as a ""ransomware"" attack, such as last month's cyber-attack which threatened NHS computer systems. The attack was continuing on Thursday, with access to online networks being restricted. The university has warned staff and students of the risk of data loss and ""very substantial disruption"". University College London (UCL) is a ""centre of excellence in cyber-security research"", a status awarded by the GCHQ intelligence and monitoring service. The central London university, ranked last week in the world's top 10, says that a ""widespread ransomware attack"" began on Wednesday. It was first blamed on so-called ""phishing"" emails, with links to destructive software. But later the university suggested it was more likely to be from contact with a ""compromised"" website, where clicking on a pop-up page might have spread a malware infection. Ransomware attacks are where computer systems are locked and threatened with damaging software unless payments are made. Students and staff were warned that ""ransomware damages files on your computer and on shared drives where you save files"" and were told not to open any suspicious attachments. The university says that it believes the risk of further infection has been contained, but it is urging staff and students to help with efforts to reduce any ""further spread of this malware"". Universities, which often carry out commercially sensitive research, have become frequent targets for cyber-attacks. ""However, what makes this attack interesting is the timing,"" said Graham Rymer, an ethical hacker and research associate at the University of Cambridge. ""Hackers tend to target people who will be desperate to get access to their data and are, therefore, more likely to pay the ransom. ""Currently there are a lot of students who will be putting the final touches to their dissertations, so it could be that they were the targets."" Mr Rymer said UCL seemed to have responded well to the attack and had ""locked it down pretty well"". ""One thing UCL did is to quickly switch all drives in the system to ""read-only"" following the attack, which essentially prevented the malware from doing real damage."" Mr Rymer said UCL may not have been the only intended target as he had seen other businesses facing the same malware.

Shearer settles 'negligent advice' claim,"Alan Shearer is now a Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer has agreed a settlement after launching a Â£9m damages claim over ""negligent"" financial advice. The 46-year-old former England and Newcastle striker was suing financial adviser Kevin Neal and pensions specialist Suffolk Life. A trial began at the High Court in London on Wednesday, but a lawyer representing Mr Shearer told the judge an agreement had now been reached. Barrister Gerard McMeel said the terms of the agreement were confidential. Lawyers had indicated that the case centred on a pension worth about Â£4m. The Match of the Day pundit alleged Mr Neal had been ""careless"" and ""dishonest"", while Suffolk Life had breached its regulatory duties. Both Suffolk Life and Mr Neal disputed the claims, with Mr Neal describing them as driven by ""pure greed and ego"". Mr Shearer was also suing two defunct companies, Kevin Neal Associates and Kevin Neal Associates Wealth Management. In his 18-year playing career, Shearer made more than 550 club appearances, for Newcastle, Southampton and Blackburn, and won 63 England caps.

Corbyn 'angry' over Grenfell fire,"This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited the site and spoke to locals Empty flats in North Kensington should be ""requisitioned if necessary"" for people left homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire, Jeremy Corbyn says. The Labour leader has also said he is ""very angry"" that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire. PM Theresa May said the residents were ""in our thoughts and prayers"" and has ordered a public inquiry into the fire. But she was criticised by a senior Labour MP for failing to meet residents when she visited the scene on Thursday. At least 17 people died in the disaster at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London in the early hours of Wednesday. Reality Check: Can the government requisition homes? PM orders public inquiry Six questions for the investigators Live updates Mr Corbyn, who earlier released a statement saying he was ""very angry that it was possible for the fire to spread in the way it did,"" said people living in high-rise flats would be frightened following the Grenfell Tower disaster and needed answers to give them ""peace of mind"". And he told MPs on Thursday: ""The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it's the wealthiest part of the country. ""The ward where this fire took place is, I think the poorest ward in the whole country. ""And properties must be found, requisitioned if necessary, in order to make sure those residents do get re-housed locally. ""It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live."" Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid promised the government would ""act immediately"" and will do ""whatever is required"", even if it costs billions of pounds. Asked if this could include high rise blocks being knocked down, he said: ""I think there's no place that we can't go now to make properties safe in terms of learning from this."" But Mr Javid stressed that the government's response must be led by evidence from the fire investigators' report. This video can not be played Communities minister Sajid Javid tells Today the Grenfell Tower fire should not have happened He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""Whatever they tell us, that is exactly what we need to deal with and we need to deal with it immediately - there will be no bars to that. We will deal with it, but we have to be led by the expert opinion on this."" Asked whether dealing with the findings would include evacuating other buildings, Mr Javid said: ""Whatever they tell us is necessary to make those people safe, there can be no shortcuts to this."" Mrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the fire. Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people. Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited. Mr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: ""People are angry and I share that anger."" Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed. But Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harmanwrote on Twitter:,external""Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV."" The prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the ""professionalism and bravery"" of the emergency services. She pledged that the government ""stands ready to provide every assistance"" to the council and emergency services. ""I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home."" She has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected. But MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended. At the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: ""What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy."" He said the ""exceptionally complex"" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for ""plodding bureaucracy"" in the official response. ""It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,"" he said. Only part of the specially-arranged meeting was filmed by the Commons authorities Answers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said. ""Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried."" Shadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry. The new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety. The government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said. At the end of the meeting, he promised ""every single family"" would be re-housed in the local area. Theresa May spoke to emergency workers when she visited the scene Earlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, ""to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated"". Labour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately. Recommendations made after afire in a tower blockin Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations. In October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had ""publicly committed"" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire. Mr Healey said this review had ""not been started"". This video can not be played London fire: PM orders full public inquiry ""The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,"" he said. Responding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was ""simply not true"" that a report about building regulations had been ""sat on"". The BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry. He or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness. The Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.

'Working class aren't being listened to',"Maria Vigo says North Kensington's working class are being pushed out by affluent outsiders Maria Vigo has lived opposite Grenfell Tower for 11 years, and she's upset. Not just with the fire that claimed so many lives in the block she can see from her kitchen window. She's also upset with how expensive her local playgroup has become, and how the people of North Kensington can't afford the properties in the area. But - most of all - she's upset that she's not being listened to. ""There was a lot of anger on the school run this morning,"" she says. ""There's a lot of separation between classes and people are telling me that it's down to social cleansing."" Maria says people are angry that things didn't work in the tower, and that there weren't any sprinklers. ""They need to train us how to get out of buildings safely, not just put up a fire notice,"" she says. The mother of two, whose children both have special needs, talks of how, years ago, the affluence of Knightsbridge spilled into parts of Kensington, then Notting Hill, then Holland Park. She puts her hands into a circle. ""We feel like we're being surrounded."" Maria was born in the area, and talks about how local playgroups have been privatised. ""If they were Â£2 and now they're Â£7.50, then no-one can afford to take their kids there."" She speaks without drawing breath, frustration spilling out. ""This area's always been working class. It's starting to become a bit less so now, and the working class are feeling that they're being left without a voice. ""The council isn't listening to us. We don't want a pretty building. They should ask us 'What do we need? or 'What would we like?'"" Maria also says a desire for profits is encroaching on the lives of working-class locals. ""Properties are being built in this area that aren't being bought by people in the local community."" The area around Grenfell Tower is busy, especially near Latimer Road tube, but voices are low and sombre. People stand huddled in groups, looking downcast. Some don't want to talk to the press. Others take photographs of the blackened block; a scar in the sky that dominates everyone's thoughts. Young men in sports gear and oversized caps, old men in shirts and trousers, and women in hijabs, all pull out their phones to take photographs of the soot-stained tower, bits of which float onto the street. People's faces screw up as they look up. No-one can believe what they're seeing. Some North Kensington locals say they are being priced out of their own area Snatches of conversation can be heard in the streets. ""Can you imagine how desperate..."" says one man to a woman as they walk. People drive to various churches and buildings that are now refuge centres, trying to hand over bundles of clothes, but they're politely turned away. One man pulls up to Latymer Community Church in a van, with two big bags of clothes. He's turned away as there are too many clothes being donated now. He sticks them into his white van, explaining that he's from Essex but was passing and wanted to help. He grins, helplessly. In the streets, it looks like a mass house move is under way - cars are stuffed with bin liners. Their drivers call out to pedestrians and police officers for directions to drop-off centres. They too are told their kindness can't be accepted, that so much has been donated, but that nappies are still needed. Father Bisrat Berhanu, 55, is an Orthodox priest and lives in Lancaster Way. He's been around here for 19 years. He would visit people in Grenfell Tower, knew families there, and is shocked at what's happened. ""The community is dynamic, it's close,"" he says. ""The people in the tower blocks knew each other, they were like a family. I've met people who lived there. We've cried together. ""We're feeling shock. Everyone's been ringing me, even people from overseas, asking just what has happened."" He too says that locals feel like they're being pushed out by affluence, that numbers mean more than people do. ""There are conspiracy theories but I don't get into that. We need love and kindness, to try and cure the wound, and cure people's hearts."" Christina Simmons says she hopes the community will come closer together now Christina Simmons, 56, lives in a street close to the tower and has been a local for 27 years. She's disabled and has difficulty walking. ""People are coming together and rallying together,"" she says. ""I didn't realise we had so many Eritreans and Somalians, they've all come out to offer support."" She too believes that ""they aren't listening to us,"" a phrase she repeats several times. ""Roads were closed recently because of gas works apparently. Well, I didn't see any works. It creates chaos and I can't walk very far. No-one told us they were closing the roads. ""They don't listen to us. We're being neglected and ignored. I'm bloody angry."" But she does soften her tone, after expressing sympathy for the horrors for those caught up in the fire. ""I'd like to see some community meetings,"" she says. ""Maybe this'll all bring us closer together.""

Bank surprises with interest rate vote,"UK interest rates have been kept on hold at 0.25%, but in a surprise move three of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee backed a rate rise. The 5-3 vote by the Bank's policymakers was the closest for a rate rise since 2007, and comes with inflation close to a four-year high of 2.9%. Inflation is now well above the Bank's target rate of 2%. News of the vote pushed the pound up by more than a cent against the dollar, although it fell back later. Ian McCafferty, Michael Saunders and Kristin Forbes were the three members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) who voted for an increase. Ms Forbes had been the sole vote in favour of a rise at the MPC's previous two meetings. However, the decision of Mr Saunders and Mr McCafferty to back an increase as well surprised economists. ""The more hawkish tone of the MPC appears to reflect some concern about inflation - which has accelerated faster than it expected over recent months and is now forecast to exceed 3% this year - as well as the strength of employment that is continuing to erode slack in the labour market,"" Capital Economics said. Pound jumps on surprise Bank vote Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell said it appeared that the ""willingness of the MPC to 'look through' higher inflation and leave rates on hold is wearing thin, and if inflation continues to surprise we could see higher rates by the end of the summer"". Sterling, which had been trading below $1.27 before the minutes were released, surged to almost $1.28 in response, while the FTSE 100 share index was down more than 1%. In the minutes of its meeting, the MPC said the ""driving force"" behind the recent pickup in inflation had remained the depreciation of sterling that followed the Brexit vote in June last year. However, it added that a ""number of indicators of domestically generated inflationary pressure"" had also increased in recent months. The committee said inflation could exceed 3% by the autumn and was expected to remain above the 2% target for an ""extended period"" as the weaker pound pushed up prices while pay growth remained ""subdued"". The three MPC members who voted to raise rates were swayed by the inflation fears, and also took into account growth in ""business investment and net trade"" which appear ""on track"" to compensate for weaker consumption. They also thought that interest rates would still leave monetary policy ""very supportive"". However, the five committee members who voted to leave rates unchanged took into account the recent slowdown in consumer spending and economic growth as a whole. They said ""it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent"", that would be. ""It is as yet unclear to what degree weaker consumption would be offset by other components of demand"". the minutes said. While different members of the MPC placed different weights on these arguments, the minutes said that ""all committee members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent"". Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, said: ""This gradual shift in stance represents the MPC's efforts to foretell and communicate a forthcoming hike. Don't ignore it."" However, other economists said it could still be some time before the Bank votes to rise rates. ""It is far from certain that interest rates will rise in the near term,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""There is the potential for the balance of views to alter, with the imminent changes in the MPC's membership. Kristin Forbes who has been a strong advocate of raising interest rates is now leaving the MPC, while another member is due to appointed as the committee is currently one short.""

Mystery person hands over WW1 ship's bell,"The bell was left at Swanage Pier in the early hours of the morning A bell from a ship involved in one of Britain's worst off-shore disasters has apparently been found in a plastic bag left anonymously for a BBC reporter. It bears the name of the SS Mendi which sank off the Isle of Wight during World War One, killing more than 600 black South African labourers. The bell is thought to have been stripped from the wreck by divers. Maritime archaeologist John Gribble, who has surveyed the ship, said the bell was probably genuine. BBC reporter Steve Humphrey said the anonymous donor phoned him on Wednesday after seeing recent coverage of the Mendi centenary. Mr Humphrey arranged to arrive at Swanage Pier in the early hours to find the bell in a plastic bag. A note in the bag read: ""If I handed it in myself it might not go to the rightful place. ""This needs to be sorted out before I pass away as it could get lost."" More than 800 members of the South African Native Labour Corps were on board the Mendi at the time of the disaster ""The bell has never been reported found, but given the extent to which the site was stripped of non-ferrous metals in the past I'd be very surprised if the bell was still on the wreck"", Mr Gribble said. ""The bell looks right. It's the right sort of size for a bell of that period."" The SS Mendi sank on 21 February 1917 when it was accidentally rammed in thick fog by the Royal Mail packet-boat SS Darro. A government inquiry said the Darro failed to lower lifeboats, leaving 646 men to drown. Most of the dead were members of the South African Native Labour Corps (SANLC), heading to France to do manual labour on the Western Front. In 1995 the Queen and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial to the Mendi victims The Darro's captain, who was blamed for the tragedy by the Board of Trade, was handed a one-year suspension of his master's certificate. The story became a symbol of racial injustice in South Africa, where successive white-led governments discouraged annual Mendi Day commemorations. In 1995, the Queen and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial to the Mendi victims in Soweto. A note was left with the bell in the early hours This video can not be played A bell, apparently from the wreck of the WW1 ship SS Mendi, is found in a plastic bag The government's Receiver of Wreck said the bell would probably be given to a museum while a decision was made about its future.

Nigeria's secret Facebook women,"It is one of Facebook's fastest growing communities and has become such a phenomenon that last week, Mark Zuckerberg asked to meet its founder. But what is Fin? Female IN or Fin is a ""secret"" Facebook group that has recently clocked up over a million members, largely from Nigeria. But it's a secret that founder Lola Omolola wants you to know all about - if you're a woman that is. Though it has a vaguely romantic air, secret is just Facebook terminology, Ms Omolola says. It means invitation-only - you need to know a member to get in. ""It's a safe place, for a woman who has something to say,"" Ms Omolola explains. ""You don't have to agree but it is her story, she can say it."" The group is a sort of confessional space, where women share stories that they might be uncomfortable - or even afraid - to tell in person. It doesn't offer anonymity - members have to post under their real names. And the stories are stunning, although they remain strictly confidential. In the few days that I've been a Finster, I've read testimonies on domestic abuse, physical and emotional violence, child abuse and rape. One woman speaks about the moment she told her parents she was about to have a child as a single girl of 17, another about finally being accepted as a lesbian by her mother after many years. They are brave and intimate, telling of failed relationships or unconventional sexual preferences. The posts are brutally honest but many of them are laced with self-deprecating humour. Like the woman who mortified herself on a first date in front of a banquet hall of people or the lady who stole the keys of a bus driver after he bumped her car and refused to apologise. Many of the stories speak of a distinctly Nigerian experience. Finsters meet up in real life too Until recently the group was called Female In Nigeria, so it's not a surprise that most of its members are just that. ""The Nigerian woman has been the core of this process, because I am a Nigerian woman,"" says Ms Omolola. A former journalist, she moved from Nigeria to the US in the early 2000s at the age of 24 and started the group in 2015. She had had an idea to start something for some time - a forum where Nigerian women could talk openly about the issues that affected them. But it was the kidnap of theChibok girlsthat drove her to do it. ""I knew the cause of it,"" she says. ""When you grow up in a place where a woman's voice is not even valid, everything reinforces that idea that we're not good enough."" It didn't surprise her that a group of men could kidnap and enslave these girls, because they didn't see them as equals. ""Between the ages of three and six I noticed that whenever a girl shows any sign of self-awareness she gets silenced. When I said anything I got a pinch - a real, live pinch."" Those pinches came from aunties, uncles, even her mother but never from her father. And it's him that Ms Omolola traces her early feminism to. Her father was a part-time businessman and was often at home with the children while her mum worked as full-time haematologist. ""We never felt any gender disparity,"" she says. ""I realise now how much effort it must have taken. It was not something he was just stumbling into. It was an active choice."" The group are unusually open with each other Fin started out as a group where women could discuss women's issues - one of the first blogs was on domestic violence - and Ms Omolola expected it to be an abstract conversation. But women responded with their own stories. Almost instantly it became a place where people could share things they had never shared before. ""When we started I used to cry. I stopped sleeping, I stopped eating,"" she says. ""I was not ready for the stories that were coming out."" ""There were women who had been abused for 40 years and hadn't told anyone. No-one should live like that."" Now the group gets hundreds of applications for posts every day but they are managed and approved by a group of 28 volunteers. About 40-100 make it on the page. Fin has strict rules. Above anything else, Finsters are not allowed to judge each other.  Any negative comments are removed, as is the member who posts them. ""I noticed that those people who try to shut women up in real life, they came there,"" says Ms Omolola. ""They are so deeply conditioned to work against their own interest. ""It's the online version of the pinch and the shush."" But the pinchers and shushers were persistent. In a religiously conservative society like Nigeria, expressions of female sexual freedom were never going to go unchallenged. Some members tried to get around the ban by commenting with passages from the bible which condemned the woman's actions. That inspired a second rule - no preaching. ""We prohibit religious-themed advice,"" it says in the rules. ""Fin is not a place of worship."" Lola Omolola says she makes no money from the million-strong group People have likened Fin and its founder to the devil, they've called the group evil, a corrupter of young women. Ms Omolola says she has been the subject of concerted attacks by church groups. But she's not worried. ""Most people think that the controversy would kill me,"" she says. ""They don't realise that it's actually empowering me."" After amassing a million-strong membership and a high-profile meeting with Mr Zuckerberg, what is next for Fin? Ms Omolola has dreams of expanding the group into bricks and mortar, providing centres where women can go to talk about their experiences in a safe space. But that may be a long way off. ""It needs money and right now I have none,"" she says. ""I can't even pay my rent."" It's something that she discussed with Zuckerberg and though Facebook haven't offered funding yet, she's still in conversation with it on how to move the group forward. From day one, she says, she had offers from companies who want to advertise on Fin but she has refused to monetise women's stories.

Farce? Circus? Biggest fight ever?,"This video can not be played Mayweather v McGregor: The kings of trash talk The best boxer in a generation against one of the biggest names in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Floyd Mayweather Jr, regarded - before his retirement - as the world's best pound-for-pound boxer, will fight UFC star Conor McGregor in alight-middleweight boxing contestin Las Vegas on 26 August. But how and why did the fight come about? Does McGregor have a chance? What impact will it have on the sports? And is it all just a money-making circus? BBC Sport takes a look at the history and the reaction to the contest. Floyd Mayweather has not fought since beating Andre Berto on points in September 2015 Why is it happening? Quite simply... money, with both fighters expected to earn up to $100m (Â£78.5m). After Mayweather gained a convincing points win over Andre Berto in September 2015, the American, who has won world titles at five weights, said: ""My career is over, that's official. ""You've got to know when to hang them up. There's nothing left to prove in the sport of boxing, I just want to spend time with my family."" However, there was growing interest in a fight between Mayweather and McGregor, after the Irish UFC star went on American chat show Conan and said he would ""most certainly dismantle"" Mayweather. Talks between the two camps began in May 2016 and McGregor, who has never boxed professionally or as an amateur, was granted a boxing licence in California last November. After social media insults flew from both sides, including Mayweather calling McGregor a ""little punk"", the Irishman claimed he had signed a contract for the fight and applied for a Nevada boxing licence, so it could be held in Las Vegas. However, it was still a shock to both the boxing and UFC worlds when Mayweather, whose nickname is Money, posted a video on social media confirming the fight will happen at the T-Mobile Arena on 26 August. Leonard Ellerbe, chief executive of Mayweather Promotions, said: ""There is not one place I go to with Floyd where he doesn't get asked the question: 'Floyd, are you going to fight Conor McGregor?' All Floyd thinks about is fighting Conor McGregor."" BBC Radio 5 live In Short: 'UFC will be the real winner' Mayweather, 40, never entertained the idea of the pair meeting in a UFC event, saying ""a real man fights standing up"". Therefore, a boxing bout was the only outcome. Bookmakers expect a one-sided contest, with the American as short as 1-12 to win his 50th professional fight, a landmark that would see him overtake legendary boxer Rocky Marciano, who retired after 49 victories. However, the fight has not been well received by a large number of boxers. This video can not be played McGregor will do well to lay glove on Mayweather - Frampton Mexican Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, a two-weight world champion whose only loss in 51 fights came against Mayweather in 2013, called it a ""circus and a joke"", echoing comments fromformer five-weight world champion Oscar de la Hoya. ""It's hurting the sport of boxing,"" added Alvarez. ""It's a big circus and a joke because when a fighter from boxing gets into MMA (mixed martial arts) or a fighter from MMA gets into boxing it's just a big joke. People don't take it seriously."" Ricky Hatton, the only British boxer to fight Mayweather - losing in the 10th round of their Las Vegas bout in December 2007 - feels the fight should not count on the American's boxing record. ""Conor's the biggest star in UFC and, if he gets whitewashed by Mayweather, which he would, it wouldn't look good on the UFC,""Hatton told Boxing News.,external BBC Radio 5 live boxing pundit Steve Bunce added: ""No disrespect to Conor McGregor, he is a brilliant self-publicist. ""The mixed martial arts people tell me he is fantastic because he is fearless, reckless and that makes him entertaining, but he is a hopeless boxer. ""He is a raw novice. Peter McDonagh, who has lost more times than he has won, is the Irish champion at Conor McGregor's weight, and he would beat McGregor in a 10 or 12-round fight. This will be an absolute mismatch."" Irish boxing champion Peter McDonagh would have liked to have fought McGregor McGregor, who at 28 is 12 years younger than Mayweather, has won 21 of his 24 MMA fights, including 18 knockouts, and has received some support from the UFC world. ""He has incredible power, a power that nobody else has - I've never seen anyone hit that hard,"" said Russia's Artem Lobov, who has sparred with McGregor. ""MMA is so much more demanding on the body - the wrestling, the changing levels, all that takes a lot out of you. Boxing is a breeze for us after MMA. ""If you look at Mayweather's fights, he often likes to get into the clinch, but what is a boxer in a clinch against a wrestler, an MMA fighter? Boxers are absolute novices in the clinch. ""Get a boxer and get him wrestling for a minute or two - the arms get so heavy, filled with blood, they can't even hold them up any more, they can't box."" UFC president Dana White also believes McGregor's style will cause problems for the American. ""Mayweather is 40 years old and he's always had problems with southpaws,"" said White. ""Conor McGregor is 28 and a southpaw. Whenever he hits people, they fall."" American MMA fighter Holly Holm, who ended Ronda Rousey's unbeaten run with a brutal knockout in 2015, thinks McGregor will be able to adapt. ""I'm one of those who believes in being able to cross over,"" said Holm. ""Boxing is a whole different world, but Conor really believes in himself, and he's going to put up a good fight."" White, for one, is in no doubt. He said: ""It's definitely going to be the biggest fight ever in combat sports history and probably going to be the biggest pay day ever. All sides involved are pretty happy with their deals."" The T-Mobile Arena holds 20,000 people, so the fighters will be performing live in front of less than a quarter of the 90,000 people who watched Anthony Joshua's thrilling win over Wladimir Klitschko in their world heavyweight title clash at Wembley Stadium in April. However, the money will come not only from the live gate, but also through international television distribution, sponsorships, closed circuit and merchandise sales. When Mayweather fought Filipino Manny Pacquiao in May 2015, the fight attracted a record of 4.4 million American pay-per-view sales, with the event generating more than $500m (Â£392.7m) in gross worldwide receipts. Tickets will be in extremely short supply.Only 1,000 of 16,500 tickets were put on general salefor the Mayweather v Pacquiao fight at the MGM Grand - and some were then sold online for as much as Â£94,000. The rest of the tickets went to fighters, sponsors and promoters. Such was the demand, hotels and bars charged people to watch the action on big-screen televisions. Stephen Espinoza, executive vice-president of American television station Showtime Sports, said fans will pay to watch the McGregor-Mayweather fight because of the novelty. ""The sky is the limit,"" he said. ""There is nothing to compare it against. No-one has seen this type of competition in the ring. ""We're not only drawing fans from the universe of boxing fans and the universe of MMA fans. We've actually tapped into the audience that really doesn't follow either sport."" Sort of. On two high-profile occasions, boxers have tried their luck in the UFC octagon, with one winning and one losing. Most recently, in August 2010, James Toney - a three-weight boxing champion who had no MMA experience - took on Randy Couture. It did not last long. Within a minute, Couture had produced a single-leg takedown. He then fired a series of unanswered lefts and rights to Toney's head before the fight was stopped. Ray Mercer gained a win over former UFC heavyweight champion Tim Sylvia in 2009 The other time the worlds of MMA and boxing collided was in June 2009, when boxer Ray Mercer took on former UFC heavyweight champion Tim Sylvia. Again, it did not last long - nine seconds in fact. Mercer, who had fought Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko, caught Sylvia with a crushing right hook with the first punch of the contest, knocking out his opponent. In 1976, Muhammad Ali took part in a 15-round exhibition contest with Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki. The bout - a mix of boxing and wrestling that had little to do with serious sport  - ended in a draw. Former IBF world middleweight champion Darren Barker expects it to be one-sided, but go on for 12 rounds British light-heavyweight champion Frank Buglioni does not expect it to be competitive British light-welterweight title contender Tommy Coyle says the fight is only happening because of the money involved British middleweight champion Tommy Langford was asked what he thought of the contest. He was not impressed Irish UFC fighter Paul Redmond remembers when Randy Couture beat American heavyweight boxer James Toney in a UFC contest It is a mixture of emotions for American middleweight UFC fighter Derek Brunson American middleweight UFC fighter Tim Kennedy is upset at the differences in pay between MMA and boxing American welterweight fighter Matt Brown expects Floyd Mayweather to beat Conor McGregor Read more: How the world reacted to McGregor-Mayweather Mike Costello, BBC Radio 5 live boxing correspondent One of boxing's all-time greats will take on a man who hasn't had a single professional boxing contest and it'll become one of the most talked-about sporting events of 2017. Mayweather is coming out of retirement at the age of 40 for a fight some have dismissed as a farce and a mismatch. McGregor is 12 years younger and the biggest draw in UFC, the most successful and popular brand in mixed martial arts. Insults have been traded for two years - when they first started, nobody believed for a moment this fight would happen. They both draw huge audiences on pay-per-view TV and the showdown is likely to generate tens of millions of dollars for each man. It's likely to be televised in the United States by Showtime, a cable network and one of the biggest investors in boxing in recent years. Executives there are saying their digital traffic in the past few weeks is leading them to believe this will be nothing short of a monster event and it's been built by the hype generated by these two masters of the art of hype. Conor McGregor beat Eddie Alvarez to win the UFC lightweight championship in November Simon Head, MMA reporter To the uninitiated, Conor McGregor may come across as a brash, overconfident braggart, but a glance at his record tells a completely different story. Underneath the larger-than-life exterior lies a fierce, dedicated competitor who has more often than not backed up his pre-fight talk with big-time performances in the UFC octagon. He successfully predicted his stoppage wins over Chad Mendes, Jose Aldo and Eddie Alvarez in successive UFC title fights. Now he's predicting he'll topple the most skilled boxer in this - or perhaps any - generation. Even by Mystic Mac's own standards, this one is a big ask. The contest itself pitches a combat sport specialist (Mayweather) against a man blessed with one of the most comprehensive skillsets in combat sports (McGregor). The equivalent of a 100m sprinter against a decathlete, if you like. But in those terms, this fight is the 100m. Only a fraction of McGregor's formidable fighting arsenal will be in play here, and that tips the scales significantly in Mayweather's favour. As well as the skills gap in pure boxing terms, there's also the issue of prep time. Conor has the dedication, the intelligence and the belief to walk into the T-Mobile Arena on August 26 as prepared as he possibly can be. But this is the equivalent of writing a PhD thesis without taking the course first. A passing grade is surely just making it to the scorecards, or even just looking competitive. But that won't be enough for McGregor, whose ability to deliver on the big stage is right up there with the best you'll find anywhere in sport. The archetypal man for the big occasion, McGregor performs best when the lights shine brightest. Mayweather is rightly the unbackable favourite, but McGregor certainly isn't a toothless opponent. Make no mistake, he has the power to trouble Floyd, especially with his left hand. But to hurt Floyd, Conor will have to land clean. In theory, he has 36 minutes to find Mayweather's chin. If he does, we'll see one of the biggest shocks in sporting history. But it wouldn't be a shock to him. He's already predicted it. And he means it, too.

The cult TV shows making a comeback,"The original Blockbusters was hosted by Bob Holness, who died in 2012 TV bosses are always looking for the next big blockbuster. ""Wait! I've got it. What about Blockbusters?"" many producers have (repeatedly) suggested in meetings over the years as the classic gameshow has been rebooted. Simon Mayo and Liza Tarbuck have both fronted recent iterations of the show, which was originally hosted by Bob Holness. And now,according to The Sun,external, the programme will be returning to our screens once more thanks to production company Thames TV. The new host hasn't yet been revealed but the format will reportedly remain the same, with players trying to make their way across a board of hexagons by answering questions. It's the latest in a long line of rebooted TV formats. The Crystal Maze returned last year, fronted by Richard Ayoade ""The 1980s and 90s was a golden era for these sort of shows,"" says Molli Mitchell, TV critic for The Daily Express. ""But ultimately, I don't think there is a huge need for them to come back. ""The initial announcement of an old favourite show such as Blind Date returning generates a lot of hype, and a lot of people watch the first few episodes, but the buzz often fades pretty quickly unless producers get it absolutely right."" She adds: ""Some will jump at the chance to watch but I think most people would rather watch a gripping drama or stream anything and everything from Netflix than be in a rush to watch a reboot of an old TV gaming show."" Here's a look at eight other recently-revamped formats - and their varying degrees of success. Millionaire has experienced something of a renaissance this year - witha new West End show about the coughing scandaland an anniversary revival of the series on ITV. There were quite a few changes made to the new TV format, however, not least the change in host from Chris Tarrant to Jeremy Clarkson. The updated ""phone a friend"" lifeline saw a producer sent to the friend's house to make sure they aren't Googling the answer during the call. And there was a brand new lifeline in the shape of ""ask the host"" - which allowed a contestant to call on Clarkson for help with the answer. But, as many contestants found out, The Grand Tour presenter's general knowledgeoften turned out to be rather limited. Nonetheless, the show itself was deemed a success andITV have commissionedmore episodes for 2019. Rylan Clark-Neal has covered a lot of ground in his TV career. He's gone from novelty X Factor contestant in 2012 to Celebrity Big Brother winner the following year, and now presents shows such as Big Brother and This Morning. Now, he looks set to step into the shoes of the late Dale Winton to present an updated take on Supermarket Sweep. Winton's death earlier this year came a few months after Fremantle TV bought the rights to the show and announced plans to reboot it. While Rylan's appointment as presenter hasn't been officially confirmed,he dropped a big hint on Twitter earlier this month,external. He posted a photo of him in a dressing room with a Supermarket Sweep script lying conspicuously on the table in front of him. He later deleted the picture, however. So because nothing has officially been confirmed yet and we don't have any promo images, please enjoy this picture of him on a Children In Need special of The Weakest Link last year. Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc are fronting the reboot of the show Dear, oh dear. The problems with this year's reboot of The Generation Game started even before it had aired. Mel and Sue climbed on board for the remake - a presenting duo normally thought to be a safe pair of hands after their huge success on Bake Off. Butthe BBC cut the number of episodesfrom four to two amid rumours many of the shows were not good enough. Critics described the ones that did air as ""desperate"" and ""a shameless carbon copy"" of the versions broadcast in the 1970s and 80s, fronted by, amongst others, Sir Bruce Forsyth. Butit was a ratings hit- attracting an average of 5.1 million viewers, according to overnight figures. It may be hard to remember a time when one of the most popular shows on TV involved a bald man from New Zealand challenging adults to solve mind puzzles in the Aztec zone. But it really happened - and The Crystal Maze was so popular it has since been brought back in two forms. Last year, it launched as a real-life ""immersive""live experiencein London and Manchester, with members of the public able to play the game for real. It's also been resurrected for our TV screens by Channel 4. Look inside the new Crystal Maze Richard O'Brien, now 75 years old, sadly did not return for the reboot, so producers went with the second most famous Richard they could find. The IT Crowd star Richard Ayoade was joined by a plethora of celebrity contestants including Louis Spence and Ore Oduba as he blew the dust out of the Medieval zone last summer. Channel 4 have now ordered more episodes for 2019. The Price Is right ran in the 1980s and 1990s on ITV with Leslie Crowther at the helm before Sir Bruce Forsyth took over. Last December's reboot of the legendary show saw Alan Carr take the reins as contestants attempt to win cash and prizes by guessing how much objects cost. Surely this must have been proper bucket list territory for Alan Carr? ""This is proper bucket list territory for me,"" said Alan Carr. ""I loved it when I was growing up and now for me to be at the helm of such a legendary show is a dream come true."" Some critics questioned whether the show needed to be brought back - but praised Carr's fronting of it. ""It's an absurdly simple and lazy idea for a 'new' show, and I blame Alan Carr entirely for the fact that I will almost certainly watch it again,""said The Guardian,external. Before people chose their potential life partners by swiping right on a dating app, there was an age where romance was something that happened in person. No honestly, look it up. Blind Date, which ran from 1985 to 2003, saw a male or female contestant pose questions to three potential partners, whom they couldn't physically see. If the chooser liked any of the definitely-not-scripted answers given by the three datees, they could select them as their Blind Date, and would be promptly whisked off to a glamorous holiday destination. Last year, the show returned for a second date courtesy of Channel 5, this time with Paul O'Grady taking over presenting duties from his friend Cilla Black, who died in 2015. And Blind Date isn't the only show that Cilla fronted which was brought back. Life may be full, full of surprises. But it's evidently not full of TV formats which can be easily resurrected. ITV clearly spotted the reboot potential in Surprise, Surprise - a warm-hearted show which, er, surprised members of the public - often reuniting them with a long-lost relative. The highlight, of course, was Cilla getting to sing the theme song at the end of every episode. It returned in 2012 with Holly Willoughby fronting the show. Sadly, she didn't get to sing, but she did enlist a star-studded cast including Lionel Richie andPharrell Williams,externalto help surprise a whole new generation of viewers. Streetmate falls into an unusual category, as last year it was rebooted for the second time. A re-reboot, if you will. It originally ran on Channel 4 from 1998 to 2001 - a set of circumstances which means it was naturally fronted by Davina McCall. ITV2 then brought it back in 2007 for a short series fronted by the afore-mentioned Holly Willoughby, but it wasn't renewed beyond its initial four episodes. Last summer though, it was Gogglebox star Scarlett Moffatt who fronted it when it relaunched, again on Channel 4. The show saw Scarlett pick a member of the public who is single, and then help them approach potential eligible partners in the street to ask them out on a date. The reboot wasn't a hit with everyone however, withThe Daily Telegraph awarding it two stars,externalin its review. ""In the age of Tinder this is clearly an absurd means of sorting the losers from the Lotharios,"" wrote Ed Power.

The duo whose single was inspired by a random Tube conversation,"This video can not be played Oh Wonder perform their single Ultralife for the Radio 1 Piano Sessions. Two and a half years ago, at the start of their career, Oh Wonder singer Josephine Vander Gucht fell over a gate, smashing her front teeth and breaking her nose. It forced the band to remain anonymous for almost a year: No photographs, no interviews, no videos. But there was an upside. Last year, as she caught a train home from Heathrow, she sat next to a passenger ""covered in blood [with] no teeth, looking sorry for himself"". ""I tentatively went up to him and his girlfriend and said, 'I just wanted to let you know you'll be fine',"" recalls the 27-year-old. ""'Go to the dentist tomorrow, don't panic, you'll be great'. And he was like, 'Oh, thank you so much!'. ""And then this guy opposite us piped up, 'I broke my nose, too!'. And suddenly this whole little carriage was talking about their injuries, which was remarkable. ""When I got off the Tube, I was so excited. Chatting to strangers gives you such a buzz because there's that element of fear before you talk to someone. ""So I walked from Brockley station back to my house, singing into my phone. And I've got this really funny voice note, which is like, 'I'm getting high on humans!'"" Josephine Vander Gucht: ""I would hate to be famous. I think it would just be very lonely."" Later, Josephine sent the melody to her musical partner, Anthony West, saying, ""We have to write a song about this tomorrow"". ""I just sent a text back saying, 'You're crazy,'"" he laughs, but the demo was worked up into a full song,High on Humans,external, which features on the band's upcoming second album, Ultralife. Like her Tube journey, the song tingles with nervous energy, capturing that extraordinary feeling of connecting with other people; a theme that runs through the record. The duo were moved to write about ""what it means to be a human in this day and age"" after a head-spinning two years, in which their music became an online phenomenon, resulting in a record deal and a tour that ran to more than 200 shows around the world. The success caught them completely off guard. Oh Wonder was conceived as a songwriting project, whereby the two musicians could subsidise their solo careers by giving songs to other artists. In September 2014, they created aSoundcloud page,externaland, prompted to describe themselves, wrote: ""Writing duo, one song a month"". ""We thought it was a good way to build up a portfolio over a year,"" explains Josephine. Then their first song, Body Gold, amassed 100,000 plays in just three days. ""We thought it was a fluke,"" says Anthony. ""But then we uploaded something the next month, and the same thing happened. And it just kept snowballing. ""On the first of every month, we'd go to a little coffee shop and just release a song and thousands of people would play it. It was amazing. It was the best year ever."" The duo both released solo material before Oh Wonder took over their careers Initially, they stayed incognito - partly because of their mantra ""it's about the art, not the artist"", but mainly because of Josephine's injuries. ""I had no teeth,"" she grimaces. ""It was a really ill-timed accident."" ""For a while, she had a little lisp,"" adds Anthony, who had to edit all of his partner's vocals to remove the erroneous ""esses"". Recording on a budget of just Â£200, they hit upon a vocal style where both musicians sing in unison, with Josephine's voice in the centre, and Anthony singing twice, once in the left ear and once in the right. The technique was actually a happy accident - they'd recorded two sets of vocals so the songs could be pitched to both male and female artists, but their managers advised them to blend the two takes, and it became Oh Wonder's unique sonic signature. Fans, it seemed, couldn't get enough of it. ""Because we released a song a month over a long period, our fans had a year of their lives soundtracked by our music,"" says Josephine. ""Rather than just, 'Oh, I really like that song you did,' we get, 'You released that song when I was at university or I had moved to a different country'. We get the most heart-warming stories. Hundreds a week."" Anthony recalls a gig in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where a 50-year-old woman approached the band to express her gratitude for the band's music. Her son, who had recently died of cancer, had been a fan. In his final months, they would wait on tenterhooks for every new release. ""When he died, she was with him and they were listening to his favourite song,"" says Anthony. ""And she said, 'I thank you so much because now, when I listen to that song, my son is there with me.'"" Stories like that helped alleviate the drudgery and loneliness of touring - ""when you go from 3,000 people screaming your name to being back in the dressing room, on your own, eating a yoghurt."" The band have built a loyal fanbase in the US, and recently played a high profile slot at Coachella Being whisked around the world has changed the two musicians in ways they never expected. ""I've found that I've become fiercely loyal now,"" says Josephine. ""If someone has an engagement party and I've said I will be there, I will cancel everything, even if it really compromises things, in order to make it."" And that, in a nutshell, is what Ultralife - both the album and its title track - is about. ""You and I will both have days where we're really sad, like, 'it's Friday night and I'm in on my own and there's no food in the fridge and I'm miserable,'"" says Josephine. ""And the next day you wake up and you're like, 'I feel fantastic, I feel so liberated and empowered and I have loads of mates and it's incredible.' ""Ultralife is the word we use to symbolise the someone or something in your life that pulls you out of those trickier moments and into the celebratory, ultra version of yourself."" So who is that person for Oh Wonder? ""We haven't been asked that yet!"" laughs Josephine, before Anthony chips in with a vague answer about friends and family. Many assume the duo are a real-life couple - but they have been doggedly reluctant to discuss a potential romance, even though they live together and have an uncanny knack for finishing each other's sentences. ""People think we're brother and sister, which suits us just fine,"" Josephine told one interviewer. The band are on tour for the rest of the year, playing dates in Asia and America before returning home for six shows in October Instead, they want the focus to be their music, which they wrote eyeball-to-eyeball over a piano in a rented AirB&B apartment in New York. Compared to their first album, Ultralife is ""pumped full of energy"", a direct response to the audience's reactions on their last tour. Sonically, it's a big leap forward, while retaining all of the breathless boy-girl beauty of their debut. The band don't want the album to propel them to Beyonce levels of fame (""I think it would just be very lonely,"" says Josephine), but it could jeopardise their chances of striking up anonymous conversations on the Tube. Which, as Anthony attests, could be a blessing. ""I once sat with a Danish friend on the Tube,"" he says, ""And there was two girls opposite me talking in a foreign language. ""Later, my friend told me they were Danish, too, and they were tearing into my shoes, talking about how awful they were. ""I thought they were quite normal shoes, honestly."" Oh Wonder's new album, Ultralife, is released on 14 July by Island Records. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Reality Check: Have the Greek bailouts worked?,"As eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels for crucial talks on Greece, Reality Check looks at whether the bailouts the country has received have secured Greece's economic survival or just created unsustainable debt. Neither Greece nor its creditors would say they are happy with how it has worked out. In 2010, when the Greek debt crisis started, Greece received â¬110bn (Â£96bn) in bailout money. And in 2012, the country received a second bailout of â¬130bn. These loans, from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), were deemed necessary to stop Greece going bankrupt. In exchange, Greece was required to make deep public spending cuts, raise taxes and introduce fundamental changes to the public sector and labour legislation. In August 2015, the eurozone countries agreed to give Greece a third bailout, of up to â¬86bn, on the condition of further changes. The next tranche of that bailout, which Greece needs in order to honour repayments due in July, is being discussed at the eurozone finance ministers' meeting on Thursday. In 2010, they managed to keep Greece in the euro and prevented the collapse of the common currency. So, from the perspective of the eurozone as a whole, a chaotic ""Grexit"" did not happen. But seven years on, and many more billions of euros later, was this price worth paying, both from the point of view of Greece's creditors and of the Greek people? It is impossible to know what the situation would be like now had Greece not received the bailouts, but the consequences of receiving them have been painful. For the Greek people, the bailouts and the austerity measures implemented with them have come at a huge cost. Unemployment remains staggeringly high: 22.5% of Greekswere unemployed,externalin March 2017. And almost half of people under the age of 25 were out of work Those who do work, earn less. The minimum monthly wage at the beginning of the crisis was â¬863. It has now fallen to â¬684 Pensioners have been hit particularly hard. Pension changes since 2010 mean 43% ofpensioners,externalnow live on less than â¬660 a month, according to the Greek government Government spending onhealth,externalwas almost halved between 2010 and 2015, while theeducation budget,externalwas cut by 20% Woman protests at anti-austerity demonstration in 2015 Greece's creditors, strongly influenced by Germany, demanded that Greece start spending less than it earned. In 2016, for the first time, Greece achieved this. The surplus is small, at â¬1.3bn or 0.7% of GDP. But this can hardly be seen as a success - the economy has shrunk and the overall debt pile is still going up, not down. What to do about the debt is the main stumbling block between Greece's creditors, the eurozone countries and the IMF. Some countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, do not want to release any more money unless the IMF agrees to be part of the third rescue programme for Greece. They think that, without the IMF, the EU institutions would be too soft on Greece in their demands for changes. The IMF has so far refused to get involved because it says Greece's debts are unsustainable and need restructuring. It says that Greece cannot be expected to grow out of its debt problem, even with the full implementation of changes. The talks on Thursday will determine whether Greece will be able to make the repayments due in July. But the key question is whether the creditors can reach any agreement on restructuring Greek debt. French President Emmanuel Macron said he would ""lead the fight"" for debt relief because ""there's no chance of returning to a stable economy and society in the eurozone with the current level of debt"". Germany is much more reluctant to allow any debt relief, ahead of elections there in September. Bailouts for Greece may have dropped from the headlines, but have they worked? Not yet.

Why do we spend less on Father's Day than Mother's Day?,"The amount spent on Father's Day presents is far less than on Mother's Day If you are buying your dad a present for Father's Day on Sunday, I bet you don't spend as much as you did on your mum for Mother's Day. With Father's Day due to be celebrated on 18 June in the UK, US and more than 70 other countries from Argentina to Zambia, retailers around the world are set to enjoy a significant boost. But while the amount of money we all spend on Father's Day continues to go up every year, it still trails far behind Mother's Day. In the US, the average amount spent on gifts per dad this weekend is expected to be $135 (Â£106), says the National Retail Federation (NRF), with total spending expected to reach $15.5bn. By contrast, Americans spent an average of $186 on Mother's Day presents this year, for a total $23.6bn, says the NRF. This is a third more and the figures for the UK paint the same picture. So why do we spend more on our mums? Alcoholic drinks may be a rare example of when Father's Day presents are more generous than Mother's Day Dr Lars Perner, a consumer psychologist at the University of Southern California, says that most of us simply think our mothers deserve better or bigger presents. ""To some extent, wrong or right, mothers are often considered to be the biggest contributor to the home life. ""People tend to understand the sacrifices they make, that's what you see. Moms have a special place in people's hearts - there's a special idea of what they offer the family."" Dr Perner adds that perhaps dads are also ""less interested in tangible tokens of appreciation"". ""I think fathers think they don't really need expensive, showy trinkets, or anything like mom's bouquet of flowers."" he says. ""They're not typically gift oriented. They generally don't expect anyone to feel an obligation to buy material items for them."" But before millions of dads complain that they really would like some generous gifts this weekend, Prof Kyle Murray, of the Alberta School of Business in Canada, says figures show that every year more money is being spent on Father's Day. Sales of male grooming products rise ahead of Father's Day ""Retailers have long made a big push on Mother's Day because demand for gift-giving was strong, and Father's Day more of an afterthought,"" he says. With traditional gender roles continue to break down, and fathers are doing more housework and hands-on parenting ""it is not surprising to see more emphasis on Father's Day,"" says Prof Murray. He adds: ""Retailers are of course happy to cater to consumer demand and have been ramping up their Father's Day promotions, as it becomes a more active spending occasion."" Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, adds that as today's fathers have a ""more emotional"" relationship with their children than past generations, it makes it ""a whole lot easier to buy presents for him, because his kids know him on a deeper level"". The modern Father's Day is an American invention, with the first widespread celebration taking place on 1910, two year's after the first Mother's Day celebration While Mother's Day was officially recognised by the US government in 1913, Father's Day had to wait until 1972 Unlike Mother's Day, Father's Day is celebrated on the same day in the US and the UK - the third Sunday in June Portugal, Spain and Italy are rare exceptions, celebrating Father's Day on 19 March, which is also St Joseph's Day - the date chosen to celebrate Joseph, the husband of Jesus' mother Father's Day started to be marked in the UK after World War Two More than 70 countries now mark Father's Day on the third Sunday in June But what presents should you buy your dad for Sunday? Male grooming products remain a hardy perennial, with firms in that sector looking forward to a significant rise in sales. In London, Truefitt & Hill, the world's oldest barber shop, says that sales of its shaving, hair care and aftershaves go up significantly this week. Joanna Broughton, managing director of the business, which also has outlets around the world, and an online operation, says: ""We do find that our Father's Day offers are exceptionally popular, and we do find ourselves exceptionally busy on this very special occasion."" Meanwhile, US shaving giant Gillette is for the second year in a row running a promotional campaign. The ""Go Ask Dad"" initiative encourages sons to ask their fathers for advice rather than look things up on the internet. Gillette is currently running a Father's Day campaign ""We've always been a champion of Father's Day, and passing on shaving traditions,"" says Barbara Diecker, North American communication manager for Gillette. For dads who might be hoping for something more fun than a new razor this weekend, a number of surveys on both sides of the Atlantic are a useful guide to what you may receive. In the US, the most popular Father's Daypresents,external, in descending order are - dinner or brunch, clothes, gift cards, power tools, personal care products, sports goods, and car related items. Meanwhile, the best-sellinggifts,externalin the UK are chocolate, alcohol, books, gadgets and aftershave. And the total UKspend,externalin 2015 was Â£684m, up from Â£658m in 2014. If you are going to buy your dad a present you'll probably buy a card, too. But yet again, you are unlikely to spend as much on the card as you did for your mother. Even the amount spent on Father's Day cards is less than that spent on Mother's Day cards Last year the average amount spent on a Father's Day card in the UK was Â£1.85, says the Greeting Card Association of the UK, comparer to Â£2.09 for a Mother's Day card. Miles Robinson, co-founder of UK card-shop chain House of Cards, agrees that ""dads don't get quite the same recognition"" as mums. More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at quirky or unusual business topics from around the world: Can you be taught to be more charismatic? Does selling up mean selling out? 'I turned my dad's erotic novel into a hit podcast' Would you carry something abroad for a stranger? ""Perhaps fathers aren't so bothered about the sentimental side of cards, or gift giving, at Father's Day as mums are for Mother's Day, but we think it's just as important to remember and recognise the role that dads play."" Yet while mums may overall get more generous presents and more expensive cards, there may be one area where dads come out on top - we buy them nicer bottles of booze. Children can of course choose to make their own Father's Day cards instead of buying one UK wine merchant Berry Bros & Rudd says that its figures suggest that customers are spending more on wine and spirits for Father's Day than for Mother's Day. While it hasn't revealed its underlying sales figures, it says that last year the value of products bought for Father's Day soared by 240%, compared with an increase of just 13% for Mother's Day. Best-sellers for Father's Day include its own-label gin, whiskies and ""Good Ordinary Claret"", its popular red wine from Bordeaux in France.

Reality Check: Why don't all high-rises have sprinklers?,"Lakanal House, south London A sprinkler system is one of the most effective tools available to prevent the spread of fire in tall buildings. Grenfell Tower and thousands of others in the UK do not have sprinklers installed. Reality Check explores the reasons. Regulations in England mean that only buildings constructed since 2007 and which are taller than 30m are required to have sprinklers fitted. This requirement wasn't applied retroactively so did not apply to Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974. Existing high-rises in England must have them fitted if a fundamental change is made to the structure or use of the building. These regulations are the same in Northern Ireland. In Scotland all new residential buildings taller than 18m must be fitted with sprinklers. In Wales since last year, all new and refurbished residential accommodation must have sprinklers. Nowhere in the UK is it a requirement to retroactively fit sprinklers in existing buildings. This tragedy has brought back memories of other fires in high-rise blocks and warnings ignored. The World at One has looked into what recommendations were made in the past. After a fire at Shirley Towers, Southampton, in 2010, which killed two firefighters, the coroner said: ""Social housing providers should be encouraged to consider the retrofitting of sprinklers in all existing high-rise buildings in excess of 30 metres in height."" In 2005, a fire at Harrow Court in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, killed a woman and two firefighters trying to rescue her. The Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service report recommended the UK Fire Service should explore options for high-rise buildings, including the ""provision of sprinklers"". After six people died at Lakanal House in south London in 2009, the coroner said ""It is recommended that [the Department for Communities and Local Government] encourage providers of housing in high-rise residential buildings containing multiple domestic premises to consider the retrofitting of sprinkler systems."" Fewer than 1% of council tower blocks are fitted with sprinklers - so what does it cost to fit a new sprinkler system in an old building? Sir Ken Knight, the author of a report on the Lakanal House fire, said that while there was significant evidence of the effectiveness of systems such as sprinklers controlling fire spread in buildings, it was not considered ""practical or economically viable"" to enforce the retrospective fitting of fire suppression systems to all current high-rise residential buildings. The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association (BAFSA), the trade body for the fire sprinkler industry, said retrofitting Grenfell Tower with sprinklers might have cost Â£200,000. This is the figure for installing a sprinkler system but does not include potential maintenance fees or costs associated with the wider redevelopment of a building. Costing will of course vary from building to building. After the Shirley Towers fire in 2010, it cost the council Â£1m to install sprinklers in three tower blocks. The cost can be high because in blocks made of concrete and steel like Grenfell, the process is difficult and time-consuming. So the focus has been on other measures which would contain a fire to stop it spreading. However, Roy Wilsher, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said it is ""certainly something we need to look at again"". He also said that if the fire spread up the outside of a high-rise, as it is reported to have done at Grenfell Tower, then sprinklers might not have made a difference. Flames engulf the Address Hotel in Dubai on New Year's Eve 2016 The Grenfell fire was similar to one that broke out in Dubai in 2016 - the difference is ""that building had sprinklers and nobody was killed"", according to Alan Brinson of the European Fire Sprinkler Network. In 2015, a spokesman for the Chief Fire Officers Association said that nobody had ever died in a fire in the UK in a property with a ""properly installed sprinkler system working the way it's meant to"".

Fred Talbot jailed over sex offences,"Former TV weatherman Fred Talbot has been jailed for four years for historical sex offences against boys he took on school trips to Scotland. Talbot, 67, was convicted at Lanark Sheriff Court of seven charges of indecent assault. The offences, against boys aged 15 to 17, took place between 1978 and 1981. They happened during separate trips to two locations - one near Moffat in southern Scotland, and one on the Caledonian Canal in Inverness. The four-year sentence will start on 14 August, at the end of the punishment part of a five-year jail term Talbot is already serving for previous sex offences. Sheriff Nikola Stewart said the former This Morning presenter had taken advantage of the innocence of his victims. She told Talbot the boys ""all trusted and all liked you"". Sheriff Stewart added: ""They were keen to go on the camping trips and sailing trips that you organised, both informally and as official school trips. ""That trust and affection was grossly abused by you on repeated occasions as you preyed upon these young boys - some away from home and away from parental care for the first time, and all utterly unsuspecting of the sexual threat you posed to them."" Talbot was a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning show during the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the time of the attacks, he was a biology teacher at a school in the Manchester area and took boys away on camping and boating trips. This video can not be played Sheriff Nikola Stewart said Talbot had organised the trips to abuse the boys in his care During the trial, a succession of witnesses, now men in their 50s who cannot be named for legal reasons, told how Talbot abused his position of trust. One man told the court he was indecently assaulted as a teenage boy after a visit to a pub on a camping trip left him ""very much the worse for wear"". A further witness said he was left ""petrified"" when Talbot indecently assaulted him on a trip to the Caledonian Canal in 1979. Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown, 54, who was not an alleged victim, also gave evidence at the trial and said he had never forgotten the moment Talbot invited one of his young friends to sleep in his tent on a school camping trip. Talbot was previously jailed for five years at Manchester Crown Court in 2015 for the indecent assault of two 14-year-old boys. NSPCC Scotland described Talbot as ""a prolific abuser who carried out a series of attacks on children in his care"". A spokesman for the charity said: ""Thanks to the bravery of his victims, he has again been brought to justice. ""Abuse ruins childhoods. Talbot used his position of trust as a teacher to prey on his victims and the attacks he carried out will have had long-lasting effects on them into adulthood. ""We hope the sentence imposed on him will help his victims finally overcome what happened to them. ""This case shows once again how important it is that those who have suffered abuse are able to come forward and see justice done.""

Pair charged over bouncy castle death,"Paramedics were called to the park but Summer later died in hospital Two people have been charged with manslaughter after a seven-year-old girl died when the bouncy castle she was playing on blew away. Summer Grant, from Norwich, suffered serious injuries at a funfair in Harlow, Essex, in 2016. Paramedics were called to Harlow Town Park but Summer died in hospital. Essex Police said fairground workers Shelby Thurston, 25, and William Thurston, 28, had been charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. The pair, from Whitecross Road, Wilburton, Cambridgeshire, have also been charged with failure to discharge a general health and safety duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act. They are due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court next month. It is believed a strong gust of wind swept the dome-shaped inflatable that Summer had been playing on across the park Police have said they want to trace a witness who was near the fairground rides at the time of the incident. He was described as a young black man, believed to be in his teens, the force said. At the opening of an inquest into Summer's death last April, Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard high winds had taken the dome-shaped inflatable ""some distance"". The inquest was also told Summer was thought to have died from multiple injuries. A vigil held in her memory in April saw about 200 people gather at the park and have a two-minute silence.

Will buses be run on coffee in future?,"Could London buses be run on coffee waste? Green entrepreneur Arthur Kay wants the red buses that have become a landmark of London to run on fuel generated by coffee waste. He runs Biobean, a start-up which is gathering waste from coffee chains such as Costa and converting it into liquid fuel. The firm is due to unveil a coffee-run bus in the capital in a few weeks. In London, the need to get cleaner air is vital - the dense road network coupled with high buildings make it one of the most polluted places in the UK. Poor air quality in London has led some to wear protective masks when out and about on the streets ""We are going through a period of energy divergence where we are moving from a fossil-fuel based society to one that is increasingly diversified. Bio-fuel will be crucial to that,"" said Mr Kay. The biochemical method by which oil is extracted from a pile of coffee grounds is patented but uses a process which evaporates the grounds via something known as hexane extraction. It extracts around 15 to 20% of oil and the remaining mass is turned into bio-mass pellets which can be burnt as fuel in wood burners. And, said Mr Kay, there is always a ready supply of ingredients. ""As long as people are still drinking coffee, there will be coffee waste. ""In the UK, people consume 500,000 tonnes of coffee each year, and if we could use all of it we could power a city such as Manchester,"" he said Lots of countries are starting to see the benefits of  bio-fuel, which can be made out of anything from chocolate to sewage. Sweden created some unwanted headlines a few years ago when it used the carcasses of rabbits - being culled due to over-population - to make fuel. Households in Stockholm are encouraged to separate food waste from other rubbish But before that, Sweden had a long history of using bio-fuels and in the capital, Stockholm, 15,000 cars - many of which are taxis - and 300 buses are now run on bio-gas. Initially bio-fuel was created from ethanol - which is generated from Brazilian sugar cane - but following concerns in the mid 1990s that this was unsustainable because it was also a food source - the country focused more on bio-gas, made as a by-product of methane in sewage. In order to increase the use of bio-fuel, it converted the city's own vehicles which encouraged petrol stations to introduce bio-fuel pumps. ""Now we are examining new ways to generate bio-gas from food waste,"" said Gustaf Landahl, head of Stockholm's smart cities project. That includes providing households with different coloured bags to allow them to sort organic waste more easily. ""The city air quality is much better now but there are still some streets that have a problem,"" he said. That is due in part to the rise in popularity of diesel cars in recent years and the use of studded tyres, popular in Sweden during the winter months, which can also release pollutants. In 2009 the EU decided that by 2020, 10% of transport in member nations should be powered by renewable energy but since then there has been a backlash about how sustainable some of these sources are. ""There have been concerns about certain bio-fuels, such as ethanol which is generated from corn or rape-seed because they are also edible and so there is a conflict with using the crops for food,"" explained Dr Cecilia Mondelli, a lecturer for the Advanced Catalysis Engineering group at ETH Zurich. Making such material at scale is also problematic because it requires land to grow, added Dr Mondelli. As a result, more attention has been focused on bio-fuel that can be generated from waste products such as coffee grounds. ""Even if you use a waste, this does not ensure that its conversion process has a mild ecologic impact. One needs to take into account other aspects, mainly the energy and chemical auxiliaries required and the waste produced, to estimate the sustainability of the process in a meaningful manner,"" said Dr Mondelli. She believes that bio-fuels will remain ""a fraction of our future energy system"" alongside other sources such as hydrogen, methanol and renewables such as solar. For many cities, the alternative to fossil fuels lies with electric vehicles Some cities are choosing more conventional routes to improving air quality with many pursuing policies that favour electric vehicles. Beijing is the latest to announce plans to convert its fleet of 70,000 taxis to electric, starting this year at a cost of around 9 billion yuan. Norway currently boasts the world's highest number of electric cars per capita and in March announced that electric or hybrid cars represented half of new registrations in the country so far this year. Sales of electric cars accounted for more than 17% of new vehicle registrations in January, and hybrid vehicles 33.8%. Cars with combustion engines are heavily taxed in Norway while electric vehicles are exempt from almost all taxes. Owners also get free access to toll roads, ferries and parking at public car parks. Back in London, car-maker Ford is partnering with Transport for London to pilot electric-only vans in the city. The number of commercial vehicles has increased by 12% in cities as more and more people rely on fast deliveries of online goods. Delivery vans are a familiar sight in cities and running them on clean fuel could make a difference to the environment ""As cities grow, and London is growing by the equivalent of two full Tube trains every week, there will be a continuation of that trend,"" said Graham Hoare, Ford's chief engineer. It forces city authorities to look for more innovative ways to reduce congestion and improve air quality. Ford's trial will see 20 plug-in hybrid vans on the roads that will complete ""the majority of drives"" in electric mode, with a conventional engine available to take over on longer trips. While electric trucks are not new, what makes this project more radical is the fact the firm will be geo-fencing London - effectively creating walls around the city, within which the vans must drive in full electric mode. Telematics in the vans will allow engineers to reset this function if drivers are found to be emitting CO2 within the zone. ""It is not that we don't trust drivers,"" explained Mr Hoare. ""It is more so we can guarantee the function of the vehicle in certain environments.""

Brexit negotiations to start on Monday,"EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier (left) and UK Brexit Secretary David Davis confirmed the start of talks Formal Brexit negotiations will begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The Queen's Speech was delayed and will now take place on Wednesday. Live political updates Date confirmed for Queen's Speech The UK is due to leave the EU by the end of March 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which started the clock on Brexit, in March. Mrs May had hoped the general election would increase her Commons majority before the start of talks - but it created a hung Parliament, and she is seeking the DUP's backing to win key votes. Key subjects to be negotiated include the status of EU nationals and Britons living elsewhere in the EU, the size of any ""divorce"" bill and how the UK will trade with the EU once it leaves. Since last week's general election, there have been calls for a new cross-party approach to talks, but Downing Street has said its strategy will not change. EU leaders have been calling for talks to begin - on Tuesday Mr Barnier said: ""I can't negotiate with myself.""

Father doubts N Korea story on son's coma,"This video can not be played Otto Warmbier's dad: N Korea's treatment of my son 'horrible' The emotional father of a US student freed by North Korea this week says he does not believe the regime's explanation for his son's coma. The regime said 22-year-old Otto Warmbier's medical condition was caused last year by botulism and a sleeping pill he was given after his trial. But Fred Warmbier said his son had been treated ""brutally"". He spoke as an Ohio hospital said Otto had suffered a ""severe neurological injury"" and is in a stable condition. ""We went for 15 months without a word from or about Otto,"" Mr Warmbier said of his son, who fought back tears at Thursday's press conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. ""It was only a week ago that the North Korean government now claims that he was in a coma for almost all of that time. Medical personnel were seen transferring a person believed to be Mr Warmbier to an ambulance at an airport in Cincinnati on Tuesday night ""Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care."" Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by the clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Fred Warmbier told reporters his son had been held as a ""war criminal'. He said he and his wife, Cindy, had relied ""on this false premise that they would treat Otto fairly and let him go"". Fred Warmbier says he never heard about or from his son during his 15-month detention In honour of his son, Fred Warmbier wore the same jacket Otto was wearing when he was paraded before media to tearfully confess to attempting to take the sign as a ""trophy"" for a US church. Mr Warmbier also appeared to criticise the Obama administration for failing to help secure his son's release. How harsh is prison in North Korea? ""When Otto was first taken we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release,"" he said. ""We did so without result. Earlier this year Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over."" The university student was freed hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea, but Fred Warmbier said the professional athlete's visit had nothing to do with his son's release. This video can not be played US student Otto Warmbier said he was ""a poor scapegoat"" before he was jailed in 2016 The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining Americans as political pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Pyongyang has accused Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its regime. Three Americans remain in custody in North Korea. The detentions have come at a time of heightened tension between North Korea and the US and its regional neighbours.

How BAE sold surveillance tools to Arab states,"A year-long investigation by BBC Arabic and a Danish newspaper has uncovered evidence that the UK defence giant BAE Systems has made large-scale sales across the Middle East of sophisticated surveillance technology, including to many repressive governments. These sales have also included decryption software which could be used against the UK and its allies. While the sales are legal, human rights campaigners and cyber-security experts have expressed serious concerns these powerful tools could be used to spy on millions of people and thwart any signs of dissent. The investigation began in the small Danish town of Norresundby, home to ETI, a company specialising in high-tech surveillance equipment. ETI developed a system called Evident, which enabled governments to conduct mass surveillance of their citizens' communications. A former employee, speaking to the BBC anonymously, described how Evident worked. ""You'd be able to intercept any internet traffic,"" he said. ""If you wanted to do a whole country, you could. You could pin-point people's location based on cellular data. You could follow people around. They were quite far ahead with voice recognition. They were capable of decrypting stuff as well."" This video can not be played How BAE sold cyber-surveillance tools to Arab states One early customer of the new system was the Tunisian government. The BBC tracked down a former Tunisian intelligence official who operated Evident for the country's veteran leader, President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. ""ETI installed it and engineers came for training sessions,"" he explained. ""[It] works with keywords. You put in an opponent's name and you will see all the sites, blogs, social networks related to that user."" The source says President Ben Ali used the system to crack down on opponents until his overthrow in January 2011, in the first popular uprising of the Arab Spring. As protests spread across the Arab world, social media became a key tool for organisers. Governments began shopping around for more sophisticated cyber-surveillance systems - opening up a lucrative new market for companies like BAE Systems. BAE Systems bought cyber security firm ETI for Â£137m in 2011 In 2011, BAE bought ETI and the company became part of BAE Systems Applied Intelligence. Over the next five years, BAE used its Danish subsidiary to supply Evident systems to many Middle Eastern countries with questionable human rights records. Freedom of information requests submitted by the BBC and the Dagbladet Information newspaper in Denmark revealed exports to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Morocco and Algeria. While it is not possible to link individual cases directly to the Evident system, increased levels of cyber-surveillance since the start of the Arab Spring have had a direct and devastating impact on the activities of human rights and democracy campaigners in many of the states that acquired it. ""I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said more than 90% of the most active campaigners in 2011 have now vanished,"" says Yahya Assiri, a former Saudi air force officer who fled the country after posting pro-democracy statements online. Manal al-Sharif says Gulf states have the money to buy advanced surveillance equipment ""It used to be that 'the walls have ears', but now it's 'smartphones have ears,'"" says Manal al-Sharif, a Saudi women's rights activist who also now lives abroad. ""No country monitors its own people the way they do in the Gulf countries. They have the money, so they can buy advanced surveillance software."" The situation has led campaigners to voice deep concerns about the future of civil society in the Middle East. ""Surveillance will destroy people's confidence in organising, expressing and sharing ideas, trying to create a political movement,"" warns Gus Hosein of London-based Privacy International. The BBC has also asked for responses from the governments of Saudi Arabia, Oman and the UAE. It has not yet received any replies. All sales of Evident were made entirely legally under Danish government export licences, issued by the Danish Business Authority. BAE Systems in the UK declined a BBC request for an interview on the issue, saying it was against company policy to comment on specific contracts. But in a written statement the company said: ""BAE systems works for a number of organisations around the world within the regulatory framework of all relevant countries and within our responsible trading principles."" Vision 2030 - Saudi Arabia's plan to diversify the economy and open up the country culturally During the course of the BBC investigation, it emerged that sales of Evident could also potentially have an impact on national security in the UK. An upgraded version of the system now offers another capability - decryption or, to use the technical term, cryptanalysis. This enables users to read communications even if they have been security encrypted. Cryptanalysis is such a powerful tool that its export is tightly controlled. The BBC has obtained a 2015 email exchange between the British and Danish export authorities in which the British side clearly expresses concern about this capability with reference to an Evident sale to the United Arab Emirates. ""We would refuse a licence to export this cryptanalysis software from the UK because of Criteria 5 concerns,"" says the email. ""Criteria 5"" refers to the national security of the UK and its allies. Since the 2011, Gulf states have stepped up efforts to curb dissent with tough cyber-crime laws The worry is that the software could give users access to the UK's own communications. ""Once you've sold the equipment to someone they can probably do what they want with it,"" says Ross Anderson, professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University. ""An Arab country wants to buy cryptanalysis equipment supposedly for its own law enforcement. They have embassies in London, Washington, Paris and Berlin. What's to stop them putting bulk surveillance equipment in our cities and then using the cryptanalysis equipment to decipher all the mobile phone calls they hear?"" Despite British objections, the Danish authorities approved the Evident export. The Danish foreign ministry declined to be interviewed but in statement said the Danish Business Authority would not grant export authorisation if an EU member state requested that it did not because of security concerns. Defence experts argue that at a time when countries around the world face heightened terrorist threats, there is a clear justification for sales of surveillance equipment. Cyber-security experts have expressed concerns about how surveillance tools are used ""It's a trade-off,"" says Jonathan Shaw, former head of Cyber-Security at the UK Ministry of Defence. ""I would imagine the consideration that plays in people's minds is not so much the economic advantage... but it's that the security of the state we're talking to is closely linked to ours. Or they are tracking people who are a direct threat to Britain and we need their assistance."" According to a 2016 UK Home Officereport,external, mass surveillance technology has played a significant role in every major counter-terrorism investigation in the last decade. ""The more terrorist incidents there are, the more people will start to see the benefits of favouring security over privacy,"" Mr Shaw adds. No-one from the UK government was willing to speak to the BBC about the implications of Evident sales, but the Department for International Trade issued a statement: ""The government takes its defence export responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world. All export licence applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis against strict criteria, taking account of all relevant factors at the time of the application, including human rights considerations."" Dutch MEP Marietje Schaake is one of the few European politicians prepared to discuss concerns about surveillance technology exports. She says European countries will ultimately pay a price for the compromises now being made. ""Each and every case where someone is silenced or ends up in prison with the help of EU-made technologies I think is unacceptable,"" she told the BBC. ""I think the fact that these companies are commercial players, developing these highly sophisticated technologies that could have a deep impact on our national security, on people's lives, requires us to look again at what kind of restrictions maybe be needed, what kind of transparency and accountability is needed in this market before it turns against our own interest and our own principles.""

Argentine player gives opponent the needle,"Colombian striker Juan Otero (second from the left) was Allende's main target An Argentine football player has caused outrage after admitting that he used a needle to hurt his rivals during a cup match on Sunday. Federico Allende, a defender for lower-division club Sport Pacifico, bragged in a radio interview about using the needle several times against strikers from top-division club Estudiantes. Allende said that players had to be clever in order to win. Pacifico's president Hector Moncada vowed to expel the player. ""We are devastated. This incident has tarnished the team's good work. I will expel him from the club,"" Mr Moncada told ClarÃ­n newspaper. Pacifico won the match 3-2, knocking Estudiantes out of the competition in a major upset. The players were received like heroes in the small western town of General Alvear when they returned from Buenos Aires, where the match was played. But the good atmosphere soon turned into bad news. Allende gave Cordoba's Vorterix Radio an interview on Tuesday in which he said ""you need to play dirty"" to beat big clubs like Estudiantes de La Plata. ""I kept piercing the Estudiantes strikers with a needle,"" said the Pacifico defender. ""We know that top division players don't like contact, they don't like if we waste time or if we play dirty. So that was the way to do it. Football is like that. Football is for the clever,"" Allende said. South American football expert Tim Vickery told the BBC that Allende had hidden two needles in his shin guards. One broke but, when the referee was at the other end of the field, Allende used the other to poke Colombian striker Juan Otero several times. Otero complained to the referee during the match but to no avail. Tim Vickery says there is ""a beautiful romanticism"" about South American football but there is also another side where you do what you can get away with. Allende said on the radio: ""I completely nullified Otero. He must hate me."" After hearing the interview, Otero described Allende as ""a nasty man"".

The Royal Tank Regiment soldier died on Thursday after being injuredat Castlemartin Rangeon Wednesday. BBC Wales understands that the incident involved ammunition. Minister for People and Veterans, Tobias Ellwood, said the soldier died with his family ""by his bedside"". BBC Wales understands the soldier died at Morriston Hospital. Three seriously injured soldiers have been taken to hospitals in Swansea, Cardiff and Birmingham. One injured soldier is in Morriston Hospital, Swansea, another at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, and the third was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, which has a dedicated wing for treating injured service personnel. The MoD, Dyfed-Powys Police and the Health and Safety Executive are investigating the incident. What is Castlemartin Range? Mr Ellwood said: ""It is with deep sadness that I can confirm the death of a soldier from the Royal Tank Regiment who died as a result of injuries sustained in an incident at Castlemartin Range. ""His next of kin were by his bedside and we will be respecting their privacy before further details are released. ""Three other soldiers have also been wounded and our thoughts remain with the friends and families of all those involved. ""The safety of our personnel is our absolute priority and a full investigation is under way to understand the details of this tragic incident."" On the camp flags have been lowered to half mast. The MoD has suspended tank live firing as a precaution following the incident. The Army's website said the regiment was ""preparing for a live fire exercise at Castlemartin in Wales"" which was scheduled to take place at the range between Monday and Friday. The range, opened by the War Office in 1938, covers 5,900 acres on the south Pembrokeshire coast. In May 2012, Ranger Michael Maguiredied during a live firing exerciseat the training base.

Business Live: Pound falls back,"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Philip Hammond withdraws from Mansion House speech Pound jumps by almost a cent after BoE announcement UK retail sales growth slows BA says computer meltdown to cost Â£80m DFS shares plunge after profit warning Russell Hotten That's all for tonight from the Business Live page. Join us again tomorrow from 06:00. Renault shareholders have narrowly 
backed the pay package of long-serving chief executive Carlos Ghosn, overcoming 
protests about an issue that has divided the carmaker and the French government 
for several years. Shareholders voted in favour of a resolution on Ghosn's â¬7m package for 2016 and his 2017 deal, which has yet to be defined. The 2016 package received the backing of 53% of shareholders meeting 
in Paris, while the outline of the 2017 deal was backed by 54%. The Brazilian-born head of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance was last 
year locked in a tussle with Renault shareholders who voted to reject his 
salary. France's new president Emmanuel Macron
laid out his vision for a digital future, saying he
wants the country to undergo a revolution so that it ""thinks and moves like a startup"". Speaking in Paris, Macron
repeated he wanted to reform labour laws to give more
decision-making powers to companies and lower corporate tax. The state should act as an enabler - not a constraint - for
innovators and entrepreneurs, he said. The French president said he would limit the wealth tax to
cover just property in order to help businesses, and would
create a single levy of 30 percent on capital income so as not
to scare businesses away. ""When an entrepreneur has too much success, he gets
stigmatized and, in general, he gets taxed. This is over"", he said. Macron told a crowd of start-up founders, investors and
students.
    ""I'm proud of you... Everywhere, women and men want to innovate. France is in
the middle of becoming a nation of startups,"" he said.  Wall Street fell on Thursday as a recent
selloff in technology stocks deepened and investors fretted
about the economy's health as the Federal Reserve raises
interest rates. The S&P technology sector fell 0.5%,
continuing a slide that began last Friday. Apple shares fell 0.6% while
Google parent Alphabet dropped 0.9% after analyst reports on the two tech heavyweights. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.66 points,
or 0.07%, to 21,359.90, the S&P 500 lost 5.46 points, or 0.22%, to 2,432.46 and the Nasdaq dropped 29.39 points, or 0.47%, to 6,165.50. Here are the thoughts of BBC World Service economics correspondent Andrew Walker.   Time was beginning to press for this payment. Greece has repayments on other loans due next month, which it could not otherwise have made. The decision by eurozone finance ministers reflects economic policy actions already taken by Greece and the new commitment by the International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde to recommend that her board contribute financially to this bailout.  It is however a qualified commitment that she has made. She is proposing that any IMF funds be paid only when the eurozone has made further commitments to ease Greece's debt burden. An IMF contribution was politically important for Germany especially to strengthen the perceived credibility of the bailout.""  Eurogroup chief tweets: Allow Twitter content?

Greece's international creditors have promised a total of â¬86bn - paid in tranches as Athens implements economic reforms - to rescue the country. After three bailouts, Greece's debt currently stands at a staggering 180% of annual output, by far the biggest national debt pile in Europe. In an emotional editorial published on Wednesday in France, Greek Prime 
Minister Alexis Tsipras (above) said today's meeting was ""essential"" for the ""future 
of Europe"".  The release of the money was to ensure Athens did not default on â¬7bn of debt repayments due to fall next month. The International Monetary Fund had wanted clarity over the conditions imposed on Greece in return for the money. But in a statement this evening IMF chief Christine
Lagarde said the organisation would support the deal. ""We have recently seen significant
progress by the Greek government on policy reforms... We have
also seen progress on debt relief, although further discussions are needed on
the scope and type of measures to be provided by Greeceâs European creditors,"" she said. Eurozone ministers have struck a long-delayed 
deal to unlock the latest tranche of Greece's bailout cash and avert a 
fresh debt crisis this summer. The 19 
finance ministers have been meeting in Luxembourg to discuss the release of â¬8.5bn. Here's the full statement,external. The Danish government says it will tighten export controls of high level cyber surveillance equipment following a BBC Arabic investigation into sales by a BAE Systems division in the country to Middle East states. Working with Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information,the BBC uncovered evidencethat some of these sales have included decryption software, which could be used against the UK and its allies. Danish minister of Business Brian Mikkelsen said his department would look into ""higher requirements for company documentation regarding the... risk of human rights violations"" when it comes to issuing export licences for spyware classed as a potential weapon under international law. The Danish company had been exporting intrusive surveillance kit to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Morocco and Algeria. BAE say its technology plays a crucial role in combating terrorism and insist they're fully compliant with all export regulations. Shares of Snapchat owner Snap fell 4.5% and briefly touched its
initial public offering price of $17, highlighting investors' loss of
confidence in the social media company that faces fierce
competition from Facebook. Snap's listing in March was the hottest US technology IPO in years, with the shares climbing to $29.44 in the days immediately after its
market debut.  Qatar has signed a $12bn deal to buy F-15 fighters jets from the US. The sale of the Boeing-made aircraft was finalised at a meeting in Washington between US defence chief Jim Mattis and his Qatari counterpart. It comes days after US President Donald Trump accused Qatar - a major US ally - of funding terrorism ""at a very high level"" - a charge Qatar denies. Other Gulf countries recently cut ties with Doha, accusing it of destabilising the region through its alleged support of extremist groups and links to Iran. Qatar is home to the biggest US air base in the Middle East, Al-Udeid. It houses around 10,000 troops and plays a key role in the US-led operations against the so-called Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Mr Trump's comments appeared at odds with the US Department of Defence, which had praised Qatar's ""enduring commitment to regional security"" just days earlier. Royal Bank of Scotland has had its credit rating upped by Moody's. The bank has only been given a Baa3 - the lowest investment grade. But it does mark another step in the long road to recovery for the bailed-out bank. RBS said it welcomed the upgrade, which reflects it restructuring progress. Now, if only RBS could sort out that pending massive settlement with US authorities for allegedly misselling mortgage securities before the financial meltdown.... A former banker at Julius Baer
and Credit Suisse has pleaded guilty to a US money
laundering conspiracy charge in connection with a wide-ranging
corruption probe of FIFA, the world soccer governing body. Jorge Arzuaga, 56, of Argentina, entered his plea before
US District Judge Pamela Chen in the Brooklyn federal court as
part of an agreement with prosecutors. ""I deeply regret what I did,"" Arzuaga said in court. ""I am
ashamed."" He is one of more than 40 people and entities charged
in the US probe, in which prosecutors say soccer officials
took more than $200m in bribes and kickbacks in exchange
for marketing and broadcast rights. US share markets have recovered some lost ground, but are still in negative territory. The S&P 500 is 0.35% off, the Nasdaq 0.75% lower, and the Dow Jones has lost 0.12%. Nike is the Dow's biggest loser, down 3.5% after the company said it
would cut about 2% of its 70,000 global workforce and eliminate a
quarter of its shoe styles. Mattel dropped 8.7% to an 18-month low after the toymaker
cut its dividend.  Facebook has announced details of steps,externalit is taking to remove terrorist-related content. The move comes after growing pressure from governments for technology companies to do more to take down material such as terrorist propaganda. In a series of blog posts by senior figures and an interview with the BBC, Facebook says it wants to be more open about the work it is doing. The company told the BBC it was using artificial intelligence to spot images, videos and text related to terrorism as well as clusters of fake accounts. ""We want to find terrorist content immediately, before people in our community have seen it,"" it said. A woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India has started legal action against the company over revelations executives obtained her medical records. The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, says Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and two other executives intruded into private affairs and defamed her. Kalanick, whose mother died recently, announced this week that he was taking a leave of
absence. The founder of the taxi-hailing company has been under fire for fostering a culture of sexism and
rule-breaking. The rumour mill is going into overdrive about the future of Avon's chief executive Sheri McCoy. The Wall Street Journal and Reuters are among media groups reporting she is stepping down at the cosmetics firm. Activist investor Barington Capital has been pressuring Avon to search for a new chief executive, saying
Avon's shares have suffered under McCoy. Avon's stock has sunk about 84% since she took
charge in 2012. One of her first moves as boss was to reject a $10.7bn takeover bid from Coty  Swiss food group Nestle

of 900m Swiss francs  (Â£724m). The business includes brands like Butterfinger, BabyRuth,
100Grand, SkinnyCow and Raisinets. ""Nestle will explore strategic options for its US confectionery business, including a potential sale,"" the company
said in a statement. The review of options does not include Nestle's Toll House

in a week against the euro after as many as three
members of the Bank of England's policy committee surprised
financial markets by voting for a rise in interest rates. The pound rose 0.69% to â¬1.1448. Trading below $1.27 before the Bank's decision, the pound also leapt by a full cent to $1.2795 after it emerged that Ian
McCafferty and Michael Saunders had voted with existing policy
hawk Kristin Forbes for higher borrowing costs. That didn't help stocks markets, however, with investors already nervous about UK economic growth and company profits. The internationally focussed FTSE 100, which has tended to
rise as the pound falls, closed down 0.74% to 7,419. 3 points. The more domestic FTSE 250 fell 2% to 19,553.6.   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Trump 'probed for obstruction of justice',"Robert Mueller is overseeing the investigation into Russia's alleged meddling and any Trump links President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice, US media reports say. They say senior intelligence officials will be interviewed on whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into his sacked national security adviser, and about the firing of FBI chief James Comey. Mr Trump tweeted that the move was the latest action in a ""phony story"". Mr Mueller is leading an FBI inquiry into Russian meddling in the election. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. On Thursday, he described the ongoing inquiry as a ""witch hunt"" that was ""led by some very bad and conflicted people"". The latest development was first carried inthe Washington Post,external. Laterthe New York Times,externalandWall St Journal,externalreported the story, citing their own sources. The Washington Post says the decision by Mr Mueller to investigate President Trump's own conduct is a major turning point in the investigation, which until recently focused on the Russian angle. Mr Putin was speaking on his annual live phone-in Russian President Vladimir Putin has joked about Mr Comey's testimony, saying the fact that he had admitted leaking details of his conversations with President Trump to the media put him in the same category as US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia. ""What's the difference between the FBI head and Mr Snowden then?"" Mr Putin asked during a live phone-in with the Russian public in Moscow, adding, ""By the way, if he is persecuted in this respect, we will be ready to give him political asylum in Russia too."" The latest media reports say the obstruction of justice investigation began just days after President Trump fired Mr Comey on 9 May. Mr Comey, who had been leading one of several Russia inquiries,testified to Congress last weekthat Mr Trump had pressured him to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? A legal 'dream team' looking at Trump Mr Flynn was sacked in February for failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. Mr Comey testified under oath that Mr Trump had told him during a private meeting: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" The White House has said the president ""has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn"". Mr Comey had testified he was ""sure"" Mr Mueller was looking at whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice. This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments But Mr Comey also testified that, to his knowledge, the president had not tried to stop the Russia investigation. However, the Wall St Journal quoted a source as saying that Mr Mueller would examine whether Mr Comey's sacking was an attempt by the president to alter the course of the investigation. President Trump said in a TV interview that he had fired the FBI chief because of the ""Russia thing"". Mr Trump reportedly told Russian officials at an Oval Office meeting a day after sacking Mr Comey that his position had now eased. ""I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off,"" Mr Trump said, according to a US officialquoted by the New York Times,external. This video can not be played Trump says he made the decision to fire Comey - that's not what the White House originally said. The latest reports also speak of an investigation into possible money laundering among Trump associates. A former senior official told the New York Times that any collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials would have involved a pay-off, and that there may have been attempts to hide the route of the payments by using offshore banking. The three names being mentioned in US media are Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, and Richard Ledgett, until recently Mr Rogers's deputy. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Who is Robert Mueller? What does a special counsel do? At a Senate panel last week, Mr Coats and Admiral Rogers said they had never felt pressured to interfere in investigations. The three were not involved in the Trump campaign but may be asked whether Mr Trump sought their help to end the Flynn inquiry. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe A separate Washington Post report has said that Mr Coats told associates in March that the president had asked him to try to get the FBI to back off. However, the Times points out that the latest questioning does not mean a criminal case is being built against the president, simply that information is being gathered by the FBI. It will be passed to prosecutors who will then have to decide. He tweeted early on Thursday morning, saying: ""They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice."" His legal team responded angrily on Wednesday evening about the leaked information. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Mr Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said: ""The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal."" Mr Trump has repeatedly railed against leaks from the FBI, saying this is the important story, not alleged collusion with Russia, which he has dismissed as ""fake news"". The New York Times reports that Mr Trumphas considered firing Mr Mueller,externalin recent days but has been talked out of it by aides. How can Trump stop media leaks? James Comey hinted at it. Washington insiders suspected it. Now US media are reporting it (through anonymous sources, of course). Donald Trump himself is under direct investigation for obstruction of justice by the special counsel's office. Take all those previous assertions by the president that he's not the target of law enforcement efforts, and throw them out the window. Mr Trump will surely insist that the inquiry into whether his campaign had ties to Russia is still a hoax perpetrated by Democrats and a hostile media, and that the obstruction allegations are built on that empty foundation. That may not matter. ""It's not the crime; it's the cover-up,"" may be a hackneyed political saying, but that doesn't mean it lacks a kernel of truth. There's still an open question as to what, exactly, could happen if Mr Mueller does find the president violated the law in acting to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Could charges be filed? Would it fall on the House of Representatives to act? It's all uncharted legal terrain. If the latest media reports are correct, however, Mr Mueller may be charting a course for the darkness.

London fire death toll rises to 17,"Flames are still visible on the lower floors of the building At least 17 people died in a massive fire that engulfed a west London block of flats, police said, as they warned that figure could rise further. Earlier, the fire service said rescuers did not expect to find any more survivors in the smouldering ruins of Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington. Sniffer dogs are to be sent in to search for evidence and identification of people still inside. The Queen has said her ""thoughts and prayers"" are with families. People have been desperately seeking news of missing family and friends. More than 30 people remain in hospital - 17 of whom are in a critical condition. The prime minister spoke to fire commissioner Dany Cotton as she surveyed the damage Labour's Jeremy Corbyn spoke to firefighters and community leaders on a visit Prime Minister Theresa May, who made a brief private visit to the scene,has promised a full investigation, as questions are asked about the speed at which the fire spread. Later, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn told community leaders ""the truth has to come out"" on a separate visit to the site. Firefighters were called to the 24-storey residential tower in the early hours of Wednesday, at a time when hundreds of people were inside, most of them sleeping. Many were woken by neighbours, or shouts from below, and fled the building. Fire crews rescued 65 adults and children, but some stayed in their homes, trapped by smoke and flames. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far Baby 'dropped to safety from tower' On Thursday morning, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said her crews had identified a ""number of people, but we know there will be more"". The size of the building means it could take weeks, she added. Asked how many were still missing, Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said it would be ""wrong and incredibly distressing"" to give a number. ""I know one person was reported 46 times to the casualty bureau,"" he said. A brief search of all floors in the tower had been carried out, but the severity of the fire and amount of debris meant a thorough search would be ""difficult and painstaking"", Commander Cotton said. Fire seemed to spread quickly across the tower block's cladding Community centres were inundated with donations from across London and the UK Temporary structures will be built inside the block in order to shore it up before more thorough work can begin. The cause of the fire, which took more than 24 hours to bring under control, remains unknown. Throughout the morning, only smoke was seen coming from the charred building, but by Thursday lunchtime flames flared up again on one of the lower floors. Dozens of people left homeless spent the night in makeshift rescue centres, as well-wishers signed a wall of condolence near the site. London-born singer Adele and her husbandvisited the sceneon Wednesday evening, and was seen comforting people. Singer Rita Ora also pitched in, helping to sort donations outside the tower. Photographs and messages in English and Arabic have been left for loved ones. Alongside them are words of anger and calls for justice, with people saying their safety concerns were not listened to. Student helps Grenfell residents before exam The man who filmed the Grenfell fire The local authority - Kensington and Chelsea council - said 44 households had been placed in emergency accommodation so far. Through the night, people donated food, clothes and blankets for those left without homes. By early morning some volunteers said they were overwhelmed with donations and were turning people and vans away. One volunteer, Bhupinder Singh, said: ""It is times like this that the best of our community comes out. This is where you find out how good it is to be a Londoner."" An emotional Adele was seen hugging some of those caught up in the fire This video can not be played London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said specialist dogs will be used during the investigation Questions have been raised about why the fire appeared to spread so quickly and engulf the entire building. BBC Newsnight's Chris Cook says the type of claddingon the outside of Grenfell Tower, installed in 2015 during a refurbishment, had a polyethylene - or plastic - core, instead of a more fireproof alternative with a mineral core. Similar cladding was used in high-rise buildings hit by fires in France, the UAE and Australia, he said. The government has said checks were now planned on tower blocks that have gone through a similar upgrade. Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, initially said in a statement that the work met ""all fire regulations"" - the wording was omitted in a later statement. Fire risk assessment in tower blocks was ""less rigorous"" since responsibility for it shifted from the fire brigade to the owner,Sian Berry, housing committee chairwoman of the London Assembly, said. Concerns have also been raised about fire alarms not going off and the lack of sprinklers. It is still possible to build tall buildings without sprinklers, said Russ Timpson of the Tall Buildings Fire Safety Network, but he expected regulations might change soon. Overseas colleagues are ""staggered"" when they hear tall buildings are built in the UK with a single staircase, he added. Roy Wilsher, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said that if the fire spread up the outside of the tower, sprinklers might not have made a difference. Design and regulations for such tower blocks mean fire should be contained in a single flat, he said. ""Clearly something's gone wrong in this case."" Jessica Urbano Ramirez, 12, is believed to have become separated from her family This video can not be played A local nurse ran towards the burning building to try to help victims Meanwhile, appeals are being made on social media for news of friends and family who are still unaccounted for. Among them are 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez and 66-year-old grandfather Tony Disson, from the 22nd floor. Security guard Mo Tuccu, who was visiting friends in the tower to break the Ramadan fast, is also missing. One family from the 17th floor has five people missing. Husna Begum and four other family members were last heard from two hours after the fire started. Labour MP David Lammy is appealing for information about his friend, Khadija Saye, and her mother, Mary Mendy. An emergency number -0800 0961 233- has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. Read more aboutthe missing here. Stories continue to emerge from survivors and eyewitnesses. One man, who lives in the neighbourhood, said he saw people banging at the window and children screaming. He said he knew one family with five children under the age of 10 who were all missing.

Business Live: Pound pares gains,"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Philip Hammond withdraws from Mansion House speech Pound jumps by almost a cent after BoE announcement UK retail sales growth slows BA says computer meltdown to cost Â£80m DFS shares plunge after profit warning Russell Hotten That's all for tonight from the Business Live page. Join us again tomorrow from 06:00. Renault shareholders have narrowly 
backed the pay package of long-serving chief executive Carlos Ghosn, overcoming 
protests about an issue that has divided the carmaker and the French government 
for several years. Shareholders voted in favour of a resolution on Ghosn's â¬7m package for 2016 and his 2017 deal, which has yet to be defined. The 2016 package received the backing of 53% of shareholders meeting 
in Paris, while the outline of the 2017 deal was backed by 54%. The Brazilian-born head of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance was last 
year locked in a tussle with Renault shareholders who voted to reject his 
salary. France's new president Emmanuel Macron
laid out his vision for a digital future, saying he
wants the country to undergo a revolution so that it ""thinks and moves like a startup"". Speaking in Paris, Macron
repeated he wanted to reform labour laws to give more
decision-making powers to companies and lower corporate tax. The state should act as an enabler - not a constraint - for
innovators and entrepreneurs, he said. The French president said he would limit the wealth tax to
cover just property in order to help businesses, and would
create a single levy of 30 percent on capital income so as not
to scare businesses away. ""When an entrepreneur has too much success, he gets
stigmatized and, in general, he gets taxed. This is over"", he said. Macron told a crowd of start-up founders, investors and
students.
    ""I'm proud of you... Everywhere, women and men want to innovate. France is in
the middle of becoming a nation of startups,"" he said.  Wall Street fell on Thursday as a recent
selloff in technology stocks deepened and investors fretted
about the economy's health as the Federal Reserve raises
interest rates. The S&P technology sector fell 0.5%,
continuing a slide that began last Friday. Apple shares fell 0.6% while
Google parent Alphabet dropped 0.9% after analyst reports on the two tech heavyweights. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.66 points,
or 0.07%, to 21,359.90, the S&P 500 lost 5.46 points, or 0.22%, to 2,432.46 and the Nasdaq dropped 29.39 points, or 0.47%, to 6,165.50. Here are the thoughts of BBC World Service economics correspondent Andrew Walker.   Time was beginning to press for this payment. Greece has repayments on other loans due next month, which it could not otherwise have made. The decision by eurozone finance ministers reflects economic policy actions already taken by Greece and the new commitment by the International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde to recommend that her board contribute financially to this bailout.  It is however a qualified commitment that she has made. She is proposing that any IMF funds be paid only when the eurozone has made further commitments to ease Greece's debt burden. An IMF contribution was politically important for Germany especially to strengthen the perceived credibility of the bailout.""  Eurogroup chief tweets: Allow Twitter content?

Greece's international creditors have promised a total of â¬86bn - paid in tranches as Athens implements economic reforms - to rescue the country. After three bailouts, Greece's debt currently stands at a staggering 180% of annual output, by far the biggest national debt pile in Europe. In an emotional editorial published on Wednesday in France, Greek Prime 
Minister Alexis Tsipras (above) said today's meeting was ""essential"" for the ""future 
of Europe"".  The release of the money was to ensure Athens did not default on â¬7bn of debt repayments due to fall next month. The International Monetary Fund had wanted clarity over the conditions imposed on Greece in return for the money. But in a statement this evening IMF chief Christine
Lagarde said the organisation would support the deal. ""We have recently seen significant
progress by the Greek government on policy reforms... We have
also seen progress on debt relief, although further discussions are needed on
the scope and type of measures to be provided by Greeceâs European creditors,"" she said. Eurozone ministers have struck a long-delayed 
deal to unlock the latest tranche of Greece's bailout cash and avert a 
fresh debt crisis this summer. The 19 
finance ministers have been meeting in Luxembourg to discuss the release of â¬8.5bn. Here's the full statement,external. The Danish government says it will tighten export controls of high level cyber surveillance equipment following a BBC Arabic investigation into sales by a BAE Systems division in the country to Middle East states. Working with Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information,the BBC uncovered evidencethat some of these sales have included decryption software, which could be used against the UK and its allies. Danish minister of Business Brian Mikkelsen said his department would look into ""higher requirements for company documentation regarding the... risk of human rights violations"" when it comes to issuing export licences for spyware classed as a potential weapon under international law. The Danish company had been exporting intrusive surveillance kit to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Morocco and Algeria. BAE say its technology plays a crucial role in combating terrorism and insist they're fully compliant with all export regulations. Shares of Snapchat owner Snap fell 4.5% and briefly touched its
initial public offering price of $17, highlighting investors' loss of
confidence in the social media company that faces fierce
competition from Facebook. Snap's listing in March was the hottest US technology IPO in years, with the shares climbing to $29.44 in the days immediately after its
market debut.  Qatar has signed a $12bn deal to buy F-15 fighters jets from the US. The sale of the Boeing-made aircraft was finalised at a meeting in Washington between US defence chief Jim Mattis and his Qatari counterpart. It comes days after US President Donald Trump accused Qatar - a major US ally - of funding terrorism ""at a very high level"" - a charge Qatar denies. Other Gulf countries recently cut ties with Doha, accusing it of destabilising the region through its alleged support of extremist groups and links to Iran. Qatar is home to the biggest US air base in the Middle East, Al-Udeid. It houses around 10,000 troops and plays a key role in the US-led operations against the so-called Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Mr Trump's comments appeared at odds with the US Department of Defence, which had praised Qatar's ""enduring commitment to regional security"" just days earlier. Royal Bank of Scotland has had its credit rating upped by Moody's. The bank has only been given a Baa3 - the lowest investment grade. But it does mark another step in the long road to recovery for the bailed-out bank. RBS said it welcomed the upgrade, which reflects it restructuring progress.

and Credit Suisse has pleaded guilty to a US money
laundering conspiracy charge in connection with a wide-ranging
corruption probe of FIFA, the world soccer governing body. Jorge Arzuaga, 56, of Argentina, entered his plea before
US District Judge Pamela Chen in the Brooklyn federal court as
part of an agreement with prosecutors. ""I deeply regret what I did,"" Arzuaga said in court. ""I am
ashamed."" He is one of more than 40 people and entities charged
in the US probe, in which prosecutors say soccer officials

The move comes after growing pressure from governments for technology companies to do more to take down material such as terrorist propaganda. In a series of blog posts by senior figures and an interview with the BBC, Facebook says it wants to be more open about the work it is doing. The company told the BBC it was using artificial intelligence to spot images, videos and text related to terrorism as well as clusters of fake accounts. ""We want to find terrorist content immediately, before people in our community have seen it,"" it said. A woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India has started legal action against the company over revelations executives obtained her medical records. The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, says Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and two other executives intruded into private affairs and defamed her. Kalanick, whose mother died recently, announced this week that he was taking a leave of
absence. The founder of the taxi-hailing company has been under fire for fostering a culture of sexism and
rule-breaking. The rumour mill is going into overdrive about the future of Avon's chief executive Sheri McCoy. The Wall Street Journal and Reuters are among media groups reporting she is stepping down at the cosmetics firm. Activist investor Barington Capital has been pressuring Avon to search for a new chief executive, saying
Avon's shares have suffered under McCoy. Avon's stock has sunk about 84% since she took

said in a statement. The review of options does not include Nestle's Toll House

in a week against the euro after as many as three
members of the Bank of England's policy committee surprised
financial markets by voting for a rise in interest rates. The pound rose 0.69% to â¬1.1448. Trading below $1.27 before the Bank's decision, the pound also leapt by a full cent to $1.2795 after it emerged that Ian
McCafferty and Michael Saunders had voted with existing policy
hawk Kristin Forbes for higher borrowing costs. That didn't help stocks markets, however, with investors already nervous about UK economic growth and company profits. The internationally focussed FTSE 100, which has tended to
rise as the pound falls, closed down 0.74% to 7,419. 3 points. The more domestic FTSE 250 fell 2% to 19,553.6.   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Queen's Speech to take place next week,"The State Opening of Parliament and Queen's Speech will take place next Wednesday, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has announced. It had been due to take place on Monday, but was delayed by Theresa May's efforts to strike a deal with the DUP to back her minority government.

BBC Politics Live: Latest updates Queen to attend Royal Ascot after Speech May to meet five Northern Ireland parties Quick guide to what's going on Hammond flexes muscles over Brexit It is not yet clear whether EU withdrawal talks, which had been due to start on Monday, will also now go ahead on Wednesday, although Brexit Secretary David Davis has said they will start ""next week"". In a statement, Mrs Leadsom said: ""The government has agreed with Buckingham Palace that the State Opening of Parliament will take place on 21 June 2017."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is planning to set out his party's own programme for government in a substantial amendment to the Queen's Speech, and will urge all other parties to back it in an attempt to topple Mrs May and form a minority Labour administration. DUP Leader Arlene Foster met the prime minister in Downing Street this week But the Conservatives are confident they can agree a deal with the Democratic Unionists, who have 10 MPs, that will allow them to get their programme through. A senior Conservative source told BBC News: ""The PM saw the Queen yesterday (Wednesday) and agreed the timing of the speech. ""Talks are progressing well and the two parties are in broad agreement on the principles of the Queen's Speech. ""Both parties are committed to the Union, Brexit, combating terrorism and prosperity across the UK. While talks are progressing it's important the government gets on with its business.

Buckingham Palace has said this year's state opening and Queen's Speech will take place with ""reduced ceremonial elements"". Her Majesty will not wear her Imperial State Crown or robes and will travel to the Houses of Parliament by car rather than horse-drawn carriage. The traditional Royal procession will also be scaled back and the annual service of the Order of the Garter has been cancelled for the first time since 1984. Buckingham Palace said the changes had been made because of the proximity of the State Opening of Parliament to the Queen's Birthday and Trooping the Colour parade on Saturday. Her Majesty is expected to attend day two of the Royal Ascot race meeting on Wednesday after the State Opening earlier in the day.

Blast hurts children at Chinese nursery,"Chinese TV showed a large crowd gathered outside the nursery At least eight people have been killed and dozens injured in an explosion at a nursery in China. State news agency Xinhua said the blast took place just outside the kindergarten in the town of Xuzhou in Jiangsu province on Thursday afternoon. No children or teachers were among the casualties, it said. The cause of the blast is not clear but media reports say the police are treating the explosion as a criminal offence and have identified a suspect. The explosion happened at about 17:00 (09:00 GMT). Two people were killed immediately and six others died from their injuries, Xinhua reported. According to the news agency, 65 people have been injured, with several in a serious condition. Unverified images circulating on social media showed adults and children lying on the ground. Video footage of injured people shared online had initially been thought to have been of the blast, but according to Xinhua, police say the footage is from an unrelated incident earlier this year. The Xuzhou blast is the second tragedy to strike a Chinese kindergarten in recent weeks. Last month, 11 children died when a bus packed with kindergarten pupils burst into flames inside a tunnel in eastern Shandong province. It later emerged that thefire had been started deliberately by the driver, who also died.

Hammond flexes muscles over Brexit,"It is the first significant reassurance to businesses that the government is ready to step in with extra financial support as the Brexit deal is negotiated. The chancellor has made it clear to his allies he wants jobs and the economy to be the first consideration as Britain leaves the European Union. His approach is described by some as a ""soft"" Brexit, meaning that the UK keeps closer ties to the single market and possibly stays within the customs union. Even if that means making more financial contributions to the EU. It is certainly different in tone from pre-election comments by the Prime Minister that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". At the Mansion House speech tonight, Philip Hammond will say that Â£48bn of funds from the European Union's investment bank will not be put at risk. The European Investment Bank (EIB) provides funding for infrastructure projects across the EU, such as the building of the Crossrail train line in London, and tram networks in Nottingham and Manchester. It lends at preferential rates to EU members and some thought the source of financing could be at risk as the UK approaches the departure date of March 2019. But the government will now act as final guarantor for those funds if the EIB demands extra assurances on the financial viability of the projects. The Treasury says it will use financing available from the British Business Bank to cover any shortfalls the UK faces. Although the guarantee is likely to be welcomed by business - which has often felt locked out of the Brexit process - much more important is the tone Mr Hammond will strike in his speech tonight. It will be the first significant intervention in the Brexit debate by a member of the Cabinet since the election and Theresa May's loss of authority. Mr Hammond backs a discussion around membership of the EU's customs union even if that curtails Britain's ability to sign free trade deals with other nations. Such a position could put him at odds with the International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, who wants Britain to be free to sign new trade deals with non-EU countries. Yesterday Mr Hammond was discussing with aides how far he should travel down the ""soft Brexit"" route ahead of a meeting with Mrs May, which is planned for this morning, to finalise the speech, one of the most important in the economic calendar. It is unlikely he will overtly distance himself from the government's pre-election position laid out by the Prime Minister in her Lancaster House speech last January, in which she said Britain would leave the single market and ""full membership"" of the customs union. What ""no full membership"" means is still unclear, and Britain could now look at a position where it is still bound by some of the customs union's rules in exchange for tariff free access to the rest of the single market. Although there have been significant tensions between the Treasury and Number 10 over the approach not just to Brexit but to the UK economy, Mr Hammond is aware that Mrs May is in a fragile position politically. Any push to change the government's position on the EU is likely to be coded. But his desire for closer ties with Britain's largest trading partner is likely to be clear in the language, I have been told. Mr Hammond is close to Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister, who wants strong economic ties with the UK post-Brexit. The chancellor, who campaigned to remain in the EU ahead of the referendum, believes there will be a deal, but the tone has to change towards the rest of the EU if Britain is to achieve it.

Tower cladding 'linked to other fires',"Work to install new cladding was completed in 2015 The cladding on Grenfell Tower was used on other buildings hit by fires around the world, the BBC has learned. The exterior cladding, added in 2015, had a polyethylene - or plastic - core instead of an even more fireproof alternative, BBC Newsnight understands. High-rise buildings in France, the UAE and Australia that had similar cladding have all been hit by fires that spread. The government says if this cladding was used, it would not comply with current building regulations. The Department for Communities and Local Government said such material should not be used as cladding on buildings over 18m high. Rydon, which completed the renovations, said the work met all fire regulations. The company also insisted that building control and safety standards had been fully met. And Harley Facades, the company that fitted the panels to the building, said in a statement: ""At this time, we are not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower."" The west London tower block was refurbished at a cost of almost Â£9m. The exterior of the 1970s-built tower was modernised with replacement windows, while additional homes were added using vacant space in the building. What we know so far Residents raised fire risk fears The questions facing investigators The work also included the installation of new cladding - consisting of two aluminium sheets with a polyethylene core. However, experts have told Newsnight that cladding with a mineral core is considered to be less flammable. Newsnight policy editor Chris Cook said the cladding used on Grenfell Tower was sold under the brand Reynobond. He said manufacturers offer two different versions of the cladding - one with a plastic core and one with a mineral core. He said he understood cladding with a plastic core was used in the west London tower. Christopher Miers, managing director of specialist architects Probyn Miers, told the programme it was ""critical"" what the core of the cladding was made of. ""I think attention on the cladding is because we've seen in the reports and the photographs, burning exterior of the building,"" he said. ""And we've seen enormous areas where the exterior is destroyed."" Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said people living in the north Kensington block ""have the right"" to ask whether the cladding compromised the safety of the building. Flames could be seen spreading up the tower block He told the programme there must be an ""absolutely thorough investigation"". Tower blocks in the UK are designed to prevent fires spreading and to restrict them to one flat or floor, he added. Residents in Grenfell Tower say they were told as recently as last weekend that they should remain in their flats in the event of a fire. Mr Wrack added: ""If during the course of renovations, fire resistant walls, doors, ceilings have been compromised, then clearly the whole basis on which that advice has been based falls apart. ""This should not be happening, that's the horrible aspect of this incident."" Both before and during the refurbishment, the localGrenfell Action Group,externalclaimed that the block constituted a fire risk. Residents also warnedthat site access for emergency vehicles was ""severely restricted"". The 24-storey Grenfell Tower is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation on behalf of the council. In a statement it said: ""It is too early to speculate what caused the fire and contributed to its spread. ""We will co-operate fully with all the relevant authorities in order to ascertain the cause of this tragedy."" Do you live in a building with similar design and cladding to Grenfell Tower?

China blast hurts children at nursery,"Chinese TV showed a large crowd gathered outside the nursery At least eight people have been killed and dozens injured in an explosion at a nursery in China. State news agency Xinhua said the blast took place just outside the kindergarten in the town of Xuzhou in Jiangsu province on Thursday afternoon. No children or teachers were among the casualties, it said. The cause of the blast is not clear but media reports say the police are treating the explosion as a criminal offence and have identified a suspect. The explosion happened at about 17:00 (09:00 GMT). Two people were killed immediately and six others died from their injuries, Xinhua reported. According to the news agency, 65 people have been injured, with several in a serious condition. Unverified images circulating on social media showed adults and children lying on the ground. Video footage of injured people shared online had initially been thought to have been of the blast, but according to Xinhua, police say the footage is from an unrelated incident earlier this year. The Xuzhou blast is the second tragedy to strike a Chinese kindergarten in recent weeks. Last month, 11 children died when a bus packed with kindergarten pupils burst into flames inside a tunnel in eastern Shandong province. It later emerged that thefire had been started deliberately by the driver, who also died.

Australian PM mocks Trump in leaked audio,"This video can not be played PM Malcolm Turnbull: âThe butt of my jokes was myself"" Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been recorded apparently mocking US President Donald Trump in footage leaked by the media. Mr Turnbull was filmed speaking at an event for the Australian media at Parliament House on Wednesday night. The event is normally not reported on, but thepolitical editor at Australia's Nine Network,externalsaid he had chosen to break protocol and make it public. Mr Turnbull said the report was ""a breach of faith."" Mr Trump and Mr Turnbull recently repaired ties after a troubled start. They had anacrimonious first phone callover Mr Trump's reluctance to honour a deal to accept up to 1,200 refugees from Australian detention camps. But last monththe two leaders met in New York, after which Mr Trump described their relationship as ""fantastic"". In the leaked footage, Mr Turnbull performs a jokey routine for guests at the Mid Winter Ball for the media. Adopting the mannerisms of the president, he says their meeting was ""beautiful. It was the most beautiful putting-me-at-ease ever"". ""The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls. We are winning so much, we are winning, we are winning like we have never won before,"" he said. Mr Turnbull saw a 10-point drop in approval ratings for his government in a March poll, with only a slight recovery in the latest May numbers. But Mr Trump is also facing tough polling numbers - his disapproval rating hit a new high of 59% in a recent Gallup poll. Mr Turnbull also jokes that polls are ""so easy to win"" adding: ""I have this Russian guy..."" in reference to Mr Trump's long-running difficulties with allegations that his campaign officials may have colluded with Russian hackers to influence the election outcome. The prime minister appeared onMelbourne's 3AW radio,externalshow with Tom Elliott to discuss a different issue, but briefly addressed the controversy and said he, rather than Mr Trump, was the butt of his joke. ""It's a good-humoured roast,"" he said. ""My speech was affectionately light-hearted."" He said the speech was supposed to be ""off the record"" and that next year, ""at the mid-winter ball, I'll read selected passages from budget paper number two."" ""It's a breach of protocol, it's a breach of faith, and all those things...  you've got to have a laugh, you've got to lighten up."" Nine's political editor Laurie Oakes, who first reported the remarks, said he did not attend the ball himself, but that the audio ""just happened"" to leak and a sample had been posted on Instagram. His employer said Mr Oakes ""does not believe reporting should be banned at events hosted by journalists"". Australia is one of the closest allies of the United States. Troops from the two countries have fought together in all recent major conflicts including Iraq and Afghanistan.

London fire: 'No more survivors expected',"Flames are still visible on the lower floors of the building At least 17 people died in a massive fire that engulfed a west London block of flats, police said, as they warned that figure could rise further. Earlier, the fire service said rescuers did not expect to find any more survivors in the smouldering ruins of Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington. Sniffer dogs are to be sent in to search for evidence and identification of people still inside. The Queen has said her ""thoughts and prayers"" are with families. People have been desperately seeking news of missing family and friends. More than 30 people remain in hospital - 17 of whom are in a critical condition. The prime minister spoke to fire commissioner Dany Cotton as she surveyed the damage Labour's Jeremy Corbyn spoke to firefighters and community leaders on a visit Prime Minister Theresa May, who made a brief private visit to the scene,has promised a full investigation, as questions are asked about the speed at which the fire spread. Later, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn told community leaders ""the truth has to come out"" on a separate visit to the site. Firefighters were called to the 24-storey residential tower in the early hours of Wednesday, at a time when hundreds of people were inside, most of them sleeping. Many were woken by neighbours, or shouts from below, and fled the building. Fire crews rescued 65 adults and children, but some stayed in their homes, trapped by smoke and flames. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far Baby 'dropped to safety from tower' On Thursday morning, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said her crews had identified a ""number of people, but we know there will be more"". The size of the building means it could take weeks, she added. Asked how many were still missing, Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said it would be ""wrong and incredibly distressing"" to give a number. ""I know one person was reported 46 times to the casualty bureau,"" he said. A brief search of all floors in the tower had been carried out, but the severity of the fire and amount of debris meant a thorough search would be ""difficult and painstaking"", Commander Cotton said. Fire seemed to spread quickly across the tower block's cladding Community centres were inundated with donations from across London and the UK Temporary structures will be built inside the block in order to shore it up before more thorough work can begin. The cause of the fire, which took more than 24 hours to bring under control, remains unknown. Throughout the morning, only smoke was seen coming from the charred building, but by Thursday lunchtime flames flared up again on one of the lower floors. Dozens of people left homeless spent the night in makeshift rescue centres, as well-wishers signed a wall of condolence near the site. London-born singer Adele and her husbandvisited the sceneon Wednesday evening, and was seen comforting people. Singer Rita Ora also pitched in, helping to sort donations outside the tower. Photographs and messages in English and Arabic have been left for loved ones. Alongside them are words of anger and calls for justice, with people saying their safety concerns were not listened to. Student helps Grenfell residents before exam The man who filmed the Grenfell fire The local authority - Kensington and Chelsea council - said 44 households had been placed in emergency accommodation so far. Through the night, people donated food, clothes and blankets for those left without homes. By early morning some volunteers said they were overwhelmed with donations and were turning people and vans away. One volunteer, Bhupinder Singh, said: ""It is times like this that the best of our community comes out. This is where you find out how good it is to be a Londoner."" An emotional Adele was seen hugging some of those caught up in the fire This video can not be played London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said specialist dogs will be used during the investigation Questions have been raised about why the fire appeared to spread so quickly and engulf the entire building. BBC Newsnight's Chris Cook says the type of claddingon the outside of Grenfell Tower, installed in 2015 during a refurbishment, had a polyethylene - or plastic - core, instead of a more fireproof alternative with a mineral core. Similar cladding was used in high-rise buildings hit by fires in France, the UAE and Australia, he said. The government has said checks were now planned on tower blocks that have gone through a similar upgrade. Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, initially said in a statement that the work met ""all fire regulations"" - the wording was omitted in a later statement. Fire risk assessment in tower blocks was ""less rigorous"" since responsibility for it shifted from the fire brigade to the owner,Sian Berry, housing committee chairwoman of the London Assembly, said. Concerns have also been raised about fire alarms not going off and the lack of sprinklers. It is still possible to build tall buildings without sprinklers, said Russ Timpson of the Tall Buildings Fire Safety Network, but he expected regulations might change soon. Overseas colleagues are ""staggered"" when they hear tall buildings are built in the UK with a single staircase, he added. Roy Wilsher, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said that if the fire spread up the outside of the tower, sprinklers might not have made a difference. Design and regulations for such tower blocks mean fire should be contained in a single flat, he said. ""Clearly something's gone wrong in this case."" Jessica Urbano Ramirez, 12, is believed to have become separated from her family This video can not be played A local nurse ran towards the burning building to try to help victims Meanwhile, appeals are being made on social media for news of friends and family who are still unaccounted for. Among them are 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez and 66-year-old grandfather Tony Disson, from the 22nd floor. Security guard Mo Tuccu, who was visiting friends in the tower to break the Ramadan fast, is also missing. One family from the 17th floor has five people missing. Husna Begum and four other family members were last heard from two hours after the fire started. Labour MP David Lammy is appealing for information about his friend, Khadija Saye, and her mother, Mary Mendy. An emergency number -0800 0961 233- has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. Read more aboutthe missing here. Stories continue to emerge from survivors and eyewitnesses. One man, who lives in the neighbourhood, said he saw people banging at the window and children screaming. He said he knew one family with five children under the age of 10 who were all missing. ""There are so many children that are unaccounted for. My daughter's best friend has gone,"" he told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. This video can not be played Humraz Khan and his friends filmed as the fire took hold. This is how their night unfolded. Michael Paramasivan, who lived on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, was among many who defied official advice to stay put, and ran with their families down dark, smoke-filled corridors to get out of the building. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished,"" he said. People in the street below describedwatching as a baby was thrown from a window, people jumped and climbed down the side of the burning tower using ropes made from bed sheets. Jody Martin said: ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors'.""

It said passengers forced to travel without their luggage should contact their airline to find out when it would be returned to them. Although flights were able to operate as normal, it is understood that hundreds of passengers departed without their bags. People were advised to pack essential items in their hand luggage.

Fire crews work all night at tower block,"Flames are still visible on the lower floors of the building At least 17 people died in a massive fire that engulfed a west London block of flats, police said, as they warned that figure could rise further. Earlier, the fire service said rescuers did not expect to find any more survivors in the smouldering ruins of Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington. Sniffer dogs are to be sent in to search for evidence and identification of people still inside. The Queen has said her ""thoughts and prayers"" are with families. People have been desperately seeking news of missing family and friends. More than 30 people remain in hospital - 17 of whom are in a critical condition. The prime minister spoke to fire commissioner Dany Cotton as she surveyed the damage Labour's Jeremy Corbyn spoke to firefighters and community leaders on a visit Prime Minister Theresa May, who made a brief private visit to the scene,has promised a full investigation, as questions are asked about the speed at which the fire spread. Later, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn told community leaders ""the truth has to come out"" on a separate visit to the site. Firefighters were called to the 24-storey residential tower in the early hours of Wednesday, at a time when hundreds of people were inside, most of them sleeping. Many were woken by neighbours, or shouts from below, and fled the building. Fire crews rescued 65 adults and children, but some stayed in their homes, trapped by smoke and flames. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far Baby 'dropped to safety from tower' On Thursday morning, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said her crews had identified a ""number of people, but we know there will be more"". The size of the building means it could take weeks, she added. Asked how many were still missing, Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said it would be ""wrong and incredibly distressing"" to give a number. ""I know one person was reported 46 times to the casualty bureau,"" he said. A brief search of all floors in the tower had been carried out, but the severity of the fire and amount of debris meant a thorough search would be ""difficult and painstaking"", Commander Cotton said. Fire seemed to spread quickly across the tower block's cladding Community centres were inundated with donations from across London and the UK Temporary structures will be built inside the block in order to shore it up before more thorough work can begin. The cause of the fire, which took more than 24 hours to bring under control, remains unknown. Throughout the morning, only smoke was seen coming from the charred building, but by Thursday lunchtime flames flared up again on one of the lower floors. Dozens of people left homeless spent the night in makeshift rescue centres, as well-wishers signed a wall of condolence near the site. London-born singer Adele and her husbandvisited the sceneon Wednesday evening, and was seen comforting people. Singer Rita Ora also pitched in, helping to sort donations outside the tower. Photographs and messages in English and Arabic have been left for loved ones. Alongside them are words of anger and calls for justice, with people saying their safety concerns were not listened to. Student helps Grenfell residents before exam The man who filmed the Grenfell fire The local authority - Kensington and Chelsea council - said 44 households had been placed in emergency accommodation so far. Through the night, people donated food, clothes and blankets for those left without homes. By early morning some volunteers said they were overwhelmed with donations and were turning people and vans away. One volunteer, Bhupinder Singh, said: ""It is times like this that the best of our community comes out. This is where you find out how good it is to be a Londoner."" An emotional Adele was seen hugging some of those caught up in the fire This video can not be played London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said specialist dogs will be used during the investigation Questions have been raised about why the fire appeared to spread so quickly and engulf the entire building. BBC Newsnight's Chris Cook says the type of claddingon the outside of Grenfell Tower, installed in 2015 during a refurbishment, had a polyethylene - or plastic - core, instead of a more fireproof alternative with a mineral core. Similar cladding was used in high-rise buildings hit by fires in France, the UAE and Australia, he said. The government has said checks were now planned on tower blocks that have gone through a similar upgrade. Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, initially said in a statement that the work met ""all fire regulations"" - the wording was omitted in a later statement. Fire risk assessment in tower blocks was ""less rigorous"" since responsibility for it shifted from the fire brigade to the owner,Sian Berry, housing committee chairwoman of the London Assembly, said. Concerns have also been raised about fire alarms not going off and the lack of sprinklers. It is still possible to build tall buildings without sprinklers, said Russ Timpson of the Tall Buildings Fire Safety Network, but he expected regulations might change soon. Overseas colleagues are ""staggered"" when they hear tall buildings are built in the UK with a single staircase, he added. Roy Wilsher, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said that if the fire spread up the outside of the tower, sprinklers might not have made a difference. Design and regulations for such tower blocks mean fire should be contained in a single flat, he said. ""Clearly something's gone wrong in this case."" Jessica Urbano Ramirez, 12, is believed to have become separated from her family This video can not be played A local nurse ran towards the burning building to try to help victims Meanwhile, appeals are being made on social media for news of friends and family who are still unaccounted for. Among them are 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez and 66-year-old grandfather Tony Disson, from the 22nd floor. Security guard Mo Tuccu, who was visiting friends in the tower to break the Ramadan fast, is also missing. One family from the 17th floor has five people missing. Husna Begum and four other family members were last heard from two hours after the fire started. Labour MP David Lammy is appealing for information about his friend, Khadija Saye, and her mother, Mary Mendy. An emergency number -0800 0961 233- has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. Read more aboutthe missing here. Stories continue to emerge from survivors and eyewitnesses. One man, who lives in the neighbourhood, said he saw people banging at the window and children screaming. He said he knew one family with five children under the age of 10 who were all missing. ""There are so many children that are unaccounted for. My daughter's best friend has gone,"" he told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. This video can not be played Humraz Khan and his friends filmed as the fire took hold. This is how their night unfolded. Michael Paramasivan, who lived on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, was among many who defied official advice to stay put, and ran with their families down dark, smoke-filled corridors to get out of the building. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished,"" he said. People in the street below describedwatching as a baby was thrown from a window, people jumped and climbed down the side of the burning tower using ropes made from bed sheets. Jody Martin said: ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors'.""

"Catch whooping cough and earn Â£3,500","How much money would it take to persuade you to be deliberately infected with whooping cough for the sake of medical science? Researchers at Southampton University are offering people up to Â£3,526 to take up the challenge. They want to make a better vaccine to protect babies, toddlers and vulnerable adults against the disease. To help, you must be aged 18-45, in good health, willing to live in an isolation unit for 17 days - and sing. Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a highly infectious bacterial disease that is spread by airborne spit or cough droplets from infected people that others inhale. The Southampton team want to infect healthy people (by sticking pertussis bacteria up their nose) and see how well they fare. Some of the volunteers will get sick, but the scientists are most interested in those who do not develop any symptoms even though they have been exposed to the bug in the nasal drops. What they are hunting for is silent carriers, and people who are naturally immune to the infection. Silent carriers still spread the infection to other people, but do not get sick themselves. They appear to have enough immunity to fight the disease, even though they have not been vaccinated. A few people, however, are completely impervious to the infection. Understanding why this is could help with designing an improved vaccine. Lead researcher Prof Robert Read, director of the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, said: ""We want to know what's so special about these people and why we can't make them into silent carriers."" Prof Read's human experiment is part of aÂ£24m research collaboration,externalbacked by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as the pharmaceutical industry, to develop an improved vaccine. He wants 35 people to help him and his team with the initial stage of their research. Prof Read says volunteers deserve adequate financial compensation for their time Once they have been deliberately infected with the pertussis bug, these financially compensated volunteers will live in isolation at the research institute for 17 days. They will get a private room, with access to toilets, showers and a recreational area. Meals, drinks, snacks and entertainment will also be provided, but they will have to wear a mask when they have any visitors or contact with staff to ensure they do not infect others. Volunteers will have nasal and throat swabs taken throughout the study and will be asked to supply nasal fluid samples by washing out their nostrils and leaving bits of filter paper up their nose for five minutes at a time. These procedures can be ""a little uncomfortable or cause gagging, but this will resolve quickly and should not be painful or pose any risk to you"", the information sheet for volunteers advises. Volunteers will also be required to sit in a glass cupboard - the ""cough box"" - and talk, cough and sing to make spit droplets in the air for the researchers to sample. The cough box that will be used in the experiment They will undergo psychological tests throughout their stay, to check their mental wellbeing. Before they are released back into the community, they will be given antibiotics to clear up any pertussis infection. Prof Read says the experiment is ""safe and ethical"" - they will use as low a dose of pertussis as possible. Volunteers can also quit the experiment at any time. ""It may sound a bit Big Brother-ish, but they are free to leave. We will make sure the volunteers fully understand what is involved so they can truly consent."" In adults, pertussis causes cold-like symptoms and a stubborn cough that can last for months. It can be serious and need antibiotics. Adults can pass the bug on to babies and infants. For the, the infection can be extremely dangerous and deadly. Pertussis is anotifiable disease,externalin England and Wales. Immunisation is the most effective way to protect against it. Young children who get the infection may have fits of coughing that end in loud gasping ""whoops"" The UK has seen a marked increase in cases of pertussis in recent years. Since 2012, 18 babies have died from the disease. Globally, pertussis kills hundreds of thousands of children, which explains why there is a big international push to make a new vaccine. There is an existing one that can prevent the infection, but it is not as effective as doctors would like it to be and its protection wanes in individuals over years. Antibiotics can stop people spreading pertussis, but silent carriers are not aware that they are infected.

US Russia counsel 'to probe Trump obstruction',"Robert Mueller is overseeing the investigation into Russia's alleged meddling and any Trump links President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice, US media reports say. They say senior intelligence officials will be interviewed on whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into his sacked national security adviser, and about the firing of FBI chief James Comey. Mr Trump tweeted that the move was the latest action in a ""phony story"". Mr Mueller is leading an FBI inquiry into Russian meddling in the election. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. On Thursday, he described the ongoing inquiry as a ""witch hunt"" that was ""led by some very bad and conflicted people"". The latest development was first carried inthe Washington Post,external. Laterthe New York Times,externalandWall St Journal,externalreported the story, citing their own sources. The Washington Post says the decision by Mr Mueller to investigate President Trump's own conduct is a major turning point in the investigation, which until recently focused on the Russian angle. Mr Putin was speaking on his annual live phone-in Russian President Vladimir Putin has joked about Mr Comey's testimony, saying the fact that he had admitted leaking details of his conversations with President Trump to the media put him in the same category as US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia. ""What's the difference between the FBI head and Mr Snowden then?"" Mr Putin asked during a live phone-in with the Russian public in Moscow, adding, ""By the way, if he is persecuted in this respect, we will be ready to give him political asylum in Russia too."" The latest media reports say the obstruction of justice investigation began just days after President Trump fired Mr Comey on 9 May. Mr Comey, who had been leading one of several Russia inquiries,testified to Congress last weekthat Mr Trump had pressured him to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? A legal 'dream team' looking at Trump Mr Flynn was sacked in February for failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. Mr Comey testified under oath that Mr Trump had told him during a private meeting: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" The White House has said the president ""has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn"". Mr Comey had testified he was ""sure"" Mr Mueller was looking at whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice. This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments But Mr Comey also testified that, to his knowledge, the president had not tried to stop the Russia investigation. However, the Wall St Journal quoted a source as saying that Mr Mueller would examine whether Mr Comey's sacking was an attempt by the president to alter the course of the investigation. President Trump said in a TV interview that he had fired the FBI chief because of the ""Russia thing"". Mr Trump reportedly told Russian officials at an Oval Office meeting a day after sacking Mr Comey that his position had now eased. ""I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off,"" Mr Trump said, according to a US officialquoted by the New York Times,external. This video can not be played Trump says he made the decision to fire Comey - that's not what the White House originally said. The latest reports also speak of an investigation into possible money laundering among Trump associates. A former senior official told the New York Times that any collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials would have involved a pay-off, and that there may have been attempts to hide the route of the payments by using offshore banking. The three names being mentioned in US media are Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, and Richard Ledgett, until recently Mr Rogers's deputy. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Who is Robert Mueller? What does a special counsel do? At a Senate panel last week, Mr Coats and Admiral Rogers said they had never felt pressured to interfere in investigations. The three were not involved in the Trump campaign but may be asked whether Mr Trump sought their help to end the Flynn inquiry. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe A separate Washington Post report has said that Mr Coats told associates in March that the president had asked him to try to get the FBI to back off. However, the Times points out that the latest questioning does not mean a criminal case is being built against the president, simply that information is being gathered by the FBI. It will be passed to prosecutors who will then have to decide. He tweeted early on Thursday morning, saying: ""They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice."" His legal team responded angrily on Wednesday evening about the leaked information. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Mr Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said: ""The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal."" Mr Trump has repeatedly railed against leaks from the FBI, saying this is the important story, not alleged collusion with Russia, which he has dismissed as ""fake news"". The New York Times reports that Mr Trumphas considered firing Mr Mueller,externalin recent days but has been talked out of it by aides. How can Trump stop media leaks? James Comey hinted at it. Washington insiders suspected it. Now US media are reporting it (through anonymous sources, of course). Donald Trump himself is under direct investigation for obstruction of justice by the special counsel's office. Take all those previous assertions by the president that he's not the target of law enforcement efforts, and throw them out the window. Mr Trump will surely insist that the inquiry into whether his campaign had ties to Russia is still a hoax perpetrated by Democrats and a hostile media, and that the obstruction allegations are built on that empty foundation. That may not matter. ""It's not the crime; it's the cover-up,"" may be a hackneyed political saying, but that doesn't mean it lacks a kernel of truth. There's still an open question as to what, exactly, could happen if Mr Mueller does find the president violated the law in acting to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Could charges be filed? Would it fall on the House of Representatives to act? It's all uncharted legal terrain. If the latest media reports are correct, however, Mr Mueller may be charting a course for the darkness.

'Was tower fire a disaster waiting to happen?',"Work to install new cladding was completed in 2015 Today's newspaper front pages are understandably dominated by the news that at least 12 people have died in a fire at the Grenfell Tower in north Kensington, London. The Daily Mail,externalhas led with a picture of the residential block covered in bright orange flames, with the headline, ""How the hell could it happen?""  The paper published what it calls a special edition with 21 pages dedicated to coverage of the disaster. ""Tragic. Horrific. Avoidable"" are the three words chosen bythe ""i"" newspaper,external.  ""Death Trap"" is the headline used byThe Daily Mirror,externalandThe Daily Star,external.  ""They were told it was safe"" saysThe Sun,externalwhich fills 17 pages with the story. ForThe Daily Telegraph,external, it was a disaster waiting to happen.  It says ministers were warned about the fire risk posed by the type of cladding used to make the building more energy efficient as far back as 1999.  The Daily Mail talks of a string of blunders - with housing chiefs, council bosses and government ministers being accused of having ""blood on their hands"".  It claims the panels made the tower ""light up like a match"" while raining down toxic debris on rescuers. One expert toldThe Guardian,external: ""We are still wrapping high rise buildings in highly flammable materials and leaving them without sprinkler systems, then being surprised when they burn down"".  The Guardian also focuses on a claim that gas pipes had not been boxed in with ""fire rated"" protection. Many of the papers give harrowing accounts from victims and witnesses.The Times,externaltells of a 12-year-old girl separated from her mother during the evacuation; a mother-of-three who told a friend on the phone that they were not going to make it; and a baby who was thrown to safety from the ninth floor - while her mother was unable to jump herself. The Daily Mail said that in scenes reminiscent of 9/11, trapped residents leapt to their deaths and families perished as their neighbours watched in horror.   It says a father-of-four was seen shouting from the window of his tenth floor flat: ""Tell my boys I love them."" The Telegraph described how residents knotted sheets together to make ropes, while others tried to manufacture makeshift parachutes from bin bags and bedding and leapt out of windows. Among other stories in today's papers,The Financial Times,externalreported that Philip Hammond is poised to challenge Theresa May over her priorities for Brexit.  It said that the Chancellor will use his highly anticipated Mansion House speech to reassert his authority on the process. The Telegraph quotes a Tory source saying that Mr Hammond might be deliberately ""foot-dragging"" over details of a possible pact with the DUP to give him more time to argue for a softer Brexit. The Times also reports that the Treasury is said to be ""dragging its feet"" over a deal. Silver surfers are on the rise according to The Mail with record numbers of older Britons buying smartphones.  Half of the over-65s are believed to now be on social media. But they are far more likely to use Facebook as ""lurkers"", which means browsing the site without actually posting anything.

Boys lost in Paris catacombs for days,"The bones of an estimated six million people are in the catacombs Two teenage boys have been rescued, and are being treated for hypothermia, after spending three days lost in the catacombs beneath Paris. A spokesman for the Paris fire service said tracker dogs had helped them find the boys, aged 16 and 17, during a four-hour rescue effort. The catacombs are a network of burial chambers that stretch some 250km (150 miles) beneath the French capital. Only a small section of the catacombs is open to the public. But enthusiasts, known in French as cataphiles, have been known to sneak illegally into the tunnels via secret entrances, to explore them or hold secret parties, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports. The two teenagers went into the catacombs on Saturday night. It is not clear when or how the alarm was raised, but police launched their rescue effort three days later. They were said to be suffering from severe cold but otherwise unharmed. The bones of an estimated six million people are in the catacombs. They were transported there towards the end of the 18th Century from overflowing mediaeval cemeteries. The temperature in the dark narrow passageways is about 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit), AFP news agency says.
