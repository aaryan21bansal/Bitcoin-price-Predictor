Kim, 21, shot a three-under-par 69 on the final day at Sawgrass to finish on 10 under and replace Adam Scott as the youngest winner. England's Ian Poulter was tied for the lead at one stage but finished three shots behind in a tie for second with Louis Oosthuizen after a 71. Rafa Cabrera Bello and Kyle Stanley finished tied for fourth on six under. How Kim held off Poulter and made Players history After his victory in the Wyndham Championship last year, Kim is the fourth player in the last 25 years to win twice on the PGA Tour before the age of 22, following in the footsteps of Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Jordan Spieth. Poulter tried his best but was unable to catch Kim Kim started the final round two shots behind overnight leaders JB Holmes and Stanley while Poulter, chasing a first victory since 2012 and a maiden strokeplay success in the United States, was three behind. But with Holmes and Stanley failing to sustain their challenges in blustery conditions, Kim and Poulter both knocked in early birdies to share the lead. Birdies on the seventh and ninth made the South Korean the first player to reach 10 under par this week and gave him a two-shot lead. Poulter reduced the deficit to one but then, having gone 39 consecutive holes without a bogey, dropped a shot on the 12th. The 41-year-old tried to put Kim under pressure but the putts would not drop and the leader remained agonisingly out of touch. Kim saved par from tricky positions on both the 10th and 11th and safely negotiated the challenge of the water at the 17th with a bold tee shot and two composed putts. After Poulter dropped a shot on the 18th, Kim went on to secure the biggest win of his fledging career with another par. It has still been a remarkable week for Poulter, who three weeks ago thought he had lost his PGA Tour card after falling to 197th in the world rankings. That was until fellow professional Brian Gay alerted officials to a discrepancy in the points structure used for players competing on major medical extensions. The former world number five, who only played 13 tournaments in 2016 because of a foot injury, made the most of his reprieve and will climb back into the top 100 in the new rankings. ""From being in a position a couple of weeks ago where I wasn't here to finish tied second, it's a good week,"" Poulter told Sky Sports after his best finish since November 2014. ""It has been a tough 18 months. Today I felt like a couple of putts slid by, but I played well under pressure, barring that horrible second shot on the last. ""I've enjoyed it and hopefully this is just a stepping stone to pressing on for the rest of this year."" Poulter couldn't quite make enough putts to put pressure on Kim BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter at Sawgrass It was a curious Players Championship in that none of the world's top 10 could fashion a top-10 finish, but it still produced its usual share of sporting drama. Kim showed commendable composure down the stretch to become the youngest winner while Poulter will feel this was a victory despite his runner-up finish. It has been a torrid time for the Englishman over the last 18 months but this week he showed he remains capable of excellent golf even with a relatively cold putter. Now he has a platform upon which to build for the rest of the year having returned to the world's top 100. Spain's Cabrera Bello produced a spectacular finish to claim a tie for fourth with Stanley. Cabrera Bello holed out from 181 yards for the first albatross in tournament history on the 16th, then followed that with another two on the 17th, before holing from 35 feet for par on the last after hooking his tee shot into the water. But compatriot Sergio Garcia, who started the day well placed on five under, saw his hopes of adding the Players title to his Masters Green Jacket disappear on the outward nine. He dropped six shots and made just one birdie to fall back to level par and two double bogeys and three birdies on the back nine meant he finished one over. Further down the leaderboard, world number one Dustin Johnson finished outside the top three for just the third time this season in a tie for 12th. The American followed rounds of 71, 73 and 74 with a closing 68. Rory McIlroy's week came to a disappointing conclusion with a double-bogey six on the 18th in a closing 75. The world number two from Northern Ireland finished two over par in a tie for 35th and is set to undergo an MRI scan later on Monday to determine the extent of an injury which hampered his efforts at Sawgrass.

'Why I brought weapons to school',"Former offenders Bali and Lennox Rodgers now counsel schoolchildren facing exclusion from school More children are getting caught carryingknives and makeshift weapons - including rolling pins and beer cans- police in England and Wales say. Here, one woman explains why she took weapons to school as a child. ""I used anything I could get my hands on,"" says Bali Rodgers, from Dartford in Kent, who had been arrested three times by the age of 11. ""I didn't take knives but used fists and other things,"" she says. She recalls using a shiv - a type of improvised blade - to harm other pupils, and put pins in another girl's shoes. ""To think now about [what I did then] frightens the life out of me,"" she says. ""I was in total denial at the time."" Mrs Rodgers finally changed her life after leaving school at 15 and ending up in a psychiatric ward by the age of 21. She now counsels schoolchildren who are on the verge of exclusion from school. She says of her own childhood: ""I didn't know any other way,"" she says. ""I ended up hurting others, and myself."" The 49-year-old counsels children in Dartford, Maidstone, Hastings and south-east London, and says many of those she talks with are ""extremely paranoid"" that they will be attacked if they don't have a way of protecting themselves. This is particularly the case with those who have been bullied at some stage. She believes pupils are now carrying a bigger variety of weapons - and at a younger age - than in previous school generations. ""They get their hands on a knife or some object and think 'I'll never use it but carry it just in case',"" she says. ""I am working with one 14-year-old girl who doesn't fit in at school, but is carrying knives for her boyfriend. It's really sad."" A recent Freedom of Information request found an array of dangerous items - including swords, axes and air guns - were among the 2,579 weapons seized in schools in England and Wales in the two years to March 2017. ""You get the ones in gangs who brag, and see it as a bit of a fashion,"" she says. ""But it's the silent types who feel vulnerable, so they carry things."" She recalls that her own turbulent childhood - with an alcoholic father and being racially bullied - made her ""constantly violent"" at school. ""My dad used to threaten me, I was petrified of him,"" she says. She ran away from home at 15 but a decade later was taken in by a family in Kent who helped her turn her life around as a young adult. ""They were a couple, who were missionaries in Africa, and they helped me get a whole new understanding of family, respect, values."" She says that living in a stable home helped her learn that her anger was out of control. ""That's what's missing for many kids,"" she says. ""If there's no-one at home to talk to, you don't learn to respect teachers or how to control your rage."" Mrs Rodgers says teachers are ""under more pressure than ever"" and may be unable to deal with pupils who have complex issues at home. In an unusual incident three years ago, teacherAnn Maguire was stabbed to deathat her school in Leeds by a teenage pupil. Will Cornick, who was 15 at the time of the murder, later said he had gone to class that day in ""a red mist, not conscious of his surroundings"". Mrs Rodgers now runs a charity, Refocus, with her husband Lennox, who himself carried a knife when he was a teenager. Organisations Foundation4Life and UserVoice offer a similar service, by using ex-offenders to speak to young people at risk of turning to crime. ""Unlike with teachers and parents, these kids open up to us,"" she says. ""I will tell them a little bit about my story if they share a bit of their story."" For husband Lennox, who co-founded the charity in 2004, he thought when he was younger that carrying a knife ""gave me a sense of power"". He carried weapons after being bullied for being black when growing up in Oxford. After leaving school, he was involved in gangs and spent two decades in and out of prison. Mrs Rodgers says that young people hang on to every word her 54-year-old husband says when he is talking about his life, but insists that his stories do not glamorise the carrying of weapons. ""They do think he's cool - but also listen to the dark side of his story - that if you deliberately put yourself on a route of violence you don't succeed and end up in serious trouble,"" she says. ""I'm hoping we turned some bad into good."" More than 2,000 weapons seized in schools Why are more youths carrying knives?

Eurovision 'confused' Portugal winner,"""I think that you have to be a mathematician"" Portugal has won this year's Eurovision Song contest with a poignant love song, sung in Portuguese. In the early hours of Sunday morning the winner met the world's press - glass microphone trophy still in hand. Salvador Sobral entered the Eurovision Song Contest's press room last night with the same diffident, bemused demeanour he has projected since arriving in Kiev. There was no swagger, no elation - just a quizzical befuddlement at the latest turn his musical journey had taken. Like many watching at home around the world, the Lisbon-born 27-year-old had been baffled by the complex voting system that the contestadopted last year. ""I didn't understand the votes,"" he admitted to reporters. ""I think that you have to be a mathematician or something to know what's going on."" The winner wasn't alone in his confusion Nor did he expect overnight fame and fortune to come with the honour of becoming Portugal'sfirst Eurovision winner. ""I don't think anything will change,"" he shrugged. ""You win today and tomorrow, no one remembers it. ""Honestly, man, I just want to live a peaceful life,"" he told another journalist. ""If I thought of myself as a national hero or champion of Europe, it would be a bit weird."" In pictures: Eurovision Song Contest 2017 Portugal win Eurovision for first time Even in such an eclectic line-up as the one Eurovision served up this year, Sobral stood apart. While some countries offered amusing gimmicks (Romanian yodelling, Italy's dancing gorilla) and others sleek, assembly-line pop, his delicate, heartfelt ballad stood out precisely because it was so unassuming. Written by Sobral's older sister Luisa, Amar Pelos Dois - whose title translates into English as Love for Both of Us - speaks to all genders and orientations with its inclusive, unadorned message. A family affair: Salvador's sister Luisa wrote the song for him Sobral said he would be delighted if its Eurovision triumph had some impact, however small, on how music is made, produced and marketed. ""People listen to songs because they're thrown at you,"" he said. ""You have to like this because we're going to play it 16 times a day and force you to like it. ""This is music with content, an emotional song with a beautiful lyrical message and harmony - things people are not used to listening these days. ""If I can help to bring some change to music I would be really joyful,"" he said, dressed as ever in a modest dark suit. ""And I hope it will encourage people to bring different things and all sorts of music to future editions of this contest."" ""We're going to play it 16 times a day and force you to like it,"" he said of the music business Those future editions could learn much from this year, which offered audiences a spectacular, entertaining and endlessly quirky diversion. For a contest whose slogan was ""celebrate diversity"", though, it was surprising more thought was not given to basic areas of presentation. The final and the two semi-finals that preceded it were hosted by a trio of white male TV presenters who are all well-known in host nation Ukraine. Commentator Graham Norton and one of his Australian counterparts were not alone in remarking that the line-up was hardly indicative of the contest's stated aim. For the millions watching at home, however, it was the variety, the colour and the craziness that made it unmissable Saturday night viewing. In keeping with Eurovision tradition, Portugal will host the 2018 iteration of an event that continues to unify Europe in a way politics never can or will.

Cyber-attack: Is my computer at risk?,"Experts are warning that there could be further ransomware cases this week after the global cyber-attack. So, what has happened and how can organisations and individuals protect themselves from such attacks? Ransomware - a malicious program that locks a computer's files until a ransom is paid - is not new but the size of this attack by the WannaCry malware is ""unprecedented"", according to EU police body Europol. It said on Sunday that there were believed to be more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. However, that figure is likely to grow as people switch on their computers on Monday if their IT has not been updated and their security systems patched over the weekend. There are also many other strains of ransomware which cyber-security experts say they are seeing being given new leases of life. In the UK, the NHS was hit hard, but by Saturday morning the majority of the 48 affected health trusts in England had their machines back in operation. The NHS has not yet revealed what steps it took. The malware has not proved hugely profitable for its owners so far. The wallets set up to receive ransom payments  - $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin was demanded for each infected machine - contained about $30,000 when seen by the BBC. This suggests that most victims have not paid up. WannaCry infects only machines running Windows operating systems. If you do not update Windows, and do not take care when opening and reading emails, then you could be at risk. However, home users are generally believed to be at low risk to this particular strain. You can protect yourself by running updates, using firewalls and anti-virus software and by being wary when reading emailed messages. Regularly back up your data so you can restore files without having to pay up should you be infected, as there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in your files being unlocked. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre websitecontains advice,externalon how to apply the patch to stop the ransomware - MS17-010 - and what to do if you can't. The culprit is malware called WannaCry and seems to have spread via a type of computer malware known as a worm. Unlike many other malicious programs, this one has the ability to move around a network by itself. Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. The ransomware has been identified as WannaCry Once WannaCry is inside an organisation, it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too. This perhaps explains why its impact is so public - because large numbers of machines at each victim organisation are being compromised. It has been described as spreading like the vomiting bug norovirus. In March, Microsoft issued a free patch for the weakness that has been exploited by the ransomware. WannaCry seems to be built to exploit a bug found by the US National Security Agency. When details of the bug were leaked, many security researchers predicted it would lead to the creation of self-starting ransomware worms. It may, then, have taken only a couple of months for malicious hackers to make good on that prediction. It was originally thought that a number of victims were using Windows XP, a very old version of the Windows operating system that is no longer supported by Microsoft. However, according to cyber-security expert Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, the latest statistics suggest this figure is actually very small. Large organisations have to test that security patches issued by the provider of their operating systems will not interfere with the running of their networks before they are applied, which can delay them being installed quickly. It's not yet known, but some experts are saying that it was not particularly sophisticated malware. The ""kill switch""  that stopped it spreading -accidentally discovered by a security researcher- may have been intended to stop the malware working if captured and put in what's called a sandbox - a safe place where security experts put computer malware to watch what they do - but not applied properly. Ransomware has been a firm favourite of cyber-thieves for some time as it lets them profit quickly from an infection. They can cash out easily thanks to the use of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which is difficult to trace. However it's unusual for an expert criminal gang to use so few Bitcoin wallets to collect their ransom demands - as in this case - as the more wallets there are, the more difficult the gang is to trace.

Why I had to terminate my baby's life,"Last year, stand-up comedian Lou Conran had to end her pregnancy at 22 weeks - five-and-a-half months. She is now preparing a show about the experience for the Edinburgh festival, hoping this will encourage people to talk about a subject that is often covered in a blanket of silence. Last year I had to end my pregnancy because my little girl was too ill to go full term. It was devastating and there's not a day goes by that I don't think about her. One thing I have learned over the past year, is just how many people go through an experience like this, and yet it's simply not spoken about. Is it because people don't know what to say? Is it because people are frightened of upsetting you, or is it simply because it's just too tragic a situation to even comprehend. That it's easier to say nothing? Who knows? One thing you do have to deal with is the well-intended people who panic so much about saying the right thing that nine times out of 10 they get it completely wrong, much to my amusement. Among the inappropriate comments I had last year, were: 1) ""Oh you've got loads of presents. You should lose a baby more often."" 2) ""We've had a chat and we'd like to offer you our sperm."" (Five days after I'd given birth) 3) ""You've lost weight, how've you done that?"" Half the battle with baby loss is dealing with other people's reaction to it, and to you, and not only have you got all that going on but of course there's the admin to deal with. I'd signed up to the usual websites, Boots Mother & Baby pages, Mothercare, the ""What fruit is your baby most like?"" apps (which led to anxiety for a week, when it was a grapefruit, because I was convinced I was going to hate my childâ¦ I hate grapefruit) Also, the baby name sites, hypnobirthing and NCT. Cancelling these however, isn't as easy as just clicking a button to subscribe. There should be another button that says, ""Oh dear, you're no longer pregnant, we're so sorry, press here and we'll say no more."" But there isn't. And then there are the Facebook targeted ads. And the junk mail. And and and. The list is endless. When I got pregnant at the age of 41, it was a shock to say the least. It wasn't supposed to happen because three years earlier, medical types had told me my dusty womb was barren. It was wonderful but it completely floored me. At the 12-week scan I was nervous. I was scared my baby would be diagnosed with one of the three conditions they were looking for: Down's, Edwards' or Patau's. I hadn't heard of the other two, but Down's I thought was a high risk given my age. If the baby had had any of these then I guess that I'd have dealt with it. The test results came back and all was fine. Except me. I couldn't get excited. My midwife said that your pregnancy controls you, you don't control it and in hindsight it makes sense now. At the time I put my lack of enthusiasm down to the fact that I felt absolutely awful. Sickness morning, noon and night. Having to nip off at gigs to vomit in between acts was a joy. At the next scan, I was excited, for the first time in five months. My friend came with me. We were excited to find out the flavour of the baby. Then, suddenly, I heard the sonographer say: ""I'm just going to stop the scan here. I'm seeing irregularities that I wouldn't normally expect to see at this stage."" I just lay there, wondering what she was on about. She pointed out that the baby wasn't well. Its body wasn't growing the way it should. Its limbs were shorter than expected and there was a possibility that the baby had skeletal dysplasia, a condition I hadn't even heard of, let alone considered. ""Is it because I don't drink milk?"" I asked, panicking, and thinking I hadn't been doing the right things. ""No. It's nothing you've done; it's unfortunately one of those things. It means that the sperm and egg just weren't compatible during conception."" She sent us to another hospital for a second opinion straight away, but in the car I knew it was game over. I just knew. The second hospital confirmed it with a bit more detail. The bones weren't growing properly, the main issue being with the ribcage. It didn't feel real. It was like she was talking to someone else and it wasn't until I asked what sex the baby was that it hit me. The sonographer confirmed it was a girl and suddenly it - she - became a real person, instead of this little alien growing inside me. Knowing her chest and ribcage were crushing her lungs was devastating. Saying goodbye,external Sands,external Tommys,external I was booked in to see a foetal consultant the following week and the days in between were the longest of my life. All I wanted to do was sleep and not wake up until it was over. ""Your baby won't survive outside of the womb,"" the consultant said. ""She could live a day but her lungs just won't cope."" Game over. I had to terminate my baby's life. The main question for me was, would I have to give birth to her? I couldn't bear the idea of having to go through that. And my worst fears were confirmed. It wouldn't be safe for me to do otherwise. I started the process that afternoon. You get given a tablet that prepares the womb. You go home. You wait two days and then you're booked into hospital where they induce you, and the worst day of your life begins. They call this ""medical management"". My friend came with me. She was amazing, as were the nurses. Like, amazingly fabulous. So sensitive to the situation. And step by step they talked me through what was going to happen. You're bombarded with questions. Do you want a post mortem? Do you want to see her when she's born? What about the funeral? Gahhhhhh! I don't know. The only thing I did know was that I definitely wanted her body to be left to medical research. Something positive had to come out of this, and if she could help answer a few questions about her condition then this had to be the right thing to do. If you've ever been induced in pregnancy, you'll know it's not a picnic. It was around 3pm, and they put hormone tablets up into my cervix. Period pain they said, it might be a bit worse than period pain. Yep. Well, it was. For a bit, then it got worse. I was given diamorphine around 6.30pm and I managed to float off with the fairies for a few hours, until it wore off and the pain was unbearable. This video can not be played Comedian Lou Conran talks about the ""medical management"" of her pregnancy The doctors had only signed me off to have one shot of morphine, so the nurse went off to get me signed off for another one, and while she was out of the room, my waters broke. I had been instructed to give birth over a bedpan in the toilet (I know, glamorous). My mate was with me and held my hand and my baby was born pretty much straight away, over the loo, around 9.50pm. Classy. We waited for the nurse to come back and then this is when the fun began because I couldn't birth the placenta. I had to get back to the bed so the nurse followed me back, holding my baby between my legs, because she was still connected to me via the umbilical cord and the placenta, which wouldn't shift. I pushed. I really pushed but nothing. The baby was detached and taken away. The nurse spoke to her like she was a little person, like she existed, like she was my daughter, which was so comforting. Then it all got a bit bonkers. The bed was surrounded by people, a doctor tried to manually remove the placenta, which was the single most painful thing during the whole scenario. That didn't work, and I was rushed down to theatre. I had an epidural. By this point I was tired, drugged, slightly delirious, and could not care less about what was happening to me. The day after, I was checked over, I got my legs back and I was anxious to go home. I knew at some point the nurse would come back and ask if I wanted to see her. I hadn't been sure I would want to, but I knew if I didn't meet her I would regret it for the rest of my life. I was just dreading it because I didn't know what to expect. The nurse bought her in, in a tiny Moses basket. She was wrapped up like a newborn baby and covered in knitted blankets, a little knitted toy by her side. Her head was larger than I had anticipated and a reddy purple in colour but her little face was pink. Her tiny nose and mouth were perfect. The nurse took out her fingers, which were tiny and I just couldn't believe this little person had been growing, in her own little way, inside me. I was sorry for not ever getting to meet her properly. She was amazing. Yes she looked odd. Yes, she looked alien-like at first glance but when you'd been with her for a bit, you stopped seeing the unusual bits and just saw this little girl's face and fingers. My little girl's face and fingers. She looked so fragile, so delicate. I stroked her tiny cheek, and she was cold to the touch but she felt so soft. I kissed my finger and kissed her cheek with it and all I could do was say sorry to her. I was sorry for not ever getting to meet her properly, for not being able to do the things other mums did with their daughters, for not being able to feed her, or change her nappy, or be a mum to her. I felt so sorry for that. The hospital took photos of her and gave them to me in a card with her name on it. I can't show those pictures to anyone because they wouldn't see the baby that I saw. They wouldn't see my daughter's beautiful face. They would see her illness. I don't need to hear what other people think. There are no words in this situation. And I wouldn't want them. After the worst week of my life had been and gone I did what I always do when I'm upset and stressed beyond comprehension, and that was to move all the furniture around in my flat, and clean it within an inch of its life, stinking of Eau de Domestos for about a week. I started to try and get rid of all the baby things I'd bought. I'd bought a sterilising unit and gave that to my friend who had just had a baby, I'd bought a cot, and gave that to my friend who was due a baby, and I began to make patchwork blankets for other friends, that were having babies. I was surrounded by babies. Everywhere. But what do I do? Ignore my wonderful friends because of their good fortune and never see them again? No. I love them. I managed to create a massive blanket, and it's beautiful. Unfortunately you can't use it as a blanket because I managed to leave most of the pins in it and I can't get to them to take them out because I've sewn the backing on, and I'd have to unstitch the whole thing, so it's in a box in my room, as it's basically a health and safety nightmare. But it was a good distraction leading up to the funeral. When I went to buy a waterproof mascara the week before, I wasn't prepared for the cashier to ask what it was for. ""Sorry?"" ""The waterproof mascara. Wedding or funeral?"" ""Ohâ¦ funeral."" ""Was it anyone close?"" and for a split second I didn't know what to say. I'd not had to tell anyone I didn't know yet and so I just said, ""My daughter."" She gave me my change and walked off crying. It's weird hugging a stranger because you've made them cry with your situation. I got used to it in the end because most of my friends cried when I told them, and in the end I got hardened to the fact that I'd have to comfort other people when it should have been the other way round. The funeral was almost as harrowing as the birth itself The amazing hospital organised my daughter's funeral alongside others that hadn't made it that month. Unfortunately due to an error with bank holiday dates, my parents and I were a week early and inadvertently turned up at an old man's funeral, which is exactly how I love spending my spare time with my parents. So we went home that evening, drank a shed load of wine and had another go the following week. The real funeral was almost as harrowing as the birth itself, but it's important to acknowledge these little lives. All the caskets were placed at the front of the chapel and there was a 30-minute service. The grief in that room was claustrophobic but weirdly comforting. There we all were, all of us affected by the personal tragedy in front of us, in a box. I wanted to talk to the other mums, I wanted to hear their stories, I wanted us all to be united in our grief. But, typically, in our very British way, we all went about our business, heads down. It's been just over a year now, and I'm over the milestones that I was worried about. Christmas, Mother's Day and her birthday. But I strive on. I'm trying to write my Edinburgh show about what has happened (I know it's sure to be a barrel of laughsâ¦ insert scared face emoticon here). And through adversity positivity reigns, and hopefully writing about it will help people who have to endure this pain, and educate others.

Spring-cleaning India's most magnificent tent,"Rajasthan's Royal Red Tent is as tall as a double-decker bus, made from silk, velvet and gold - and it's getting its first proper clean in more than three centuries, says Melissa Van Der Klugt. High up on the ramparts of Mehrangarh, in one of Rajasthan's most famous forts - one of the most visited in India - a small team is dusting down a large tent. Each section is so big that the three conservationists - dressed in neat white overalls and equipped with pocketfuls of soft brushes - must clamber around on tables and chairs. ""The priority is the object,"" says one, pointing to the elaborate design of lotus flowers stitched in solid gold thread. For this is no ordinary tent - but one that excites huge interest and controversy in India. It was once thought to have been the home of Shah Jahan, the great 17th-Century Mughal emperor who built the Taj Mahal. His nomadic ancestors rode down from Central Asia and Afghanistan to conquer swathes of India - and this was his ""travelling palace"". Made in imperial workshops from exquisite red silk velvet and gold, it stands when unfurled at 4m (13ft) - as high as a London double-decker bus. It's known as the Lal Dera, or the Shahi Lal Dera - the Royal Red Tent. And it's being given its first proper spring clean in 350 years. ""There is no surviving piece like it in India or anywhere,"" says Karni Singh Jasol, the director of the fort's archive in Jodhpur. ""The idea was that it had to have all the luxury of a painted stone palace."" Shah Jahan was nicknamed ""the Builder of the Marvels"" - he ordered up some of Delhi and Agra's finest monuments - but spent most of his three decades in power on military campaigns. Shah Jahan, depicted circa 1625 One hundred elephants, 500 camels, 400 carts and teams of bearers were once needed to carry the emperor's camping equipment as he roved across plains and jungles with tens of thousands of horsemen. ""In his tent,"" says Jasol, ""there would be cushions and bolsters and a bed, and objects like hookahs or wine flasks and jewellery cases."" Porters carried porcelain for the emperor's table. He was said to travel at a leisurely 10 to 12 miles (15 to 18km) a day, pausing to hunt cheetah or deer. The Mughals were used to erecting these temporary cities, says Jasol. Shah Jahan's great-great grandfather, the first emperor, Babur, who arrived in India from Afghanistan, once boasted he had never spent any two Ramadans in the same place. One encampment contained so many scribes, harems, court officials and workshops churning out leather goods and artwork that an astounded British ambassador wrote that it must be the same size as Elizabethan London. The Rent Tent was believed to have been looted during a battle, whose victors, the rulers of Jodhpur, took it back to their fort, Mehrangarh, in the sun-baked Thar desert. And there it has remained. Immaculately dressed in a Nehru waistcoat and cravat, Jasol now presides over the vaulted archives within Mehrangarh's thick stone walls. They house thousands of precious artefacts and documents, often requested for exhibition abroad. Art historians now argue over whether the Red Tent belonged to Shah Jahan or his ruthless son, Aurangzeb - who put his own father under house arrest. ""But it is still our rarest and most prized object,"" says Jasol. All other Mughal tents of the same size have been dismantled and the pieces scattered.

""It was on display in one of the galleries here,"" says Jasol. ""But every morning the staff would see a sort of gold dustâ¦ There was a lot of stress on the velvet and the brocade so we put it into storage to rest."" Its conservation is part of a bigger project to revamp the museum to appeal to India's booming domestic tourist market. When Mehrangarh opened as a museum in 1974, most visitors were British or American. ""All the rooms had been locked up and only the temples had been active,"" recalls Jasol. ""I remember the first director describing how it was full of bats and bat droppings."" Now Indian visitors - curious about their history - have overtaken foreigners. The Red Tent's big clean is being carried out by team of three conservators. ""The effort that went into making it shows the dedication to the emperor,"" says one, Shakshi Gupta, peering at the fabric through a magnifying glass. ""Velvet these days might last just 20 years if you are lucky. This kind of labour and intricate weaving by hand would be too expensive."" The women are living in rooms at the fort for the next year. ""It was a little spooky at first sleeping here,"" Shakshi says. ""If the walls of this tent could talk, they must have seen so much."" Photos by Gareth Phillips except where otherwise stated.

When a lion prowled the streets of Birmingham,"Frank Bostock and his lions catching up with the news When considering which creatures have roamed the sewers beneath Birmingham, lions are unlikely to make the list. But on one fateful day in autumn 1889, a lion who had previously killed a man and mauled another escaped from a menagerie and did just that. Travelling menageries were extremely popular in the 19th Century. Although zoos were starting to emerge in Britain, these were often socially exclusive or inaccessible, according to Dr Helen Cowie, a historian at the University of York. Popular though they were, the typical menagerie's approach to health and safety was cavalier at best. Dr Cowie says they ""were not too preoccupied"" with security and there were ""an alarming number"" of escapes and accidents. An illustration from The Graphic newspaper shows men pulling a lion from a sewer using a rope while two other men threaten it with guns Frank C Bostock, the owner of a menagerie, was himself responsible for fooling both the public and the police over the whole lion-in-a-sewer affair. He later described the event as ""thrilling"". World-famous as a lion tamer, having discovered the beasts were intimidated by chairs, he came from a long line of animal-displayers and was part of theBostock and Wombwell,externalmenagerie dynasty. Fiercely ambitious, according to researchers at the National Fairground and Circus Archive, Bostock established himself in the US and by 1903 an average of 16,000 people a day were visiting his menagerie on New York fairground haven Coney Island. On returning to the UK Bostock brought back his idea of the ""Jungle"", a massive touring exhibition that moved from city to city. Frank C Bostock published a volume of his memoirs and training tips Reaching Birmingham, Bostock and his team were preparing for a show when one of his lions jumped over its keeper, pushed through a rip in the circus tent, and prowled off towards Birmingham city centre ""as free and untrammelled as when in his native wilds"". According to Bostock's account of it it his bookThe Training of Wild Animals,external, the lion came across one of the openings to the sewerage system and ""down he sprang, looking up at the crowd of people and roaring at the top of his voice. As he made his way through the sewers, he stopped at every man-hole he came to, and there sent up a succession of roars, driving some people nearly wild with terror."" Large crowds had gathered, eager to see the menagerie. Understandably, with a lion on the loose, they started to panic. So Bostock came up with a plan. Crocodiles were seen as a quirky pet for Victorian ladies In 1851 a tapir broke out of its den at Wombwell's menagerie in Rochdale, causing panic among the spectators. In 1867 a rattlesnake escaped from its box in Mander's menagerie, killing a horse and a bison. In 1868 five leopards escaped from a menagerie in the Scottish borders after their caravan overturned on the road. In 1883 a bear got loose in Grimsby and entered a private house. Even elephants sometimes went missing, though they could usually be found in the vicinity of the nearest pub. In 1854 an elephant disappeared from Batty's menagerie in Holyhead and was gone for nearly 24 hours. It was eventually discovered in a hotel cellar, surrounded by empty wine bottles. Source: Dr Helen Cowie Bostock toured the world with his menagerie Rather than try to quell the volatile crowd, he put a second lion in a cloth-covered cage and sneaked it out on the back of a lorry. He then returned, blowing his horn to attract attention, with the lion clearly visible. In his own words, ""everything went off well"". People fell for the ruse and he was cheered as a hero. ""A shout went up from the crowd 'They've got him! They've got him! They've got the lion!'"" His actions in apparently getting the lion from the sewer were reported around the world. A New Zealand newspaper ran an article called ""A lion at large in Birmingham: How the King of the Forest was recaptured"" which included details such as ""the keeper's attention was momentarily distracted by a fight between an ostrich and a deer"" and ""a group of children were in the lion's path. It cleared them at a bound"". The publicity worked in Bostock's favour. Hordes of people attended the show that evening, blissfully ignorant of the fact a man-eating lion was prowling beneath the streets. Bostock said he ""was in a perfect bath of cold perspiration, for matters were extremely serious, and I knew not what to do next. Fortunately, the lion had stopped his roaring, and contented himself with perambulating up and down the sewer"". On the afternoon of the following day, the chief of police of Birmingham visited the menagerie and congratulated Bostock on his ""marvellous pluck and daring"". Bostock came clean. Illustration of men putting a cage over a manhole in an attempt to trap the lion ""I shall never forget that man's face when he realized that the lion was still in the sewer, it was a wonderful study for any mind-reader,"" he reflected. ""At first he was inclined to blame me but when I showed him I had probably stopped a panic, and that my own liabilities in the matter were pretty grave possibilities to face, he sympathized with me, and added that any help he could give me, I might have. ""I at once asked for 500 men of the police force, and also asked that he would instruct the superintendent of sewers to send me the bravest men he could spare, with their top-boots, ladders, ropes, and revolvers with them, so that should the lion appear, any man could do his best to shoot him at sight. We arranged that we should set out at five minutes to midnight, so that we might avoid any crowd  following us, and so spreading the report. ""At the appointed time, the police and sewer-men turned out, and I have never seen so many murderous weapons at one time in my life. Each man looked like a walking arsenal, but every one of them had been sworn to secrecy."" This secrecy was preserved until Bostock himself spilled the beans. An illustration of a man and the lion in the sewer It was more than 24 hours after the stooge lion was paraded that Bostock, now in the sewer, ""saw two gleaming eyes of greenish-red just beyond, and knew we were face to face with the lion at last"". Bostock and his gang of men chased the lion through the sewers by scaring it with shouts and fireworks. When face-to-face with the lion Bostock took off his boots and put them on his hands ""and going up close to the lion, was fortunately able to hit him a stinging blow on the nose. Fearing that he would split my head open with a blow from one of his huge paws, I told one of my men to place over my head a large iron kettle which we had used to carry cartridges and other things to the sewer"". But the kettle fell off his head and startled the lion which ""turned tail like a veritable coward"" and ran into a rope lasso laid out ready to ensnare him. Bostock's recounting of the story in his memoirs concludes, rather smugly, with: ""I got the lion out of the sewer, as the people of Birmingham supposed I did, only their praise and applause were a little previous."" He died aged 46 in 1912, not by the paw of a justifiably-annoyed big cat but from the flu. There's a docile-looking stone lion on his grave.

Office sauna: The firms taking the sweat out of work,"Dolly Parton sings that ""you're just a step on the boss-man's ladder"" - not much motivation for workin' nine to five. So how can the modern office attract people to tumble outta bed and commute into work, especially when many employees could simply turn on their laptop and get things done? And how can that office make you more productive? One idea, popular among new technology companies, is to mix work and play. Stroll around the London headquarters of peer-to-peer money transfer service TransferWise in Shoreditch, London, and you see scooters, a hammock and, would you believe, one of these: Inez Miedema in the TransferWise office sauna Companies like this say such an office helps create a culture where staff enjoy coming to work, and are more productive as a result. For others, office perks like a sauna are simply a load of hot air. Twenty-somethings might enjoy the perks, says Clare Coatman, of trade union body the TUC, but they must be in addition to, rather than instead of, decent pay and conditions. ""Compare the cost of buying a ping-pong table to offering a living wage, rather than a minimum wage, and you start to cut through to the reality,"" she says. ""Perks are nice, but they do not pay the bills."" Taavet Hinrikus, founder and chief executive of TransferWise, says the aim of his firm's offices around the world is to ""create an environment for people to do their best work"". Finding a premises that allowed everyone to work on the same floor was important, he says. After that, many of the ideas of how to furnish it came from the staff themselves. The overwhelming view, and the resulting set-up, was a mix of areas that suited certain tasks. Various soundproofed phone booths are dotted around. There are traditional desks, soft seating (""the padded cell"") and a kitchen with background music. Friday's playlist included Gregorian chant and the Bee Gees (separately). The TransferWise headquarters in London features a hammock... ...other soft seats... ...table tennis next to the staff kitchen... ...and adult scooters to get around the office Speaking in the Magic Roundabout meeting room, Inez Miedema, head of affiliates and partnerships at TransferWise, admits that her parents - during a tour of the office - saw people playing a football computer game and questioned whether any work actually got done. Ultimately each team has performance indicators to ensure they are doing a good job and those failing to do so will be challenged. The trendy office and flexibility at work helps to attract talent, she says, but it is far from the only attraction, not least pay. There is a keen eye cast over competitors and similar businesses to benchmark the competitiveness of salaries. As the business has grown in size, so has the package of other benefits offered to staff. The TUC's Clare Coatman says young people really want job security and pay progression - much the same as any other generation of workers. No matter how trendy the office, their focus was still on the job, not on the jest. A report by accountancy firm PwC said career progression was the top priority for ""millennials"" - the term typically applied to those born between 1980 and 1999 - who expected to rise rapidly through an organisation. Some 52% of those asked said this was the main attraction in an employer, coming ahead of competitive salaries in second place (44%). The trouble is, says Ms Coatman, that they have very low expectations of the workplace. This theory was echoed in a recent poll commissioned by the RSA which suggested that fewer than one in 10 workers thought that ""all work was fair and decent"". As a result younger workers may choose to move to another job, rather than fight to improve the terms of their current roles, Ms Coatman says. Philip Ross says the modern office needs to be fluid A small, start-up tech firm can quite easily make their office attractive to the young worker, but what about bigger, more traditional companies? Many staff can carry the contents of their desk around with them, usually digitally on a laptop, says Philip Ross, founder and chief executive of UnWork.com, which promotes new ways of working. Young tech-savvy staff, particularly, can work anywhere so why bother getting on a packed bus or sit in a traffic jam to get to a chicken-coop office? ""As a place for people, both employees and clients, it has to work hard to pull people in - there needs to be a compelling reason to come to work,"" UnWork says in a report about a recent project for a business in New York. The office priorities for staff were ""air quality, daylight, good acoustics, great coffee and food"". The motivation for the business was a 30% cut in property costs per person, by using the space more efficiently. This video can not be played What did the ""office of the future"" look like in years gone by? Some of the vocabulary about modern offices - such as ""app-centric workplace"" and ""collision coefficient"" - may raise eyebrows among your average office worker. Yet, the logic behind the lexicon is worth a closer look. Mr Ross says that offices should allow people to move around and work with those engaged in the same ""activities"". The design of a building should encourage people to communicate in person, rather than by email or in formal meetings. Meanwhile, an office app may suggest who in an organisation is free for lunch at the same time. Then, it will point out which of them are working on a similar project. Alternatively it may highlight that some have the same interests, such as running marathons, and match-make them for lunch. However, Mr Ross argues that, among tech start-ups in particular, there has been a ""rush to collaboration"". The trend towards shared space means it can be difficult to find anywhere for staff to quietly get work done on their own. In the end, he says, there needs to be areas of an office to fit different types of work. That, it seems, may even include a sauna in the corner.

Kim wins Players Championship So what does that Players Championship win mean to Kim Si-woo?Â ""I feel like I'm still dreaming,"" he tells Sky Sports. ""I never expected I was going to win this tournament. ""I wasn't doing that well at the beginning of this year, but I'm so excited I can be the champion.

Poulter -7 (18) Ian Poulter has taken an unplayable. He gets the drop on the bark - what can he do from here? Unbelievable! Poulter curls one between a corridor of trees and it fixes its sight on the pin. Surely not? So, so close for the Englishman. That looked for a long time like it might drop. It finishes a foot away. That's fist-pumping stuff from Poulter, who slams his club to the ground in celebration. He taps in for bogey. What a fantastic tournament he's had. Kim -10 (17) Kim Si-woo has the water to his left, fans scrambling to watch him to the right. All he sees is the fairway, and that's exactly where his tee shot heads. Another flawless tee shot from the 21-year-old. oulter -8 (17) Plenty of fans offering up a hand for a high five from the leader en route to the 18th tee. Ian Poulter was there a few moments ago, now he's in a bush at the other end of the hole. That'll be music to Kim Si-woo's ears. Poulter's looking for a way out. This is troublesome. Cabrero Bello -6 (F) Rafa Cabrero Bello speaking to Sky Sports on his celebration after hitting a two at the par-five 16th: ""Initially I didn't think I got the perfect bounce and I didn't know if I got it in or not and then I saw the crowd.Â ""Lots of adrenaline flowing after that shot, I just wanted to enjoy it, let it out. ""The fans come here to enjoy themselves so why not enjoy myself with them as well.""Â Kim -10 (17) Kim Si-woo on the 17th then. The hard work surely already done having found the green. It's a long, long way from the cup, but Kim rolls his putt up to within four feet and with the consistency he's shown today you'd fancy him to clock off another par. He does. Safely through the 17th. On to the last. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Cricketers 'could strike' over contracts,"Australia's next Test series is at home to Bangladesh in August Australian cricketers are ""prepared to strike"" if a contract dispute is not resolved, which could have an impact on the Ashes at the end of the year. In March, Cricket Australiaproposed salary increases for men and women,but this would mean players no longer receive a percentage of CA's revenue. The offer was rejected and CA said it would not pay players after 30 June. Ex-Australia captain Mark Taylor said the Australian Cricketers' Association ""aren't negotiating at all"". Taylor, who is also a CA board member, told a sports chat show on Nine Network on Sunday: ""I have had players say to me in January that we could well be on strike in July."" A letter from CA chief executive James Sutherland to the players' association said 2016-17 contracts would not be renewed without a new agreement. But the ACA said the proposal was ""a win for cricket administrators but a loss for cricket"". ACA chief executive Alistair Nicholson added: ""The point lost on CA is that the players will not respond to threats."" Several Test players responded on Twitter, using the #fairshare hashtag. All-rounder Shane Watson was one of the Australia players who responded to CA's letter on Twitter Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins tweeted on social media in response to the email: ""Players are staying strong #fairshare"". Former Test paceman Mitchell Johnson added: ""Players past & present will stay strong #fairshare"". If the dispute is not resolved, there would be uncertainty over what team Australia could field after 30 June, with a two-Test series scheduled in August in Bangladesh before a home Ashes showdown with England, which runs from 23 November 2017 to 8 January 2018. Former England all-rounder Kevin Pietersen's reaction In a letter sent by CA to the ACA, chief executive James Sutherland said ""players with contracts expiring in 2016-17 will not have contracts for 2017-18"" unless the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) negotiates a new MoU (Memorandum of Understanding)"". The current MoU will expire midway through the women's World Cup, which starts in England and Wales on 24 June. ""The Australian women's World Cup squad will be paid in advance of the June-July World Cup and will be employed until the end of the event,"" Sutherland said. CA declined to comment further when contacted by Reuters. ""There is incoherence and aggression in what we have experienced at the negotiating table from CA,"" Nicholson said in a statement on Sunday. ""However, despite these threats, the players affirm their offer to participate in independent mediation. ""Quite simply, one side entered these negotiations in good faith with an intent to provide a win-win result, and the other is trying to remove player unity and drive a wedge in Australian cricket.""

How I had to terminate my baby's life,"Last year, stand-up comedian Lou Conran had to end her pregnancy at 22 weeks - five-and-a-half months. She is now preparing a show about the experience for the Edinburgh festival, hoping this will encourage people to talk about a subject that is often covered in a blanket of silence. Last year I had to end my pregnancy because my little girl was too ill to go full term. It was devastating and there's not a day goes by that I don't think about her. One thing I have learned over the past year, is just how many people go through an experience like this, and yet it's simply not spoken about. Is it because people don't know what to say? Is it because people are frightened of upsetting you, or is it simply because it's just too tragic a situation to even comprehend. That it's easier to say nothing? Who knows? One thing you do have to deal with is the well-intended people who panic so much about saying the right thing that nine times out of 10 they get it completely wrong, much to my amusement. Among the inappropriate comments I had last year, were: 1) ""Oh you've got loads of presents. You should lose a baby more often."" 2) ""We've had a chat and we'd like to offer you our sperm."" (Five days after I'd given birth) 3) ""You've lost weight, how've you done that?"" Half the battle with baby loss is dealing with other people's reaction to it, and to you, and not only have you got all that going on but of course there's the admin to deal with. I'd signed up to the usual websites, Boots Mother & Baby pages, Mothercare, the ""What fruit is your baby most like?"" apps (which led to anxiety for a week, when it was a grapefruit, because I was convinced I was going to hate my childâ¦ I hate grapefruit) Also, the baby name sites, hypnobirthing and NCT. Cancelling these however, isn't as easy as just clicking a button to subscribe. There should be another button that says, ""Oh dear, you're no longer pregnant, we're so sorry, press here and we'll say no more."" But there isn't. And then there are the Facebook targeted ads. And the junk mail. And and and. The list is endless. When I got pregnant at the age of 41, it was a shock to say the least. It wasn't supposed to happen because three years earlier, medical types had told me my dusty womb was barren. It was wonderful but it completely floored me. At the 12-week scan I was nervous. I was scared my baby would be diagnosed with one of the three conditions they were looking for: Down's, Edwards' or Patau's. I hadn't heard of the other two, but Down's I thought was a high risk given my age. If the baby had had any of these then I guess that I'd have dealt with it. The test results came back and all was fine. Except me. I couldn't get excited. My midwife said that your pregnancy controls you, you don't control it and in hindsight it makes sense now. At the time I put my lack of enthusiasm down to the fact that I felt absolutely awful. Sickness morning, noon and night. Having to nip off at gigs to vomit in between acts was a joy. At the next scan, I was excited, for the first time in five months. My friend came with me. We were excited to find out the flavour of the baby. Then, suddenly, I heard the sonographer say: ""I'm just going to stop the scan here. I'm seeing irregularities that I wouldn't normally expect to see at this stage."" I just lay there, wondering what she was on about. She pointed out that the baby wasn't well. Its body wasn't growing the way it should. Its limbs were shorter than expected and there was a possibility that the baby had skeletal dysplasia, a condition I hadn't even heard of, let alone considered. ""Is it because I don't drink milk?"" I asked, panicking, and thinking I hadn't been doing the right things. ""No. It's nothing you've done; it's unfortunately one of those things. It means that the sperm and egg just weren't compatible during conception."" She sent us to another hospital for a second opinion straight away, but in the car I knew it was game over. I just knew. The second hospital confirmed it with a bit more detail. The bones weren't growing properly, the main issue being with the ribcage. It didn't feel real. It was like she was talking to someone else and it wasn't until I asked what sex the baby was that it hit me. The sonographer confirmed it was a girl and suddenly it - she - became a real person, instead of this little alien growing inside me. Knowing her chest and ribcage were crushing her lungs was devastating. Saying goodbye,external Sands,external Tommys,external I was booked in to see a foetal consultant the following week and the days in between were the longest of my life. All I wanted to do was sleep and not wake up until it was over. ""Your baby won't survive outside of the womb,"" the consultant said. ""She could live a day but her lungs just won't cope."" Game over. I had to terminate my baby's life. The main question for me was, would I have to give birth to her? I couldn't bear the idea of having to go through that. And my worst fears were confirmed. It wouldn't be safe for me to do otherwise. I started the process that afternoon. You get given a tablet that prepares the womb. You go home. You wait two days and then you're booked into hospital where they induce you, and the worst day of your life begins. They call this ""medical management"". My friend came with me. She was amazing, as were the nurses. Like, amazingly fabulous. So sensitive to the situation. And step by step they talked me through what was going to happen. You're bombarded with questions. Do you want a post mortem? Do you want to see her when she's born? What about the funeral? Gahhhhhh! I don't know. The only thing I did know was that I definitely wanted her body to be left to medical research. Something positive had to come out of this, and if she could help answer a few questions about her condition then this had to be the right thing to do. If you've ever been induced in pregnancy, you'll know it's not a picnic. It was around 3pm, and they put hormone tablets up into my cervix. Period pain they said, it might be a bit worse than period pain. Yep. Well, it was. For a bit, then it got worse. I was given diamorphine around 6.30pm and I managed to float off with the fairies for a few hours, until it wore off and the pain was unbearable. This video can not be played Comedian Lou Conran talks about the ""medical management"" of her pregnancy The doctors had only signed me off to have one shot of morphine, so the nurse went off to get me signed off for another one, and while she was out of the room, my waters broke. I had been instructed to give birth over a bedpan in the toilet (I know, glamorous). My mate was with me and held my hand and my baby was born pretty much straight away, over the loo, around 9.50pm. Classy. We waited for the nurse to come back and then this is when the fun began because I couldn't birth the placenta. I had to get back to the bed so the nurse followed me back, holding my baby between my legs, because she was still connected to me via the umbilical cord and the placenta, which wouldn't shift. I pushed. I really pushed but nothing. The baby was detached and taken away. The nurse spoke to her like she was a little person, like she existed, like she was my daughter, which was so comforting. Then it all got a bit bonkers. The bed was surrounded by people, a doctor tried to manually remove the placenta, which was the single most painful thing during the whole scenario. That didn't work, and I was rushed down to theatre. I had an epidural. By this point I was tired, drugged, slightly delirious, and could not care less about what was happening to me. The day after, I was checked over, I got my legs back and I was anxious to go home. I knew at some point the nurse would come back and ask if I wanted to see her. I hadn't been sure I would want to, but I knew if I didn't meet her I would regret it for the rest of my life. I was just dreading it because I didn't know what to expect. The nurse bought her in, in a tiny Moses basket. She was wrapped up like a newborn baby and covered in knitted blankets, a little knitted toy by her side. Her head was larger than I had anticipated and a reddy purple in colour but her little face was pink. Her tiny nose and mouth were perfect. The nurse took out her fingers, which were tiny and I just couldn't believe this little person had been growing, in her own little way, inside me. I was sorry for not ever getting to meet her properly. She was amazing. Yes she looked odd. Yes, she looked alien-like at first glance but when you'd been with her for a bit, you stopped seeing the unusual bits and just saw this little girl's face and fingers. My little girl's face and fingers. She looked so fragile, so delicate. I stroked her tiny cheek, and she was cold to the touch but she felt so soft. I kissed my finger and kissed her cheek with it and all I could do was say sorry to her. I was sorry for not ever getting to meet her properly, for not being able to do the things other mums did with their daughters, for not being able to feed her, or change her nappy, or be a mum to her. I felt so sorry for that. The hospital took photos of her and gave them to me in a card with her name on it. I can't show those pictures to anyone because they wouldn't see the baby that I saw. They wouldn't see my daughter's beautiful face. They would see her illness. I don't need to hear what other people think. There are no words in this situation. And I wouldn't want them. After the worst week of my life had been and gone I did what I always do when I'm upset and stressed beyond comprehension, and that was to move all the furniture around in my flat, and clean it within an inch of its life, stinking of Eau de Domestos for about a week. I started to try and get rid of all the baby things I'd bought. I'd bought a sterilising unit and gave that to my friend who had just had a baby, I'd bought a cot, and gave that to my friend who was due a baby, and I began to make patchwork blankets for other friends, that were having babies. I was surrounded by babies. Everywhere. But what do I do? Ignore my wonderful friends because of their good fortune and never see them again? No. I love them. I managed to create a massive blanket, and it's beautiful. Unfortunately you can't use it as a blanket because I managed to leave most of the pins in it and I can't get to them to take them out because I've sewn the backing on, and I'd have to unstitch the whole thing, so it's in a box in my room, as it's basically a health and safety nightmare. But it was a good distraction leading up to the funeral. When I went to buy a waterproof mascara the week before, I wasn't prepared for the cashier to ask what it was for. ""Sorry?"" ""The waterproof mascara. Wedding or funeral?"" ""Ohâ¦ funeral."" ""Was it anyone close?"" and for a split second I didn't know what to say. I'd not had to tell anyone I didn't know yet and so I just said, ""My daughter."" She gave me my change and walked off crying. It's weird hugging a stranger because you've made them cry with your situation. I got used to it in the end because most of my friends cried when I told them, and in the end I got hardened to the fact that I'd have to comfort other people when it should have been the other way round. The funeral was almost as harrowing as the birth itself The amazing hospital organised my daughter's funeral alongside others that hadn't made it that month. Unfortunately due to an error with bank holiday dates, my parents and I were a week early and inadvertently turned up at an old man's funeral, which is exactly how I love spending my spare time with my parents. So we went home that evening, drank a shed load of wine and had another go the following week. The real funeral was almost as harrowing as the birth itself, but it's important to acknowledge these little lives. All the caskets were placed at the front of the chapel and there was a 30-minute service. The grief in that room was claustrophobic but weirdly comforting. There we all were, all of us affected by the personal tragedy in front of us, in a box. I wanted to talk to the other mums, I wanted to hear their stories, I wanted us all to be united in our grief. But, typically, in our very British way, we all went about our business, heads down. It's been just over a year now, and I'm over the milestones that I was worried about. Christmas, Mother's Day and her birthday. But I strive on. I'm trying to write my Edinburgh show about what has happened (I know it's sure to be a barrel of laughsâ¦ insert scared face emoticon here). And through adversity positivity reigns, and hopefully writing about it will help people who have to endure this pain, and educate others.

Office sauna: Must-have or hot air?,"Dolly Parton sings that ""you're just a step on the boss-man's ladder"" - not much motivation for workin' nine to five. So how can the modern office attract people to tumble outta bed and commute into work, especially when many employees could simply turn on their laptop and get things done? And how can that office make you more productive? One idea, popular among new technology companies, is to mix work and play. Stroll around the London headquarters of peer-to-peer money transfer service TransferWise in Shoreditch, London, and you see scooters, a hammock and, would you believe, one of these: Inez Miedema in the TransferWise office sauna Companies like this say such an office helps create a culture where staff enjoy coming to work, and are more productive as a result. For others, office perks like a sauna are simply a load of hot air. Twenty-somethings might enjoy the perks, says Clare Coatman, of trade union body the TUC, but they must be in addition to, rather than instead of, decent pay and conditions. ""Compare the cost of buying a ping-pong table to offering a living wage, rather than a minimum wage, and you start to cut through to the reality,"" she says. ""Perks are nice, but they do not pay the bills."" Taavet Hinrikus, founder and chief executive of TransferWise, says the aim of his firm's offices around the world is to ""create an environment for people to do their best work"". Finding a premises that allowed everyone to work on the same floor was important, he says. After that, many of the ideas of how to furnish it came from the staff themselves. The overwhelming view, and the resulting set-up, was a mix of areas that suited certain tasks. Various soundproofed phone booths are dotted around. There are traditional desks, soft seating (""the padded cell"") and a kitchen with background music. Friday's playlist included Gregorian chant and the Bee Gees (separately). The TransferWise headquarters in London features a hammock... ...other soft seats... ...table tennis next to the staff kitchen... ...and adult scooters to get around the office Speaking in the Magic Roundabout meeting room, Inez Miedema, head of affiliates and partnerships at TransferWise, admits that her parents - during a tour of the office - saw people playing a football computer game and questioned whether any work actually got done. Ultimately each team has performance indicators to ensure they are doing a good job and those failing to do so will be challenged. The trendy office and flexibility at work helps to attract talent, she says, but it is far from the only attraction, not least pay. There is a keen eye cast over competitors and similar businesses to benchmark the competitiveness of salaries. As the business has grown in size, so has the package of other benefits offered to staff. The TUC's Clare Coatman says young people really want job security and pay progression - much the same as any other generation of workers. No matter how trendy the office, their focus was still on the job, not on the jest. A report by accountancy firm PwC said career progression was the top priority for ""millennials"" - the term typically applied to those born between 1980 and 1999 - who expected to rise rapidly through an organisation. Some 52% of those asked said this was the main attraction in an employer, coming ahead of competitive salaries in second place (44%). The trouble is, says Ms Coatman, that they have very low expectations of the workplace. This theory was echoed in a recent poll commissioned by the RSA which suggested that fewer than one in 10 workers thought that ""all work was fair and decent"". As a result younger workers may choose to move to another job, rather than fight to improve the terms of their current roles, Ms Coatman says. Philip Ross says the modern office needs to be fluid A small, start-up tech firm can quite easily make their office attractive to the young worker, but what about bigger, more traditional companies? Many staff can carry the contents of their desk around with them, usually digitally on a laptop, says Philip Ross, founder and chief executive of UnWork.com, which promotes new ways of working. Young tech-savvy staff, particularly, can work anywhere so why bother getting on a packed bus or sit in a traffic jam to get to a chicken-coop office? ""As a place for people, both employees and clients, it has to work hard to pull people in - there needs to be a compelling reason to come to work,"" UnWork says in a report about a recent project for a business in New York. The office priorities for staff were ""air quality, daylight, good acoustics, great coffee and food"". The motivation for the business was a 30% cut in property costs per person, by using the space more efficiently. This video can not be played What did the ""office of the future"" look like in years gone by? Some of the vocabulary about modern offices - such as ""app-centric workplace"" and ""collision coefficient"" - may raise eyebrows among your average office worker. Yet, the logic behind the lexicon is worth a closer look. Mr Ross says that offices should allow people to move around and work with those engaged in the same ""activities"". The design of a building should encourage people to communicate in person, rather than by email or in formal meetings. Meanwhile, an office app may suggest who in an organisation is free for lunch at the same time. Then, it will point out which of them are working on a similar project. Alternatively it may highlight that some have the same interests, such as running marathons, and match-make them for lunch. However, Mr Ross argues that, among tech start-ups in particular, there has been a ""rush to collaboration"". The trend towards shared space means it can be difficult to find anywhere for staff to quietly get work done on their own. In the end, he says, there needs to be areas of an office to fit different types of work. That, it seems, may even include a sauna in the corner.
