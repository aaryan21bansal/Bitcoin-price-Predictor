Theresa May 'had to sack Damian Green',"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today Damian Green clearly breached ministerial code but calls sacking a ""sad moment"" Theresa May had to sack Damian Green after he ""lied"" over what he knew about police claims to have found porn on his office computer, Jeremy Hunt has said. The health secretary said the PM had acted with a ""heavy heart"" in firing the minister, her second-in-command. Mr Hunt said questions remained about the conduct of the ex-police officer who leaked details of the pornography. Mr Green continues to deny ""hurtful"" allegations that he downloaded and viewed the material. He also apologised for making writer Kate Maltby, who says he made inappropriate advances towards her in 2015, feel uncomfortable. During her visit to Poland, Mrs May said that she expected leaks by former police officers in relation to Mr Green to be ""properly investigated"" and ""taken seriously"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he hoped Mr Green would ""one day come back"" to serve in cabinet. Mr Green has tweeted that he has been ""overwhelmed"" by supportive messages.

Downing Street has confirmed Mr Green is entitled to ministerial severance pay of almost Â£17,000, which equates to a quarter of the annual pay he received as a cabinet minister. The spokesman said it was ""a matter for the former secretary of state"" as to whether he accepts the payment or not. Did a police vendetta topple Damian Green? Profile: Who is Damian Green? It was the minister's denials - rather than anything he is alleged to have done - that ultimately led to his downfall. By admitting he had made ""misleading and inaccurate"" statements to the media, he had breached the ministerial code, a Cabinet Office inquiry found. The inquiry also found that although there were ""competing and contradictory accounts of what were private meetings"" between himself and Ms Maltby, the investigation found her account ""to be plausible"". The investigation was prompted by Ms Maltby's allegations - denied by Mr Green - but it was later widened to include claims legal pornography had been found on his computer after a police raid on his Commons office in 2008. Mr Green reacted to Mr Quick's claims, in a Sunday Times article, by saying he had not been told that ""improper material"" had been found on his Parliamentary computer. He also accused Mr Quick of being the source of the story and said he was ""tainted, untrustworthy and discredited"". May: I asked you to resign Damian Green: Timeline of his downfall But in his resignation letter, he said his statements could have been ""clearer"" and conceded that his lawyers had been informed by Met Police lawyers about their initial discovery in 2008 and the police had also raised the matter with him in a phone call in 2013. ""I apologise that my statements were misleading on this point,"" he said. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was clear Mr Green had ""lied"" and said it was right that cabinet ministers were held to the ""very highest standards of conduct"" - but it was still a ""sad moment"". Mr Quick told the BBC he will continue to ""seek a retraction"" of the comments Mr Green made about him, saying the matter was ""in the hands of my lawyers"". This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC Bob Quick and another retired detective, Neil Lewis, who told the BBC he had been ""shocked"" by the contents of Mr Green's office computer, are being investigated for possible breaches of the Data Protection Act. The Metropolitan Police, who referred the case to the data regulator, said the pair were under investigation over the ""apparent disclosure to the media of confidential material gathered during a police investigation in 2008"". Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: ""These are serious allegations and we are investigating to determine whether the law has been broken and what further action is necessary including potential criminal prosecution."" Conservative MPs are angry about the alleged actions of the two retired detectives, with Jeremy Hunt claiming they ""did not sit comfortably in a democracy"", something, he added, Theresa May ""had made clear"" in her letter to Mr Green. Mr Johnson said the actions of the police ""had the slight feeling of a vendetta"", and needed to be investigated further. Damian Green was a confidant of the prime minister for many years Mr Green, 61, who as first secretary of state was effectively the PM's deputy, is the third cabinet minister to resign in the space of two months - Sir Michael Fallon and Priti Patel both quit in November. It is not likely that Mr Green's exit will suddenly unleash another bout of turmoil,writes the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, in her blog, but it does leave her a ""lonelier figure"". Mr Green, who campaigned for Remain in last year's EU referendum and had been a leading voice in Cabinet for a ""softer"" Brexit, has been a friend of the prime minister's since their Oxford University days. A Downing Street source said his resignation was a matter of sadness and regret for Mrs May, who is in Poland to announce a new defence treaty. But as prime minister she had to make sure members of her government abided by the ministerial code, the source added. The PM may decide not to appoint a new First Secretary of State, Downing Street said, but a replacement for Mr Green's other role, as Cabinet Office minster, would be announced in the New Year. Asked if his departure left Theresa May more isolated, Mr Hunt said ""leadership is lonely"" but she had shown ""extraordinary resilience in very challenging circumstances"". Kate Maltby's account was found to be plausible, the report says Kate Maltby's parents, Colin and Victoria, said in a statement they were not surprised to find that the inquiry found Mr Green to have been ""untruthful as a minister, nor that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness"". They praised their 31-year-old daughter for her courage in speaking out about the ""abuse of authority"". Ms Maltby is not commenting on Mr Green's resignation until she receives more details from the Cabinet Office. On the wider issue of dealing with instances of sexual harassment or bulling in Parliament, Mrs May said the leader of the House of Commons and leader of the House of Lords were working to ensure there was a proper grievance procedure.

'No 10 knew' of Green claims in 2016,"This video can not be played Kate Maltby on ""highly sexualised"" Westminster environment Kate Maltby, who claims Damian Green made inappropriate advances to her, says she told a senior Downing Street aide about his behaviour in 2016. The MP, who denies the claims, was sacked from the cabinet on Wednesday. This came after an inquiry found he had broken the ministerial code over ""misleading"" statements after pornography was found on his computer. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was not aware of the claims about Mr Green until last month. Allegations 'completely false' - Green Theresa May 'had to sack Damian Green' Did a police vendetta topple Damian Green? Speaking on a visit to Cyprus, she said she had first read about them inan article by Ms Maltby in the Times newspaper.,external She said: ""I recognise that Kate Maltby was obviously extremely distressed by what happened. Damian Green has recognised that and he has apologised. I think that is absolutely the right thing to do."" She has said it is important that people working in Parliament feel they can bring forward any concerns they have to be ""treated seriously"". The Cabinet Office investigation into Mr Green was prompted by her allegations that Mr Green had ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message. The inquiry was later widened to include the claims about legal pornography being discovered on his computer after a police raid on his Commons office in 2008. Speaking after the inquiry, which concluded that her evidence was ""plausible"", Ms Maltby told the BBC she had not told many people about the alleged incident at the time - except her parents - as she ""wondered if it was a one-off"". ""Eventually I spoke to a very senior and long-serving aide of Theresa May,"" she added. When giving evidence to the inquiry, she told its head, Sue Gray, that Downing Street was aware of her allegations ""to the best of my knowledge"". ""I was aware that he was the deputy prime minister and I was aware that No 10 knew about it."" Ms Maltby said she had never called for Mr Green's sacking, but wrote her article because she wanted to change the culture of Downing Street. ""This whole story has been about power,"" she said. ""Damian Green became a very, very powerful person. ""I was aware that there seemed to be improper mixing of mentorship and sexual advance within the Conservative party in his case."" Mr Green was sacked after making ""misleading"" statement about pornography found on his computer Ms Maltby added: ""My actions in this have never been guided by the quest to claim scalps, to force resignations to end people's careers. ""We need an end to the era in which the sexual exploitation of younger people is the sort of peccadillo of a politician. ""That is tolerated by those in power and perhaps exploited to enforce party discipline but not to actually do any good."" A Downing Street source told the BBC: ""The Cabinet Office conducted a thorough investigation into a number of allegations about Damian Green. ""The PM has made it clear that everyone should be able to work in politics without fear or harassment - that is why she has brought forward a new code of conduct for the Conservative Party, and set up a cross-party working group to make recommendations about the Houses of Parliament."" Speaking on Thursday, Mrs May reiterated her personal ""sadness"" at sacking her close ally Mr Green but said it was ""absolutely right"" that he had apologised to Ms Maltby. Although Mr Green was sacked over his statements about the pornography on his computer, he used his resignation letter to also apologise to Ms Maltby, who was a family friend. ""I deeply regret the distress caused to Kate Maltby following her article about me and the reaction to it,"" he wrote. ""I do not recognise the events she described in her article, but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and for this I apologise.""

Police vendetta against Green?,"Damian Green (right) described Bob Quick's claims as ""disreputable political smears"" Allies of Damian Green are said to regard hisdismissalas the culmination of a nine-year vendetta by police, orchestrated by Bob Quick, the former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner. Mr Quick oversaw a controversial investigation in 2008 into leaks from the Home Office which led to Mr Green's arrest, a raid on his Westminster office and the seizure of his parliamentary computers. The Scotland Yard officer faced such heavy criticism over the inquiry that when he made a security blunder in April 2009, inadvertently revealing details of an anti-terror operation, support for him quickly drained away and he resigned. Implicit in the suggestion of the ""vendetta"" theory is that the first secretary of state's dismissal was somehow ""payback"" by Mr Quick for that career-ending leaks inquiry. But the reality is that Mr Green was the architect of his own downfall. Profile: Damian Green Damian Green sacked after porn allegations Timeline of his downfall May: I asked you to resign On November 4, as the Sunday Times presses rolled with the exclusive story, confirmed by Mr Quick, that pornography had been found on Mr Green's work computers, the MPtweeted a statement,externaldismissing the claims in the strongest possible terms. The story was ""false"", said Mr Green, who described the allegations as ""disreputable political smears"" from a ""tainted, untrustworthy... and discredited"" officer. Furthermore, police had ""never suggested to me improper material was found"", he wrote. Mr Green's statement was a calculated, but high-risk, gamble, apparently intended to recast the pornography claims in the light of a police feud and deflect attention on to Mr Quick's motives. And for a while it worked. Indeed, a week later, when the Met Commissioner at the time, Sir Paul Stephenson,told the BBC that he too had been aware of the pornography find, the cabinet minister repeated his assertion that he had never been told about ""improper material"" on his parliamentary computers, claiming again that the disclosure was being made for ""ulterior motives"". But as the Cabinet Office inquiry has now established, Damian Green's statements were ""misleading and inaccurate"". In fact, as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has acknowledged, his former colleague ""lied"". Mr Green knew about the pornography all along: police had told his lawyers in 2008 and then discussed it with him in 2013. Only Mr Green can explain why he denied all knowledge of the material. Mr Hunt suggested on the Today programme, on BBC Radio 4, it was something ""he didn't mean to say"", but Mr Green said it twice, which indicates it was rather more than a slip of the tongue. His vehement protestations of innocence and counter-accusation against Bob Quick had the effect of ratcheting up the row when it might have served his interests better to dampen it down. Damian Green leaves his London house a day after standing down Neil Lewis, the detective who had inspected Mr Green's computers in 2008, was so angered at the minister's remarks that he contacted Mr Quick to offer support and made himself available to the Cabinet Office inquiry. The inquiry never contacted Mr Lewis to give evidence, fuelling his concerns that it would not be able to establish the full facts about the pornography and might result in a whitewash. As a result, the former police IT specialist later agreed to abroadcast interview. Mr Lewis's decision to speak out, together with Mr Quick's public statements, are now being investigated by the Information Commissioner, who will assess whether they broke data protection laws. A number of senior politicians and police officers believe the two men breached their duty to keep confidential information gleaned during the course of a police inquiry. But it is unclear if the pair, who claim they have acted in the public interest, have done anything illegal. They cannot face internal disciplinary sanctions because they have retired from the police service. Besides, the focus of this saga remains on Damian Green. After all, it was his conduct that sparked the revelations. Damian Green in his parliamentary office after his arrest in 2008 And given that the Conservative MP now admits knowing about the claims pornography had been found on his work computers there are searching questions about what he did or should have done with that information. If, as he alleges, he had not downloaded or viewed the material himself, did he inform the parliamentary authorities that his computers had been improperly accessed or hacked by someone else? Did Mr Green tell David Cameron that his computers' security may have been compromised when the former prime minister appointed him to the Home Office in 2010? And was Theresa May informed about it when Mr Green was her policing minister between 2012 and 2014, and later when she rejuvenated his political career by bringing him into the cabinet? There may be wider issues for the police - particularly where the boundaries lie between maintaining confidentiality and exposing alleged wrongdoing.  But that should not detract from the bigger questions facing a cabinet minister who failed to tell the truth.

Kuenssberg: May loses ally,"As Theresa May was just ending her year in a better place than her team could have imagined, her deputy has been forced to depart from government, despite his continued insistence that he has done nothing wrong. Damian Green has never been a politician with a huge public persona, or even a hugely well-known character. But he was an extremely important ally of Theresa May. Not just a political friend but a genuine one, close to her for decades. Full report: Damian Green sacked after porn allegations The government, so the joke in Westminster goes, has become ""weak and stable"", with number 10 taking back some control of the agenda in recent weeks. So it is not likely that Mr Green's exit will suddenly unleash another bout of turmoil. But the prime minister clearly took this decision very seriously. His friends in government had believed that he would have been cleared, with one minister telling me today, ""he'll be fine"". After the prime minister received the initial report on Monday from the Cabinet Office official Sue Grey, who found flaws in his account, Mrs May asked for further advice, calling in her independent adviser, Sir Alex Allan. He then, in turn, concluded that there had been breaches of the rules. With that, Mrs May had little choice but to ask him to go. But just as Damian Green's friends say it is a disappointment for him, still insisting that he has done nothing wrong, so too it is a political blow for the prime minister. She is a politician who guards her views, her own persona very closely. To lose one of the few who understood her, who she trusts, leaves her a lonelier figure tonight.

UN rejects Trump's Jerusalem declarationStates overwhelmingly call on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.,"This video can not be played Haley's warning: ""The United States will remember this day"" The UN General Assembly has decisively backed a resolution effectively calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The text says thatany decisions regarding the status of the city are ""null and void"",externaland must be cancelled. The non-binding resolution was approved by 128 states, with 35 abstaining and nine others voting against. It came after US President Donald Trump threatened to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. Following the vote, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US was exploring ""various options"" and no decisions had yet been made. The nine who voted against the resolution were the US, Israel, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo Among the 35 abstaining were Canada and Mexico Those voting in favour included the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia and the UK) as well as key US allies in the Muslim world There were 21 countries who did not turn up for the vote. Read more: How did your country vote? The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Israel occupied the east of the city in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Anger in Ramallah and delight in West Jerusalem Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy. The 193-member UN General Assembly held the rare emergency special session at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month. The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution that was similar to the text approved on Thursday. The text put forward by Turkey and Yemen does not mention the US, but expresses ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem"". It also says ""any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council"". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised to reject the results of the vote, calling the UN a ""house of lies"". Afterwards he said in a statement: ""Israel thanks President Trump for his unequivocal position in favour of Jerusalem and thanks those countries that voted alongside Israel, alongside the truth."" The view from one street Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the vote ""a victory for Palestine"". In a speech before the vote, US permanent representative Nikki Haley stressed that the US decision did not prejudge any final status issues, and did not preclude a two-state solution if the parties agreed to that. ""The United States will remember this day, on which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,"" she said. ""America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that."" This video can not be played Trump: ""We're watching those votes"" On Wednesday, Mr Trump warned he might cut financial aid to states who voted in favour of the resolution. ""They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,"" he said. ""Well, we're watching those votes,"" he added. ""Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care."" Analysis by Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs analyst The result of the UN General Assembly vote was inevitable: the US knew that the majority of states would vote for the resolution. But there may have been slightly more abstentions and votes against than had been expected - which will be some comfort to the Trump administration.

UN rejects Trump's Jerusalem declarationStates overwhelmingly call on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.3h3 hours agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played Haley's warning: ""The United States will remember this day"" The UN General Assembly has decisively backed a resolution effectively calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The text says thatany decisions regarding the status of the city are ""null and void"",externaland must be cancelled. The non-binding resolution was approved by 128 states, with 35 abstaining and nine others voting against. It came after US President Donald Trump threatened to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. Following the vote, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US was exploring ""various options"" and no decisions had yet been made. The nine who voted against the resolution were the US, Israel, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo Among the 35 abstaining were Canada and Mexico Those voting in favour included the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia and the UK) as well as key US allies in the Muslim world There were 21 countries who did not turn up for the vote. Read more: How did your country vote? The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Israel occupied the east of the city in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Anger in Ramallah and delight in West Jerusalem Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy. The 193-member UN General Assembly held the rare emergency special session at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month. The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution that was similar to the text approved on Thursday. The text put forward by Turkey and Yemen does not mention the US, but expresses ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem"". It also says ""any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council"". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised to reject the results of the vote, calling the UN a ""house of lies"". Afterwards he said in a statement: ""Israel thanks President Trump for his unequivocal position in favour of Jerusalem and thanks those countries that voted alongside Israel, alongside the truth."" The view from one street Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the vote ""a victory for Palestine"". In a speech before the vote, US permanent representative Nikki Haley stressed that the US decision did not prejudge any final status issues, and did not preclude a two-state solution if the parties agreed to that. ""The United States will remember this day, on which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,"" she said. ""America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that."" This video can not be played Trump: ""We're watching those votes"" On Wednesday, Mr Trump warned he might cut financial aid to states who voted in favour of the resolution. ""They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,"" he said. ""Well, we're watching those votes,"" he added. ""Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care."" Analysis by Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs analyst The result of the UN General Assembly vote was inevitable: the US knew that the majority of states would vote for the resolution. But there may have been slightly more abstentions and votes against than had been expected - which will be some comfort to the Trump administration. There's little surprise in the countries that voted against - the likes of Micronesia, Nauru and Togo had nothing to gain from voting against the interests of the US, which helps support them. Canada, Mexico and Poland were amongst those that abstained, in a move that will do nothing to harm their relations with the US. The votes for the resolution from powerful US allies, such as France, Germany and the UK, could be seen as a slap in the face for President Trump - but all would argue that they simply voted in line with the existing status quo at the UN.

Cheese recalled over listeria concernsErrington's Dunsyre Blue was named as the most likely source of an E.coli outbreak last year.3h3 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland,"A cheesemaker that was named as the most likely source of an E.coli outbreak last year has recalled one of its products over listeria fears. South Lanarkshire-based Errington Cheese is recalling a batch of Dunsyre Blue after listeria monocytogenes was found by a wholesaler. Dunsyre Blue is an unpasteurised cows' milk cheese. Health experts said it was the likely source of an outbreak of 26 cases of E. coli O157 last year. One of the cases was a three-year-old girl, who later died. The Crown Office later saidthere was no evidence available to link the cheese with the child's deathin September 2016 Food Standards Scotland has now said Errington Cheese Ltd has ""voluntarily"" recalled a batch of Dunsyre Blue after listeria was detected. The batch number involved is J9, it said. The food standards body advised people who had bought the product not to eat it. They said customers should return it to where it was bought for a full refund. Symptoms caused by Listeria monocytogenes can be similar to flu and includes high temperature, muscle ache or pains, chills, feeling or being sick and diarrhoea. In rare cases, the infection can be more severe, causing serious complications, such as meningitis. Older people, pregnant women and babies are at most risk.

Poundland's 'Naughty Elf' ad drops TwiningsThe discount chain has removed box of the brand's tea from an ad after the company complained on Twitter.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"Poundland has removed the image of a box of Twinings tea from a controversial social media advert after the company complained on Twitter. The campaign displayed a toy elf in a suggestive pose with a plastic doll in front of a box of Twinings Classics tea. Twinings tweeted that the picture ""misuses our product"". The picture has reappeared, but without the box of Classics Selection tea and a caption: ""Spot the difference?"" Poundland refused to comment on the change, but all the previous offending pictures had disappeared from Twitter by 17:30 GMT on Thursday. Twinings tweeted about the Poundland campaign: ""We had no involvement in this and... it is obviously not reflective of our brand values."" Poundland has been running its ""Naughty Elf"" adverts since the beginning of December. They have included tableaux of a toy elf in a hot tub with naked dolls and another of the toy elf playing strip poker. The campaign has divided opinion on Twitter, with some praising it as ""brilliant"", others damning it as ""outdated misogyny"". Many tweets speculated that Poundland's Twitter Feed had been hacked. However, Poundland confirmed the adverts were genuine. Marketing Director Mark Pym said: ""The love on Facebook has been overwhelming, and that's because it connects with our shoppers. ""We're proud of a campaign that's only cost Â£25.53 and is being touted as the winning marketing campaign this Christmas!"" A spokesperson for the Advertising Standards Authority confirmed they had had eight complaints about the advertising campaign, all on Thursday, claiming that it was offensive and unsuitable to be seen by children. He said: ""Because the complaints have only just come in we will assess them and then decide whether there is a problem, and whether the advertisements need to be investigated.""

"Toys R Us staves off collapse after talksLast-minute talks with pension watchdog secure Â£9.8m pension fund injection, but stores will close.6h6 hours agoBusiness","Toys R Us has staved off collapse after creditors backed a rescue plan for the UK retailer. It follows last-minute negotiations with the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) to secure a Â£9.8m injection into the company's pension fund.

The retailer's creditors met on Thursday to vote on the rescue plan, which hinged on a resolution of the pension deficit. Toys R Us's UK staff pension scheme has a deficit of more than Â£25m. The PPF said the new offer from the company was composed of a payment of Â£3.8m in 2018, with a further Â£6m promised over 2019 and 2020.

Jailed mum 'eligible for early release',"This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe tells the BBC: ""Formally, on the system, she's eligible to be released at any point."" British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held in Iran for 18 months, has been told she is eligible for early release, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe told BBC Radio 5 Live that an Iranian judiciary database had listed her as ""eligible for release"". He said her lawyer was ""hopeful"" when he visited her in prison on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 after being accused of spying - charges she denies. Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife's case had previously been marked as ""closed"", so the status change was ""great news"". ""Part of me is trying not to get too hopeful and just to keep calm just in case there is more to come,"" he said. ""But he (her lawyer) was clearly hopeful. He told her that it's a matter of finalising paperwork and it might be days to weeks rather than tomorrow morning. ""But definitely it feels like the end is much closer in sight."" What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Johnson in Iran for talks on jailed Briton Mr Ratcliffe said he felt there was a ""change of the tide"" since Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson travelled to Iran, as since then a second case against his 37-year-old wife was postponed and then cancelled. ""And now suddenly the database is shifting and saying eligible for early release,"" he said. ""She's still in prison but everything is feeling very positive."" Mr Johnson was in Iran for talks earlier this month and pressed for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release on humanitarian grounds. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 He had been accused of risking an additional five years being added to her sentence when he told a parliamentary committee that she had been in Iran to train journalists. In November,he apologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Hampstead and Kilburn MP Tulip Siddiq said the news had given the family a ""glimmer of light"". ""It has given Nazanin a real boost of positive energy, and now we wait impatiently to see what happens next,"" she told the BBC. ""Although we do not want to celebrate prematurely, it would be the perfect Christmas gift to see Nazanin released and back with her family where she belongs."" Mr Ratcliffe said part of him was still hoping his wife would be home in time for Christmas. ""Definitely hopeful, we will be singing our carols with great gusto,"" he said.

Ex-priest gets 18 years for abusing boys,"Laurence Soper fled to Kosovo in a bid to avoid prosecution for abusing the boys at St Benedict's School in west London A Catholic priest who abused boys at a London school in the 1970s and 1980s has been jailed for 18 years. Laurence Soper, 74, fled to Kosovo with Â£182,000 from the Vatican bank in a bid to avoid prosecution for abusing boys at the independent St Benedict's School, in Ealing, where he taught. He was extradited to face 19 charges of indecent and serious sexual assault against 10 former pupils. He is the fourth man to be convicted of molesting children at the school. Sentencing, Judge Anthony Bate said Soper's conduct was ""the most appalling breach of trust"" and he had ""subverted the rules of the Benedictine order and teachings of the Catholic Church"". He said the former abbot and headmaster's life would now be ""overshadowed by the proven catalogue of vile abuse"". AnOld Bailey jury took 14 hours to find Soper guilty of all chargeson 6 December. Laurence Soper was a senior priest at the Catholic school Prosecutor Gillian Etherton QC told how the victims were subjected to ""sadistic"" beatings by Soper for ""fake reasons"" and on many occasions ""with what can only have been a sexual motive"". The ""reasons"" included kicking a football in the wrong direction, failing to use double margins and using the wrong staircase. St Benedict's apologised for the ""serious wrongs of the past"" while Ealing Abbey said: ""We apologise to everyone who is affected by the crimes Soper committed. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his victims. We admire them for their courage in coming forward as witnesses."" Soper's victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were supported by relatives in court when he was sentenced. One victim suffered from nightmares and flashbacks after the abuse, but chose not to come forward out of fear of more beatings, the jury heard during the trial. Another victim said he was left faithless and suicidal. In a statement read out in court, he said he wanted to be a vet or pilot before his life was ruined. He said he began drinking to ""numb the pain of what was happening to him"". Having been brought up a strict Catholic, he said he had since lost his faith, adding: ""I have tried countless times to take my own life - I just could not cope."" Soper is the latest in a string of men to face allegations relating to their work at St Benedict's. In 2009, Father David Pearce, 75, nicknamed the ""devil in a dog collar"",was jailed after he admitted 11 charges of indecent assault dating back to 1972,external Between 2003 and 2009, ""master of discipline"" John Maestri, 78, of Chatham in Kent, admittedfive indecent assaults against childrenat St Benedict's in the 1980s and was jailed In 2010, Stephen Skelton was convicted of indecent assaults against two complainants said to have occurred in 1983 Father Anthony Gee faced accusations of abuse, but no further action was taken although civil action was brought against him In 2010, Abbot Shipperlee announced an independent review of safeguarding arrangements, policies and procedures. The following year, Lord Carlileproduced a damning report calling for tougher rulesto protect all faith pupils and stripped monks of control at the school. Soper resigned as an abbot at the Â£5,000-a-term school in 2000 and moved to Rome, during which time victims started to come forward. He then skipped bail and spent six years living in Kosovo, with a European Arrest Warrant issued for his extradition. Judge Bate said: ""You have been a clandestine sex offender since your early 30s. Your disgrace is complete."" Soper was attacked while on remand at Wormwood Scrubs prison, the court heard. He is now being held in segregation for his own protection.

"NHS to cancel ops to cope with winterBosses say the move is needed to prepare for the early January spike in demand, but surgeons complain of short notice.","Hospitals across England have been told to cancel non-emergency operations in the new year to prepare for a post-Christmas surge in patients. The first weeks of January are often the busiest of the year with winter illnesses peaking, combined with the growing day-to-day demand in A&E. So an emergency panel of NHS bosses is urging hospitals to cut back on their routine work, such as knee and hip ops. They hope it will give hospitals some breathing space to cope. Publicly, no figure is being put on the number of operations that should be put off, although the BBC understands hospitals are working on the basis of doing 10% fewer. That would mean in the region of 15,000 operations not taking place in the first two weeks of January. The panel has suggested hospitals use the staff freed up by the move to set up ""hot clinics"" staffed by experts in conditions such as respiratory illness to take the pressure off A&E. The directive is the first to be issued by the NHS National Emergency Pressures Panel, a new group of senior doctors, nurses and managers set up to advise NHS England.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Panel chair Prof Sir Bruce Keogh said it would be sensible for hospitals to curtail the amount of planned work they are doing until at least mid January. ""NHS staff are working flat out to cope with seasonal pressures and ensure patients receive the best possible care. ""However, given the scale of the challenge, hospitals should be planning for a surge that comes in the new year by freeing up beds and staff where they can to care for our sickest patients."" He said this would reduce the need for last-minute cancellations which were unfair on patients. It comes as figures released on Thursday showed pressures had already started building. The weekly bulletin from NHS England showed over 1,000 beds were closed because of the vomiting bug Norovirus - nearly 10% of the hospital bed-stock - while ambulances were increasingly likely to find themselves delayed when they dropped off patients at A&E. Pauline Philip, the NHS national director for emergency care, said it was a sensible move. She also urged hospitals to make the most of the extra Â£350m winter funding provided by the government, which was released into the system last week. And she added: ""There is still time for the public to play their part by ensuring they have their flu jab and by using local pharmacies and NHS 111."" Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, welcomed the move as it provided clarity over what should be done as pressures grow. But he said it was still pretty ""short notice"" for those patients who face having their operations cancelled. And he urged hospitals to prioritise cancer treatment and other planned operations that, if cancelled, would harm patients.

Melbourne attack 'not terror related',"This video can not be played The crash happened on Flinders Street at a busy crossing in the centre of the city The man who deliberately drove a car into a crowd in Melbourne is a drug user with mental health issues but no known terrorism links, police say. The Australian citizen of Afghan descent was taken into custody after a struggle at the scene of the incident. The car the 32-year-old was driving hit a number of pedestrians on Flinders Street, a busy thoroughfare in the city centre, said Victoria Police. Fourteen people have been injured, with several in a critical condition. A second man, 24, was arrested after being seen filming the incident. He had a bag of knives with him, police added. ""It is now believed he had no links to the incident, however he is still assisting police with inquiries,"" they said. The driver was arrested by an off-duty police officer. Police say he was the only person in the car. The officer sustained shoulder and hand injuries during the arrest and was taken to hospital. The driver was also taken to hospital, under police guard. Police arrested this man at the scene The white SUV struck pedestrians just after 16:30 local time (05:30 GMT). Witness Jim Stoupas, who runs a business nearby, told the BBC:  ""It just barrelled through a completely full intersection of pedestrians. There was no attempt to brake, no attempt to swerve."" He added: ""I saw probably five to eight people on the ground with people swarming around them [to help]. Within a minute, I think, there were police on site, so it was very, very speedy."" Ambulance Victoria said in a statement that a child of pre-school age with serious head injuries was among those taken to hospital. Another witness, Lachlan Read, told the Herald Sun the whole incident lasted about 15 seconds. ""He has gone straight through the red light at pace and it was bang, bang, bang. It was just one after the other,"" he said of the moment the vehicle started hitting people. Rossella Belardi told the BBC she was coming out of Flinders Street Station when she saw people running.  ""Many people were on the floor and smoke was coming out of the car."" ""Police and the ambulance service were incredible,"" she added. ""They came immediately out of nowhere."" Police have cordoned off the area by Flinders Street station Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Twitter that the investigations had begun, and sent ""thoughts and prayers"" to those affected.

Cheese recalled over listeria concerns,"A cheesemaker that was named as the most likely source of an E.coli outbreak last year has recalled one of its products over listeria fears. South Lanarkshire-based Errington Cheese is recalling a batch of Dunsyre Blue after listeria monocytogenes was found by a wholesaler. Dunsyre Blue is an unpasteurised cows' milk cheese. Health experts said it was the likely source of an outbreak of 26 cases of E. coli O157 last year. One of the cases was a three-year-old girl, who later died. The Crown Office later saidthere was no evidence available to link the cheese with the child's deathin September 2016 Food Standards Scotland has now said Errington Cheese Ltd has ""voluntarily"" recalled a batch of Dunsyre Blue after listeria was detected. The batch number involved is J9, it said. The food standards body advised people who had bought the product not to eat it. They said customers should return it to where it was bought for a full refund. Symptoms caused by Listeria monocytogenes can be similar to flu and includes high temperature, muscle ache or pains, chills, feeling or being sick and diarrhoea. In rare cases, the infection can be more severe, causing serious complications, such as meningitis. Older people, pregnant women and babies are at most risk.

Another image seen by the BBC shows him leaving through the front door of the prime minister's residence. Last year, Mr Yezhov visited the White House where he translated for Mr Groysman during talks with former US Vice-President Joe Biden. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have escalated in recent years. In 2014, Mr Yanukovych - who was pro-Moscow - was driven from power by violent protests in Kiev. Russian-backed forces then seized control of the Crimean peninsula, which is officially part of Ukraine. The continued presence of the Russian fleet at the port of Sevastopol in Crimea has also been a focus of tension between the countries. In 2008, Ukraine demanded that Moscow not use the fleet that is based there during its conflict with Georgia.

May seeks to reassure Polish residents,"Theresa May was in Poland to sign a defence treaty with the country Theresa May has sought to reassure Polish people living in the UK that they are still welcome after Brexit. Speaking on a trip to Warsaw to sign a new defence treaty with the country, the PM said the one million Polish residents were a ""strong part of [UK] society"". She promised a ""simple"" and ""easy"" process to get ""settled status"" to remain after the UK leaves the EU. The trip comes afterMrs May sacked one of her closest allies, Damian Green. She asked him to leave after he made ""misleading"" statements about claims pornography was found on his parliamentary computer. Senior members of the cabinet, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, have joined her on the visit. How will Poland behave towards the UK in negotiations? UK seeks defence partnership with EU The prime minister told the bilateral summit in the Polish capital it was a ""key priority"" for her visit to ""give assurance"" to Polish nationals living in the UK that ""we want them to stay"". ""That's why we worked so hard to get a deal with the EU earlier this month, to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK,"" she added. Mrs May said there would be certain requirements, such as the length of time a person has been in the UK, to achieve ""settled status"", but residents will be given a ""significant period"" to apply. She added: ""We value Polish citizens and other EU citizens in the UK. They have made a life choice, we want them to be able to continue with that life choice."" The PM recently wrote to the 980,000 Polesin the UK urging them to stay in the country after Brexit, reassuring them that the process of applying for settled status will be quick and inexpensive. The two leaders signed the defence treaty before giving speeches, saying it was a ""powerful symbol"" of co-operation. Downing Street said it was only the second such agreement the UK has with a European ally, after France. It provides a framework for enhanced co-operation in training, information sharing, defence procurement and joint exercises between the Nato partners. The UK has also backed an initiative to blunt Russian propaganda in the region. ""Poland matters greatly to the UK,"" Mrs May said. ""I am determined that Brexit will not weaken our relationship with Poland. Rather, it will serve as a catalyst to strengthen it."" Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? All you need to know about Brexit Mrs May has also announced that the UK is to provide Â£5m of funding to a joint UK-Polish plan to counter Russian misinformation in the region. Part of the money will go towards supporting Belsat, a Polish-funded TV channel broadcasting in Belarus, one of Russia's closest allies in the region. Last month, Mrs May said Moscow was seeking to ""sow discord"" in the West by meddling in elections and mounting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure. Theresa May with Poland's former Prime Minister Beata Szydlo, who was replaced by Mateusz Morawiecki earlier this month Her visit comes hours afterthe EU announced disciplinary measures against Poland, accusing the country of undermining the independence of its judges. Downing Street said Mrs May would raise her concerns with new Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, but she told a press conference constitutional issues were ""primarily a matter for the country concerned, not the EU"".

Hope of new lead in mystery Alps murders,"This video can not be played Alps Murder: 'No progress' five years on French police are looking into a possible new lead in the unsolved killing of a British man, his wife and mother-in-law in the Alps in 2012. Saad al-Hilli, Iqbal al-Hilli and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf were shot dead on holiday. Police are questioning a 34-year-old ex-soldier who is the main suspect in two other cases in the area. One relates to the disappearance of a nine-year-old girl in August, the other to the killing of a soldier. The suspect, Nordahl Lelandais, has been in custody since September as part of the investigation over the disappearance of MaÃ«lys de Araujo in the ChambÃ©ry region of south-eastern France. He has been charged with kidnapping the girl, which he has denied. ""We are going to look at all the disturbing disappearances which have taken place in this region,"" ChambÃ©ry Prosecutor Thierry Dran told reporters, without specifying which cases would be reviewed. But they reportedly include the al-Hillis, as well as cases involving Adrien Mourial, a 24-year-old Belgian citizen who went missing near Lake Annecy in July, and Jean-Christophe Morin and Ahmed Hamad, who vanished in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The bodies of Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, were found on a remote road in Chevaline, near Lake Annecy in south-eastern France, on 5 September 2012. A passing French cyclist was also killed. The couple's two young daughters survived the shooting. One, then four, was discovered hiding under her mother's body inside the family car, eight hours after the shooting. Saad al-Hilli was killed while on holiday in France The other, then seven, was found with serious head injuries after being shot and beaten. In September, the French lead prosecutor saidwork was being carried out to identify the previous owners of the gunsused in the attack, but that there were no potential suspects in the case. MaÃ«lys de Araujo was last seen on 27 August in a children's area at a hall in Pont-de-Beauvoisin, 40km (25 miles) west of ChambÃ©ry, during a wedding in which Mr Lelandais was a guest. Her parents say they did not know him, nor had they had any argument with him. MaÃ«lys attended the wedding with her parents DNA of the girl was found on the dashboardof Mr Lelandais' car. According to his lawyer, he has admitted that MaÃ«lys was in his vehicle on the night she disappeared but said that did not prove his guilt. The suspect lived with his parents 30km from ChambÃ©ry. Mr Lelandais is also under investigation for the killing of 23-year-old soldier Arthur Noyer whose skull was found by a walker on 7 September in Montmelian, 16km from ChambÃ©ry. Mr Dran said data trawls revealed that, following Mr Noyer's disappearance on 11 April, the suspect did online searches with the key words ""human body decomposition"". The suspect admitted being in the area where Mr Noyer disappeared but denied any involvement in the killing.

UN rejects Trump's Jerusalem declaration,"This video can not be played Haley's warning: ""The United States will remember this day"" The UN General Assembly has decisively backed a resolution effectively calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The text says thatany decisions regarding the status of the city are ""null and void"",externaland must be cancelled. The non-binding resolution was approved by 128 states, with 35 abstaining and nine others voting against. It came after US President Donald Trump threatened to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. Following the vote, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US was exploring ""various options"" and no decisions had yet been made. The nine who voted against the resolution were the US, Israel, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo Among the 35 abstaining were Canada and Mexico Those voting in favour included the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia and the UK) as well as key US allies in the Muslim world There were 21 countries who did not turn up for the vote. Read more: How did your country vote? The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Israel occupied the east of the city in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Anger in Ramallah and delight in West Jerusalem Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy. The 193-member UN General Assembly held the rare emergency special session at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month. The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution that was similar to the text approved on Thursday. The text put forward by Turkey and Yemen does not mention the US, but expresses ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem"". It also says ""any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council"". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised to reject the results of the vote, calling the UN a ""house of lies"". Afterwards he said in a statement: ""Israel thanks President Trump for his unequivocal position in favour of Jerusalem and thanks those countries that voted alongside Israel, alongside the truth."" The view from one street Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the vote ""a victory for Palestine"". In a speech before the vote, US permanent representative Nikki Haley stressed that the US decision did not prejudge any final status issues, and did not preclude a two-state solution if the parties agreed to that. ""The United States will remember this day, on which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,"" she said. ""America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that."" This video can not be played Trump: ""We're watching those votes"" On Wednesday, Mr Trump warned he might cut financial aid to states who voted in favour of the resolution. ""They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,"" he said. ""Well, we're watching those votes,"" he added. ""Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care."" Analysis by Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs analyst The result of the UN General Assembly vote was inevitable: the US knew that the majority of states would vote for the resolution. But there may have been slightly more abstentions and votes against than had been expected - which will be some comfort to the Trump administration. There's little surprise in the countries that voted against - the likes of Micronesia, Nauru and Togo had nothing to gain from voting against the interests of the US, which helps support them. Canada, Mexico and Poland were amongst those that abstained, in a move that will do nothing to harm their relations with the US. The votes for the resolution from powerful US allies, such as France, Germany and the UK, could be seen as a slap in the face for President Trump - but all would argue that they simply voted in line with the existing status quo at the UN. There was no pressing reason for them to switch from this stance. But the real test of the vote will be whether the Trump administration acts on its threats to reconsider financial aid to some of those who backed the resolution.  Key, too, will be whether the resolution will give fresh impetus to the protests against the US decision that have been going on ever since it was announced, but have yet to really catch fire.

Facebook ditches fake news warning flag,"Facebook no longer displays red warning icons next to fake news stories shared on the platform, as it says the approach has not worked as hoped. In December 2016, the site started showing a ""disputed"" warning next to articles that third-party fact checking websites said were fake news. However, it said research suggested the ""red flag"" approach actually ""entrenched deeply held beliefs"". It will now display ""related articles"" next to disputed news stories. Previously, disputed articles showed a red icon ""Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs - the opposite effect to what we intended,"" Facebook'sTessa Lyons wrote,externalin a blog post. Instead of displaying a warning icon in the news feed, it will instead ""surface fact-checked articles"" and display them next to disputed stories. Facebook said it had tested the approach and found that although the new approach did not reduce the number of times disputed articles were clicked on, it did lead to them being shared fewer times. People who do try and share a disputed article are showed a pop-up with links to fact-checked sources. Fact-checked articles will be given more prominence ""Using language that is unbiased and non-judgmental helps us to build products that speak to people with diverse perspectives,""Facebook's designers,externalsaid. ""Just as before, as soon as we learn that an article has been disputed by fact-checkers, we immediately send a notification to those people who previously shared it."" Critics say social networks should face regulation if they do not tackle the spread of misinformation and propaganda. ""What Facebook is trying to do is respond to pressure that it should be treated as a publisher, rather than a platform,"" said Tim Luckhurst, professor of journalism at the University of Kent. ""I think that argument is dead. They are a publisher, so it is not enough to offer people a menu of other related stories. ""We have a generation of people that are so anti-establishment and sceptical of evidence-based news, we need regulation of the type imposed on broadcasters since they first emerged."" Prof Luckhurst said he was ""appalled"" by Facebook's argument that it was different from traditional media. ""They usually raise the objection that they cannot be regulated because they're international. Well so is the BBC, so is CNN."" Fake news - is Facebook doing enough?

Virgin Trains West Coast strike called off,"Virgin Trains says planned strikes by the RMT and TSSA unions on Virgin Trains West Coast have been called off. Strikes were due to take place on Friday and on four days in January. The company said it would try to run a full service on Friday, but warned there could be some cancellations. Virgin advised customers to check the timetable before travelling. However, the revised timetable is not due to go live on its website until the early hours of Friday morning. ""We'll do everything we can to run a full service on Friday, but because the strike has been called off at the last minute there may be some cancellations,"" said Phil Whittingham, managing director for Virgin Trains on the west coast. ""We'll be working hard to make sure our customers can make it home as quickly and easily as possible for Christmas."" The strike was over pay, with the RMT seeking a ""suitable and equal"" pay offer for train managers and on-board catering workers on the West Coast route from Glasgow to Euston to that given to drivers. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said a breakthrough had been made in talks with the company and the offer, as yet unspecified, was good enough to be put to union members. TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes said: ""I am pleased Virgin has finally seen sense, come back to the negotiating table, and made an offer sparing our passengers further disruption at...  Christmas.""

NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter,"Hospitals across England have been told to cancel non-emergency operations in the new year to prepare for a post-Christmas surge in patients. The first weeks of January are often the busiest of the year with winter illnesses peaking, combined with the growing day-to-day demand in A&E. So an emergency panel of NHS bosses is urging hospitals to cut back on their routine work, such as knee and hip ops. They hope it will give hospitals some breathing space to cope. Publicly, no figure is being put on the number of operations that should be put off, although the BBC understands hospitals are working on the basis of doing 10% fewer. That would mean in the region of 15,000 operations not taking place in the first two weeks of January. The panel has suggested hospitals use the staff freed up by the move to set up ""hot clinics"" staffed by experts in conditions such as respiratory illness to take the pressure off A&E. The directive is the first to be issued by the NHS National Emergency Pressures Panel, a new group of senior doctors, nurses and managers set up to advise NHS England.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Panel chair Prof Sir Bruce Keogh said it would be sensible for hospitals to curtail the amount of planned work they are doing until at least mid January. ""NHS staff are working flat out to cope with seasonal pressures and ensure patients receive the best possible care. ""However, given the scale of the challenge, hospitals should be planning for a surge that comes in the new year by freeing up beds and staff where they can to care for our sickest patients."" He said this would reduce the need for last-minute cancellations which were unfair on patients. It comes as figures released on Thursday showed pressures had already started building. The weekly bulletin from NHS England showed over 1,000 beds were closed because of the vomiting bug Norovirus - nearly 10% of the hospital bed-stock - while ambulances were increasingly likely to find themselves delayed when they dropped off patients at A&E. Pauline Philip, the NHS national director for emergency care, said it was a sensible move. She also urged hospitals to make the most of the extra Â£350m winter funding provided by the government, which was released into the system last week. And she added: ""There is still time for the public to play their part by ensuring they have their flu jab and by using local pharmacies and NHS 111."" Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, welcomed the move as it provided clarity over what should be done as pressures grow. But he said it was still pretty ""short notice"" for those patients who face having their operations cancelled. And he urged hospitals to prioritise cancer treatment and other planned operations that, if cancelled, would harm patients.

Catalans vote amid Spain stand-off,"One exit poll suggested separatist parties would win a majority Separatist parties are on course to retain a majority in the new Catalan parliament, early results suggest. The election pits Catalan pro-independence parties against those who want the region to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain. However, with almost all votes counted, the unionist Citizens (Cs) party had the biggest share of the vote. A BBC correspondent says there seems little prospect that the election will solve Catalonia's political crisis. Normally, the largest party has the right to try to form a government - according to the results so far, this would be the unionist party Citizens. However, the separatist parties may insist they have the right to try first, if they have the largest number of seats overall. Within the separatist party block, ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont's Together for Catalonia party was slightly ahead of the Republican left of Catalonia, led by his former deputy Oriol Junqueras. Live election coverage Spain dismissed the separatist Catalan government in October after declaring the referendum to be illegal.

His team told the BBC that he was unable to vote as he was in Brussels. Turnout was reportedly more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. By Europe reporter Gavin Lee in Barcelona No pets allowed - it's a pooches-at-the-door policy here in the central Barcelona polling station of Casinet d'Hostafrancs, and there must be one dog to every 10 voters. Early voters queued in their dozens here 20 minutes before polls opened - something I didn't see in Berlin, Paris or Amsterdam this year for elections elsewhere in Europe. It may point to a record turnout across Catalonia. Opinion polls predict up to 85% of the 5.3 million eligible voters will turn out. In the queue Ana, a student, described it as ""the most important election in the history of Catalonia"". When polls close tonight the people, given the legal right to vote this time, will have shown the direction in which they want the independence crisis to play out. Separatists who dominated the Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October, after the referendum. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots.

Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. As a result, campaigning for Thursday's snap election has led to some unusual scenes, with Mr Puigdemont addressing rallies via a videolink from Brussels. Oriol Junqueras has been sending messages to supporters from prison. In the run-up to the referendum Mr Puigdemont's JxCat party had been allied to the ERC, led by Mr Junqueras. But the ERC has opted out of a new alliance, making Mr Junqueras the main separatist rival to Mr Puigdemont.

Sofa surfers: The young hidden homeless,"Sam: ""It takes pretty much every day of my life, trying to find out where I am going to be staying"" Sam does not know where he will be sleeping tonight. Now 23, he says he first became homeless at 15 because of a family breakdown and has been in and out of bedsits, hostels and supported accommodation ever since. ""I've stayed at friends' in the past - I've never really had my own actual flat,"" he says. ""I've slept rough quite a few times but most of the time when I've slept rough I have not actually slept. ""I just wander round because I can't really shut off when I'm out in the cold."" Reality Check: Who is homeless? I sofa-surfed after being kicked out on Christmas Day This week acommittee of MPs called homelessness a ""national crisis"", highlighting more than 9,000 rough sleepers and 78,000 families in temporary accommodation in England alone. Sam drifts between friends' sofas, temporary accommodation and rough sleeping in and around Leyland in Lancashire. Young people like him  do not always show in official statistics - but new UK-wide research for the BBC found: 41% of young people have stayed with friends on floors or sofas for at least one night (excluding after nights out or due to travel difficulties) Just over 9% did so for over a month Young men are more likely to have sofa-surfed than young women - 48% of the 484 men questioned said they had compared with 34% of 519 women. At The Key drop-in centre for young homeless people in Leyland, Ian, 25, says he has been sofa-surfing for seven years. His days revolve around a few hours at the drop-in centre. Otherwise, he walks the streets for hours, trying to stay warm and then heads to a mate's house in the evening. ""I end up spending a few hours there. Then I would finally ask him if I could stay the night. If he says yes I would stay there."" He says he feels a burden on his friends. Sometimes he says he runs out of friends he feels able to ask and has to sleep out. The most common reasons for young people resorting to friends' sofas included parents being unable or unwilling to provide housing, extended family being unable to help and splitting from a partner. Tenancies ending, domestic abuse, rent arrears and leaving care also contributed. On the phone, looking for a room Ian has been offered a friend's flat for the next three weeks. Sam, who has spent time in prison, has come to the drop-in centre to make calls to try to find a room for the night. On the coldest nights, the local council will find him somewhere to stay but that ends as soon as the temperature rises above zero. ""It takes pretty much every day of my life, trying to find out where I am going to be staying. ""It doesn't feel like it ever ends. I feel quite drained with it all."" He is on medication for depression. Sam says not having an address means he can't register with a GP to get the mental health support he needs. Depression affects Ian too and both young men say it's hard to study or look for work without an address. ""I feel like I'm going round in circles and circles and circles,"" says Ian. ""All I can do is keep trying."" Ursula Patten, operations director at The Key, says sofa surfers should definitely be considered homeless. ""You are homeless if you haven't got a place you can stay on a consistent basis - somewhere that you can call home."" She says about 70% of the homeless young people on the charity's books have sofa-surfed before running out of options and seeking help. But she believes that with the right support there is no reason why homeless young people should not have hope for the future. ""It's just a phase in your life. You may have got lost but you've got strengths. Everybody's got strengths. And I would say go and get some support and somebody to help you find your direction in life because you can attain great things."" Charity support includes emergency food parcels for young homeless people The charity Centrepoint said the BBC data corroborated its ownresearch, carried out in 2014 by Cambridge University.,external Co-author Anna Clarke said: ""Sofa-surfing is a not uncommon experience for young people in housing difficulties. ""It is really useful to have this kind of evidence on something that's inherently difficult to quantify."" And Centrepoint chief executive Seyi Obakin said it was crucial to ""dispel the myth that there is anything fun or easy about sofa-surfing"". This video can not be played Five things about being homeless ""Goodwill is the only thing keeping too many young people from sleeping on the UK's streets. ""It's frightening just how many are trapped in a cycle that is detrimental to their health, sees them struggle to keep up in education, and where outstaying their welcome can mean becoming exposed to dangers no-one should have to face.""

MP's aide cleared of Westminster rape,"This video can not be played Samuel Armstrong said his life had been ""turned upside down"" by allegations A Conservative MP's chief of staff has been cleared of raping a woman after they had sex in the MP's Westminster office. Samuel Armstrong, aide to South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay, said he and the woman had consensual sex after drinking in the Houses of Parliament. He was found not guilty of two counts of rape and two of sexual assault at Southwark Crown Court. The jury returned its verdicts after five-and-a-half hours of deliberation. CCTV captured the aide, from Danbury, Essex, and the woman - a parliamentary worker - dancing in an empty Westminster Hall before they headed off with her holding his arm on the evening of 13 October 2016. Mr Armstrong said he felt like he had been ""punched in the stomach"" when he was arrested early the next morning. His barrister, Sarah Forshaw described him as ""earnest, a little geeky, awkward"" while Mr Mackinlay, who was not in Westminster that evening, told the court he and his aide were like ""father and son"". Speaking at the end of the two-week trial, Mr Armstrong said: ""My whole life has been turned upside down. ""For a year now I've not slept or eaten and I was innocent. ""Were it not for the fact that crucial evidence was disclosed to my defence team just eight working days before trial there could well have been yet another miscarriage of justice in this case."" A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""The disclosure of evidence in this case was undertaken properly and in line with our legal obligations. ""We disclosed additional material to the defence on 30 November - only a day after the police officer in charge and the CPS had first examined it."" The court was told the pair kissed as they danced to jazz music in the office, before they had consensual sex - a claim the woman denied. Mr Armstrong's barrister suggested the woman had panicked after becoming distressed as she tried to leave the Palace of Westminster at about 02:00 GMT. ""When it was over you were not upset with him at all, were you?"" Ms Forshaw asked her. She replied: ""Yes, I was completely confused and devastated in the truest sense of that word."" She admitted sending a request to Mr Armstrong to follow him on Twitter in September 2017 but said it was an accident. Mr Armstrong's defence lawyer suggested the woman became distressed as she left The woman said she had given the story to journalists 15 hours after she and Mr Armstrong had sex. She sent a message to her boyfriend: ""Keeping you in the loop. I've given it to Harry Cole who works for the Sun. It will either be in the Mail on Sunday or the Sun front page on Monday."" A later message said: ""The media already knew so this is my way of controlling it to ensure I get a sympathetic writer."" Mr Armstrong said he had lost his ""dream job"" and would ""never, ever, ever"" get his career back. He said: ""It was foolish. It was an act of enormous foolishness and as a consequence I have had the worst year of my life. ""While what I did is foolish, the point is I'm innocent of this and for whatever reason somebody is trying to make a horrible, horrible, horrible allegation."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Mackinlay told the court he was not sure whether the Mr Armstrong ""hero-worshipped"" him, but said they had a close relationship. ""Given the age difference, I became like - it was almost like father and son, I suppose."" He told jurors they would go for a beer, or out for drinks and dinner with his wife, Kati, when they were working in the MP's Kent constituency office.

Hope of new lead in mystery Alps murdersPolice are questioning a former soldier who is the main suspect in two other cases in the area.8m9 minutes agoEurope,"This video can not be played Alps Murder: 'No progress' five years on French police are looking into a possible new lead in the unsolved killing of a British man, his wife and mother-in-law in the Alps in 2012. Saad al-Hilli, Iqbal al-Hilli and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf were shot dead on holiday. Police are questioning a 34-year-old ex-soldier who is the main suspect in two other cases in the area. One relates to the disappearance of a nine-year-old girl in August, the other to the killing of a soldier. The suspect, Nordahl Lelandais, has been in custody since September as part of the investigation over the disappearance of MaÃ«lys de Araujo in the ChambÃ©ry region of south-eastern France. He has been charged with kidnapping the girl, which he has denied. ""We are going to look at all the disturbing disappearances which have taken place in this region,"" ChambÃ©ry Prosecutor Thierry Dran told reporters, without specifying which cases would be reviewed. But they reportedly include the al-Hillis, as well as cases involving Adrien Mourial, a 24-year-old Belgian citizen who went missing near Lake Annecy in July, and Jean-Christophe Morin and Ahmed Hamad, who vanished in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The bodies of Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, were found on a remote road in Chevaline, near Lake Annecy in south-eastern France, on 5 September 2012. A passing French cyclist was also killed. The couple's two young daughters survived the shooting. One, then four, was discovered hiding under her mother's body inside the family car, eight hours after the shooting. Saad al-Hilli was killed while on holiday in France The other, then seven, was found with serious head injuries after being shot and beaten. In September, the French lead prosecutor saidwork was being carried out to identify the previous owners of the gunsused in the attack, but that there were no potential suspects in the case. MaÃ«lys de Araujo was last seen on 27 August in a children's area at a hall in Pont-de-Beauvoisin, 40km (25 miles) west of ChambÃ©ry, during a wedding in which Mr Lelandais was a guest. Her parents say they did not know him, nor had they had any argument with him. MaÃ«lys attended the wedding with her parents DNA of the girl was found on the dashboardof Mr Lelandais' car. According to his lawyer, he has admitted that MaÃ«lys was in his vehicle on the night she disappeared but said that did not prove his guilt. The suspect lived with his parents 30km from ChambÃ©ry. Mr Lelandais is also under investigation for the killing of 23-year-old soldier Arthur Noyer whose skull was found by a walker on 7 September in Montmelian, 16km from ChambÃ©ry. Mr Dran said data trawls revealed that, following Mr Noyer's disappearance on 11 April, the suspect did online searches with the key words ""human body decomposition"". The suspect admitted being in the area where Mr Noyer disappeared but denied any involvement in the killing.

"Apple admits slowing down older iPhonesCustomers have long suspected iPhones slow down over time. Now, Apple has confirmed some models do.6h6 hours agoTechnologyComments","Apple has confirmed the suspicions of many iPhone owners by revealing it does deliberately slow down some models of the iPhone as they age. Many customers have long suspected that Apple slows down older iPhones to encourage people to upgrade. The company has now said it does slow down some models as they age, but only because the phones' battery performance diminishes over time. Apple said it wanted to ""prolong the life"" of customers' devices. The practice was confirmed after a customer shared performance tests on Reddit, suggesting their iPhone 6S had slowed down considerably as it had aged but had suddenly sped up again after the battery had been replaced. ""I used my brother's iPhone 6 Plus, and his was faster than mine? This is when I knew something was wrong,""wrote TeckFire,external. Technology websiteGeekbench,externalthen analysed several iPhones running different versions of the iOS operating system and found some of them did indeed appear to have been deliberately slowed down. Apple has now confirmed that it made changes to iOS to manage ageing lithium-ion batteries in some devices, since the batteries' performance diminishes over time. Apple charges Â£79 to replace iPhone batteries, and also covers the work under its AppleCare policies, but other companies also offer solutions ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, [when they] have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company said. ""Last year, we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. ""We've now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future. ""Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers."" Lithium batteries degrade over time because of what happens during the charging and discharging cycle. During both those events, lithium ions migrate through the material forming the battery. Lithium-ion batteries degrade with use Studies using electron microscopes have shown that each time the ions do this they make tiny changes to the physical structure of that electrolyte. The effect is like ""rust creeping unevenly across steel"", according to one scientist who has studied the phenomenon. The changes effectively erode the material so it can hold less of a charge and can hamper its ability to provide a steady power supply. Higher voltages make the erosion happen more quickly, as do higher temperatures. ""By choosing to implement this quietly, it appears more nefarious than it really is. That doesn't engender trust,"" wrote developer and bloggerNick Heer,external. ""Apple has long been very good about managing expectationsâ¦ this is an instance where they blew it. Needlessly, I think."" Replacing an old battery in one of the affected models should return the phone to its former speed.  Doing so costs Â£79 in the UK and $79 (Â£59) in the US. ""They should be more transparent about it,"" said Chris Green from the tech consultancy Bright Bee. ""You're taking away performance that somebody has paid for. If you're going to slow down the phone over time, you should explain why it is happening, so people understand it is ultimately for their benefit. ""But I do see where they're coming from. By slowing the phone, it does help mitigate the problem of the diminishing battery."" Prince Harry and Meghan Markle engagement photos released Jerusalem: UN resolution rejects Trump's declaration The heir whose killings stunned Canada It is a combination of urban myth and conspiracy theory - the idea that Apple builds planned obsolescence into the iPhone, slowing down older models to make you splash out on an upgrade. Now it turns out to be true - the slowing down part, if not the motive behind it. Apple's explanation that it is all about managing the performance of ageing batteries seems quite reasonable. After all, the fact that the lithium-ion batteries that power mobile phones degrade over time is well known and owners of other leading smartphones also complain of poor battery life after a few years. But what will frustrate and anger many iPhone users is Apple's lack of transparency. The software tweak at the heart of this story happened last year and rumours about the deliberate downgrading of performance have been bubbling for weeks. But it was only a couple of days after a software developer showed exactly what was happening that Apple finally came out and explained. Here is a company that is - as any journalist can attest - fanatical about controlling the message about its products.  It has also benefitted from the devotion over the years of customers who are more like fans. But maybe it is time for Apple to show a bit more honesty in that relationship.

Toys R Us agrees rescue plan with creditors,"Toys R Us has staved off collapse after creditors backed a rescue plan for the UK retailer. It follows last-minute negotiations with the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) to secure a Â£9.8m injection into the company's pension fund. However, the rescue plan entails closing 26 of its 105 UK outlets, putting 800 jobs at risk, although no stores will close until spring 2018. Toys R Us employs 3,200 staff in total in the UK. The retailer's creditors met on Thursday to vote on the rescue plan, which hinged on a resolution of the pension deficit. Toys R Us's UK staff pension scheme has a deficit of more than Â£25m. The PPF said the new offer from the company was composed of a payment of Â£3.8m in 2018, with a further Â£6m promised over 2019 and 2020. The vote saw 98% of Toys R Us creditors backing the arrangement. Why did Toys R Us fall from grace? Toy sellers bet on Christmas as sales dip Toys R Us will continue to trade under its company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which is a step short of going into administration. Steve Knights, managing director of Toys R Us UK, said: ""The vote in favour of the CVA represents strong support for our business plan and provides us with the platform we need to transform our business so that we can better serve our customers today and long into the future. ""All of our stores across the UK will remain open for business as normal until spring 2018. Customers can continue to shop online and there will be no changes to our returns policies or gift cards across this period."" The toy retailer started in the US in the 1950s It reached the UK in 1985, as a subsidiary of the US chain, when it opened five stores It launched its UK website in 1996 The retailer now has 105 stores around the UK Its flagship stores are at London's Brent Cross shopping centre and in Bristol The company sells largely from warehouse-style stores at the edge of towns, but says these are now ""too big and expensive to run"". It is also finding it hard to compete against online toy retailers. The chain said that, as part of the CVA proposal, a number of these stores had been identified for closure. It said talks with employees would start in the New Year. Toy's R Us's parent company in the USis in formal bankruptcy protection proceedings.Recent reports suggest it is considering closing between 100 and 200 stores in America.

NHS makes 380 birth blunders a day,"This video can not be played Ryan and Wendy Agius's daughter, Talulah, was stillborn Tens of thousands of mothers and babies in England were harmed by potential lapses in maternity care in the past two years, the BBC has learned. More than 276,000 incidents were logged by worried hospital staff between April 2015 and March 2017 - the equivalent of one mistake for every five births. Most were minor or near misses, but almost a quarter of the incidents led to the mother or baby being harmed - and in 288 cases there was a death. Ministers said safety must be improved. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC the figures were ""shocking"" and improving the way mothers and babies were cared for was a ""top priority"". ""Mistakes in maternity care can lead to heart-breaking tragedies for mothers and babies."" But he said it was encouraging hospitals were being honest as that would help prevent repeat problems. However, childbirth charity NCT said the figures suggested maternity care was ""in crisis"". The incidents have been flagged up under a voluntary reporting scheme run by the regulator NHS Improvement that staff are encouraged to take part in if they have concerns about care. The potential lapses logged include everything from short delays getting medication or records not being completed properly to babies being deprived of oxygen and life-threatening complications not being diagnosed. We must do better on baby deaths - Hunt The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' Wendy Agius was sent home three times by maternity staff - by the time of her fourth visit the baby had died Wendy Agius was already past her due date in June 2014 when she became concerned that her baby was not moving. Over the next two days Wendy, 33, and her husband Ryan, 37, made repeated calls to the local maternity unit - a midwifery-led unit in Eastbourne - as well as making three visits. Each time they were told everything was fine - even after Wendy collapsed at one point. When they returned a fourth time, no heart beat could be found. Their daughter, Talulah, had died. ""It was devastating,"" said Wendy. ""They just kept sending us home. We were treated like an inconvenience."" It later emerged on one visit their baby's heart rate had been incorrectly recorded and their symptoms should have led to them being invited in more quickly and seen by a consultant at an earlier point. But established guidelines were not followed. Since then, the couple have not been able to get pregnant again. Ryan said: ""It was the worst thing imaginable. We can't move forward. It is always there every day."" East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs the maternity service, said it had apologised for the failings. An internal review concluded it was not possible to ascertain whether the mistakes had led to Talulah being stillborn. Of the 63,380 cases of harm, nearly 55,000 involved injuries or conditions that required no more than basic first aid, such as treating a mother who had slipped in the shower. But there were 8,134 cases of more significant harm, including 479 which caused severe harm, such as permanent disability, and 288 deaths. Records seen by the BBC show a range of problems, including: delays dealing with women who had suffered haemorrhages and other complications babies left brain damaged after being deprived of oxygen during birth babies not screened for infections, leaving them at risk of meningitis, blood poisoning and pneumonia heart rates incorrectly measured or recorded delays in emergency Caesareans, causing distress to the baby midwives requesting help from consultants too late or not at all women being told to stay at home or sent away from maternity units despite reporting potentially serious problems Overall, a third of the incidents related to mistakes with treatments or procedures, while one in five was a result of problems with the admission, transfer or discharge of mothers and babies. The figures also highlight how some hospitals have seen more cases than others, although NHS Improvement points out that being a high reporter of incidents may just be because a hospital is more transparent about its care. Nonetheless, in a number of the cases there are serious concerns about services. Seven babies and two mothers died at the Royal Oldham and North Manchester General hospitals, both of which are run by the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS trust. The trust said it now had new leadership, staff had been provided with extra training and more midwives recruited, and since the changes had been made there had been no more deaths. Meanwhile, five mothers and four babies died under the care of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust between 2015 and 2017. The trust said it could not provide details of what had happened because of patient confidentiality. An inquest into the death of another baby - in 2014  - highlighted major problems at the trust. The baby, Rafe Angelo, died from oxygen starvation. His mother had been transferred from a local birthing centre to Queen Alexandra Hospital, which is run by the trust, after complications developed. But there were a series of delays in her getting treatment, including an ambulance crew's detour for a toilet break and no doctors or midwives to meet the ambulance on arrival. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust also saw 11 cases of severe harm during the period. And hospital bosses had to apologise to a couple after their baby died in 2015. There had been delays in the mother undergoing an emergency Caesarean, while the heart rate had not been properly recorded. The trust admitted the baby could have survived if mistakes had not been made. Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Trust reported the most incidents, more than 5,000. The trust runs St Mary's Hospital in the city, which reported nine deaths, two were mothers and seven babies. The trust said lessons had been learned from the incidents. The government has set a target for halving the overall rate of stillbirths, deaths and baby brain injuries by 2025. To help ensure lessons are learned, the Healthcare Safety Investigations Branch, set up earlier this year, will start looking at all cases of unexplained serious harm and death from next year. The reports made to NHS Improvement - highlighted by the BBC - will feed into that system. The idea of both systems is to ensure the NHS creates a learning culture so similar mistakes can be prevented. But unions have said staffing is also an issue. The Royal College of Midwives believes the NHS in England is 3,500 midwives short of what it needs. Staffing has also been highlighted by the Care Quality Commission, which inspects hospitals. In its review of services earlier this year, it warned staffing and the ability to provide one-to-one care during labour was a concern. Half of maternity units are currently judged to be not safe enough. Maternity is also the biggest cause of clinical negligence payouts, accounting for half of the cost of all claims. Last year, Â£1.9bn of claims were made - a rise of 91% since 2004-05. Abigail Wood, head of campaigns at childbirth charity NCT, said: ""Maternity care is in crisis, staffing levels are dangerously low and midwives are being stretched to the limit.""

UK plans new defence treaty with Poland,"Theresa May was in Poland to sign a defence treaty with the country Theresa May has sought to reassure Polish people living in the UK that they are still welcome after Brexit. Speaking on a trip to Warsaw to sign a new defence treaty with the country, the PM said the one million Polish residents were a ""strong part of [UK] society"". She promised a ""simple"" and ""easy"" process to get ""settled status"" to remain after the UK leaves the EU. The trip comes afterMrs May sacked one of her closest allies, Damian Green. She asked him to leave after he made ""misleading"" statements about claims pornography was found on his parliamentary computer. Senior members of the cabinet, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, have joined her on the visit. How will Poland behave towards the UK in negotiations? UK seeks defence partnership with EU The prime minister told the bilateral summit in the Polish capital it was a ""key priority"" for her visit to ""give assurance"" to Polish nationals living in the UK that ""we want them to stay"". ""That's why we worked so hard to get a deal with the EU earlier this month, to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK,"" she added. Mrs May said there would be certain requirements, such as the length of time a person has been in the UK, to achieve ""settled status"", but residents will be given a ""significant period"" to apply. She added: ""We value Polish citizens and other EU citizens in the UK. They have made a life choice, we want them to be able to continue with that life choice."" The PM recently wrote to the 980,000 Polesin the UK urging them to stay in the country after Brexit, reassuring them that the process of applying for settled status will be quick and inexpensive. The two leaders signed the defence treaty before giving speeches, saying it was a ""powerful symbol"" of co-operation. Downing Street said it was only the second such agreement the UK has with a European ally, after France. It provides a framework for enhanced co-operation in training, information sharing, defence procurement and joint exercises between the Nato partners. The UK has also backed an initiative to blunt Russian propaganda in the region. ""Poland matters greatly to the UK,"" Mrs May said. ""I am determined that Brexit will not weaken our relationship with Poland. Rather, it will serve as a catalyst to strengthen it."" Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? All you need to know about Brexit Mrs May has also announced that the UK is to provide Â£5m of funding to a joint UK-Polish plan to counter Russian misinformation in the region. Part of the money will go towards supporting Belsat, a Polish-funded TV channel broadcasting in Belarus, one of Russia's closest allies in the region. Last month, Mrs May said Moscow was seeking to ""sow discord"" in the West by meddling in elections and mounting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure. Theresa May with Poland's former Prime Minister Beata Szydlo, who was replaced by Mateusz Morawiecki earlier this month Her visit comes hours afterthe EU announced disciplinary measures against Poland, accusing the country of undermining the independence of its judges. Downing Street said Mrs May would raise her concerns with new Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, but she told a press conference constitutional issues were ""primarily a matter for the country concerned, not the EU"".

Philippines ferry carrying 251 capsizes,"This video can not be played Video footage shows passengers being brought ashore in Quezon A ferry carrying 251 people has capsized in stormy seas off the east coast of the Philippines. Local fisherman and rescue boats saved more than 200 of those on board - but at least four people died and seven are missing, the coastguard says. Passengers say large waves and strong winds meant the vessel started taking in water near the island of Polillo - and quickly sank. Rescuers said they were hampered by heavy rain and big waves. The ferry was carrying 251 people when the accident occurred Coastguard spokesman Armand Balilo said the ferry had capacity for 280 people and had not been overloaded. ""We believe the weather was a big factor [in the accident],"" he added. Boat accidents are relatively common in the Philippines, which frequently experiences storms. Tropical Storm Tembin is forecast to hit land early on Friday and people travelling home for Christmas had been warned to do so earlier than usual.

Profile: Damian Green,"Damian Green has been a confidant of the prime minister for many years Damian Green was one of the prime minister's closest allies in government. A university friend, he entered Parliament at the same time as Theresa May. But now he has been sacked from the cabinetafter an investigation found he breached the ministerial code. Mr Green was a leading Conservative figure for 20 years and had been a friend of the prime minister since they were at Oxford university together in the 1970s. They entered Parliament together in 1997. Later, he served in the Home Office during the coalition government. After she became Tory leader in June 2016, Mrs May brought the 61-year old into her cabinet and a year later named him as her effective deputy by giving him the title of first secretary of state. Since then, the former journalist, who campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum, has been a vital cog in a government beset by divisions and infighting over Brexit. Kuenssberg: He was one of the few who understood May Damian Green resignation letter in full He has played a substantial role behind the scenes chairing key cabinet committees and, more publicly, deputised for Mrs May at Prime Minister's Questions as recently as last week. He spent much of his early political career in the backroom, but the MP for Ashford in Kent has twice hit the headlines in a big way over the past decade. His political future has been in question since journalist and Conservative activist Kate Maltby suggested,in an article in November for the Times,external, he had behaved inappropriately towards her. The 31-year old claimed the minister ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015 and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message which left her feeling ""awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised"". Damian Green resigns from cabinet 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer Minister denies computer porn allegations Mr Green, who is an acquaintance of the journalist's parents, said the claims were ""hurtful"" and ""completely false"". But they were referred to the Cabinet Office for investigation by a top civil servant amid a swirl of allegations about harassment and other misconduct at Westminster. In his resignation letter, Mr Green apologised to Ms Maltby for making her feel ""uncomfortable"". The civil servant's inquiry also considered claims that legal pornography was found on a computer removed from Mr Green's office in the House of Commons in 2008. Damian Green and his wife, Alicia Collinson, have two daughters Date of birth:17 January 1956, aged 61 Job:First secretary of state since June this year. MP for Ashford in Kent since 1997 Education:Reading School in Berkshire, followed by Balliol College, Oxford University Family:Married to barrister Alicia Collinson. The couple have two grown-up daughters Mr Green, shadow immigration minister at the time, was arrested in November 2008 and was held for nine hours as part of a Scotland Yard inquiry into a Home Office leak. The arrest was described as disproportionate and flawed by two inquiries in 2009 and no charges were brought against him. Mr Green, who is married to barrister Alicia Collinson and has two grown-up daughters, has always strenuously denied that he either viewed or downloaded any pornographic material on his Commons computer. But, in his resignation letter, he said he should have been clear that police lawyers talked to his lawyers in 2008 about the pornography, and the police raised the matter again in a phone call in 2013. Although it took Mr Green a comparatively long while to make it to the cabinet table, he is no stranger to being close to the centre of power - giving up a successful career in newspapers and broadcasting to work as an official in John Major's Downing Street in the early 1990s. The Welsh-born politician was on the Tories' pro-European wing, having refused to rule out the UK one day joining the euro, long after many of his colleagues had done so. But unlike EU diehards such as Ken Clarke and Lord Heseltine, who also campaigned on the remain side in the 2016 referendum, he has been on something of a journey and has taken a more pragmatic approach to Brexit.

Warning shots as N Korean soldier defects,"The DMZ is one of the world's most heavily guarded strips of land South Korea's military has fired warning shots at North Korean guards searching for a soldier who defected. The North Korean soldier had walked across the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) shortly after 08:00 (23:00 GMT Wednesday). He had emerged from thick fog at a checkpoint, said the South's military. He is the fourth North Korean soldier to defect this year. The incident comes weeks after one of the most dramatic defections in recent times. In that incident, on 13 November,a soldier was shot as he fled across to the southern sideof the Joint Security Area (JSA) in the village of Panmunjom. N Korea defector has 'enormous parasites' North Korean defector: What we've learned from dramatic footage Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea Thursday's incident took place at a checkpoint in the mid-western frontline, said Roh Jae-cheon, spokesman for South Korea's joint chiefs of staff. Heavy fog had descended on the area, limiting visibility to about 100m (110 yards), he told reporters. But as the North Korean soldier approached the post, his movements were picked up on surveillance equipment. Mr Roh added that the defector was taken into custody and was ""safely secured"". Authorities are now investigating what drove him to make the crossing. The soldier, thought to be 19 years old, was carrying an AK-47 rifle, reported The Korea Herald citing the military. No gunfire was exchanged at the time. But shortly after his crossing, a group of border guards from the North approached the border, appearing to search for their comrade, according to South Korea's defence ministry. South Korean soldiers fired about 20 warning shots. Officials said the sound of gunshots coming from the North was heard about 40 minutes later, although no bullets were found to have crossed the border. Heavy fog had descended on the checkpoint, said South Korea's military Very few North Korean defectors risk crossing to the South via the DMZ. One of the world's most heavily guarded strips of land, the DMZ is a thin buffer zone between the two Koreas and is fortified on both sides with barbed wire, surveillance cameras, electric fencing and landmines. How to dodge mines and snipers on the Korean border Last month's defection saw a soldier drive a jeep right up to the border, in a dramatic escape captured on surveillance cameras. He ran across to the South in a hail of bullets from North Korean guards. Shot five times, the soldier collapsed in a pile of leaves on the South's side, and was later rescued by South Korean soldiers. This video can not be played A rare instance of a defector fleeing through the demilitarised zone was captured on CCTV in 2017 His recovery was closely tracked by South Korean media. He was released from intensive care and is reported to have written a thank you note to the doctors who treated him. Two other North Korean soldiers defected, also via the DMZ, in June this year in separate incidents. Only one soldier defected last year. The total number of North Koreans who directly defected to the South has also risen to 15 this year, compared to five last year, according to official figures reported by Yonhap news agency. Hundreds more defect through China, before making their way to the South. In a separate announcement on Thursday, South Korea's unification ministry said two defecting North Koreans had been found on a fishing boat in the South's waters.

Australian submarine found after 103 years,"There have been 13 missions to find the submarine The wreck of Australia's first naval submarine has been found after a 103-year search. The HMAS AE-1 was the first Allied submarine lost in World War One, vanishing off Rabaul, Papua New Guinea with 35 Australian and British crewmates onboard on 14 September 1914. The 13th search mission for the vessel found it in waters off the Duke of York islands in Papua New Guinea. The discovery solves Australia's oldest naval mystery, the government said. Searchers used an underwater drone to find the wreck ""This is one of the most significant discoveries in Australia's naval maritime history,"" Defence Minister Marise Payne said on Thursday. ""It was the first loss for the Royal Australian Navy and the first Allied submarine loss in World War One; a significant tragedy felt by our nation and our allies."" The search team used an underwater drone floating 40m (131ft) above the sea bed to scour the area. The wreck was found in more than 300m of water. She said the search team had conducted a brief commemorative service for those who had lost their lives onboard. The government will try to contact the descendents of the crew, and also work with PNG authorities on commemorations for the site. ""I truly believe this will bring peace of mind to the family and descendants of the crew who lost their lives onboard and perhaps, in time, we may discover what caused the submarine to sink,"" Ms Payne said. The exact location has not been revealed in order to protect the submarine, but it appears to have survived in one piece. There are no plans to return AE1 to Australia, but work will now begin on trying to establish why it sank. Twelve search missions over the last century had failed to find its resting place.

Catalans vote in bid to end stand-off,"One exit poll suggested separatist parties would win a majority Separatist parties are on course to retain a majority in the new Catalan parliament, early results suggest. The election pits Catalan pro-independence parties against those who want the region to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain. However, with almost all votes counted, the unionist Citizens (Cs) party had the biggest share of the vote. A BBC correspondent says there seems little prospect that the election will solve Catalonia's political crisis. Normally, the largest party has the right to try to form a government - according to the results so far, this would be the unionist party Citizens. However, the separatist parties may insist they have the right to try first, if they have the largest number of seats overall. Within the separatist party block, ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont's Together for Catalonia party was slightly ahead of the Republican left of Catalonia, led by his former deputy Oriol Junqueras. Live election coverage Spain dismissed the separatist Catalan government in October after declaring the referendum to be illegal.

Catalonia crisis in 300 words Catalonia snap election: What you need to know But he said ""this is not a normal day"" and ""neither is it a day of normal democracy"". His team told the BBC that he was unable to vote as he was in Brussels. Turnout was reportedly more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. By Europe reporter Gavin Lee in Barcelona No pets allowed - it's a pooches-at-the-door policy here in the central Barcelona polling station of Casinet d'Hostafrancs, and there must be one dog to every 10 voters. Early voters queued in their dozens here 20 minutes before polls opened - something I didn't see in Berlin, Paris or Amsterdam this year for elections elsewhere in Europe. It may point to a record turnout across Catalonia. Opinion polls predict up to 85% of the 5.3 million eligible voters will turn out. In the queue Ana, a student, described it as ""the most important election in the history of Catalonia"". When polls close tonight the people, given the legal right to vote this time, will have shown the direction in which they want the independence crisis to play out. Separatists who dominated the Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October, after the referendum. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots. This video can not be played A look at the key players in Catalonia's regional election The move led to violent clashes with hundreds of people reported injured. Footage showing police tackling people at polling stations and pulling a woman by her hair caused outrage. Could Catalonia make a success of independence?

Mr Puigdemont decided it was enough to declare independence from Spain. This video can not be played Police were filmed violently tackling voters Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then sacked the Catalan government, imposed direct rule and called the 21 December election. Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. As a result, campaigning for Thursday's snap election has led to some unusual scenes, with Mr Puigdemont addressing rallies via a videolink from Brussels. Oriol Junqueras has been sending messages to supporters from prison. In the run-up to the referendum Mr Puigdemont's JxCat party had been allied to the ERC, led by Mr Junqueras. But the ERC has opted out of a new alliance, making Mr Junqueras the main separatist rival to Mr Puigdemont.

Damian Green sacked after porn allegations,"Damian Green, one of Theresa May's closest allies, has been sacked from the cabinet after an inquiry found he had breached the ministerial code. He was ""asked to quit"" after he was found to have made ""inaccurate and misleading"" statements over what he knew about claims pornography was found on his office computer in 2008. He also apologised for making writer Kate Maltby feel uncomfortable in 2015. Laura Kuenssberg said the PM ""had little choice but to ask him to go"". The BBC's political editor said the departure of a close friend left Mrs May a ""lonelier figure"". Mr Green, 61, who as first secretary of state was effectively the PM's deputy, is the third cabinet minister to resign in the space of two months - Sir Michael Fallon and Priti Patel both quit in November. This video can not be played Theresa May ""will miss his advice, will miss his support"" - Laura Kuenssberg on Damian Green sacking In her written response, Mrs May expressed ""deep regret"" at Mr Green's departure but said his actions ""fell short"" of the conduct expected of a cabinet minister. Like Mrs May, Mr Green campaigned for Remain in last year's EU referendum and had been a leading voice in Cabinet for a ""softer"" Brexit. He had been under investigation regarding allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards journalist and Tory activist Ms Maltby. He denied suggestions that he made unwanted advances towards her in 2015. He also denied that he had either downloaded or viewed pornography on a computer removed from his Commons office in 2008 andsaid police had ""never suggested to me that improper material was found"".,external In his resignation letter, Mr Green said statements he made about what he knew about the pornography could have been ""clearer"", conceding that his lawyers had been informed by Met Police lawyers about their initial discovery in 2008 and the police had also raised the matter with him in a phone call in 2013. ""I apologise that my statements were misleading on this point,"" he said. Laura Kuenssberg: Theresa May loses one of the few who understood her Profile: Who is Damian Green? May: I asked you to resign Damian Green: Timeline of his downfall Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Green had ""lied"" about ""a particular incident"" and that was why he had to go but it was a ""sad moment"". Asked if his departure left Theresa May more isolated, he said ""leadership is lonely"" but she had shown ""extraordinary resilience in very challenging circumstances"" and was someone ""who is capable of taking very difficult decisions"". This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC An official report by the Cabinet Office found that public statements he made relating to what he knew about the claims were ""inaccurate and misleading"" and constituted a breach of the ministerial code. The report also found that although there were ""competing and contradictory accounts of what were private meetings"" between himself and Ms Maltby, the investigation found her account ""to be plausible"". Her parents, Colin and Victoria Maltby, said in a statement they were not surprised to find that the inquiry found Mr Green to have been ""untruthful as a minister, nor that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness"". They praised their 31-year-old daughter for her courage in speaking out about the ""abuse of authority"". Ms Maltby is not commenting on Mr Green's resignation until she receives more details from the Cabinet Office. Damian Green was a confidant of the prime minister for many years Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Damian Green has never been a politician with a huge public persona, or even a hugely well-known character. But he was an extremely important ally of Theresa May. Not just a political friend but a genuine one, close to her for decades. The government, so the joke in Westminster goes, has become ""weak and stable"", with number 10 taking back some control of the agenda in recent weeks. So it is not likely that Mr Green's exit will suddenly unleash another bout of turmoil. But the prime minister clearly took this decision very seriously. She is a politician who guards her views, her own persona very closely. To lose one of the few who understood her, who she trusts, leaves her a lonelier figure. Read Laura's full blog In her reply, the PM said while the report had found his conduct to have been ""professional and proper"" in general, it was right that he had apologised for making Ms Maltby ""feel uncomfortable"". Addressing breaches of the ministerial code, she added: ""While I can understand the considerable distress caused to you by some of the allegations made in the past few weeks, I know that you share my commitment to maintaining the high standards that the public demands of ministers of the crown. ""It is therefore with deep regret that I asked you to resign from the government and have accepted your resignation."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Green's political future has been in question since Ms Maltby claimed in an article in the Times that the minister ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015 and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message which left her feeling ""awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised"". Mr Green, an acquaintance of the journalist's parents, said the claims were ""hurtful"" and ""completely false"". Kate Maltby's account was found to be plausible, the report says But they were referred for investigation by top civil servant Sue Gray - who is examining other claims that emerged during a swirl of allegations about harassment and other misconduct at Westminster. The inquiry was subsequently expanded to consider claims that legal pornography was found on a computer removed from Mr Green's office in the House of Commons in 2008. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today Damian Green clearly breached ministerial code but calls sacking a ""sad moment"" It was one of a number of possessions seized by the police during a controversial inquiry into the leaking of official documents by a civil servant to Mr Green, at the time a shadow Home Office minister under David Cameron. Mrs May, who has known Mr Green since they were contemporaries at Oxford, brought him into the cabinet after she became PM in 2016 and promoted him to first secretary of state in July. Since then, he has played a substantial role behind the scenes chairing key cabinet committees and has also deputised for Mrs May at Prime Minister's Questions. It is not clear who will replace him in those roles but unconfirmed reports have suggested there will be no announcement until the New Year, with Parliament due to go on recess on Thursday.

Born in the wrong place for good schools?,"The report warns that regional gaps in good schools have grown wider in recent years There is a widening geographical divide in access to high-performing schools in England, says a report from the Education Policy Institute. Between 2010 and 2015, London took an increasing share of the secondary schools where pupils were most likely to make good progress. But the report says areas in the North and North East were being left behind. A Department for Education spokeswoman said social mobility plans would help chances to be spread more evenly. The report picks up on concerns about social mobility now being increasingly affected by where families live - with disadvantaged youngsters in London having a much better chance of going to good schools than similarly deprived pupils in other parts of the country. David Laws, the think tank's chairman and a former education minister, said the widening inequality was ""shocking"". In this study, ""high-performing"" schools are not those with the best exam results or rated as outstanding or good but those that are in the top third for how much progress pupils have made since starting secondary school. The report says that a number of London boroughs are stretching further ahead in the density of such schools. Harrow, Hillingdon, Brent, Ealing and Camden are among those with the greatest increases in such schools with a high level of value added. Among the 20 top authorities by this measure, 16 are in London. The authorities with a decreasing number of such high-performing schools are clustered in the North and Midlands, including Blackburn, Derby, Wirral, Warrington and Dudley. Young people in Blackpool and Hartlepool are named as having the least access to local secondary schools where pupil progress is in the top third by national standards. The analysis shows how levels of deprivation are not necessarily linked to the availability of high-performing schools. Haringey has 29% of pupils eligible for free school meals, but has among the country's highest densities of successful schools, in terms of value added. This measure of disadvantage is higher than any of the bottom 10 authorities with the least availability of good value-added schools. ""It is shocking to see that over recent years the access to high-quality secondary school places in England has become even more unequal,"" said Mr Laws. ""In one-fifth of local areas, children cannot access quality secondary school places. government rhetoric about spreading opportunity is not being matched by experience in areas such as the North, North East and parts of the Midlands."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""The answer of course is pretty simple."" He said schools needed better funding, to be able to recruit high-quality teachers and to have a longer-term approach to keeping the best teachers and head teachers. A Department for Education spokeswoman said that a new plan to promote social mobility was designed ""to make sure opportunities are spread evenly across the country"". ""That's why we are targeting the areas that need the most support through the Â£72m opportunity areas programme, and by investing Â£280m over the next two years to target resources at the schools most in need to improve their performance and deliver more good school places.""

Damian Green: Timeline of his downfall,"Damian Green, one of Theresa May's closest allies, has been sacked from the cabinet following claims that pornography was found on his office computer. Here is a timeline of how Home Office leaks in 2008 sparked an investigation which would lead to his downfall. 8 October 2008:The Cabinet Office calls the Metropolitan Police to investigate after a series of leaked official documents from the Home Office are published in national newspapers. The leaks, about illegal immigration and other issues, embarrass the Labour government. Damian Green is the Conservatives' immigration spokesman at the time. 19 November 2008:Junior Home Office official Christopher Galley is arrested in connection with the leaked documents. No charges were brought against him, although he was later sacked. 27 November 2008: Mr Green is arrested and held by the Metropolitan Police for nine hours on suspicion of ""conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office, and aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring misconduct in a public office"". His home and his offices in Kent and parliament are searched. He is released on bail. 28 November 2008: Conservative leader David Cameron criticises the ""heavy-handed tactics"" employed by Scotland Yard. 2 December 2008:Scotland Yard announces an urgent review of its handling of the leaks probe. Profile: Damian Green Theresa May loses one of the few who understood her 8 April 2009:The officer in charge of the inquiry into the leaks, Bob Quick, is forced to resign over an alleged security breach.

Kate Maltby says Damian Green made inappropriate advances towards her 31 October 2017:Theresa May asks Whitehall's top civil servant to investigate allegations that Mr Green, now First Secretary of State, made inappropriate advances towards journalist and activist Kate Maltby in 2015 - which he denies. 1 November 2017:Ms Maltby writes in the Times that Damian Green ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message. The 31-year-old writer and academic says the encounters left her feeling ""awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised"". Mr Green says he had known Ms Maltby since 2014 and the pair ""had a drink as friends twice-yearly"". He said the text he had sent to her was meant to be friendly and ""this untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful."" He denies touching her knee in 2015. 4 November 2017:Bob Quick tells the Sunday Times pornography was found on one of Mr Green's parliamentary computers during the 2008 inquiry into the home office leaks.

Funeral held for K-pop star Jonghyun,"This video can not be played Fans mourn K-pop star Jonghyun K-pop's biggest stars have led the procession for the funeral of singer Jonghyun who took his own life this week aged 27. Jonghyun, whose real name was Kim Jong-hyun, was the lead singer of one of the biggest K-pop groups, SHINee. His bandmates and others from the pop group Super Junior carried his coffin, dressed in all black. His death has sparked waves of grief among fans with thousands visiting the hospital where his body was held. A note believed to have been sent by him to a friend spoke of his struggles with depression and fame. It said he was ""broken from the inside"" and that ""the life of fame was never meant for me"". ""What else can I say more. Just tell me I've done well. That this is enough. That I've worked hard. Even if you can't smile don't fault me on my way."" Dead K-pop star 'consumed by depression' Jonghyun fans in 'pearl aqua Moon' tribute The dark side of Asiaâs pop music industry The procession on Thursday left the Asan Medican Centre in Seoul with one of Jonghyun's band mates and his sister at the front.

Conceived in South Korea in the 1990s as a Western-Asian hybrid, K-pop is now a multi-million dollar industry. It is at the forefront of the so-called Korean Wave - the spread of Korean music, drama and film across Asia and worldwide. SHINee were founded in 2008 as a five member group under SM Entertainment, and quickly rose to become of the biggest K-pop boy groups. Over the past years, SHINee recorded several albums in Japanese and in 2017 sold out the 55,000-seat Tokyo Dome and part of their Japan tour. Earlier this year, they also played their first North American tour. Depression is more than just feeling a bit down for a few days. It is an illness which, at its most severe, can leave people feeling that life is no longer worth living. It can cause physical symptoms such as headaches, sleeplessness and constant tiredness which may last for months and months. People with depression can also feel anxious, irritable and agitated on a daily basis but it affects everyone differently and only in rare cases is it a reason for violence against others. If people admit their symptoms and talk to someone about their feelings, depression can usually be treated but the biggest barrier to getting help is often stigma and the fear of disclosing mental health problems.

Protected status for Richard III burial site,"The car park was situated on top of the former church of the Greyfriars, a 13th-Century monastic friary King Richard III's burial site, which was famously found beneath a council car park, has been given protected status. The last Plantagenet king's remains were discovered in 2012 after a team of enthusiasts and historians pinpointed the location in Leicester. It has been dubbed ""one of the most significant in our national history"". Richard III, who was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, wasreburied at Leicester Cathedral. He was originally interred at the church of the Greyfriars, a 13th-Century monastic friary. The church appears to have been demolished during the reign of Henry VIII. However, because much of the area was not built upon during the intervening centuries, it is believed Greyfriars remains relatively ""well-preserved"" underground. Making the friary into a scheduled monument means special consent is required before any work or changes can be made. The car park was excavated in 2012 Perhaps unsurprisingly, as soon as the authorities appreciated the significance of the site, its days as a car park were numbered. Once the identity of the remains was confirmed, plans for a visitor centre were approved andit opened just over a year later. The centre, housed in a former school, was extended to cover the actual location of the grave. A window in the floor allows visitors to see below their feet to the spot where the king was found. Council workers have - obviously - had to find alternative spots for their vehicles, andcar park attendant Mike Mistry has since been made redundant. Despite having one of the shortest reigns of any British monarch, Richard is arguably the most notorious of them all. Often portrayed on stage and screen as a hunchbacked, bloodthirsty murderer (mainly thanks to Shakespeare), by many accounts he died a brave and valiant death. He also introduced the concept of bail, and passed tax reforms which survive to the modern day. Who was the real Richard III? How the king's remains were found The bloody last moments of a king Richard III's remains were found under a car park in Leicester Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, the body that advised the government, said: ""The site of Greyfriars where Richard III was hastily buried in the days following his death in the final battle of the War of the Roses is one of the most significant in our national history. ""The archaeological remains on the site are now well understood and fully deserve protection as a scheduled monument."" Heritage Minister, John Glen, said the government was ensuring the remains of the once lost medieval friary are ""preserved for future generations."" The protected area will be managed in partnership with Leicester City Council.

Apple admits slowing down older iPhones,"Apple has confirmed the suspicions of many iPhone owners by revealing it does deliberately slow down some models of the iPhone as they age. Many customers have long suspected that Apple slows down older iPhones to encourage people to upgrade. The company has now said it does slow down some models as they age, but only because the phones' battery performance diminishes over time. Apple said it wanted to ""prolong the life"" of customers' devices. The practice was confirmed after a customer shared performance tests on Reddit, suggesting their iPhone 6S had slowed down considerably as it had aged but had suddenly sped up again after the battery had been replaced. ""I used my brother's iPhone 6 Plus, and his was faster than mine? This is when I knew something was wrong,""wrote TeckFire,external. Technology websiteGeekbench,externalthen analysed several iPhones running different versions of the iOS operating system and found some of them did indeed appear to have been deliberately slowed down. Apple has now confirmed that it made changes to iOS to manage ageing lithium-ion batteries in some devices, since the batteries' performance diminishes over time. Apple charges Â£79 to replace iPhone batteries, and also covers the work under its AppleCare policies, but other companies also offer solutions ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, [when they] have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company said. ""Last year, we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. ""We've now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future. ""Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers."" Lithium batteries degrade over time because of what happens during the charging and discharging cycle. During both those events, lithium ions migrate through the material forming the battery. Lithium-ion batteries degrade with use Studies using electron microscopes have shown that each time the ions do this they make tiny changes to the physical structure of that electrolyte. The effect is like ""rust creeping unevenly across steel"", according to one scientist who has studied the phenomenon. The changes effectively erode the material so it can hold less of a charge and can hamper its ability to provide a steady power supply. Higher voltages make the erosion happen more quickly, as do higher temperatures. ""By choosing to implement this quietly, it appears more nefarious than it really is. That doesn't engender trust,"" wrote developer and bloggerNick Heer,external. ""Apple has long been very good about managing expectationsâ¦ this is an instance where they blew it. Needlessly, I think."" Replacing an old battery in one of the affected models should return the phone to its former speed.  Doing so costs Â£79 in the UK and $79 (Â£59) in the US. ""They should be more transparent about it,"" said Chris Green from the tech consultancy Bright Bee. ""You're taking away performance that somebody has paid for. If you're going to slow down the phone over time, you should explain why it is happening, so people understand it is ultimately for their benefit. ""But I do see where they're coming from. By slowing the phone, it does help mitigate the problem of the diminishing battery."" Prince Harry and Meghan Markle engagement photos released Jerusalem: UN resolution rejects Trump's declaration The heir whose killings stunned Canada It is a combination of urban myth and conspiracy theory - the idea that Apple builds planned obsolescence into the iPhone, slowing down older models to make you splash out on an upgrade. Now it turns out to be true - the slowing down part, if not the motive behind it. Apple's explanation that it is all about managing the performance of ageing batteries seems quite reasonable. After all, the fact that the lithium-ion batteries that power mobile phones degrade over time is well known and owners of other leading smartphones also complain of poor battery life after a few years. But what will frustrate and anger many iPhone users is Apple's lack of transparency. The software tweak at the heart of this story happened last year and rumours about the deliberate downgrading of performance have been bubbling for weeks. But it was only a couple of days after a software developer showed exactly what was happening that Apple finally came out and explained. Here is a company that is - as any journalist can attest - fanatical about controlling the message about its products.  It has also benefitted from the devotion over the years of customers who are more like fans. But maybe it is time for Apple to show a bit more honesty in that relationship.

Mothers and babies harmed by birth errors,"This video can not be played Ryan and Wendy Agius's daughter, Talulah, was stillborn Tens of thousands of mothers and babies in England were harmed by potential lapses in maternity care in the past two years, the BBC has learned. More than 276,000 incidents were logged by worried hospital staff between April 2015 and March 2017 - the equivalent of one mistake for every five births. Most were minor or near misses, but almost a quarter of the incidents led to the mother or baby being harmed - and in 288 cases there was a death. Ministers said safety must be improved. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC the figures were ""shocking"" and improving the way mothers and babies were cared for was a ""top priority"". ""Mistakes in maternity care can lead to heart-breaking tragedies for mothers and babies."" But he said it was encouraging hospitals were being honest as that would help prevent repeat problems. However, childbirth charity NCT said the figures suggested maternity care was ""in crisis"". The incidents have been flagged up under a voluntary reporting scheme run by the regulator NHS Improvement that staff are encouraged to take part in if they have concerns about care. The potential lapses logged include everything from short delays getting medication or records not being completed properly to babies being deprived of oxygen and life-threatening complications not being diagnosed. We must do better on baby deaths - Hunt The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' Wendy Agius was sent home three times by maternity staff - by the time of her fourth visit the baby had died Wendy Agius was already past her due date in June 2014 when she became concerned that her baby was not moving. Over the next two days Wendy, 33, and her husband Ryan, 37, made repeated calls to the local maternity unit - a midwifery-led unit in Eastbourne - as well as making three visits. Each time they were told everything was fine - even after Wendy collapsed at one point. When they returned a fourth time, no heart beat could be found. Their daughter, Talulah, had died. ""It was devastating,"" said Wendy. ""They just kept sending us home. We were treated like an inconvenience."" It later emerged on one visit their baby's heart rate had been incorrectly recorded and their symptoms should have led to them being invited in more quickly and seen by a consultant at an earlier point. But established guidelines were not followed. Since then, the couple have not been able to get pregnant again. Ryan said: ""It was the worst thing imaginable. We can't move forward. It is always there every day."" East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs the maternity service, said it had apologised for the failings. An internal review concluded it was not possible to ascertain whether the mistakes had led to Talulah being stillborn. Of the 63,380 cases of harm, nearly 55,000 involved injuries or conditions that required no more than basic first aid, such as treating a mother who had slipped in the shower. But there were 8,134 cases of more significant harm, including 479 which caused severe harm, such as permanent disability, and 288 deaths. Records seen by the BBC show a range of problems, including: delays dealing with women who had suffered haemorrhages and other complications babies left brain damaged after being deprived of oxygen during birth babies not screened for infections, leaving them at risk of meningitis, blood poisoning and pneumonia heart rates incorrectly measured or recorded delays in emergency Caesareans, causing distress to the baby midwives requesting help from consultants too late or not at all women being told to stay at home or sent away from maternity units despite reporting potentially serious problems Overall, a third of the incidents related to mistakes with treatments or procedures, while one in five was a result of problems with the admission, transfer or discharge of mothers and babies. The figures also highlight how some hospitals have seen more cases than others, although NHS Improvement points out that being a high reporter of incidents may just be because a hospital is more transparent about its care. Nonetheless, in a number of the cases there are serious concerns about services. Seven babies and two mothers died at the Royal Oldham and North Manchester General hospitals, both of which are run by the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS trust. The trust said it now had new leadership, staff had been provided with extra training and more midwives recruited, and since the changes had been made there had been no more deaths. Meanwhile, five mothers and four babies died under the care of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust between 2015 and 2017. The trust said it could not provide details of what had happened because of patient confidentiality. An inquest into the death of another baby - in 2014  - highlighted major problems at the trust. The baby, Rafe Angelo, died from oxygen starvation. His mother had been transferred from a local birthing centre to Queen Alexandra Hospital, which is run by the trust, after complications developed. But there were a series of delays in her getting treatment, including an ambulance crew's detour for a toilet break and no doctors or midwives to meet the ambulance on arrival. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust also saw 11 cases of severe harm during the period. And hospital bosses had to apologise to a couple after their baby died in 2015. There had been delays in the mother undergoing an emergency Caesarean, while the heart rate had not been properly recorded. The trust admitted the baby could have survived if mistakes had not been made. Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Trust reported the most incidents, more than 5,000. The trust runs St Mary's Hospital in the city, which reported nine deaths, two were mothers and seven babies. The trust said lessons had been learned from the incidents. The government has set a target for halving the overall rate of stillbirths, deaths and baby brain injuries by 2025. To help ensure lessons are learned, the Healthcare Safety Investigations Branch, set up earlier this year, will start looking at all cases of unexplained serious harm and death from next year. The reports made to NHS Improvement - highlighted by the BBC - will feed into that system. The idea of both systems is to ensure the NHS creates a learning culture so similar mistakes can be prevented. But unions have said staffing is also an issue. The Royal College of Midwives believes the NHS in England is 3,500 midwives short of what it needs. Staffing has also been highlighted by the Care Quality Commission, which inspects hospitals. In its review of services earlier this year, it warned staffing and the ability to provide one-to-one care during labour was a concern. Half of maternity units are currently judged to be not safe enough. Maternity is also the biggest cause of clinical negligence payouts, accounting for half of the cost of all claims. Last year, Â£1.9bn of claims were made - a rise of 91% since 2004-05. Abigail Wood, head of campaigns at childbirth charity NCT, said: ""Maternity care is in crisis, staffing levels are dangerously low and midwives are being stretched to the limit.""

Catalans to vote in bid to end stand-off,"One exit poll suggested separatist parties would win a majority Separatist parties are on course to retain a majority in the new Catalan parliament, early results suggest. The election pits Catalan pro-independence parties against those who want the region to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain. However, with almost all votes counted, the unionist Citizens (Cs) party had the biggest share of the vote. A BBC correspondent says there seems little prospect that the election will solve Catalonia's political crisis. Normally, the largest party has the right to try to form a government - according to the results so far, this would be the unionist party Citizens. However, the separatist parties may insist they have the right to try first, if they have the largest number of seats overall. Within the separatist party block, ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont's Together for Catalonia party was slightly ahead of the Republican left of Catalonia, led by his former deputy Oriol Junqueras.

His team told the BBC that he was unable to vote as he was in Brussels. Turnout was reportedly more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. By Europe reporter Gavin Lee in Barcelona No pets allowed - it's a pooches-at-the-door policy here in the central Barcelona polling station of Casinet d'Hostafrancs, and there must be one dog to every 10 voters. Early voters queued in their dozens here 20 minutes before polls opened - something I didn't see in Berlin, Paris or Amsterdam this year for elections elsewhere in Europe. It may point to a record turnout across Catalonia. Opinion polls predict up to 85% of the 5.3 million eligible voters will turn out. In the queue Ana, a student, described it as ""the most important election in the history of Catalonia"". When polls close tonight the people, given the legal right to vote this time, will have shown the direction in which they want the independence crisis to play out. Separatists who dominated the Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October, after the referendum. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots.

Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. As a result, campaigning for Thursday's snap election has led to some unusual scenes, with Mr Puigdemont addressing rallies via a videolink from Brussels. Oriol Junqueras has been sending messages to supporters from prison. In the run-up to the referendum Mr Puigdemont's JxCat party had been allied to the ERC, led by Mr Junqueras. But the ERC has opted out of a new alliance, making Mr Junqueras the main separatist rival to Mr Puigdemont.

Gap 'widening' in access to good schools,"The report warns that regional gaps in good schools have grown wider in recent years There is a widening geographical divide in access to high-performing schools in England, says a report from the Education Policy Institute. Between 2010 and 2015, London took an increasing share of the secondary schools where pupils were most likely to make good progress. But the report says areas in the North and North East were being left behind. A Department for Education spokeswoman said social mobility plans would help chances to be spread more evenly. The report picks up on concerns about social mobility now being increasingly affected by where families live - with disadvantaged youngsters in London having a much better chance of going to good schools than similarly deprived pupils in other parts of the country. David Laws, the think tank's chairman and a former education minister, said the widening inequality was ""shocking"". In this study, ""high-performing"" schools are not those with the best exam results or rated as outstanding or good but those that are in the top third for how much progress pupils have made since starting secondary school. The report says that a number of London boroughs are stretching further ahead in the density of such schools. Harrow, Hillingdon, Brent, Ealing and Camden are among those with the greatest increases in such schools with a high level of value added. Among the 20 top authorities by this measure, 16 are in London. The authorities with a decreasing number of such high-performing schools are clustered in the North and Midlands, including Blackburn, Derby, Wirral, Warrington and Dudley. Young people in Blackpool and Hartlepool are named as having the least access to local secondary schools where pupil progress is in the top third by national standards. The analysis shows how levels of deprivation are not necessarily linked to the availability of high-performing schools. Haringey has 29% of pupils eligible for free school meals, but has among the country's highest densities of successful schools, in terms of value added. This measure of disadvantage is higher than any of the bottom 10 authorities with the least availability of good value-added schools. ""It is shocking to see that over recent years the access to high-quality secondary school places in England has become even more unequal,"" said Mr Laws. ""In one-fifth of local areas, children cannot access quality secondary school places. government rhetoric about spreading opportunity is not being matched by experience in areas such as the North, North East and parts of the Midlands."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""The answer of course is pretty simple."" He said schools needed better funding, to be able to recruit high-quality teachers and to have a longer-term approach to keeping the best teachers and head teachers. A Department for Education spokeswoman said that a new plan to promote social mobility was designed ""to make sure opportunities are spread evenly across the country"". ""That's why we are targeting the areas that need the most support through the Â£72m opportunity areas programme, and by investing Â£280m over the next two years to target resources at the schools most in need to improve their performance and deliver more good school places.""

Chocolate poisoning risk to dogs,"Dogs have been known to snaffle chocolate decorations, gifts and advent calendars Chocolate poisoning is a risk to the family dog at Christmas, say vets. They warn that dogs are four times more likely to fall ill from eating chocolate at this time of year. A study found hundreds of cases of dogs needing veterinary treatment after stealing chocolate Santas, selection boxes, chocolate oranges and even a mug of hot chocolate. Vets are trying to get the message across that the confectionery should be kept out of reach of the family pet. While dogs like the taste of chocolate, it can make them ill, even in small quantities. ''The take home message is firstly to make sure that people recognise that chocolate is a potential problem and to be vigilant with their chocolate gifts over the holiday period,'' said Dr Philip Jones, lecturer in veterinary epidemiology and public health at the University of Liverpool. ''If their dog does get access... to make sure that they contact their veterinary surgeon. ''And also before they contact their veterinary surgeon to have an estimate of how much chocolate and what type of chocolate the dog has eaten.'' The chemical theobromine, found in cocoa beans, is broken down more slowly in dogs. This can lead to sickness, increased heart rate, agitation, seizure, and, occasionally, death. Electronic health records from 200 veterinary practices - about 10% of the total number in the UK - were analysed for the study, between 2012 and 2017. The research found chocolate intoxication was four times more likely at Christmas than on a normal day.  The risk was half that at Easter, but there was no difference on Valentine's Day and Halloween. Vomiting was the most common symptom of chocolate poisoning, followed by agitation and increased heart rare. Younger dogs were more likely to snaffle chocolate and fall ill. In most cases, only small amounts were consumed. However, there were exceptions, such as when a dog ate a large number of Easter eggs hidden in a garden for a children's party. Treatment for poisoning depends on the amount of time that has passed since the dog ate. The dog may be given medicine  to induce vomiting and activated charcoal to stop further absorption of the toxic substance. The dog may then need fluid therapy and further medication to combat toxic effects on the heart. The study is published in the journal,Veterinary Record,external. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

US finds against Bombardier in Boeing fight,"Parts of Bombardier's C-Series planes are made in Belfast The US has ruled that Canada's Bombardier received government subsidies and sold C-Series jets below cost in the US, a step likely to lead to steep tariffs. The US Commerce Department investigated the aerospace firm's US sales after a petition from rival American company Boeing. The conflict has the potential to lead to job losses in Northern Ireland. Bombardier said it was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision. The dispute has contributed to escalating trade tensions between the US and Canada. The fight stems from a 2016 sale of 75 C-Series jets to Delta Air Lines. Boeing claims Delta paid $20m per plane, well below an estimated cost of $33m and what Bombardier charges in Canada. Bombardier employs about 1,000 people in Belfast linked to the C-Series. The Unite union in the UK called the Commerce Department decision ""nakedly political"", adding it had the potential to ""crush jobs, not only in Northern Ireland but in the US too"". ""More than 50 percent of C-Series components are sourced from the US, where the supply chain sustains 22,000 US jobs. The economic impact of these tariffs would be felt in communities on both sides of the Atlantic,"" said Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner. ""Boeing is using its meritless complaint as cover to close the US market, which is one of the biggest in the world, to new entrants such as Bombardier's C-Series aircraft."" This video can not be played The Unite union reacts to latest Bombardier ruling The Commerce Department's final determination on Wednesday set trade duties of about 292% - slightly lower than a preliminary finding. The inquiry now moves to the US International Trade Commission, which will examine if the dumping and subsidies caused injury to Boeing. It is expected to make a final decision in February 2018, which would trigger the duties. This week, Canada's ambassador to the US warned that it might take the fight to the World Trade Organization, if the US continues to side with Boeing. Earlier this month Canada scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Canada's anger over the trade challenge. On Wednesday, Bombardier said the Commerce Department had not taken into account Bombardier's plan to build a facility in the US, as part of a planned partnership with Airbus. ""This facility will provide US airlines with a US-built plane thereby eliminating any possibility of harm due to imports,"" said spokesman Mike Nadolski. ""Unfortunately, the Commerce Department decision is divorced from this reality and ignores long-standing business practices in the aerospace industry, including launch pricing and the financing of multibillion dollar aircraft programs."" The Commerce Department said it will collect the duties from the importer, if the US commission finds against Bombardier. Delta has said it plans to move forward with the order, but does not expect to pay the tariffs. Bombardier ruling 'disappointing' - union.

Cost of global disasters 'jumps in 2017',"Hurricane Maria caused extensive damage in Puerto Rico which is still struggling to rebuild Disasters in 2017 caused losses of $306bn (Â£229bn), according to estimates from insurance giant Swiss Re. The figure represents a 63% jump from last year, and is well above the average of the past decade. The Americas was hardest hit, with hurricanes in the Caribbean and southern US, earthquakes in Mexico and wildfires in California. Despite the rise in the financial cost of disasters, there was no significant increase in the loss of lives. Swiss Re said more than 11,000 people died or went missing in disaster events in 2017, which is similar to 2016's figure. A report by the firm's research arm Sigma,externalfound insured losses amounted to $136bn (Â£102bn) - more than double last year's total and the third highest on record. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria together caused insured losses of about $93bn (Â£70bn) according to the the report. But Swiss Re said the insurance industry had demonstrated that it could cope very well with such high losses, despite gaps in protection remaining. ""If the industry is able to extend its reach, many more people and businesses can become better equipped to withstand the fallout from disaster events"", said Martin Bertogg, head of catastrophe perils at Swiss Re.

"Ramaphosa vows to tackle SA corruptionThe new ANC leader pledges ""radical economic transformation"" for South Africa.1h40 minutes agoAfrica","Cyril Ramaphosa is one of South Africa's wealthiest politicians The new leader of South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC), Cyril Ramaphosa, has pledged to fight corruption and pursue a policy of ""radical economic transformation"". Closing the party's conference, he said tackling unemployment and poverty should also be key party policies. Mr Ramaphosa was elected on Monday to succeed President Jacob Zuma as party leader. He is in a strong position to become president at elections in 2019. ""This conference has resolved that corruption must be fought with the same intensity and purpose that we fight poverty, unemployment and inequality,"" he told delegates at the end of the five-day conference. ""We must also act fearlessly against alleged corruption and abuse of office within our ranks."" He said that the party had approved the seizure of land without compensation, but he cautioned against undermining the economy and food production. Analysis by Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg It was a long wait for Cyril Ramaphosa's speech, which had been scheduled for Wednesday morning. When he finally made it at around midnight, he congratulated his party on having emerged from conference ""united"". But there are many who point to issues like the alleged disappearance of 68 votes, cast for the powerful position of secretary general, and argue that splits in the party could well deepen. Mr Ramaphosa's choice of words on the land issue was interesting. They reflect the careful tightrope the ANC is trying to walk: Addressing the concerns of the majority black population, whilst trying to assuage the business community and allay comparisons to its neighbour Zimbabwe. There was also the expected condemnation of corruption in government and so-called state capture. What was not expected was his swipe at corporate corruption, and thinly veiled reference to the recent Steinhoff scandal. Again this is indicative of the delicate balance Mr Ramaphosa is trying to achieve. He wants to let investors know he is serious about correcting the issues of the recent past, and convince black voters that he will equally address the mistakes of white-owned businesses. Profile: Cyril Ramaphosa Will Zuma be ousted as South Africa's president? Can South Africa avoid doing a Zimbabwe on land? How Jacob Zuma's presidency shaped South African speech Steinhoff facing credit squeeze The ANC has been under pressure to redress disparities which mean white farmers still own much of the best land in South Africa, more than two decades after the end of apartheid. ""This conference has resolved that the expropriation of land without compensation should be among the mechanisms available to government to give effect to land reform and redistribution,"" he said. ""It has also been resolved that we ensure we do not undermine the agricultural production or the economy - that is what is important."" Mr Ramaphosa praised his defeated rival for the ANC leadership, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. This video can not be played What advice should South Africa's ruling party take on board? The leadership battle caused fierce political infighting, raising fears that the party might split before the 2019 election. President Zuma has been embroiled in a series of corruption scandals - he denies any wrongdoing - and support for the ANC has declined in recent elections. However, it still gained more than 50% of the national vote in local polls last year. Born in Soweto, Johannesburg, in 1952 Detained in 1974 and 1976 for anti-apartheid activities Launched the National Union of Mineworkers in 1982 Chairman of the National Reception Committee which prepared for Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990 Became an MP and chairman of constitutional assembly in 1994 Moved full-time into business in 1997, becoming one of South Africa's richest businessmen On the board of mine-owners Lonmin during 2012 Marikana massacre of striking miners Became South Africa's deputy president in 2014 Elected ANC leader in 2017 Analysts say Mr Ramaphosa may move to sack Mr Zuma in the coming weeks, however this would need the backing of the party leadership. In a separate development, the ANC conference passed a resolution to direct the government to downgrade the South African embassy in Israel to a liaison office. It described the move as a ""practical expression of support to the oppressed people of Palestine"". Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump caused widespread controversy when he announced the US would recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate its embassy there from Tel Aviv.

SHINee were founded in 2008 as a five member group under SM Entertainment, and quickly rose to become of the biggest K-pop boy groups. Over the past years, SHINee recorded several albums in Japanese and in 2017 sold out the 55,000-seat Tokyo Dome and part of their Japan tour. Earlier this year, they also played their first North American tour. Depression is more than just feeling a bit down for a few days. It is an illness which, at its most severe, can leave people feeling that life is no longer worth living. It can cause physical symptoms such as headaches, sleeplessness and constant tiredness which may last for months and months. People with depression can also feel anxious, irritable and agitated on a daily basis but it affects everyone differently and only in rare cases is it a reason for violence against others. If people admit their symptoms and talk to someone about their feelings, depression can usually be treated but the biggest barrier to getting help is often stigma and the fear of disclosing mental health problems.

"Cost of global disasters 'jumps in 2017'Hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires caused much of the estimated $306bn losses, a report says.1h31 minutes agoBusiness","Hurricane Maria caused extensive damage in Puerto Rico which is still struggling to rebuild Disasters in 2017 caused losses of $306bn (Â£229bn), according to estimates from insurance giant Swiss Re. The figure represents a 63% jump from last year, and is well above the average of the past decade. The Americas was hardest hit, with hurricanes in the Caribbean and southern US, earthquakes in Mexico and wildfires in California. Despite the rise in the financial cost of disasters, there was no significant increase in the loss of lives. Swiss Re said more than 11,000 people died or went missing in disaster events in 2017, which is similar to 2016's figure. A report by the firm's research arm Sigma,externalfound insured losses amounted to $136bn (Â£102bn) - more than double last year's total and the third highest on record. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria together caused insured losses of about $93bn (Â£70bn) according to the the report. But Swiss Re said the insurance industry had demonstrated that it could cope very well with such high losses, despite gaps in protection remaining. ""If the industry is able to extend its reach, many more people and businesses can become better equipped to withstand the fallout from disaster events"", said Martin Bertogg, head of catastrophe perils at Swiss Re.

Ramaphosa vows to tackle SA corruption,"Cyril Ramaphosa is one of South Africa's wealthiest politicians The new leader of South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC), Cyril Ramaphosa, has pledged to fight corruption and pursue a policy of ""radical economic transformation"". Closing the party's conference, he said tackling unemployment and poverty should also be key party policies. Mr Ramaphosa was elected on Monday to succeed President Jacob Zuma as party leader. He is in a strong position to become president at elections in 2019. ""This conference has resolved that corruption must be fought with the same intensity and purpose that we fight poverty, unemployment and inequality,"" he told delegates at the end of the five-day conference. ""We must also act fearlessly against alleged corruption and abuse of office within our ranks."" He said that the party had approved the seizure of land without compensation, but he cautioned against undermining the economy and food production. Analysis by Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg It was a long wait for Cyril Ramaphosa's speech, which had been scheduled for Wednesday morning. When he finally made it at around midnight, he congratulated his party on having emerged from conference ""united"". But there are many who point to issues like the alleged disappearance of 68 votes, cast for the powerful position of secretary general, and argue that splits in the party could well deepen. Mr Ramaphosa's choice of words on the land issue was interesting. They reflect the careful tightrope the ANC is trying to walk: Addressing the concerns of the majority black population, whilst trying to assuage the business community and allay comparisons to its neighbour Zimbabwe. There was also the expected condemnation of corruption in government and so-called state capture. What was not expected was his swipe at corporate corruption, and thinly veiled reference to the recent Steinhoff scandal. Again this is indicative of the delicate balance Mr Ramaphosa is trying to achieve. He wants to let investors know he is serious about correcting the issues of the recent past, and convince black voters that he will equally address the mistakes of white-owned businesses. Profile: Cyril Ramaphosa Will Zuma be ousted as South Africa's president? Can South Africa avoid doing a Zimbabwe on land? How Jacob Zuma's presidency shaped South African speech Steinhoff facing credit squeeze The ANC has been under pressure to redress disparities which mean white farmers still own much of the best land in South Africa, more than two decades after the end of apartheid. ""This conference has resolved that the expropriation of land without compensation should be among the mechanisms available to government to give effect to land reform and redistribution,"" he said. ""It has also been resolved that we ensure we do not undermine the agricultural production or the economy - that is what is important."" Mr Ramaphosa praised his defeated rival for the ANC leadership, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. This video can not be played What advice should South Africa's ruling party take on board? The leadership battle caused fierce political infighting, raising fears that the party might split before the 2019 election. President Zuma has been embroiled in a series of corruption scandals - he denies any wrongdoing - and support for the ANC has declined in recent elections. However, it still gained more than 50% of the national vote in local polls last year. Born in Soweto, Johannesburg, in 1952 Detained in 1974 and 1976 for anti-apartheid activities Launched the National Union of Mineworkers in 1982 Chairman of the National Reception Committee which prepared for Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990 Became an MP and chairman of constitutional assembly in 1994 Moved full-time into business in 1997, becoming one of South Africa's richest businessmen On the board of mine-owners Lonmin during 2012 Marikana massacre of striking miners Became South Africa's deputy president in 2014 Elected ANC leader in 2017 Analysts say Mr Ramaphosa may move to sack Mr Zuma in the coming weeks, however this would need the backing of the party leadership. In a separate development, the ANC conference passed a resolution to direct the government to downgrade the South African embassy in Israel to a liaison office. It described the move as a ""practical expression of support to the oppressed people of Palestine"". Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump caused widespread controversy when he announced the US would recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate its embassy there from Tel Aviv.

UK car production falls in November,"The number of cars built in the UK last month fell by 4.6% compared with a year earlier, driven down by a sharp decline in domestic demand. Nearly 161,500 vehicles were made in UK factories in November, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). But output for the domestic market fell by 28.1%, as a result of ""Brexit uncertainty"" and ""confusion over diesel taxation"", the SMMT said. Production for export rose by 1.3%. What's gone wrong in the UK car market? UK car production rises in October The SMMT figures showed that of the 161,490 cars produced last month, 24,276 were for the UK market, while 137,214 were shipped overseas. Exports reached their highest proportion of output so far this year at 85%. However, the SMMT said production for the home market ""continued to falter"" and fell for the fourth month in a row. Earlier this month, SMMT car registration figures showed that the number of cars sold in the UK fell for the eighth consecutive month in November, declining by 11.2%. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""Brexit uncertainty, coupled with confusion over diesel taxation and air quality plans, continues to impact domestic demand for new cars and, with it, production output."" He added that it was good to see exports grow last month, but ""this only reinforces how overseas demand remains the driving force for UK car manufacturing. ""Clarity on the nature of our future overseas trading relationships, including details on transition arrangements with the EU, is vital for future growth and success."" The number of cars made so far this year is down 2% compared with the same period last year at 1.57 million. Production for the home market has fallen by 9%, while production of vehicles for export is flat.

May: I asked you to resign,"Prime Minister Theresa May has sacked Damian Green as First Secretary of State amid claims that pornographic material was found on a Commons computer in 2008. Replying to his letter of resignation, she recalls the pair's lengthy friendship and how they entered Parliament together in 1997. Here is the full text of both her reply and his notice of resignation. I am extremely sad to be writing this letter. We have been friends and colleagues throughout our whole political lives - from our early days at university, entering the House of Commons at the same election, and serving alongside each other both in Opposition and in Government. As Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and as First Secretary of State, you have brought great wisdom, good sense and a commitment to helping the most vulnerable to my Cabinets in this Parliament and the last. I have greatly appreciated your hard work and the contribution you have made to my team, just as I did at the Home Office, where you served as Immigration Minister and Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice, helping to drive through important but often difficult reforms. Like you, I know the vast majority of our police to be diligent and honourable public servants, working hard to protect the public and maintain law and order. But I shared the concerns raised from across the political spectrum when your Parliamentary office was raided in 2008 when you were a shadow Home Office Minister holding the then Labour Government to account. And I share the concerns, raised once again from across the political spectrum, at the comments made by a former officer involved in that case in recent weeks. I am glad that the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has condemned that, made clear that police officers' duty of confidentiality endures after they leave the force, and that the Metropolitan Police's professional standards department are reviewing the comments which have been made. When allegations were raised about your personal conduct, I asked the Cabinet Secretary to establish as far as possible the facts of the case and provide advice on whether or not there had been a breach of the Ministerial Code. He has produced a thorough report which concludes that your conduct as a minister has generally been both professional and proper. You have expressed your regret for the distress caused to Ms Maltby following her article about you and the reaction to it. I appreciate that you do not recognise the events Ms Maltby described in the article, but you do recognise that you made her feel uncomfortable and it is right that you have apologised. I know that you share my determination to ensure that everyone who wants to play their part in our political life should feel able to do so - without fear or harassment, and knowing they can speak out if they need to. Equally, it is right that those who put themselves forward to serve the public should also be accorded the respect of a private life within the law. I have also carefully considered the report's conclusions in relation to two statements you made on 4 and 11 November which you now accept were inaccurate and misleading. This falls short of the Seven Principles of Public Life and is a breach of the Ministerial Code - a conclusion which has been endorsed by Sir Alex Allan, the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests. While I can understand the considerable distress caused to you by some of the allegations which have been made in recent weeks, I know that you share my commitment to maintaining the high standards which the public demands of Ministers of the Crown. It is therefore with deep regret, and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years, that I asked you to resign from the Government and have accepted your resignation. Yours ever Theresa Dear Prime Minister, I regret that I've been asked to resign from the government following breaches of the Ministerial Code, for which I apologise. It has been a privilege to serve in your government both as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and as First Secretary of State and Minister for the Cabinet Office. It was also a great pleasure to work with you in the Home Office both as Minister for Immigration and as Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims. Your years as home secretary were a model of reforming institutions in the interests of the wider public. I share and support your vision of a country that works for everyone, using Conservative policies to help those who have for too long been disadvantaged. In particular I am pleased to have published the Race Disparity Audit and to have started the government on a road to a reformed social care system. From the outset I have been clear that I did not download or view pornography on my Parliamentary computers. I accept that I should have been clear in my press statements that police lawyers talked to my lawyers in 2008 about the pornography on the computers, and that the police raised it with me in a subsequent phone call in 2013. I apologise that my statements were misleading on this point. The unfounded and deeply hurtful allegations that were being levelled at me were distressing both to me and my family and it is right that these are being investigated by the Metropolitan Police's professional standards department. I am grateful that the Cabinet Secretary has concluded that my conduct as a minister has generally been both professional and proper. I deeply regret the distress caused to Kate Maltby following her article about me and the reaction to it. I do not recognise the events she described in her article, but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and for this I apologise. Finally I would like to give heartfelt thanks to my Parliamentary colleagues and my Ashford constituents for the huge support they have shown me in recent weeks. I will continue to argue for the modernising conservatism I have always believed in.
