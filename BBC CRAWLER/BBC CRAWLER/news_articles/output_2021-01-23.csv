"Larry King, veteran talk show host, dies aged 87","Larry King achieved worldwide fame with his popular CNN talk show Larry King, giant of US broadcasting who achieved worldwide fame for interviewing political leaders and celebrities, has died at the age of 87. King conducted an estimated 50,000 interviews in his six-decade career, which included 25 years as host of the popular CNN talk show Larry King Live. He died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to Ora Media, a production company he co-founded. Earlier this month, he was treated in hospital for Covid-19, US media say. The talk show host, famous for his braces and rolled-up sleeves, had faced several health problems in recent years, including heart attacks. Larry King: US TV legend who hosted 50,000 interviews King was married eight times to seven women and had five children. Two of them died last year within weeks of each other - daughter Chaia died from lung cancer and son Andy of a heart attack. King carried out interviews with every sitting US president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama and a number of world leaders. His other high-profile guests included Dr Martin Luther King, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and Lady Gaga. ""For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,"" Ora Media said in a statement, without giving the cause of death. This video can not be played Larry King: ""I like spontaneity. That's the kind of broadcaster I am"". Born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn, New York, in 1933, King rose to fame in the 1970s with his radio programme The Larry King Show, on the commercial network Mutual Broadcasting System. In 1985 he launched Larry King Live on the fledgling CNN, and became one of the network's biggest stars. The programme, broadcast around the world, was a success with audiences, with King answering thousands of phone calls from viewers. He earned a number of honours, including two Peabody awards, but was also criticised for his non-confrontational approach and open-ended questions. King boasted of not doing much research for the interviews so, he said, he could learn along with viewers. By 2010 his ratings had dropped significantly, with critics saying King's approach felt outdated in an era of more aggressive interviewing styles. King then announced his retirement, saying: ""It's time to hang up my nightly suspenders."" In his final programme on CNN, he told his viewers: ""I don't know what to say, except to you, my audience, thank you. Instead of goodbye, how about so long?"" Allow Twitter content?

CNN replaced him with British journalist and broadcaster Piers Morgan, whose programme King criticised for being ""too much about him"". Morgan, whose programme was cancelled three years later, said on Twitter on Saturday:,external""Larry King was a hero of mine until we fell out after I replaced him at CNN & he said my show was 'like watching your mother-in-law go over a cliff in your new Bentley.' (He married 8 times so a mother-in-law expert)."" But, Morgan added, King ""was a brilliant broadcaster & masterful TV interviewer."" In a statement, CNN president Jeff Zucker said: ""The scrappy young man from Brooklyn had a history-making career spanning radio and television. His curiosity about the world propelled his award-winning career in broadcasting, but it was his generosity of spirit that drew the world to him."" Most recently, King hosted another programme, Larry King Now, broadcast on Hulu and RT, Russia's state-controlled international broadcaster. A Kremlin spokesman was quoted as saying by state RIA Novosti news agency: ""King repeatedly interviewed Putin. The president has always appreciated his great professionalism and unquestioned journalistic authority."" Outside broadcasting, King founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation in 1988, a charity which helps to fund heart treatment for those with limited financial means or no medical insurance.

PM talks to Biden in first call since inauguration,"Mr Johnson raised the benefits of a UK-US trade deal during his phone call with Mr Biden Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spoken to Joe Biden for the first time since the new US president was inaugurated. Mr Johnsonsaid on Twitter,externalthat he looked forward to ""deepening the longstanding alliance"" between the UK and the US as they drove a ""green and sustainable recovery from Covid-19"". Mr Biden was sworn in as president and Kamala Harris as vice-presidentin a ceremony in Washington on Wednesday. The PM said their inauguration wasa ""step forward"" for the US. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Johnson ""warmly welcomed"" the president's decision to rejoin theParis Agreement on climate changeand the World Health Organization - both abandoned byMr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump. ""The prime minister praised President Biden's early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach net zero by 2050,"" the spokesman said. PM: Biden inauguration 'a step forward' Biden sets to work on reversing Trump policies What can Johnson expect from the Biden presidency? The spokesman added that, in building on the two nations' ""long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders ""re-committed to the Nato alliance and our shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy"". The two leaders also talked about ""the benefits of a potential free trade deal"" between the UK and the US, with Mr Johnson reiterating his intention ""to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible"". After the inauguration of any American president, a political spectator sport immediately begins: the order in which the new occupant of the White House speaks to other world leaders. It is a crude metric of relative importance, but a metric nonetheless. I understand the call lasted for around 35 minutes and was the first conversation Joe Biden has had with a European leader as president. The focus on climate change makes political and diplomatic sense. It's a topic where a Conservative prime minister and Democrat president can agree, and it matters particularly to the UK as the host of the COP26 UN Climate Change Summit in Glasgow in November. But when you compare what Downing Street said about the call and what the White House said, one thing leaps out. No 10's readout refers to a conversation about a trade deal. President Biden's does not. It's widely expected there'll be no such agreement any time soon. Mr Johnson and Mr Biden ""looked forward to to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow"" and to working together during the forthcoming G7, G20 andCOP26summits, the spokesman added. A White House statement said Mr Biden ""conveyed his intention to strengthen the special relationship"" between the US and UK and ""revitalize transatlantic ties"". Congratulating Mr Biden and Ms Harris - who is the first woman and first black and Asian-American person to serve as vice-president - the PM said earlier that their inauguration was a ""step forward"" for the US, which had ""been through a bumpy period"". This video can not be played Johnson: ""It's a big moment for us - we have things we want to do together."" Mr Johnson said it was a ""big moment"" for the UK and the US and their ""joint common agenda"". The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg has said theBiden Presidency ""brings some hope to government""because No 10 believes ""there is a lot of overlap"" between what Mr Biden and Mr Johnson want to do. The US president has previously said that he does not wanta ""guarded border""between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland following Brexit, and that any UK-US post-Brexit trade deal had to be""contingent"" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement. The PM and Mr Biden have never met in real life, but the new US president once referred to Mr Johnson as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Mr Trump. After winning the presidential election, Mr Biden phoned Mr Johnson ahead of other European leaders and expressed his desire tostrengthen the historic ""special relationship"" between the two countries.

Man City avoid FA Cup shock at Robins,"This video can not be played FA Cup: Cheltenham Town 1-3 Manchester City highlights Cheltenham Town came within nine minutes of one of the biggest shocks in recent FA Cup history before Manchester City staged a dramatic late rally to crush the dreams of the gallant League Two side. The Robins, 72 places below City who sit second in the Premier League, threatened huge embarrassment for Pep Guardiola's side after Alfie May put Cheltenham ahead on the hour after a trademark long throw from captain Ben Tozer caused chaos in the area. City, who made ten changes to the team that beat Aston Villa in the Premier League on Wednesday, spared their embarrassment when Phil Foden, the game's outstanding player, arrived at the far post to turn in substitute Joao Cancelo's long cross in the 81st minute. And the turnaround was complete three minutes later when a rare moment of slackness in the outstanding Cheltenham defence, with goalkeeper Josh Griffiths superb, switched off and Gabriel Jesus scored from Fernandinho's delivery. Ferran Torres scored Manchester City's third with the last kick of the game to give the scoreline a cruel reflection on Cheltenham's heroic efforts. It was so cruel on manager Michael Duff and his players, who now go back the battle for promotion from League Two, while City will be away at Swansea in the fifth round. ""I'm incredibly proud,"" the Robins boss said of his side's display. ""The players they brought on from the bench and they way they celebrated the goals tells you something. They know they've been in a game. They've done that to better teams than us."" Live text, video and reaction from Saturday's fourth-round ties Lawro's FA Cup predictions v Radio 1 DJ Jordan North This video can not be played FA Cup: How close Cheltenham came to Manchester City shock The sight of Manchester City manager Guardiola disputing where Cheltenham could take a throw-in said everything about the way the League Two underdogs gave their mighty opponents a serious fright. Tozer's throw-ins were causing all manner of problems and led to Cheltenham's goal but there was so much more to their performance than that set-piece weapon, a threat any manager in the game would utilise. Cheltenham tried to play football when they got the chance, with goalscorer May, who has done the hard yards in non-league before playing for Doncaster and now Cheltenham, a leading light. Robins keeper Griffiths, who suffered the ignominy of being beaten from 71 yards by his Newport County opposite number Tom King in midweek, was in defiant form as he saved well from Riyad Mahrez and Torres, showing command throughout. Tozer's headed goalline clearance from Benjamin Mendy in the first half was also symbolic of their 'they shall not pass' approach. This video can not be played 'Incredible defending!' Shearer & Richards on Tozer's brilliant goalline clearance There may have been no fans inside this compact stadium but there was still a real sense of occasion, the game being halted in the first half because of a firework display nearby. In the end this will be a bitter disappointment to Cheltenham but they can be rightly proud and take huge confidence into their League Two promotion battle. Duff highlighted how financially important the cup run was for his club. ""It's essential,"" he added. ""Every pound coming in is probably worth a tenner in normal times. ""These games don't come around very often. It's a shame because [with fans] the place would've been bouncing. Would that have seen us through in the last 10 minutes? I'm not so sure - but the key is to enjoy it."" This video can not be played May gives Cheltenham a shock lead over Manchester City Guardiola made 10 changes to his line-up to give Manchester City's shadow squad a chance to impress. Some, like the erratic Mendy, did not take that opportunity and it was someone establishing himself in City's side that spared the blushes of this expensively assembled squad. Foden was magnificent, so light on his feet with glorious ball control, endless creativity and the man pulling the strings for City even when they were struggling to break down resilient Cheltenham. The 20-year-old was head and shoulders above his City team-mates. He was the one who was going to pull them out of their grim predicament if anyone was, and so it proved when he popped up with the crucial late equaliser that lifted Guardiola's team and deflated Cheltenham. Foden had already carved out chances for Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus that were not taken so it was a case of 'do it yourself' when he was the player on target. The fact Guardiola was forced to use three subs in Ruben Dias, Ilkay Gundogan and Joao Cancelo once Cheltenham went ahead proved how worried the Premier League giants were. This was an unimpressive, scratchy display from City's much-changed team, with Guardiola resting so many of the players who are giving them such an ominous look in the Premier League - luckily they had the brilliance of Foden to pull them out of a deep hole. Guardiola praised the England attacking midfielder for his impressive performance. ""Foden is in a great moment and with great confidence,"" he said. ""He is clinical in front of goal and he had a similar chance to the goal we scored at [Chelsea's] Stamford Bridge - he is playing really well."" The City manager suggested he was confident in the players he put out on the pitch. ""I didn't have regrets even when we were 1-0 down, we had clear chances from the first minute,"" he added. ""When they take advantage it gets complicated, but we got it to 1-1 and it was tight. We came here with humility and had the quality to make the difference."" This video can not be played Gabriel Jesus scores late goal to put Manchester City ahead at Cheltenham Town Cheltenham have lost all nine of their competitive meetings with Premier League sides, by an aggregate score of 6-23. City have won 10 consecutive games in all competitions for the first time since a run of 11 from August to October 2017. May's opener for Cheltenham was the first goal City had conceded in 509 minutes of action in all competitions, since Callum Hudson-Odoi's strike for Chelsea at the start of the month. Foden is City's top scorer in all competitions this season with nine goals in 25 appearances, one more than he netted in 38 games last season. Jesus has been involved in 12 goals in 13 FA Cup appearances for City, scoring eight and assisting four. May has scored four goals in his four FA Cup games for Cheltenham, with each of his eight goals in total in the competition coming in home games.

Scientists play down 'more deadly variant' claim,"Scientists say signs a new coronavirus variant is more deadly than the earlier version should not be a ""game changer"" in the UK's response to the pandemic. Boris Johnson has said there is ""some evidence"" the variant may be associated with ""a higher degree of mortality"". But the co-author of the study the PM was referring to said the variant's deadliness remained an ""open question"". Another adviser said he was surprised Mr Johnson had shared the findings when the data was ""not particularly strong"". A third top medic said it was ""too early"" to be ""absolutely clear"". At a Downing Street coronavirus news conference on Friday,the prime minister said: ""In addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant - the variant that was first identified in London and the South East - may be associated with a higher degree of mortality."" Speaking alongside the PM, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said there was ""a lot of uncertainty around these numbers"" but that early evidence suggested the variant could be about 30% more deadly. For example, Sir Patrick said if 1,000 men in their 60s were infected with the old variant, roughly 10 of them would be expected to die - but this rises to about 13 with the new variant. UK variant 'may be more deadly' New coronavirus variants: What do we know? Epidemic shrinking but remains 'precarious' The announcement followeda briefing,externalby scientists on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) which concluded there was a ""realistic possibility"" that the variant was associated with an increased risk of death. But one of the briefing's co-authors, Prof Graham Medley, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The question about whether it is more dangerous in terms of mortality I think is still open."" ""In terms of making the situation worse it is not a game changer. It is a very bad thing that is slightly worse,"" added Prof Medley, who is a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Another 1,348 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Saturday, in addition to 33,552 new infections, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,external. There is huge uncertainty in the evidence on how lethal the variant is. The scientific experts that reviewed the data,externalused a precise phrase saying it was a ""realistic possibility"" the new variant is more deadly. That means there's a roughly 50-50 chance it will turn out to be true. With time, and sadly more deaths, the picture will become clearer. While people debate the uncertainties though, we already know this variant has the ability to kill more people than the old ones. A virus that spreads faster (this one is 30-70% faster) will infect more people, more quickly, putting a greater strain on hospitals and leading to a sharper spike in deaths. It is why viruses becoming more transmissible can be a bigger problem than ones becoming more deadly. Nervtag's chairman Prof Peter Horby defended the government's ""transparency"" in making the announcement. ""Scientists are looking at the possibility that there is increased severity... and after a week of looking at the data we came to the conclusion that it was a realistic possibility,"" he said. ""We need to be transparent about that. If we were not telling people about this we would be accused of covering it up."" This video can not be played Sir Patrick Vallance: ""There is evidence that there's an increased risk for those who have the new variant"" But Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of Sage subgroup the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), agreed it was too early to draw ""strong conclusions"" as the suggested increased mortality rates were based on ""a relatively small amount of data"". He told BBC Breakfast he was ""actually quite surprised"" Mr Johnson had made the early findings public rather than monitoring the data ""for a week or two more"". ""I just worry that where we report things pre-emptively where the data are not really particularly strong,"" Dr Tildesley added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle also said it was not ""absolutely clear"" the new variant was more deadly than the original. ""There is some evidence, but it is very early evidence. It is small numbers of cases and it is far too early to say,"" she told the Today programme. Meanwhile, senior doctors are calling on England's chief medical officer to cut the gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The British Medical Association told Prof Chris Whittyan extension to the maximum gap between jab from three weeks to 12 weeks, to get the first dose to more people, was ""difficult to justify"".

"More than 4,000 Covid patients now on ventilators","The number of coronavirus patients on mechanical ventilation in the UK has passed 4,000 for the first time in the pandemic. A total of 4,076 Covid patients were in ventilator beds as of Friday,according to government data,external. That is higher than during the first wave, when the peak was 3,301 on 12 April. It comes as another 1,348 deaths and 33,552 new infections were reported on Saturday. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told a Downing Street news briefing on Friday: ""The death rate's awful and it's going to stay, I'm afraid, high for a little while before it starts coming down."" 'We've lost five patients in a single shift' UK variant 'may be more deadly' 'Record number' of Covid hospital transfers Covid epidemic shrinking but remains 'precarious' Meanwhile, new figures show that a record number of seriously-ill Covid patients are being transferred fromover-stretched hospitals because of a lack of bed space. About 1 in 10 patients admitted to intensive care are being sent to a different site, according to the body which audits critical care services. In a series of reports in the past week, the BBC's Clive Myrie has been to a mortuary and the Royal London Hospital, where 12 out of 15 floors are occupied by Covid patients and staff are struggling to cope. Martin Freeborn's wife Helen, 64, died with Covid-19 at the hospital shortly before he spoke to the BBC. Mr Freeborn urged people to ""be over-careful"" in taking precautions to stay safe from the virus because ""you don't want this to happen"". ""Nobody wants to go through this... Don't end up like us, please,"" he added. This video can not be played Martin Freeborn's wife, Helen, died from Covid at the Royal London Hospital: 'Don't end up like us, please' The number of people in mechanical ventilation beds has climbed every day since 18 December when it was 1,364 and now stands at 4,076. It is one of the key figures the government considers when deciding its policy on when to ease coronavirus lockdown restrictions. When the pandemic first struck the UK, the government saw what had happened in hospitals in China and Italy and prioritised the provision of ventilators in British hospitals. It set about buying as many ventilators as possible, and encouraged British manufacturers to design the machines to build stocks to cope with the worst-case Covid scenario. In September last year, a report found the NHS now had30,000 ventilators available - about one for every 2,200 people in the UK. People in hospital are also being treated differently from the early days of the pandemic - which may explain why figures suggest slightly more people go on to recover after being on ventilation than back in March, April and May. A number of drugs are being tested as possible treatments for people with the disease,the BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher has said. They include the steroid dexamethasone, which has been shown to reduce the risk of death by a third for ventilated patients and by a fifth for those on oxygen. Encouraging results have also been reported from two anti-inflammatory medications, tocilizumab and sarilumab. Dr Ami Jones, intensive care consultant atAneurin Bevan University Health Board, in Wales,said there had been ""carnage"" for the ""last few weeks"". Speaking whilst on shift, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're maybe at 150% capacity and I know London are much worse than that. ""We've a steady stream of fit, young patients requiring critical care and sadly we're losing some of those patients. ""We lost a patient overnight and I've replaced them with a patient of similar age. ""It's heartbreaking - and it's been going on for weeks and weeks and we haven't seen any kind of stop yet."" Dr Jones said the average Covid patient stays in hospital between two to four weeks ""and it really puts them through it"". She added: ""You really want people who are going to be able to survive that three or four weeks and actually come out the other end and make a good recovery. ""We're not stopping people having care but we're giving it to the people we feel have the best chance of getting through what is a horrific situation we're going to put them through."" Dr Jones said nurses are ""broken"", both physically, from months of long shifts in personal protective equipment (PPE), and emotionally - partly due to the impact of the virus on them, their families and the community. Dr Rupert Pearse, consultant in intensive care medicine at a London hospital, speaking on behalf of the Intensive Care Society, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a ""huge number"" of patients were still attending hospital. He said: ""Whilst we know the infection rate has probably now peaked, and we can be hopeful to soon be sure we've hit a hospital admissions peak, admissions to ICU [the intensive care unit] usually lag 48 hours behind that. ""So we're still very very worried that we're being pushed right up to the wire in terms of the resources we're able to deliver for patient care."" Dr Pearse added that there were three or four times more critical care beds in some hospitals than they would usually have. He said: ""I can remember a time when it would take years for an intensive care unit to negotiate one extra bed on a complement of 14 or 15 beds. ""We, within a few weeks, have massively increased the number of beds and finding the staff - most importantly of all - to deliver that has been a huge logistical exercise."" Reacting to the ventilation figures, Dr Charlotte Hopkins, deputy chief medical officer for Barts Health NHS trust in east London,said on Twitter,externalthere had been a ""fast-paced increase"" since 18 December, and that more than a third of the 4,076 ventilated patients were in London. It comes as some scientists said that signs a new Covid variant is more deadly than the earlier version should not be a ""game changer"" in the UK's response to the pandemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that there was ""some evidence"" the variant that emerged in the UK may be associated with ""a higher degree of mortality"". But Prof Graham Medley, the co-author of the study the PM was referring to, said the variant's deadliness remained an ""open"" question. Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of Sage subgroup the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), said he was ""surprised"" Mr Johnson had shared the findings when the data was ""not particularly strong"". Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said it was ""too early"" to be ""absolutely clear"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? ""There is some evidence, but it is very early evidence. It is small numbers of cases and it is far too early to say,"" she told the Today programme. Up to and including 22 January, 5,861,351 people have now had their first Covid jab and 468,617 have had their second dose. Senior doctors are calling on England's chief medical officer to cut the gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The British Medical Association told Prof Chris Whittyan extension to the maximum gap between jab from three weeks to 12 weeks, to get the first dose to more people, was ""difficult to justify"". The UK's four chief medical officers have previously defended the delay to the second jabin a letter to medical staff,external, saying: ""unvaccinated people are far more likely to end up severely ill, hospitalised [or] in some cases dying"".

New variants: What do we know?,"The rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus has been blamed for the introduction of strict tier four mixing rules for millions of people, harsher restrictions on mixing at Christmas in England, Scotland and Wales, and other countries placing the UK on a travel ban. So how has it gone from being non-existent to the most common form of the virus in parts of England in a matter of months? The government's advisers on new infections now say they have ""high"" confidence that it is more able to transmit than other variants. All the work is at an early stage, contains huge uncertainties and a long list of unanswered questions. As I've written before,viruses mutate all the time and it's vital to keep a laser focuson whether the virus' behaviour is changing. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London, which had only tier two restrictions until recently. But already the justification for tier four restrictions is in part to reduce the spread of the variant. ""Laboratory experiments are required, but do you want to wait weeks or months [to see the results and take action to limit the spread]? Probably not in these circumstances,"" Prof Nick Loman, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, told me. It was first detected in September. In November around a quarter of cases in London were the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. You can see how the variant has come to dominate the results of testing in some centres such as the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Laboratory. Allow Twitter content?

Mathematicians have been running the numbers on the spread of different variants in an attempt to calculate how much of an edge this one might have. But teasing apart what is due to people's behaviour and what is due to the virus is hard. The figure mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was that the variant may be up to 70% more transmissible. He said this may be increasing the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by 0.4. That 70% number appearedin a presentation by Dr Erik Volz, from Imperial College London,external, on Friday. During the talk he said: ""It is really too early to tellâ¦ but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than [a previous variant] ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this."" There is no ""nailed on"" figure for how much more infectious the variant may be. Scientists, whose work is not yet public, have told me figures both much higher and much lower than 70%. But there remain questions about whether it is any more infectious at all. ""The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. It is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations. The variant can be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off. Data from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one. Yes. The virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, is not the same one you will find in most corners of the world. TheD614G mutation emerged in Europe in February,externaland became the globally dominant form of the virus. Another, called A222V, spread across Europe andwas linked to people's summer holidays in Spain,external. An initial analysis of the new variant has been published andidentifies 17 potentially important alterations,external. There have been changes to the spike protein - this is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway to our body's cells. One mutation called N501Y alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"". This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. ""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman. The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion, in which a small part of the spike is removed - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink. Work by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge has suggested this mutation increases infectivity two-fold in lab experiments. Studies by the same group suggest the deletionmakes antibodies from the blood of survivors less effective at attacking the virus,external. Prof Gupta told me: ""It is rapidly increasing, that's what's worried government, we are worried, most scientists are worried."" The variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is the variant has emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. Instead their body became a breeding ground for the virus to mutate. There is no evidence to suggest that it does, although this will need to be monitored. However, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals. If the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would in turn lead to more people needing hospital treatment. Almost certainly yes, or at least for now. All three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up. Vaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work. ""But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying,"" said Prof Gupta. ""This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that."" Vaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people. This may be the most concerning element of what is happening with the virus. This variant is just the latest to show the virus is continuing to adapt as it infects more and more of us. A presentation by Prof David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow on Friday, concluded: ""The virus will probably be able to generate vaccine escape mutants,external."" That would put us in a position similar to flu, where the vaccines need to be regularly updated. Fortunately the vaccines we have are very easy to tweak.

Flood-hit villagers could be out of homes for days,"This video can not be played Teresa Dalling says a river of orange water rushed through the village on Thursday Flood victims will not be able to return to their homes until their safety can be assured, a council leader has said. The Coal Authority has said initial checks suggested water built up in a mine shaft causing a""blow out""that flooded properties in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot. About 80 people were evacuated as water rushed through the village on Thursday. Council leader Rob Jones said it was unlikely residents could return Monday. He said underground investigations would begin on Saturday and the work could take two to three days. ""Safety is the paramount concern for us,"" he said. ""Because we can't guarantee the site safety - that's the reason why people will remain away from their properties until such time as we can give the all clear. Is Wales' coalmining heritage behind flooding? Mine shaft 'blow out' may have flooded village Financial help offered to flood victims ""We don't know what the water has done underground."" The fire service said on Saturday morning the pumping operation was ""making good progress"". Mr Jones toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastpeople may be able to return next week but ""did not want to raise hopes"" it will be Monday. This video can not be played Parts of village underwater after flooding He said the flooding was ""more than likely"" related to old mine workings with six mines known about in area. He said the industry dated back 300 years. Skewen resident John Thomas returned home from a funeral with wife Lynne on Thursday to find their house had turned into ""a lake"".

""Other people who were evacuated had the chance to move things upstairs, I didn't have a chance to do that because I couldn't get in to it."" At least 80 people had to leave their homes in the village after flooding Local MP Stephen Kinnock said affected residents were staying in ""lots of different places"" across the region.

Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said officers were continuing to look at how to minimise the risk of pollution to nearby rivers, and investigating any impacts on the River Neath. The Coal Authority, which manages the effects of past coal mining, is investigating the incident. Chief executive Lisa Pinney said equipment, due on site on Saturday, would be used to drill into mine workings to ""fully investigate what has happened"". ""The blow out is likely to have been caused by a blockage underground which has caused water to back up and to break out using the easiest path,"" she said. ""The excessive rainfall of the past few days and the prolonged rainfall this winter, will have put additional pressure on the system. ""We know that people will want to get back to their homes and we will continue to progress these works as soon as possible, but public safety has to come first."" There are a number of historical mine workings in Skewen dating back beyond 1850. On Saturday, Mr Jones said water was still pouring out of the affected site so workers were diverting it, while machines cleared gulleys and drains to give the water the chance to enter drainage systems.

Health boss warns against vaccine queue jumping,"It is not clear if anyone not entitled succeeded in getting a Covid jab A health board boss has criticised council staff for potentially sharing Covid vaccine invites with colleagues. The board meeting in North Wales heard some council staff, not within groups currently being vaccinated, booked appointments by following a link in an email only intended for the recipient. Betsi Cadwaladr health board's chairman Mark Polin said such actions could deprive someone else of a jab. Denbighshire council said it had warned staff the emails were not to be abused. It is not clear if anyone not entitled succeeded in getting a Covid jab, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. Only front-line social care and health workers, those over 80 and 70 years old, care home residents and their carers are currently being vaccinated. Independent member Jackie Hughes spoke about the matter at Thursday's monthly health board meeting. Answering her query, Dr Chris Stockport, the health board's executive director of primary care and community services, said: ""We are very clear with our local authority partners and teams of what frontline means in the same way we are elsewhere. ""When you arrive [for a vaccine] there's a process of validation. ""The likelihood is they will experience some difficulties working through the booking system [if they try to get into a higher vaccination cohort]. ""It adds complications for a busy team and I would ask them not to do that when it's a clear effort to circumvent the cohort."" At Thursday's daily press briefing the UK Government Home Secretary Priti Patel said people who jumped the queue for the vaccinewere ""morally reprehensible"" as they were putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She said all the UK Government's measures were under review but ""our focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can protect them and obviously protect others in the community"". Mr Polin added: ""Whilst we understand the concerns people should not be doing what they are doing. ""The priority groups have been identified with clear medical guidance and sound reasoning behind it. ""So people jumping the queue are depriving someone else, potentially, of receiving the vaccine at the point at which they should."" He said it was a temporary problem, adding: ""We are changing the booking system, so this opportunity is not going to last much longer."" He said staff were looking out for any inappropriate bookings. Gap between Covid jabs 'unacceptable' When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

Six questions about the Cumbria coal controversy,"The government has been pressured into calling a public inquiry into a proposed new coal mine in Cumbria. The county council at first approved the colliery, and the government decided not to challenge the decision. After an outcry from environmentalists, the council decided to review its decision. But now ministers have taken over the process, following weeks of angry criticism from climate experts and campaigners. A firm applied for planning permission to dig for coking coal in Cumbria, and councillors approved the bid. They said the scheme did not contravene planning rules and would help diversify jobs. Why the battle for British coal matters to the world Coal mine go-ahead 'undermines climate summit' Government defends Cumbria coal mine green light John Kerry calls Trump 'reckless' over climate But coal is seen as the dirtiest of the fossil fuels driving up global temperatures. The British government heads a UN climate summit in November and has launched the Powering Past Coal alliance of nations to relinquish coal. Fiji is an alliance member - and its UN ambassador Satyendra Prasad told me opening a new mine sends the wrong signal. ""Investment in renewables in place of coal is the morally correct choice,"" he said. ""In the global climate struggle, words are extremely important. Deeds matter even more."" This was a thorny decision. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick could have overridden the council but, amid the turmoil of the January Covid lockdown, he put out a notice saying he would not block permission because it was a ""local"" issue. Environmentalists were furious, saying climate change was the ultimate global problem. Robert Jenrick chose not to overrule the local council The government later told me there were no grounds to block the application under planning law. A spokesperson said leaving the decision to the council aligned with the Tory principle of having decisions taken at the lowest possible tier of government. But then the council itself decided to review its approval of the mine, because councillors said they hadn't taken the climate change question into account in their discussions. Ultimately, the government decided it would review the issue itself, with a public debate over the issues involved. Yes. The mine lies in the Copeland constituency in a cluster of so-called ""red wall"" seats won by the Conservatives from Labour. Cumbria has low unemployment (2.8% from July 2019-June 2020 compared with 3.4% in Copeland and 3.8% nationally) but local MPs argued that well-paid manual jobs shouldn't be turned away. The Copeland MP Trudy Harrison is the prime minister's parliamentary aide and it's hard to conceive that she did not drop a word in his ear, although she wouldn't talk to me about that. They insist they're not. The key to the debate, they say, is that the mine will produce coking coal, which is needed for steel. The government is phasing out thermal coal for power stations by 2025 but has not announced any plans to phase out coking coal. The advisory Climate Change Committee says the UK must stop burning coking coal by 2035 in order to hit climate targets. I understand the committee fears that if the mine goes ahead its owners and workers will lobby to keep it running after that date. But the MPs fear that the technology to create steel using non-coal methods such as hydrogen won't be ready by 2035. Mark Jenkinson, Tory MP for nearby Workington, told me: ""It's better for the environment to dig coking coal from Workington than from Wyoming, because it saves on emissions from transport. We can't let other countries pick up the tab for emissions on our behalf."" Environmentalists have long called for a moratorium on new fossil fuels. When John Sauven, from Greenpeace, heard that approving the mine was considered a local decision he said: ""Let's hope China doesn't take the same view - or the world will be toast"". He's written to Boris Johnson saying: ""As host of the largest global climate talks since the signing of the Paris Agreement, it is mystifying that a new coal mine has been approved. ""This will make it much harder to fulfil the ambitions of the alliance to phase out coal. We call on you to reverse the decision"". Labour's Climate Change lead Matthew Pennycook agreed. ""This makes a mockery of the government's claim to be a climate leader, and won't provide the long-term job security Cumbrians deserve,"" he said. ""Decarbonised steel is the future and Ministers should be relentlessly focused on developing an active industrial strategy that will attract good, low-carbon jobs and investment to counties like Cumbria."" The Liberal Democrats and Greens agree. The government will hold a public inquiry to allow supporters of the mine and environmentalists to put their opposing cases. There's no timetable for the inquiry yet, but the government will be hoping that the controversy has been kicked into the long grass until at least after it hosts the UN climate summit in November. Environmentalists will doubtless accuse the government of failing to take a stand. The inquiry will examine evidence from the Climate Change Committee against the mine, and the counter-case from those who believe the mine is needed to support the UK steel industry. In effect, climate strategy and industrial strategy will both be on trial. In the meantime, pressure will increase on ministers to agree policies that will stimulate green jobs in West Cumbria, which has an unemployment rate just below the national average, but where jobs are heavily concentrated in the nuclear sector at Sellafield.

If you're just catching up, here are some of the main headlines from the day:  Today's Live Page was brought to you by Alice Cuddy, Julian Joyce, Lauren Turner and  Victoria Lindrea.    Earlier we told you about some of themore unusual vaccine centresacross the UK. Another is former St Albans nightclub Batchwood Hall, which closed in the first lockdown. It happens to have been the venue for the wedding of Wendy Lewis, 81, when it was a stately home, before being converted to an entertainment venue - and shereturned there for her Covid vaccine. Mrs Lewis, a grandmother of four, said: ""As I sat on a chair by the staircase, I looked up and I remembered that's where I threw my bouquet to my bridesmaids. It brought it all back. ""It was the first time I'd been back since 1962, for a friend's wedding reception, shortly after mine."" Her husband Jim died in 2012, after the couple were ""very happily married"" for 50 years, Mrs Lewis said.    Volunteers at a food bank in Midlothian say they have received Covid vaccinations - ahead of the majority of those over the age of 80. Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday that 34% of over-80s in Scotland had received their first dose. Mark Wells, manager of the Food Facts Friends food bank in Penicuick, said he and six volunteers had received jabs in the past week. NHS Lothian said it had not received detailed guidance on what counts as a priority health and social care worker. A spokesperson for the health board said health and social care workers who work with the very vulnerable were eligible for vaccination at this stage.

Today's figure, of 1,348 deaths, is more than were recorded last Saturday, when there were 1,295 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. If deaths continue at the same rate, the UK will reach the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths under that measure within the coming days. The figure of 33,552 new cases of coronavirus is down from a week ago, when there were 41,346 new positive tests.  There have been another 1,348 deaths recorded in the UK, of people who had had a positive Covid-19 test in the previous 28 days. It brings the total number of deaths, under that measure, to 97,329. And another 33,552 people have tested positive for the virus. It brings the total to 3,617,459. Up to and including 22 January, 5,861,351 people have now had their first Covid jab and 468,617 have had their second dose.   Doctors in France have advised people to avoid talking on busy public transport to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus. In a statement, Franceâs National Academy of Medicine said: âThe mandatory wearing of masks on public transport, where social distancing is not possible, should be accompanied by one very simple precaution: avoid talking and making phone calls.â Academy member Patrick Berche told local media that if there was lots of space it was not a problem, but if you were very close to the person next to you it made sense not to talk. ""It is not an obligation, it is a recommendation,"" he told BFM TV. Masks have been compulsory on public transport in France since May. Guests fled when police arrived at the Stamford Hill school An orthodox Rabbi in Cheshire has issued a strident attack on those who broke lockdown restrictions by holding a wedding ceremony in north London. Police broke up a wedding party of approximately 150 people in Stamford Hill,in the borough of Hackney, on Thursday night Writing on Facebook, Rabbi Dovid Lewis deemed the wedding ""a criminal act"" and claimed the wedding was not lawful. ""By making a wedding in these times, when it is against the law and puts so many people's lives at real risk, that invalidates the declaration,"" he wrote. ""A Jewish wedding is a three-way partnership between Chosson, Kallah and Hashem [Bridegroom, Bride and God]. Last night's debacle was nothing short of idolatrous. ""They have in essence transgressed the 3 cardinal sins of Idolatry, Adultery and Murder. ""That my dear friends, is my view on this most sad news."" Ireland may have to slow its mass rollout of coronavirus jabs because of issues with the supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has warned. AstraZeneca has told the EU thata production problem means that the number of initial doses available would be lower than expected. In an interview with Irish broadcaster RTÃ, MicheÃ¡l Martin said AstraZeneca âwas going to be the catalyst to be allowed to move from low level to mass vaccinationâ. He added that delivery delays would ""put us in a problem"". He said the length of the delay would be dependent on ongoing discussions between the EU and Oxford University/AstraZeneca, and that some ""very robust meetings"" would be taking place in the coming days. By Sunday, he said, ""most of the long-term care residents"" and ""about half of front-line healthcare workers"" in the Republic of Ireland would be vaccinated. Martin also told RTÃ that he expects Covid-19 restrictions to remain in place in the Republic for the first six months of 2020.

The former coordinator of Donald Trumpâs White House coronavirus task force has said she âalwaysâ considered quitting. In an interview with CBSâs Face The Nation,,externalDr Deborah Birx said the role affected peopleâs perceptions of her. ""I mean, why would you want to put yourself through that every day?â she said. âColleagues of mine that I had known for decades...in that one experience, because I was in the White House, decided that I had become this political person, even though they had known me forever.â She said she had to ask herself every morning and night: âIs there something that I think I can do that would be helpful in responding to this pandemic?"" Birx faced criticism last year for attending a family get-together over Thanksgiving, despite urging Americans to to restrict gatherings to ""your immediate household"". She announced in December thatshe would retire following the incident.

Fr Brian Fitzpatrick was called to give last rites to a patient in Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh and when he got there, found four people gathered around the man's bed. Because they were wearing full PPE, he didn't know who they were and assumed it was the man's family as one of them was in tears. The others were holding the patient's hand and wiping his brow, while one of the group quietly recited a prayer. He then realised the names and job titles of the four people were written on their protective equipment and that it was a group of doctors and nurses. Fr Fitzpatrick said: These are our frontline staff; they are giving everything in service for us and our family members and I will never forget that touching sight and beautiful experience as long as I live."" Peaky Blinders, the Birmingham-set BBC series, is filmed in part at the Black Country Living Museum With millions of people throughout the UK now receiving their vaccinations, space for the procedure can be at a premium. That's why cathedrals, mosques, museums and vehicle showrooms have been pressed into service as some of the more unusual vaccination centres. In the Midlands, the Black Country Living Museum,which doubles as a set for hit TV show Peaky Blinders, becomes Dudley's first vaccination centre on Monday. It will be joined byBlackpool's famous Winter Gardensand a motorcycle dealership in Crewe. The Crewe Honda Centre usually stocks about 100 motorcycles, but will now be a community vaccination centre, after owner Roger Morris got together with his best friend, pharmacist Raj Patel. ""It's a great way that two businesses from totally different backgrounds can come together and help the local community,"" said Mr Morris, who declined any rent for the space. On Friday,a mosque in Birmingham became the first in the UK to open as a vaccination hub. The Al-Abbas Islamic Centre in Balsall Heath is expected to vaccinate up to 500 people a day. The imam, Sheikh Nuru Mohammed said opening the mosque as a venue would ""send a strong message to our Muslim brothers and sisters"". ""We are doing this to say a big 'no' to fake news and a big 'yes' to the vaccine,"" said Sheikh Nuru. Blackburn and Salisbury cathedrals are among the church buildings to have opened as vaccine stationsin the past week. The Dean of Blackburn, Rev Peter Howell-Jones said using the building for such a public service showed the ""welcome and hospitality at the heart of Christianity"". A total of 5,526,071 Covid-19 vaccinations took place in England between December 8 and January 22, according to provisional NHS England data. This includes first and second doses and is a rise of 425,596 on Friday's figures. Of this number, 5,085,771 were the first dose of the vaccine, while 440,300 were the second dose. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris In 2002 Julienne created a motor stunt show that ran for many years at Disney theme parks in Paris and Florida. RÃ©my Julienne, one of the world's best-known stuntmen, has died in France with coronavirus, aged 90. Over a 50-year career, Julienne devised the crashes, crunches and collisions witnessed in more than 1,400 films. He also starred in many of them, albeit anonymously. The legendarycascadeur (stunt performer) appeared as a body double for a host of stars, including Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Charles Bronson and Jean-Paul Belmondo. In wig and appropriate clothing, he also took on the form of Sophia Loren, Carole Bouquet and Gina Lollobrigida. Among his most famous works are the chase scenes in 1969's The Italian Job, in which a fleet of Mini-Coopers in Turin cross a river, dive into the metro and jump from the roof of the Fiat factory. He also worked on six Bond films, notably going behind the wheel of a battered yellow CitroÃ«n 2CV in For Your Eyes Only. A life-long lover of motorbikes and anything driven at speed, Julienne specialised in spectacular destruction. But he was committed to the maximum elimination of risk and calculated his stunts with extreme precision. ""What is beautiful about the job is that you can never be 100% certain,"" he said.

"Larry King, veteran talk show host, dies aged 87The legendary US chat show host had been in hospital after being diagnosed with Covid.","Larry King achieved worldwide fame with his popular CNN talk show Larry King, giant of US broadcasting who achieved worldwide fame for interviewing political leaders and celebrities, has died at the age of 87. King conducted an estimated 50,000 interviews in his six-decade career, which included 25 years as host of the popular CNN talk show Larry King Live. He died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to Ora Media, a production company he co-founded. Earlier this month, he was treated in hospital for Covid-19, US media say. The talk show host, famous for his braces and rolled-up sleeves, had faced several health problems in recent years, including heart attacks. Larry King: US TV legend who hosted 50,000 interviews King was married eight times to seven women and had five children. Two of them died last year within weeks of each other - daughter Chaia died from lung cancer and son Andy of a heart attack. King carried out interviews with every sitting US president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama and a number of world leaders. His other high-profile guests included Dr Martin Luther King, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and Lady Gaga. ""For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,"" Ora Media said in a statement, without giving the cause of death. This video can not be played Larry King: ""I like spontaneity. That's the kind of broadcaster I am"". Born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn, New York, in 1933, King rose to fame in the 1970s with his radio programme The Larry King Show, on the commercial network Mutual Broadcasting System. In 1985 he launched Larry King Live on the fledgling CNN, and became one of the network's biggest stars. The programme, broadcast around the world, was a success with audiences, with King answering thousands of phone calls from viewers. He earned a number of honours, including two Peabody awards, but was also criticised for his non-confrontational approach and open-ended questions. King boasted of not doing much research for the interviews so, he said, he could learn along with viewers. By 2010 his ratings had dropped significantly, with critics saying King's approach felt outdated in an era of more aggressive interviewing styles. King then announced his retirement, saying: ""It's time to hang up my nightly suspenders."" In his final programme on CNN, he told his viewers: ""I don't know what to say, except to you, my audience, thank you. Instead of goodbye, how about so long?"" Allow Twitter content?

How to avoid lockdown back and shoulder pain,"Millions of people are less physically active than they were before Covid-19. For those working from home, the morning walk to the bus stop has gone. Days on end can be spent hunched over a laptop without ever leaving the house. For some, that's taking a painful toll. Asurvey,externalof people working remotely, by Opinium for the charity Versus Arthritis, found 81% of respondents were experiencing some back, neck or shoulder pain. Almost half (48%) said they were less physically active than before the lockdown.  Anotherstudy,externalby the Institute for Employment Studies found 35% reporting new back pain while working from home. Physiotherapists and other back pain experts say those with serious or persistent problems should seek professional help, but there are things that many of us can do to help ourselves. Pretty much all the experts agree that one of the best things you can do is get moving. Don't sit in the same position for long periods. ""Make sure you take any opportunity you can to move your body,"" says Ashley James of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists (CSP). ""It doesn't need to be about exercise as such,"" he says.  ""It's about building movement into your day."" He calls it taking ""regular movement snacks"". That could be taking phone calls or joining online meetings standing up, just having a stretch or walking up and down the stairs when you don't really need to, he says.  When you're moving, different muscle groups share the work of keeping your head, neck, back and the rest of your body supported, rather than continually overloading the same muscles. Where lockdowns have restricted outside exercise to once a day, Mr James's advice is to use that daily opportunity for at least a good walk whenever you can. Movement can help with breathing by opening up your chest, and reducing muscle atrophy. It increases blood flow and lubricates synovial joints - joints that allow free movement - like hips and shoulders. Creating a new routine to help keep you moving can be difficult, so experts suggest setting a timer on your phone or laptop to remind you to move. It's a good way to avoid getting stuck in the same position hour after hour, says neck specialist Chris Worsfold. ""We've evolved to move,"" he says. ""We naturally want to move after about 20 or 30 minutes, so that's when you need to go and shake it about."" If you're sitting when it goes off, stand up. If you're standing, have a stretch or walk up and down the stairs. ""The key is to create a routine that works for you,"" says Leanne Antoine, who treats patients in Hertfordshire.  ""There's no point in creating a schedule that makes you feel like a failure when you don't keep to it."" So ask yourself honestly what you would be prepared to do, and stick to it. Be careful, but as long as it gets you out of the chair, stretching, walking or Zumba dancing in your living room, it doesn't matter, she says. ""You don't need the perfect set up with a thousand pound chair, but if you're scrunched up on the sofa, it's not going to be good for your back,"" says Chris Martey. Your workspace is worth some serious thought, but companies have a big interest in selling expensive equipment, so he says beware of unnecessary costs. Leanne Antoine agrees: ""Just make small tweaks that don't cost the earth."" That could be as simple as using a cushion to raise you up on your chair, or to support your lower back. An inexpensive adjustable office chair can help. A mount for your laptop will raise your screen to eye level so that you're not always looking down, particularly on long online video calls. An external keyboard is also useful. ""Talk to your employer,"" says Ms Antoine. Many will supply equipment to staff. If you have to use a sofa, at least make sure your feet are firmly on the floor and you're sitting back with a cushion to support your lower back. Standing desks can be helpful, says Chris Martey. But you need to alternate between standing and sitting - and take regular screen breaks. If you don't have a standing desk,some experts,externalrecommend standing with your laptop on an ironing board for short periods. We're in a ""perfect storm"" for back trouble - according to Ashley James, with Covid-19 restricting physical activity while simultaneously ramping up anxieties about health, job insecurity, children's education and more. It's impossible to quantify but a lot of back pain is driven by anxiety, he says.  In the jargon, back problems are ""biopsychosocial"". It doesn't help that we're now in winter - when many people experience a dip in mood. People de-stress in all sorts of ways of course.  Pilates and yoga are helpful for some. One of the best ways is to work on getting better sleep, says Mr James. ""Sleep hygiene"" is the key. That means cutting down on caffeine in the afternoon and evening, keeping to a consistent night time routine and trying to wake up at the same time every day. TheNHS advises,externalagainst using electronic devices for an hour or so before you go to bed, as the light from the screen may make it more difficult for you to sleep. Light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone which helps to make you sleepy. Many studies have suggested thatblue light,externaldoes this most powerfully, butsome research,externalsuggests the warmer colours used in ""night mode"" on many devices may actually have a bigger impact. The CSP has designed some simple stretches which, if done regularly, can help ward off aches and pains. They're for people who are working remotely and find themselves sitting for long periods. How to exercise at your desk (Chartered Society of Physiotherapy),external NHS advice on back pain treatment,external The chest stretch, the leg stretch, the sit stretch and the wall press, are designed to help different muscle groups. The CSP says there is no ""perfect posture"" and that the priority is to keep moving. There's a positive message here, says Chris Martey. For millions of people suffering everyday aches and pains he says: ""You can take control. You can self-manage. You don't have to be dependent."" Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.

Detentions and warnings over Navalny protests,"Police warned that unsanctioned protests would be ""immediately suppressed"" Russian police have detained close aides of the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny, as a string of nationwide protests gets under way. Police have broken up demonstrations in the eastern Khabarovsk region, amid stern warnings for people to stay home. Mr Navalny's supporters flooded social media with calls to rally at protests expected in dozens of cities later. He is Russian leader Vladimir Putin's most high-profile critic. He was arrested last Sunday after he flew back to Moscow from Berlin, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Russia last August. On his return, he was immediately taken into custody and found guilty of violating parole conditions. He says it is a trumped-up case designed to silence him. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities More than 60m people have watched his new video about President Vladimir Putin's alleged luxury Black Sea palace. The Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Among those detained in Moscow on Thursday were his spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, and one of his lawyers, Lyubov Sobol. They face fines or short jail terms. Ms Sobol, who has a young child, was later released. But Ms Yarmysh has now been jailed for nine days. Prominent Navalny activists are also being held in the cities of Vladivostok, Novosibirsk and Krasnodar. Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh is accused of violating protest laws Unauthorised rallies are being planned in more than 60 cities across Russia for Saturday. Moscow police say any unauthorised demonstrations and provocations will be ""immediately suppressed"". A thousand people were reported to have come onto the streets in the Khabarovsk region, with some of them already detained. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia, who travelled back to Russia with him from Germany, said she would demonstrate in Moscow ""for myself, for him, for our children, for the values and the ideals that we share"". Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) has drawn millions of followers on social media, through slickly produced videos alleging large-scale official corruption. He has long denounced Mr Putin's administration as ""feudal"" and full of ""crooks and thieves"". For a long time the Russian authorities made out that Alexei Navalny was irrelevant. Just a blogger. With a tiny following. No threat whatsoever. Recent events suggest the opposite. First Mr Navalny was targeted with a nerve agent, allegedly by a secret group of FSB state security hitmen. Instead of investigating the poisoning, Russia is investigating him: on his return from Germany the Kremlin critic was arrested. Having put Mr Navalny behind bars, the authorities are putting pressure on his supporters. The Kremlin's greatest fear is of a Ukraine-style revolution in Russia that would sweep away those in power. There's no indication that such a scenario is imminent. But with economic problems growing, the Kremlin will worry that Mr Navalny could act as a lightning rod for protest sentiment. That explains the police crackdown on Navalny allies ahead of Saturday's potential protests. Plus, this is getting personal. Mr Navalny's video about ""Putin's Palace"" on the Black Sea was designed to cause maximum embarrassment to the Russian president. In the""Putin's palace"" video,externalMr Navalny alleges that rich businessmen close to Mr Putin paid for a sumptuous 17,691sq m (190,424sq ft) palace for him at Gelendzhik, by the Black Sea. It is alleged to have a casino, a theatre and many other comforts, including a vineyard and tea house in the sprawling grounds. The Kremlin dismissed the YouTube video as a ""pseudo-investigation"" aimed at earning money for Mr Navalny. Prosecutors have warned people against protesting in support of Mr Navalny on Saturday. Russia's education ministry has told parents not to allow their children to attend. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Some Russian celebrities in the arts and sports have pledged support for Mr Navalny. They include ice hockey star Artemi Panarin. Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov - now a leading anti-Putin activist based in the US - tweeted that pro-Navalny posts were being widely blocked in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

In a phone call to President Putin on Friday, EU Council President Charles Michel voiced ""grave concern"" about the jailing of Mr Navalny. Mr Michel said the EU was ""united in its call on Russia to swiftly release Mr Navalny and proceed with the investigation into the assassination attempt on him, in full transparency and without further delay"". In October, the EU imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre over the Novichok poisoning of Mr Navalny. The Kremlin retaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions, denying any role in the attack and rejecting the expert finding that the Russian nerve agent had been used. The Black Sea palace allegedly features a casino, an ice rink and a vineyard The social media app TikTok has a flood of videos from Russians promoting the protests planned for Saturday. The messages about Mr Navalny have been going viral for several days. A well-known Russian TikTok user, Slava Varfolomeyev, told BBC Russian: ""I go on TikTok and find that every third video is about 'Putin's palace', the detention of Navalny and the 23 January rally!"" He said that on Thursday ""this swelled to a maximum: practically seven out of every 10 videos were on that topic [Navalny]"". TikTok's popularity is based on short-form videos. On Wednesday Russia's official media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that TikTok take down any information ""encouraging minors to act illegally"", threatening large fines.

"Two new railway lines get Â£794m boostThe government says the funding will connect ""left-behind"" communities.Business","A rejuvenated Northumberland Line will help connect local communities to Newcastle city centre, say supporters Two railway lines, closed to passengers since the 1960s, are to get almost Â£800m funding from the government. East West Rail, which will eventually connect Oxford and Cambridge, will get Â£760m to open new parts of the line. The Northumberland Line, which still carries freight, will get Â£34m for initial work aimed at reintroducing passenger services. Reopening closed lines like these would help connect ""left-behind"" communities, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. ""Restoring railways helps put communities back on the map and this investment forms part of our nationwide effort to build back vital connections and unlock access to jobs, education and housing,"" he said. These investments would return these routes ""to their former glory"" and was part of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda, Mr Shapps added. Diesel engines will initially run on the lines, but Mr Shapps said he hoped more environmentally friendly trains, for example powered by hydrogen or new battery technology, would replace them in the future. When asked by the BBC why the lines wouldn't be electrified, he said these lines might potentially bypass the overhead wire technology altogether. ""We're building it in such a way that we can use, probably, the very latest technology, potentially, in the future,"" he said. ""The most important thing is the infrastructure,"" he said. ""It's about building the stations, things you need to do no matter what kind of train you're going to run on there, if it's going to take passengers."" But Labour MP Daniel Zeichner, who represents Cambridge, said: ""Every rail expert will tell you it will cost more later to electrify a line."" ""In a time of climate emergency, we really shouldn't be building railway lines for diesel, it's got to be electric."" The line connecting Oxford and Cambridge would serve new housing developments, he said, and rail was ""the right way to get people in and out of a city like Cambridge"". ""It's very important for the UK economy, but it's got to be done in an environmentally sustainable way,"" he said. ""It seems crazy to be building new railways which aren't electrified in the first place, and I really hope the government will reconsider.""

The project is being delivered by a publicly-owned body called the East West Company. The first phase of East West Rail, which was completed in 2016, connected Oxford and Bicester. But at the moment, rail passengers wishing to go from Oxford to Bletchley have to take a detour via Coventry. The aim is to get trains running between Oxford and Bletchley by 2025, with new stations at Winslow and Bletchley. The Department for Transport said the works will create 1,500 jobs, and have a wider economic benefit for the area. The eventual aim of the project, which the government expects to be completed by the end of the decade, is to connect Oxford and Cambridge by rail via Bedford, taking in Milton Keynes and Aylesbury on branches. The Northumberland Line was closed to passengers in 1964 as part of a rationalisation of the railway network known as the Beeching cuts. Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the Northumberland Line was ""a really critical piece of local infrastructure"" that would help bring people in south east Northumberland and north Tyneside closer to Newcastle city centre, and closer to well-paid jobs. Passengers would be able to take the train between Ashington and Newcastle ""Having better connectivity will help attract businesses to that area, and it will help to deliver genuine levelling-up,"" he said. The new Â£34m investment, which aims to reopen the line between Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Ashington, will include funds for preparatory works and land acquisition. There are plans for new stations at at Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth, Bebside, Newsham, Seaton Delaval, and Northumberland Park, in North Tyneside, as well as upgrades to the track and changes to level crossings where new bridges or underpasses were needed, the Department for Transport said.

How to avoid lockdown back and shoulder painTips on how to reduce back pain through the Covid-19 lockdown and beyond.,"Millions of people are less physically active than they were before Covid-19. For those working from home, the morning walk to the bus stop has gone. Days on end can be spent hunched over a laptop without ever leaving the house. For some, that's taking a painful toll. Asurvey,externalof people working remotely, by Opinium for the charity Versus Arthritis, found 81% of respondents were experiencing some back, neck or shoulder pain. Almost half (48%) said they were less physically active than before the lockdown.  Anotherstudy,externalby the Institute for Employment Studies found 35% reporting new back pain while working from home. Physiotherapists and other back pain experts say those with serious or persistent problems should seek professional help, but there are things that many of us can do to help ourselves. Pretty much all the experts agree that one of the best things you can do is get moving. Don't sit in the same position for long periods. ""Make sure you take any opportunity you can to move your body,"" says Ashley James of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists (CSP). ""It doesn't need to be about exercise as such,"" he says.  ""It's about building movement into your day."" He calls it taking ""regular movement snacks"". That could be taking phone calls or joining online meetings standing up, just having a stretch or walking up and down the stairs when you don't really need to, he says.  When you're moving, different muscle groups share the work of keeping your head, neck, back and the rest of your body supported, rather than continually overloading the same muscles. Where lockdowns have restricted outside exercise to once a day, Mr James's advice is to use that daily opportunity for at least a good walk whenever you can. Movement can help with breathing by opening up your chest, and reducing muscle atrophy. It increases blood flow and lubricates synovial joints - joints that allow free movement - like hips and shoulders. Creating a new routine to help keep you moving can be difficult, so experts suggest setting a timer on your phone or laptop to remind you to move. It's a good way to avoid getting stuck in the same position hour after hour, says neck specialist Chris Worsfold. ""We've evolved to move,"" he says. ""We naturally want to move after about 20 or 30 minutes, so that's when you need to go and shake it about."" If you're sitting when it goes off, stand up. If you're standing, have a stretch or walk up and down the stairs. ""The key is to create a routine that works for you,"" says Leanne Antoine, who treats patients in Hertfordshire.  ""There's no point in creating a schedule that makes you feel like a failure when you don't keep to it."" So ask yourself honestly what you would be prepared to do, and stick to it. Be careful, but as long as it gets you out of the chair, stretching, walking or Zumba dancing in your living room, it doesn't matter, she says. ""You don't need the perfect set up with a thousand pound chair, but if you're scrunched up on the sofa, it's not going to be good for your back,"" says Chris Martey. Your workspace is worth some serious thought, but companies have a big interest in selling expensive equipment, so he says beware of unnecessary costs. Leanne Antoine agrees: ""Just make small tweaks that don't cost the earth."" That could be as simple as using a cushion to raise you up on your chair, or to support your lower back. An inexpensive adjustable office chair can help. A mount for your laptop will raise your screen to eye level so that you're not always looking down, particularly on long online video calls. An external keyboard is also useful. ""Talk to your employer,"" says Ms Antoine. Many will supply equipment to staff. If you have to use a sofa, at least make sure your feet are firmly on the floor and you're sitting back with a cushion to support your lower back. Standing desks can be helpful, says Chris Martey. But you need to alternate between standing and sitting - and take regular screen breaks. If you don't have a standing desk,some experts,externalrecommend standing with your laptop on an ironing board for short periods. We're in a ""perfect storm"" for back trouble - according to Ashley James, with Covid-19 restricting physical activity while simultaneously ramping up anxieties about health, job insecurity, children's education and more. It's impossible to quantify but a lot of back pain is driven by anxiety, he says.  In the jargon, back problems are ""biopsychosocial"". It doesn't help that we're now in winter - when many people experience a dip in mood. People de-stress in all sorts of ways of course.  Pilates and yoga are helpful for some. One of the best ways is to work on getting better sleep, says Mr James. ""Sleep hygiene"" is the key. That means cutting down on caffeine in the afternoon and evening, keeping to a consistent night time routine and trying to wake up at the same time every day. TheNHS advises,externalagainst using electronic devices for an hour or so before you go to bed, as the light from the screen may make it more difficult for you to sleep. Light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone which helps to make you sleepy. Many studies have suggested thatblue light,externaldoes this most powerfully, butsome research,externalsuggests the warmer colours used in ""night mode"" on many devices may actually have a bigger impact. The CSP has designed some simple stretches which, if done regularly, can help ward off aches and pains. They're for people who are working remotely and find themselves sitting for long periods. How to exercise at your desk (Chartered Society of Physiotherapy),external NHS advice on back pain treatment,external The chest stretch, the leg stretch, the sit stretch and the wall press, are designed to help different muscle groups. The CSP says there is no ""perfect posture"" and that the priority is to keep moving. There's a positive message here, says Chris Martey. For millions of people suffering everyday aches and pains he says: ""You can take control. You can self-manage. You don't have to be dependent."" Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.

Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denialIn the city where the virus first emerged there is now an insistence that it came from elsewhere.China,"An exhibition now celebrates Wuhan's success in controlling the outbreak Wuhan has long since recovered from the world's first outbreak of Covid-19. It is now being remembered not as a disaster but as a victory, and with an insistence that the virus came from somewhere - anywhere - but here. From the moment a new, pandemic coronavirus emerged in the same city as a laboratory dedicated to the study of new coronaviruses with pandemic potential, Prof Shi Zhengli has found herself the focus of one of the biggest scientific controversies of our time. For much of the past year she has met the suggestion that Sars-Cov-2 might have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology with angry denial. The Wuhan Institute of Virology Now though, she has offered her own thoughts on how the initial outbreak may have begun in the city. In an article in this month's edition of Science Magazine she referred to a number of studies that, she said,suggest the virus existed outside of China,externalbefore Wuhan's first known case in December 2019. ""Given the finding of Sars-Cov-2 on the surface of imported food packages, contact with contaminated uncooked food could be an important source of Sars-Cov-2 transmission,"" she wrote. From one of the world's leading experts on coronaviruses, even the discussion of such a possibility seems unusual. Could a spiralling outbreak of infection that almost destroyed Wuhan's health system, sparked the world's first Covid lockdown and spawned a global catastrophe really have arrived on imported food without any signs of similarly devastating outbreaks elsewhere? ""The virus came from America,"" this fishmonger told the BBC But with the virus vanquished, the idea that it is a foreign import is repeated with almost unanimity across this city of 11 million people. ""It came here from other countries,"" one woman running a hotpot stall in a busy street tells me. ""China is a victim."" ""Where did it come from?"" the next-door fishmonger repeats my question aloud, and then answers: ""It came from America."" On 23 January last year, the Chinese authorities severed transport links out of Wuhan and confined the city's population to their homes. The tough lockdown coincided with the annual spring festival celebrations and came too late to prevent the global spread of the disease - five million people had already left the city ahead of the holiday. One year on from the world's first lockdown in Wuhan What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? Doctors' warnings had gone unheeded,externaland, in an outpouring of anger on the Chinese internet, the authorities stood accused of covering up the initial outbreak in the interests of political stability. One year on, there's little sign of that anger in Wuhan today. In fact it's the humdrum normality that is striking - the traffic jams, the bustling markets and busy restaurants. Wuhan's streets are bustling again Its success in eventually bringing the virus under control is now being celebrated in a giant exhibition hall, complete with models of medical workers in hazmat suits, installations of hospital beds and - everywhere you look - giant portraits of President Xi Jinping. The accompanying texts mention his ""all-out war"" against the pandemic, his ""resolute decision making"" and how he has been willing to share ""China's solutions"" with the world. Wuhan's exhibition features giant portraits of Xi Jinping There can be no doubting the success of China's mass testing programmes, its tracing apps and the widespread mask wearing. But its strict enforcement of lockdowns, withlittle hand-wringing over the impact on individual rights,external, may be far less easy for democratic countries to emulate. ""The strategic success achieved in this battle fully manifested the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the significant advantages of the socialist system of our country,"" the exhibition proclaims. Despite China's promise of international co-operation, the world is still no closer to an answer to the biggest question of them all - where did the virus come from? Many prominent scientists believe that - based on past outbreaks - the most likely source of the coronavirus is a natural one, a ""zoonotic"" leap from bats - known to harbour such viruses - to humans, possibly via an intermediate species. But China has produced very little evidence to show the work that's been done in its search for the source, in particular the testing of historic human samples stored by hospitals to determine where and when the virus really started spreading. Bats, roadblocks and the origins of coronavirus Wuhan - City of silence Those scientists who argue that the possibility of an accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology should also be included as part of any investigation are curious about this apparent silence. ""I find it very unlikely that such investigations would not have already occurred,"" Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, told me. ""It's a serious risk to resume life as usual without knowing where a dangerous human pathogen came from."" Wuhan's exhibition also has a display of hospital beds Instead of publishing its own evidence though, China appears to be taking an anywhere-but-Wuhan approach, with state media cheerleading the idea that the virus may havearrived in Wuhan on frozen food imports,externalor talking cryptically of ""multiple origins,external"". At a recent daily press briefing, I asked China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, why such narratives were being promoted in the absence of real scientific evidence. ""Your question reveals your prejudice against China,"" she replied. ""Reports have emerged from Australia, Italy and many other countries that the coronavirus was found in multiple places in the autumn of 2019."" ""Aren't these all facts?"" she asked. Not according to Alina Chan, who told me that such studies ""lack validation"" and some have been conducted without ""the most basic controls"". ""They do not present persuasive scientific evidence that the virus was circulating outside of China before the late 2019 outbreak in Wuhan,"" she said. ""The earliest detected cases and outbreak were in Wuhan. Early cases outside of China were found to have travelled from Wuhan. The most similar viruses have been found inside China."" This video can not be played The BBC's Robin Brant visits the Wuhan market where Covid-19 was first traced Interestingly, scientists who have found themselves disagreeing strongly about the likelihood of the lab-leak theory, suddenly find themselves very much aligned on whether the virus came from abroad. ""I do not find the data linking Sars-Cov-2 to frozen foods to be credible,"" Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in the US, told me. As someone who is afirm supporter of China's insistence,externalthat the virus could not have escaped from a lab, he gives its latest position much shorter shrift.

Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial,"An exhibition now celebrates Wuhan's success in controlling the outbreak Wuhan has long since recovered from the world's first outbreak of Covid-19. It is now being remembered not as a disaster but as a victory, and with an insistence that the virus came from somewhere - anywhere - but here. From the moment a new, pandemic coronavirus emerged in the same city as a laboratory dedicated to the study of new coronaviruses with pandemic potential, Prof Shi Zhengli has found herself the focus of one of the biggest scientific controversies of our time. For much of the past year she has met the suggestion that Sars-Cov-2 might have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology with angry denial. The Wuhan Institute of Virology Now though, she has offered her own thoughts on how the initial outbreak may have begun in the city. In an article in this month's edition of Science Magazine she referred to a number of studies that, she said,suggest the virus existed outside of China,externalbefore Wuhan's first known case in December 2019. ""Given the finding of Sars-Cov-2 on the surface of imported food packages, contact with contaminated uncooked food could be an important source of Sars-Cov-2 transmission,"" she wrote. From one of the world's leading experts on coronaviruses, even the discussion of such a possibility seems unusual. Could a spiralling outbreak of infection that almost destroyed Wuhan's health system, sparked the world's first Covid lockdown and spawned a global catastrophe really have arrived on imported food without any signs of similarly devastating outbreaks elsewhere? ""The virus came from America,"" this fishmonger told the BBC But with the virus vanquished, the idea that it is a foreign import is repeated with almost unanimity across this city of 11 million people. ""It came here from other countries,"" one woman running a hotpot stall in a busy street tells me. ""China is a victim."" ""Where did it come from?"" the next-door fishmonger repeats my question aloud, and then answers: ""It came from America."" On 23 January last year, the Chinese authorities severed transport links out of Wuhan and confined the city's population to their homes. The tough lockdown coincided with the annual spring festival celebrations and came too late to prevent the global spread of the disease - five million people had already left the city ahead of the holiday. One year on from the world's first lockdown in Wuhan What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? Doctors' warnings had gone unheeded,externaland, in an outpouring of anger on the Chinese internet, the authorities stood accused of covering up the initial outbreak in the interests of political stability. One year on, there's little sign of that anger in Wuhan today. In fact it's the humdrum normality that is striking - the traffic jams, the bustling markets and busy restaurants. Wuhan's streets are bustling again Its success in eventually bringing the virus under control is now being celebrated in a giant exhibition hall, complete with models of medical workers in hazmat suits, installations of hospital beds and - everywhere you look - giant portraits of President Xi Jinping. The accompanying texts mention his ""all-out war"" against the pandemic, his ""resolute decision making"" and how he has been willing to share ""China's solutions"" with the world. Wuhan's exhibition features giant portraits of Xi Jinping There can be no doubting the success of China's mass testing programmes, its tracing apps and the widespread mask wearing. But its strict enforcement of lockdowns, withlittle hand-wringing over the impact on individual rights,external, may be far less easy for democratic countries to emulate. ""The strategic success achieved in this battle fully manifested the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the significant advantages of the socialist system of our country,"" the exhibition proclaims. Despite China's promise of international co-operation, the world is still no closer to an answer to the biggest question of them all - where did the virus come from? Many prominent scientists believe that - based on past outbreaks - the most likely source of the coronavirus is a natural one, a ""zoonotic"" leap from bats - known to harbour such viruses - to humans, possibly via an intermediate species. But China has produced very little evidence to show the work that's been done in its search for the source, in particular the testing of historic human samples stored by hospitals to determine where and when the virus really started spreading. Bats, roadblocks and the origins of coronavirus Wuhan - City of silence Those scientists who argue that the possibility of an accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology should also be included as part of any investigation are curious about this apparent silence. ""I find it very unlikely that such investigations would not have already occurred,"" Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, told me. ""It's a serious risk to resume life as usual without knowing where a dangerous human pathogen came from."" Wuhan's exhibition also has a display of hospital beds Instead of publishing its own evidence though, China appears to be taking an anywhere-but-Wuhan approach, with state media cheerleading the idea that the virus may havearrived in Wuhan on frozen food imports,externalor talking cryptically of ""multiple origins,external"". At a recent daily press briefing, I asked China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, why such narratives were being promoted in the absence of real scientific evidence. ""Your question reveals your prejudice against China,"" she replied. ""Reports have emerged from Australia, Italy and many other countries that the coronavirus was found in multiple places in the autumn of 2019."" ""Aren't these all facts?"" she asked. Not according to Alina Chan, who told me that such studies ""lack validation"" and some have been conducted without ""the most basic controls"". ""They do not present persuasive scientific evidence that the virus was circulating outside of China before the late 2019 outbreak in Wuhan,"" she said. ""The earliest detected cases and outbreak were in Wuhan. Early cases outside of China were found to have travelled from Wuhan. The most similar viruses have been found inside China."" This video can not be played The BBC's Robin Brant visits the Wuhan market where Covid-19 was first traced Interestingly, scientists who have found themselves disagreeing strongly about the likelihood of the lab-leak theory, suddenly find themselves very much aligned on whether the virus came from abroad. ""I do not find the data linking Sars-Cov-2 to frozen foods to be credible,"" Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in the US, told me. As someone who is afirm supporter of China's insistence,externalthat the virus could not have escaped from a lab, he gives its latest position much shorter shrift. ""All the available evidence points to an emergence of the virus somewhere in China in late 2019,"" he said. Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli, seen here inside the laboratory in Wuhan Prof Shi Zhengli recently told the BBC in an exchange of emails thatshe'd welcome ""any form of visit""by an inquiry team to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to rule out the possibility of a lab leak.

Two new railway lines get Â£794m boost,"A rejuvenated Northumberland Line will help connect local communities to Newcastle city centre, say supporters Two railway lines, closed to passengers since the 1960s, are to get almost Â£800m funding from the government. East West Rail, which will eventually connect Oxford and Cambridge, will get Â£760m to open new parts of the line. The Northumberland Line, which still carries freight, will get Â£34m for initial work aimed at reintroducing passenger services. Reopening closed lines like these would help connect ""left-behind"" communities, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. ""Restoring railways helps put communities back on the map and this investment forms part of our nationwide effort to build back vital connections and unlock access to jobs, education and housing,"" he said. These investments would return these routes ""to their former glory"" and was part of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda, Mr Shapps added. Diesel engines will initially run on the lines, but Mr Shapps said he hoped more environmentally friendly trains, for example powered by hydrogen or new battery technology, would replace them in the future. When asked by the BBC why the lines wouldn't be electrified, he said these lines might potentially bypass the overhead wire technology altogether. ""We're building it in such a way that we can use, probably, the very latest technology, potentially, in the future,"" he said. ""The most important thing is the infrastructure,"" he said. ""It's about building the stations, things you need to do no matter what kind of train you're going to run on there, if it's going to take passengers."" But Labour MP Daniel Zeichner, who represents Cambridge, said: ""Every rail expert will tell you it will cost more later to electrify a line."" ""In a time of climate emergency, we really shouldn't be building railway lines for diesel, it's got to be electric."" The line connecting Oxford and Cambridge would serve new housing developments, he said, and rail was ""the right way to get people in and out of a city like Cambridge"". ""It's very important for the UK economy, but it's got to be done in an environmentally sustainable way,"" he said. ""It seems crazy to be building new railways which aren't electrified in the first place, and I really hope the government will reconsider."" Government urged to 'safeguard' Eurostar's future Prioritise northern railways over HS2, says report Passengers told to check train times as routes cut The East West Rail investment will rebuild a train line between Bicester and Bletchley which was closed in 1968. The project is being delivered by a publicly-owned body called the East West Company. The first phase of East West Rail, which was completed in 2016, connected Oxford and Bicester. But at the moment, rail passengers wishing to go from Oxford to Bletchley have to take a detour via Coventry. The aim is to get trains running between Oxford and Bletchley by 2025, with new stations at Winslow and Bletchley. The Department for Transport said the works will create 1,500 jobs, and have a wider economic benefit for the area. The eventual aim of the project, which the government expects to be completed by the end of the decade, is to connect Oxford and Cambridge by rail via Bedford, taking in Milton Keynes and Aylesbury on branches. The Northumberland Line was closed to passengers in 1964 as part of a rationalisation of the railway network known as the Beeching cuts. Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the Northumberland Line was ""a really critical piece of local infrastructure"" that would help bring people in south east Northumberland and north Tyneside closer to Newcastle city centre, and closer to well-paid jobs. Passengers would be able to take the train between Ashington and Newcastle ""Having better connectivity will help attract businesses to that area, and it will help to deliver genuine levelling-up,"" he said. The new Â£34m investment, which aims to reopen the line between Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Ashington, will include funds for preparatory works and land acquisition. There are plans for new stations at at Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth, Bebside, Newsham, Seaton Delaval, and Northumberland Park, in North Tyneside, as well as upgrades to the track and changes to level crossings where new bridges or underpasses were needed, the Department for Transport said.

Delays halt jabs in parts of Europe,"Italy saw a dramatic fall in the number of daily vaccinations last weekend Vaccinations in parts of Europe are being held up and in some cases halted because of a cut in deliveries of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine. Germany's most populous state and several regions in Italy have suspended first jabs, while vaccinations for medics in Madrid have been stopped too. The US pharmaceutical firm has had to cut deliveries temporarily while cases in many European countries surge. Germany has reached 50,000 Covid deaths and Spain has seen record infections. Italy and Poland have threatened to take legal action in response to the reduction in vaccines. Pfizer said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. The EU has ordered 600 million doses from Pfizer and has also authorised the Moderna vaccine. Responding to the delays, Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, said the EU had to take some responsibility because of its slow approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which may come at the end of next week. Hungary has reached a deal with Russia to buy up large quantities of the Sputnik V vaccine, even though it has not received EU approval. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after an EU summit on Thursday night that quick delivery had to be ensured. ""We are determined to provide more predictability and stability to the delivery process and we look forward to more vaccines and more doses coming on stream soon,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

Hungary first in EU to approve Russian vaccine Why won't vaccinating the vulnerable end UK lockdown? Italyhas been told to expect a a 20% cut in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine next week - it has already seen a 29% dip this week - and Rome is considering legal action. Special Covid commissioner Domenico Arcuri says jabs fell from 80,000 a day to an average of 28,000 last Saturday. Some Italian regions have seen a 60% fall in doses. Germany, where BioNTech is based, has had several states struggle with vaccine deliveries.North Rhine-Westphalia,in the west, halted jabs in hospitals on Tuesday and paused first vaccinations in nursing homes too. Second vaccinations are continuing but special centres for the over-80s will not open now until next month. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? Authorities in and around theSpanish capital Madridhave temporarily stopped vaccinating healthcare personnel this week, saying they had only received half the doses they were expecting. The national government is rationing distribution until Pfizer's deliveries improve. Spain reported a record 44,357 cases in one day on Thursday. Romaniahas warned that its vaccine stocks could be down to almost zero by the end of the first week of February. TheCzechgovernment has warned that the reduction in distribution has created ""huge complications"". Poland,which began by vaccinating healthcare workers and moved to care homes this week, saw a 50% drop in the number of vaccines delivered this week. Ministers say they have been promised normal service by mid-February. If that is not the case, Warsaw says it would consider legal action. EU leaders agreed late on Thursday to keep their internal borders open,externalbut warned that restricting non-essential travel may be needed to curb the spread of the virus. Ms von der Leyen suggested Covid hot spots could be labelled as ""dark red"" zones, requiring a negative test from travellers before departure. Hours later, European stock markets fell on Friday, particularly shares in travel companies. Francehas said it will impose tighter travel restrictions for European arrivals from Sunday night, requiring a negative PCR test within three days of travel. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran has appealed to people to stop using home-made fabric masks - health officials are recommending that medical masks are worn instead. Belgiumis to ban non-essential travel for Belgian residents from late January to 1 March, other than for people living in border areas to go shopping. Anyone making an ""essential"" trip that lasts more than 48 hours will have to self-isolate and take two Covid tests after they return. Denmark, meanwhile, is suspending flights from the UAE for five days because of a tip-off suggesting that pre-flight tests are unreliable. Denmark requires all air passengers to have tests taken in the 24 hours before a flight. The total number ofGermanCovid deaths climbed above 50,000 on Friday, but the number of infections has fallen in the past week. Leading virologist Christian Drosten has warned Germans that as increasing numbers get vaccinated there will be growing pressure to curb restrictions. ""Then we won't be talking in terms of 20,000 or 30,000 infections a day but in the worst case scenario 100,000,"" he told Spiegel magazine. Why won't vaccinating the vulnerable end lockdown?

Earlier we told you about some of themore unusual vaccine centresacross the UK. Another is former St Albans nightclub Batchwood Hall, which closed in the first lockdown. It happens to have been the venue for the wedding of Wendy Lewis, 81, when it was a stately home, before being converted to an entertainment venue - and shereturned there for her Covid vaccine. Mrs Lewis, a grandmother of four, said: ""As I sat on a chair by the staircase, I looked up and I remembered that's where I threw my bouquet to my bridesmaids. It brought it all back. ""It was the first time I'd been back since 1962, for a friend's wedding reception, shortly after mine."" Her husband Jim died in 2012, after the couple were ""very happily married"" for 50 years, Mrs Lewis said.    Volunteers at a food bank in Midlothian say they have received Covid vaccinations - ahead of the majority of those over the age of 80. Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday that 34% of over-80s in Scotland had received their first dose. Mark Wells, manager of the Food Facts Friends food bank in Penicuick, said he and six volunteers had received jabs in the past week. NHS Lothian said it had not received detailed guidance on what counts as a priority health and social care worker. A spokesperson for the health board said health and social care workers who work with the very vulnerable were eligible for vaccination at this stage. This group can include those who work in the voluntary sector - with workers able to book vaccines ""on a self-triage basis"". The spokesperson added: ""At present, we do not have further or more detailed national guidance to help quantify what is meant by priority health and social care workers.""

Today's figure, of 1,348 deaths, is more than were recorded last Saturday, when there were 1,295 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. If deaths continue at the same rate, the UK will reach the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths under that measure within the coming days. The figure of 33,552 new cases of coronavirus is down from a week ago, when there were 41,346 new positive tests.  There have been another 1,348 deaths recorded in the UK, of people who had had a positive Covid-19 test in the previous 28 days. It brings the total number of deaths, under that measure, to 97,329. And another 33,552 people have tested positive for the virus. It brings the total to 3,617,459. Up to and including 22 January, 5,861,351 people have now had their first Covid jab and 468,617 have had their second dose.   Doctors in France have advised people to avoid talking on busy public transport to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus. In a statement, Franceâs National Academy of Medicine said: âThe mandatory wearing of masks on public transport, where social distancing is not possible, should be accompanied by one very simple precaution: avoid talking and making phone calls.â Academy member Patrick Berche told local media that if there was lots of space it was not a problem, but if you were very close to the person next to you it made sense not to talk. ""It is not an obligation, it is a recommendation,"" he told BFM TV. Masks have been compulsory on public transport in France since May. Guests fled when police arrived at the Stamford Hill school An orthodox Rabbi in Cheshire has issued a strident attack on those who broke lockdown restrictions by holding a wedding ceremony in north London. Police broke up a wedding party of approximately 150 people in Stamford Hill,in the borough of Hackney, on Thursday night Writing on Facebook, Rabbi Dovid Lewis deemed the wedding ""a criminal act"" and claimed the wedding was not lawful. ""By making a wedding in these times, when it is against the law and puts so many people's lives at real risk, that invalidates the declaration,"" he wrote. ""A Jewish wedding is a three-way partnership between Chosson, Kallah and Hashem [Bridegroom, Bride and God]. Last night's debacle was nothing short of idolatrous. ""They have in essence transgressed the 3 cardinal sins of Idolatry, Adultery and Murder. ""That my dear friends, is my view on this most sad news."" Ireland may have to slow its mass rollout of coronavirus jabs because of issues with the supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has warned. AstraZeneca has told the EU thata production problem means that the number of initial doses available would be lower than expected. In an interview with Irish broadcaster RTÃ, MicheÃ¡l Martin said AstraZeneca âwas going to be the catalyst to be allowed to move from low level to mass vaccinationâ. He added that delivery delays would ""put us in a problem"". He said the length of the delay would be dependent on ongoing discussions between the EU and Oxford University/AstraZeneca, and that some ""very robust meetings"" would be taking place in the coming days. By Sunday, he said, ""most of the long-term care residents"" and ""about half of front-line healthcare workers"" in the Republic of Ireland would be vaccinated. Martin also told RTÃ that he expects Covid-19 restrictions to remain in place in the Republic for the first six months of 2020.

""I mean, why would you want to put yourself through that every day?â she said. âColleagues of mine that I had known for decades...in that one experience, because I was in the White House, decided that I had become this political person, even though they had known me forever.â She said she had to ask herself every morning and night: âIs there something that I think I can do that would be helpful in responding to this pandemic?"" Birx faced criticism last year for attending a family get-together over Thanksgiving, despite urging Americans to to restrict gatherings to ""your immediate household"". She announced in December thatshe would retire following the incident. Earlier this week, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said he feels ""liberated"" by being able to talk about science under the new president. CBSâs full interview with Birx will air on Sunday. A Catholic priest haspraised hospital staff who held a dying man's handand prayed as he was dying with Covid-19. Fr Brian Fitzpatrick was called to give last rites to a patient in Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh and when he got there, found four people gathered around the man's bed. Because they were wearing full PPE, he didn't know who they were and assumed it was the man's family as one of them was in tears. The others were holding the patient's hand and wiping his brow, while one of the group quietly recited a prayer. He then realised the names and job titles of the four people were written on their protective equipment and that it was a group of doctors and nurses. Fr Fitzpatrick said: These are our frontline staff; they are giving everything in service for us and our family members and I will never forget that touching sight and beautiful experience as long as I live."" Peaky Blinders, the Birmingham-set BBC series, is filmed in part at the Black Country Living Museum With millions of people throughout the UK now receiving their vaccinations, space for the procedure can be at a premium. That's why cathedrals, mosques, museums and vehicle showrooms have been pressed into service as some of the more unusual vaccination centres. In the Midlands, the Black Country Living Museum,which doubles as a set for hit TV show Peaky Blinders, becomes Dudley's first vaccination centre on Monday. It will be joined byBlackpool's famous Winter Gardensand a motorcycle dealership in Crewe. The Crewe Honda Centre usually stocks about 100 motorcycles, but will now be a community vaccination centre, after owner Roger Morris got together with his best friend, pharmacist Raj Patel. ""It's a great way that two businesses from totally different backgrounds can come together and help the local community,"" said Mr Morris, who declined any rent for the space. On Friday,a mosque in Birmingham became the first in the UK to open as a vaccination hub. The Al-Abbas Islamic Centre in Balsall Heath is expected to vaccinate up to 500 people a day. The imam, Sheikh Nuru Mohammed said opening the mosque as a venue would ""send a strong message to our Muslim brothers and sisters"". ""We are doing this to say a big 'no' to fake news and a big 'yes' to the vaccine,"" said Sheikh Nuru. Blackburn and Salisbury cathedrals are among the church buildings to have opened as vaccine stationsin the past week. The Dean of Blackburn, Rev Peter Howell-Jones said using the building for such a public service showed the ""welcome and hospitality at the heart of Christianity"". A total of 5,526,071 Covid-19 vaccinations took place in England between December 8 and January 22, according to provisional NHS England data. This includes first and second doses and is a rise of 425,596 on Friday's figures. Of this number, 5,085,771 were the first dose of the vaccine, while 440,300 were the second dose. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris In 2002 Julienne created a motor stunt show that ran for many years at Disney theme parks in Paris and Florida. RÃ©my Julienne, one of the world's best-known stuntmen, has died in France with coronavirus, aged 90. Over a 50-year career, Julienne devised the crashes, crunches and collisions witnessed in more than 1,400 films. He also starred in many of them, albeit anonymously. The legendarycascadeur (stunt performer) appeared as a body double for a host of stars, including Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Charles Bronson and Jean-Paul Belmondo. In wig and appropriate clothing, he also took on the form of Sophia Loren, Carole Bouquet and Gina Lollobrigida. Among his most famous works are the chase scenes in 1969's The Italian Job, in which a fleet of Mini-Coopers in Turin cross a river, dive into the metro and jump from the roof of the Fiat factory. He also worked on six Bond films, notably going behind the wheel of a battered yellow CitroÃ«n 2CV in For Your Eyes Only. A life-long lover of motorbikes and anything driven at speed, Julienne specialised in spectacular destruction. But he was committed to the maximum elimination of risk and calculated his stunts with extreme precision. ""What is beautiful about the job is that you can never be 100% certain,"" he said. ""If you could, then frankly it wouldn't be interesting. Read more.

They included sit-downs with every US president since Gerald Ford.

He hosted his own nightly programme on CNN for 25 years from 1985 to 2010.

"Up to 500 new cells to be built in women's prisonsSome will enable women to have overnight visits with their children, the Ministry of Justice says.UK","Up to 500 new prison cells are to be built in women's jails, the Ministry of Justice has announced. These will be built in existing women's prisons to increase the number of single cells available and improve conditions. They will include in-cell showers, and some will enable women to have overnight visits with their children to prepare for life at home after release. In future, older cells could also be shut if the prison population reduces. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has also pledged almost Â£2m in funding to 38 charities so their ""vital work in steering women away from crime can continue"". This may include addressing mental health problems and drug use, both of which affect around half of women in prison. Prisons minister Lucy Frazer said: ""This funding boost will allow frontline services to continue the incredible work they do with some of the most vulnerable women in our society to prevent them being drawn into crime."" Announcing the funding, the government reiterated its promise to cut the number of women in custody and provide effective support to deal with problems which could lead to crime in the first place or reoffending. But it admitted there could be a temporary rise of inmates in the near future as the number of investigations and prosecutions is expected to increase amid the hiring of 20,000 more police officers. It added that the number of women in custody has fallen by 10% since 2010 and stressed that government investment in community services should see this trend continue in the long-term. If the number of women in prison falls longer term, the MoJ says the new modern facilities will allow the Prison Service to close old accommodation. Campaigners largely welcomed the announcement, but warned the efforts do not go far enough to tackle longstanding problems. Kate Paradine, chief executive of charity Women in Prison, said: ""This pledge and funding are just the start, and a far cry from what is needed in order to provide stability for women who face the sharp end of our society."" She called on the government in its upcoming Budget to safeguard the future of women's centres, which she described as an ""anchor that stop women being swept up into crime"" but warned were ""facing a funding cliff edge in April"". Emily Evison, policy officer at the Prison Reform Trust, said the plans would need to be backed up by ""action on the ground to prove effective"", adding: ""Instead of planning for a rise (in women prisoners), the government should redouble its efforts to ensure women are not being sent to prison to serve pointless short sentences."" Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""If the goal is to reduce the number of women entering the criminal justice system, then today's announcement shows that ministers are looking at the issue down the wrong end of a telescope"", claiming the funding promised was ""dwarfed"" by the cost of the extra prison places.

It happens to have been the venue for the wedding of Wendy Lewis, 81, when it was a stately home, before being converted to an entertainment venue - and shereturned there for her Covid vaccine. Mrs Lewis, a grandmother of four, said: ""As I sat on a chair by the staircase, I looked up and I remembered that's where I threw my bouquet to my bridesmaids. It brought it all back. ""It was the first time I'd been back since 1962, for a friend's wedding reception, shortly after mine."" Her husband Jim died in 2012, after the couple were ""very happily married"" for 50 years, Mrs Lewis said.    Volunteers at a food bank in Midlothian say they have received Covid vaccinations - ahead of the majority of those over the age of 80. Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday that 34% of over-80s in Scotland had received their first dose. Mark Wells, manager of the Food Facts Friends food bank in Penicuick, said he and six volunteers had received jabs in the past week. NHS Lothian said it had not received detailed guidance on what counts as a priority health and social care worker. A spokesperson for the health board said health and social care workers who work with the very vulnerable were eligible for vaccination at this stage. This group can include those who work in the voluntary sector - with workers able to book vaccines ""on a self-triage basis"". The spokesperson added: ""At present, we do not have further or more detailed national guidance to help quantify what is meant by priority health and social care workers.""

Today's figure, of 1,348 deaths, is more than were recorded last Saturday, when there were 1,295 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. If deaths continue at the same rate, the UK will reach the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths under that measure within the coming days. The figure of 33,552 new cases of coronavirus is down from a week ago, when there were 41,346 new positive tests.  There have been another 1,348 deaths recorded in the UK, of people who had had a positive Covid-19 test in the previous 28 days. It brings the total number of deaths, under that measure, to 97,329. And another 33,552 people have tested positive for the virus. It brings the total to 3,617,459. Up to and including 22 January, 5,861,351 people have now had their first Covid jab and 468,617 have had their second dose.   Doctors in France have advised people to avoid talking on busy public transport to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus. In a statement, Franceâs National Academy of Medicine said: âThe mandatory wearing of masks on public transport, where social distancing is not possible, should be accompanied by one very simple precaution: avoid talking and making phone calls.â Academy member Patrick Berche told local media that if there was lots of space it was not a problem, but if you were very close to the person next to you it made sense not to talk. ""It is not an obligation, it is a recommendation,"" he told BFM TV. Masks have been compulsory on public transport in France since May. Guests fled when police arrived at the Stamford Hill school An orthodox Rabbi in Cheshire has issued a strident attack on those who broke lockdown restrictions by holding a wedding ceremony in north London. Police broke up a wedding party of approximately 150 people in Stamford Hill,in the borough of Hackney, on Thursday night Writing on Facebook, Rabbi Dovid Lewis deemed the wedding ""a criminal act"" and claimed the wedding was not lawful. ""By making a wedding in these times, when it is against the law and puts so many people's lives at real risk, that invalidates the declaration,"" he wrote. ""A Jewish wedding is a three-way partnership between Chosson, Kallah and Hashem [Bridegroom, Bride and God]. Last night's debacle was nothing short of idolatrous. ""They have in essence transgressed the 3 cardinal sins of Idolatry, Adultery and Murder. ""That my dear friends, is my view on this most sad news."" Ireland may have to slow its mass rollout of coronavirus jabs because of issues with the supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has warned. AstraZeneca has told the EU thata production problem means that the number of initial doses available would be lower than expected. In an interview with Irish broadcaster RTÃ, MicheÃ¡l Martin said AstraZeneca âwas going to be the catalyst to be allowed to move from low level to mass vaccinationâ. He added that delivery delays would ""put us in a problem"". He said the length of the delay would be dependent on ongoing discussions between the EU and Oxford University/AstraZeneca, and that some ""very robust meetings"" would be taking place in the coming days. By Sunday, he said, ""most of the long-term care residents"" and ""about half of front-line healthcare workers"" in the Republic of Ireland would be vaccinated. Martin also told RTÃ that he expects Covid-19 restrictions to remain in place in the Republic for the first six months of 2020.

Birx faced criticism last year for attending a family get-together over Thanksgiving, despite urging Americans to to restrict gatherings to ""your immediate household"". She announced in December thatshe would retire following the incident. Earlier this week, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said he feels ""liberated"" by being able to talk about science under the new president. CBSâs full interview with Birx will air on Sunday. A Catholic priest haspraised hospital staff who held a dying man's handand prayed as he was dying with Covid-19. Fr Brian Fitzpatrick was called to give last rites to a patient in Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh and when he got there, found four people gathered around the man's bed. Because they were wearing full PPE, he didn't know who they were and assumed it was the man's family as one of them was in tears. The others were holding the patient's hand and wiping his brow, while one of the group quietly recited a prayer. He then realised the names and job titles of the four people were written on their protective equipment and that it was a group of doctors and nurses. Fr Fitzpatrick said: These are our frontline staff; they are giving everything in service for us and our family members and I will never forget that touching sight and beautiful experience as long as I live."" Peaky Blinders, the Birmingham-set BBC series, is filmed in part at the Black Country Living Museum With millions of people throughout the UK now receiving their vaccinations, space for the procedure can be at a premium. That's why cathedrals, mosques, museums and vehicle showrooms have been pressed into service as some of the more unusual vaccination centres. In the Midlands, the Black Country Living Museum,which doubles as a set for hit TV show Peaky Blinders, becomes Dudley's first vaccination centre on Monday. It will be joined byBlackpool's famous Winter Gardensand a motorcycle dealership in Crewe. The Crewe Honda Centre usually stocks about 100 motorcycles, but will now be a community vaccination centre, after owner Roger Morris got together with his best friend, pharmacist Raj Patel. ""It's a great way that two businesses from totally different backgrounds can come together and help the local community,"" said Mr Morris, who declined any rent for the space. On Friday,a mosque in Birmingham became the first in the UK to open as a vaccination hub. The Al-Abbas Islamic Centre in Balsall Heath is expected to vaccinate up to 500 people a day. The imam, Sheikh Nuru Mohammed said opening the mosque as a venue would ""send a strong message to our Muslim brothers and sisters"". ""We are doing this to say a big 'no' to fake news and a big 'yes' to the vaccine,"" said Sheikh Nuru. Blackburn and Salisbury cathedrals are among the church buildings to have opened as vaccine stationsin the past week. The Dean of Blackburn, Rev Peter Howell-Jones said using the building for such a public service showed the ""welcome and hospitality at the heart of Christianity"". A total of 5,526,071 Covid-19 vaccinations took place in England between December 8 and January 22, according to provisional NHS England data. This includes first and second doses and is a rise of 425,596 on Friday's figures. Of this number, 5,085,771 were the first dose of the vaccine, while 440,300 were the second dose. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris In 2002 Julienne created a motor stunt show that ran for many years at Disney theme parks in Paris and Florida. RÃ©my Julienne, one of the world's best-known stuntmen, has died in France with coronavirus, aged 90. Over a 50-year career, Julienne devised the crashes, crunches and collisions witnessed in more than 1,400 films. He also starred in many of them, albeit anonymously. The legendarycascadeur (stunt performer) appeared as a body double for a host of stars, including Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Charles Bronson and Jean-Paul Belmondo. In wig and appropriate clothing, he also took on the form of Sophia Loren, Carole Bouquet and Gina Lollobrigida. Among his most famous works are the chase scenes in 1969's The Italian Job, in which a fleet of Mini-Coopers in Turin cross a river, dive into the metro and jump from the roof of the Fiat factory. He also worked on six Bond films, notably going behind the wheel of a battered yellow CitroÃ«n 2CV in For Your Eyes Only. A life-long lover of motorbikes and anything driven at speed, Julienne specialised in spectacular destruction. But he was committed to the maximum elimination of risk and calculated his stunts with extreme precision. ""What is beautiful about the job is that you can never be 100% certain,"" he said. ""If you could, then frankly it wouldn't be interesting. Read more.

Read hisfull obituary here. Oprah Winfrey was among the many people to appear on King's show Larry King carried out more than 50,000 interviews during his career, CNN said. They included sit-downs with every US president since Gerald Ford. His other high-profile guests are too numerous to mention - but they include Dr Martin Luther King, Bill Gates, Margaret Thatcher and Lady Gaga. He hosted his own nightly programme on CNN for 25 years from 1985 to 2010. At its peak, his Larry King Live Show was bringing in 1.5 million viewers a night and when the final episode aired in 2010, it was the longest-running show hosted by the same person. In a recorded message on his final show, Barack Obama said King had ""opened our eyes to the world beyond our living rooms"". King continued broadcasting, and in the past few years he hosted his own shows on Ora TV, an on-demand digital network he helped to found, as well as Hulu and RT, Russia's state-controlled international broadcaster. Away from the microphone, King was married eight times to seven women and had five children, nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. CNN's Christiane Amanpour,externaldescribed Larry King as a ""giant of broadcasting and a master of the TV celebrity/statesman-woman interview"".

Up to 500 new cells to be built in women's prisons,"Up to 500 new prison cells are to be built in women's jails, the Ministry of Justice has announced. These will be built in existing women's prisons to increase the number of single cells available and improve conditions. They will include in-cell showers, and some will enable women to have overnight visits with their children to prepare for life at home after release. In future, older cells could also be shut if the prison population reduces. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has also pledged almost Â£2m in funding to 38 charities so their ""vital work in steering women away from crime can continue"". This may include addressing mental health problems and drug use, both of which affect around half of women in prison. Prisons minister Lucy Frazer said: ""This funding boost will allow frontline services to continue the incredible work they do with some of the most vulnerable women in our society to prevent them being drawn into crime."" Announcing the funding, the government reiterated its promise to cut the number of women in custody and provide effective support to deal with problems which could lead to crime in the first place or reoffending. But it admitted there could be a temporary rise of inmates in the near future as the number of investigations and prosecutions is expected to increase amid the hiring of 20,000 more police officers. It added that the number of women in custody has fallen by 10% since 2010 and stressed that government investment in community services should see this trend continue in the long-term. If the number of women in prison falls longer term, the MoJ says the new modern facilities will allow the Prison Service to close old accommodation. Campaigners largely welcomed the announcement, but warned the efforts do not go far enough to tackle longstanding problems. Kate Paradine, chief executive of charity Women in Prison, said: ""This pledge and funding are just the start, and a far cry from what is needed in order to provide stability for women who face the sharp end of our society."" She called on the government in its upcoming Budget to safeguard the future of women's centres, which she described as an ""anchor that stop women being swept up into crime"" but warned were ""facing a funding cliff edge in April"". Emily Evison, policy officer at the Prison Reform Trust, said the plans would need to be backed up by ""action on the ground to prove effective"", adding: ""Instead of planning for a rise (in women prisoners), the government should redouble its efforts to ensure women are not being sent to prison to serve pointless short sentences."" Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""If the goal is to reduce the number of women entering the criminal justice system, then today's announcement shows that ministers are looking at the issue down the wrong end of a telescope"", claiming the funding promised was ""dwarfed"" by the cost of the extra prison places.

East West and Northumberland lines get Â£794m boost,"A rejuvenated Northumberland Line will help connect local communities to Newcastle city centre, say supporters Two railway lines, closed to passengers since the 1960s, are to get almost Â£800m funding from the government. East West Rail, which will eventually connect Oxford and Cambridge, will get Â£760m to open new parts of the line. The Northumberland Line, which still carries freight, will get Â£34m for initial work aimed at reintroducing passenger services. Reopening closed lines like these would help connect ""left-behind"" communities, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. ""Restoring railways helps put communities back on the map and this investment forms part of our nationwide effort to build back vital connections and unlock access to jobs, education and housing,"" he said. These investments would return these routes ""to their former glory"" and was part of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda, Mr Shapps added. Diesel engines will initially run on the lines, but Mr Shapps said he hoped more environmentally friendly trains, for example powered by hydrogen or new battery technology, would replace them in the future. When asked by the BBC why the lines wouldn't be electrified, he said these lines might potentially bypass the overhead wire technology altogether. ""We're building it in such a way that we can use, probably, the very latest technology, potentially, in the future,"" he said. ""The most important thing is the infrastructure,"" he said. ""It's about building the stations, things you need to do no matter what kind of train you're going to run on there, if it's going to take passengers."" But Labour MP Daniel Zeichner, who represents Cambridge, said: ""Every rail expert will tell you it will cost more later to electrify a line."" ""In a time of climate emergency, we really shouldn't be building railway lines for diesel, it's got to be electric."" The line connecting Oxford and Cambridge would serve new housing developments, he said, and rail was ""the right way to get people in and out of a city like Cambridge"". ""It's very important for the UK economy, but it's got to be done in an environmentally sustainable way,"" he said. ""It seems crazy to be building new railways which aren't electrified in the first place, and I really hope the government will reconsider."" Government urged to 'safeguard' Eurostar's future Prioritise northern railways over HS2, says report Passengers told to check train times as routes cut The East West Rail investment will rebuild a train line between Bicester and Bletchley which was closed in 1968. The project is being delivered by a publicly-owned body called the East West Company. The first phase of East West Rail, which was completed in 2016, connected Oxford and Bicester. But at the moment, rail passengers wishing to go from Oxford to Bletchley have to take a detour via Coventry. The aim is to get trains running between Oxford and Bletchley by 2025, with new stations at Winslow and Bletchley. The Department for Transport said the works will create 1,500 jobs, and have a wider economic benefit for the area. The eventual aim of the project, which the government expects to be completed by the end of the decade, is to connect Oxford and Cambridge by rail via Bedford, taking in Milton Keynes and Aylesbury on branches. The Northumberland Line was closed to passengers in 1964 as part of a rationalisation of the railway network known as the Beeching cuts. Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the Northumberland Line was ""a really critical piece of local infrastructure"" that would help bring people in south east Northumberland and north Tyneside closer to Newcastle city centre, and closer to well-paid jobs. Passengers would be able to take the train between Ashington and Newcastle ""Having better connectivity will help attract businesses to that area, and it will help to deliver genuine levelling-up,"" he said. The new Â£34m investment, which aims to reopen the line between Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Ashington, will include funds for preparatory works and land acquisition. There are plans for new stations at at Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth, Bebside, Newsham, Seaton Delaval, and Northumberland Park, in North Tyneside, as well as upgrades to the track and changes to level crossings where new bridges or underpasses were needed, the Department for Transport said.

Your guide to avoiding lockdown back and shoulder pain,"Millions of people are less physically active than they were before Covid-19. For those working from home, the morning walk to the bus stop has gone. Days on end can be spent hunched over a laptop without ever leaving the house. For some, that's taking a painful toll. Asurvey,externalof people working remotely, by Opinium for the charity Versus Arthritis, found 81% of respondents were experiencing some back, neck or shoulder pain. Almost half (48%) said they were less physically active than before the lockdown.  Anotherstudy,externalby the Institute for Employment Studies found 35% reporting new back pain while working from home. Physiotherapists and other back pain experts say those with serious or persistent problems should seek professional help, but there are things that many of us can do to help ourselves. Pretty much all the experts agree that one of the best things you can do is get moving. Don't sit in the same position for long periods. ""Make sure you take any opportunity you can to move your body,"" says Ashley James of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists (CSP). ""It doesn't need to be about exercise as such,"" he says.  ""It's about building movement into your day."" He calls it taking ""regular movement snacks"". That could be taking phone calls or joining online meetings standing up, just having a stretch or walking up and down the stairs when you don't really need to, he says.  When you're moving, different muscle groups share the work of keeping your head, neck, back and the rest of your body supported, rather than continually overloading the same muscles. Where lockdowns have restricted outside exercise to once a day, Mr James's advice is to use that daily opportunity for at least a good walk whenever you can. Movement can help with breathing by opening up your chest, and reducing muscle atrophy. It increases blood flow and lubricates synovial joints - joints that allow free movement - like hips and shoulders. Creating a new routine to help keep you moving can be difficult, so experts suggest setting a timer on your phone or laptop to remind you to move. It's a good way to avoid getting stuck in the same position hour after hour, says neck specialist Chris Worsfold. ""We've evolved to move,"" he says. ""We naturally want to move after about 20 or 30 minutes, so that's when you need to go and shake it about."" If you're sitting when it goes off, stand up. If you're standing, have a stretch or walk up and down the stairs. ""The key is to create a routine that works for you,"" says Leanne Antoine, who treats patients in Hertfordshire.  ""There's no point in creating a schedule that makes you feel like a failure when you don't keep to it."" So ask yourself honestly what you would be prepared to do, and stick to it. Be careful, but as long as it gets you out of the chair, stretching, walking or Zumba dancing in your living room, it doesn't matter, she says. ""You don't need the perfect set up with a thousand pound chair, but if you're scrunched up on the sofa, it's not going to be good for your back,"" says Chris Martey. Your workspace is worth some serious thought, but companies have a big interest in selling expensive equipment, so he says beware of unnecessary costs. Leanne Antoine agrees: ""Just make small tweaks that don't cost the earth."" That could be as simple as using a cushion to raise you up on your chair, or to support your lower back. An inexpensive adjustable office chair can help. A mount for your laptop will raise your screen to eye level so that you're not always looking down, particularly on long online video calls. An external keyboard is also useful. ""Talk to your employer,"" says Ms Antoine. Many will supply equipment to staff. If you have to use a sofa, at least make sure your feet are firmly on the floor and you're sitting back with a cushion to support your lower back. Standing desks can be helpful, says Chris Martey. But you need to alternate between standing and sitting - and take regular screen breaks. If you don't have a standing desk,some experts,externalrecommend standing with your laptop on an ironing board for short periods. We're in a ""perfect storm"" for back trouble - according to Ashley James, with Covid-19 restricting physical activity while simultaneously ramping up anxieties about health, job insecurity, children's education and more. It's impossible to quantify but a lot of back pain is driven by anxiety, he says.  In the jargon, back problems are ""biopsychosocial"". It doesn't help that we're now in winter - when many people experience a dip in mood. People de-stress in all sorts of ways of course.  Pilates and yoga are helpful for some. One of the best ways is to work on getting better sleep, says Mr James. ""Sleep hygiene"" is the key. That means cutting down on caffeine in the afternoon and evening, keeping to a consistent night time routine and trying to wake up at the same time every day. TheNHS advises,externalagainst using electronic devices for an hour or so before you go to bed, as the light from the screen may make it more difficult for you to sleep. Light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone which helps to make you sleepy. Many studies have suggested thatblue light,externaldoes this most powerfully, butsome research,externalsuggests the warmer colours used in ""night mode"" on many devices may actually have a bigger impact. The CSP has designed some simple stretches which, if done regularly, can help ward off aches and pains. They're for people who are working remotely and find themselves sitting for long periods. How to exercise at your desk (Chartered Society of Physiotherapy),external NHS advice on back pain treatment,external The chest stretch, the leg stretch, the sit stretch and the wall press, are designed to help different muscle groups. The CSP says there is no ""perfect posture"" and that the priority is to keep moving. There's a positive message here, says Chris Martey. For millions of people suffering everyday aches and pains he says: ""You can take control. You can self-manage. You don't have to be dependent."" Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.

Covid hand-outs: How other countries pay if you are sick,"A restaurant worker in Lisbon, where benefits to those with symptoms, and those without, are generous The idea of a flat Â£500 payment to anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 has been dismissed by the UK government. Health officials had come up with the suggestion in the hope of encouraging people with the illness to self-isolate. There are concerns the virus is continuing to spread because some people are ignoring the instruction to stay home when they show symptoms or test positive. Downing Street has said there is already a Â£500 sum for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. But this must be applied for and there have been high rejection rates in England at least, A behaviour expert who advises the government, told the BBCjust 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolatingfor the full 10 days they were meant to. So how do other countries handle the question of paying people to stay at home, or just trusting they will do the right thing? Here, BBC correspondents from Prague to New York, offer an insight. In Portugal, even those who are just at-risk of contracting Covid - having been in direct contact with a confirmed case - are entitled to 100% of their basic salary, for 14 days, writesAlison Roberts, in Lisbon. For those who show symptoms, or have tested positive, the same is available for up to 28 days. And the normal waiting times people are used to when claiming while ill have also been done away with - these Covid payments kick in on day one of isolation. Those not on permanent work contracts tend to be treated as self-employed and are eligible for benefits based on income declared. But there are a lot of people, including many immigrants, who lack the necessary paperwork, and are therefore not eligible to claim. Nevertheless, it's perhaps not surprising that, because people are able to claim full basic pay, there hasn't been much, if any, debate about people obeying self-isolation. If there are reports of people not seeking tests, or not isolating, it seems to be more out of ignorance, which is certainly rather worrying. Slovenia has been offering compensation to people forced to self-isolate after exposure to coronavirus since it first introduced emergency measures in March, writesGuy De Launey in Ljubljana. Depending on the circumstances, this covers anything from 80% to the full amount of usual earnings. The payments may be made directly to people in quarantine, or as compensation to employers. A government official told the BBC that with its socialist past, it was normal for Slovenia to take care of people in quarantine by providing payments - and that without compensation, it would be impossible to deal with coronavirus. When the measures were first introduced, they enjoyed broad public support. But the second wave of the epidemic has seen case numbers skyrocket - Slovenia's per capita death-rate is now the third highest in the world - and public confidence overall has dipped. By the end of 2020, market research company Valicon said that only 12% of Slovenians viewed the government's measures as ""appropriate"", adding that people were ""worried and dissatisfied with the social situation"", suggesting compensation is not a panacea. In March last year, the US agreed to pay for some workers to stay at home - a big change for a country that had never paid sick leave requirement before, writesNatalie Sherman in New York. The measure guaranteed up to 14 days of pay for workers forced to isolate because they had symptoms, had received medical advice to self-quarantine, or were under government lockdown orders. It also said it would guarantee two-thirds of pay for people caring for someone with the virus for up to two weeks. One studysuggested it helped prevent hundreds of news cases,externala day. But the assistance - paid by employers which were then reimbursed by the government via tax credits - expired on 31 December. And even before that, analysts estimated that loopholes meant roughlyhalf of the country's workforce, including many grocery workers and medical staff were potentially excluded,external. As part of his $1.9tn stimulus plan, President Joe Biden is pushing to renew the law, and end the exemptions. But the proposal - which his team estimates would expand the benefit to as many as 106 million more Americans - faces stiff resistance from Republicans and key business lobbies. In Germany financial support is generous for people ordered to self-isolate by the authorities because of infection risk, writesDamien McGuinness in Berlin. As a result there hasn't been a debate in Germany about breaking self-isolation rules because of financial need. Fines can be huge - tens of thousands of euros - and are strictly enforced. Overall there's no great issue with compliance and Germany's financial package has widespread cross-party backing, and is supported by voters. Employees who are unable to work at home receive full pay for up to six weeks. This is paid by the employer, who is then reimbursed by the state. After that, workers may be eligible for sick-pay. Freelancers and self-employed people are generally also entitled to full pay for six weeks. But they would apply directly to their regional government. The exact rules and level of efficiency for payments vary from region to region. For those in the gig economy - Germany has it, though less so than Britain - this should be covered by state aid, based on tax returns. The level of state support was agreed by Germany's national parliament in Berlin. But payments are administered and funded by regional governments. There's been some discussion here about paying people to stay home if they test positive for Covid, writesRob Cameron, in Prague. The idea is advocated by at least one independent expert group. But it would be expensive, and the Czech state coffers are already stretched from keeping employees on furlough and paying compensation. Instead, salaried employees who receive a positive diagnosis are left with two choices: work from home - if they're up to it, if their job allows it and if their employer agrees, or go on sick leave for 10 days and receive 60% salary. For the self-employed it's worse. Only those who have chosen to pay state sickness insurance will receive anything. Most opt out - the benefits are marginal. So most continue working from home - if their health and profession allows it. For many workers, in other words, a positive Covid test can be a real blow to the wallet. It's an open secret that many people - especially freelancers in creative professions - beg friends and colleagues who test positive not to declare them as contacts, to avoid having to go into quarantine. For some the fear of losing work and money outweighs social responsibility. Moves to compensate people for taking time off work have largely been well received, writes Maddy Savage in Stockholm. To encourage people to stay at home from the moment they develop coronavirus symptoms, the government changed the rules to allow Swedish employees and the self-employed to claim sick pay from the first day they are off, rather than the second. Employees receive about 80% of their salary while they isolate (capped at SEK 700 or Â£61.88 per day), and the self-employed are entitled to payments capped at 804 SEK or Â£71.05. The government has also introduced an allowance for people isolating because they live with someone who has coronavirus. While Sweden has largely kept primary schools open throughout the pandemic, parents have been able to make use of a pre-existing benefit which allows them to take state-funded time off work if their children are ill (with the virus or any other illness), and an additional benefit has been introduced for parents who are forced to take time off work to look after children affected by school closures as a result of a local outbreak. But these measures have also stirred debates about welfare inequality. There are concerns that workers who are paid by the hour or on temporary contracts aren't entitled to the same level of sickness benefits as permanent staff - there are reports that this has encouraged some to keep working despite developing Covid-19 symptoms.

How worrying are new variants?,"Two new fast-spreading subvariants of Omicron are causing fresh surges of Covid around the world. BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa and may soon become the dominant strains in Europe and the US, health experts say. Ever since it first emerged, Covid has been mutating or shape-shifting. The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave. They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe. They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants. Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. Australia has reported cases too. Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit. BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall. But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily. This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread. BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths. As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions.
