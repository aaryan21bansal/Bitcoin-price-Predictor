Cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations,"Multiple allegations against Theodore McCarrick have emerged A former Roman Catholic cardinal has been defrocked after historical sexual abuse allegations. Theodore McCarrick is the most senior Catholic figure to be dismissed from the priesthood in modern times. US Church officials said allegations he had sexually assaulted a teenager five decades ago were credible. Mr McCarrick, 88, had previously resigned but said he had ""no recollection"" of the alleged abuse. ""No bishop, no matter how influential, is above the law of the Church,"" Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a statement. ""For all those McCarrick abused, I pray this judgment will be one small step, among many, toward healing."" The alleged abuses may have taken place too long ago for criminal charges to be filed because of the  statute of limitations. Mr McCarrick was the archbishop of Washington DC from 2001 to 2006. Since his resignation last year from the College of Cardinals, he has been living in seclusion in a monastery in Kansas. He was the first person to resign as a cardinal since 1927. He is among hundreds of members of the clergy accused of sexually abusing children over several decades and his dismissal comes days before the Vatican hosts a summit on preventing child abuse. Sex abuse and the Catholic Church The Vatican said Pope Francis had ruled Mr McCarrick's expulsion from the clergy as definitive, and would not allow any further appeals against the decision. Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor This is a significant moment in the Roman Catholic Church's effort to address the tide of sex abuse scandals - not least because of the high status this former Cardinal Archbishop once held. Not only was he the first cleric in more than 100 years to resign from the College of Cardinals, but his removal from the priesthood also confirms Pope Francis' assertion that anyone found guilty of abuse will be treated with zero tolerance, regardless of their status within the church. The Vatican has said that the investigative process was completed in January and Mr McCarrick was informed of the decision to dismiss him from the priesthood last night. It comes days before Pope Francis will host all the presidents of bishops conferences around the world at a summit in Rome. The summit is designed to reflect upon the global challenge of abuse and to develop protocols and procedures that could be applied across continents. Mr McCarrick is alleged to have assaulted the teenager while working as a priest in New York in the early 1970s. The claims were made public by the current Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan. He said an independent forensic agency had investigated the allegations. A review board, including legal experts, psychologists, parents and a priest, then found the allegations ""credible and substantiated"". At the time,Mr McCarrick said in a statement that had ""no recollection of this reported abuse"",externaland believed in his innocence. Several more men have since said the cleric forced them to sleep with him at a beach house in New Jersey, while they studied for the priesthood as adult seminarians. One man has come forward saying he was assaulted while still a minor. It has also since emerged that financial settlements were reached in at least two cases of alleged sexual misconduct with adults involving Mr McCarrick. They involved ""allegations of sexual misconduct with adults decades ago"", while he was working as a bishop in New Jersey, bishops in the state told US media. This video can not be played ""It's your word against God's"" video testimony from three Pennsylvania victims How does this fit into the widersexual abuse scandal? The dismissal of Mr McCarrick is the latest incident in a series of long-running cases of sexual abuse of children and young men by priests at the Church. In Germany,more than 3,600 children were assaulted by priestsbetween 1946 and 2014, a leaked report revealed in October 2018. In the US, a Pennsylvania grand jury named more than 300 clergy in a report which foundmore than 1,000 children had been abused.

US planes arrive with Venezuelan aid,"The first of several US military transport planes carrying humanitarian aid arrived in Cucuta on the Colombian border with Venezuela US military planes have been delivering humanitarian aid for Venezuela in the Colombian border town of Cucuta. The aid is being stockpiled at the request of the Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim president last month. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has alleged that the aid is part of a US plot to disguise an invasion into Venezuela. Mr GuaidÃ³ said some 600,000 Venezuelan volunteers would carry the aid across the border on 23 February. ""We will mobilise within and outside our borders,"" he said in a tweet on Saturday, adding: ""Our struggle continues to yield results!"" It remains unclear if the aid will be allowed to enter Venezuela. One road bridge between Venezuela and Colombia remains blocked on the Venezuelan side by shipping containers. Venezuela crisis in nine charts Speaking at a news conference in Cucuta, USAID administrator Mark Green said the aid had been requested by Mr GuaidÃ³ because Venezuela was in the grip of a growing humanitarian crisis.

He said meetings would take place with the Brazilian government this week to organise details of storage facilities in the Brazilian state of Roraima on the border with Venezuela.

Mr GuaidÃ³, who has been recognised by the US and most Western governments as interim president of Venezuela, said hundreds of thousands of volunteers had signed up to create brigades to help get the aid into the country.

""The message we have to get through to the armed forces is that they have one week to do the right thing.""

Emergency talks are under way between the airport, Derry City and Strabane District Council and the Department for Transport. The airport said it was ""reviewing options"" for resuming its Stansted service, which has been cancelled. Flybmi ceased operationson Saturday. Customers booked on Flybmi services have been advised not to travel to City of Derry Airport.

On Thursday,the UK government announced it would continue to provide funding for the flight between City of Derry Airport and London. The public service obligation (PSO) air route, the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, had been in place since 2017. It had been due to expire in May, but Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government would continue to subsidise the route until 2021. It was the only route Flybmi operated from City of Derry Airport. The airline operated two return flights each day, except Saturdays when there was one flight each way. Ryanairformerly operated a routebetween the airport and Stansted but axed the flights in March 2017. Danny McLaughlin, a civil engineer from County Donegal, had 14 flights booked over the next seven weeks between City of Derry Airport and London Stansted. ""I'm a bit stunned to be honest with you,"" he said. ""I feel sorry for the staff. I probably will get a bit annoyed as the weekend goes on and on Monday morning when I can't get to work."" Flybmi said uncertainty over Brexit and rises in fuel and carbon costs led it to go into administration. ""I'm really in Brexitland,"" Mr McLaughlin added. ""I'm three miles from the border. For me, personally, it's the first thing really that's affected me. And then, in 41 days' time we just don't know what's going to happen three miles up the road."" Flybmi has a fleet of Embraer jets President of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, Brian McGrath, issued a statement saying the news was ""terribly disappointing"". ""The Derry to Stansted link is an incredibly important one for connecting those who live here in the north west to London,"" said Mr McGrath. ""The loss of this will also be very damaging to businesses in the region who rely on this flight."" Financial journalist Paul Gosling told BBC News NI's The Sunday News that there had been a degree of ""reputational damage"" to the airport. ""It will make many passengers wary about whether this is the right airport for them,"" he said. He added that it was likely a new airline would be found ""in the near future"". However he said there were still worries about the airport's future: ""As soon as there is a good road connection between Derry and Belfast International Airport, there will be questions about its viability and sustainability,"" he said. BBC News NI reporter Rick Faragher, at City of Derry Airport Standing in the City of Derry Airport main terminal entrance, the footfall is still fairly busy. Emergency talks are still under way between the airport, the local council and the UK Department for Transport. It's a unique route in many ways because it's subsided by the government. With regards to reviewing options for resuming that Stansted service, the general consensus is that a replacement airline must be found as soon as possible. That will allow those very important economic links between the north west and London to be preserved. On Saturday evening, the airport tweeted: ""BMI with immediate effect no longer operate the London Stansted service. ""If you have seats booked on this service, please contact your credit card company to receive your refund. ""We are reviewing options for resuming the service with another airline as soon as possible."" DUP MP for East Londonderry Gregory Campbell said he spoke to Mr Grayling about the future of the route ""shortly after the news broke"" on Saturday evening. ""Obviously there is concern given that this is the single, direct air connection between Londonderry and London,"" he said. ""The transport secretary indicated that he is hopeful that a new operator will agree to take on the route. ""There needs to be as seamless a transition as possible from Flybmi to the new operator in order that the travelling public suffer as little as possible."" Sinn FÃ©in councillor Sandra Duffy said the news was a ""huge concern"" for the economy in the north west. In July 2018a leaked report said City of Derry Airport could close within a yearbecause of a multi-million pound shortfall in funding. At that time, there was uncertainty over whether or not the subsidy for the PSO route to London would be extended beyond May 2019. The report said that if the subsidy was not extended the London route would cease and ""the airport will no longer be sustainable"". The airport is owned by Derry and Strabane District Council. Flybmi is an East Midlands-based airline, which has 376 staff, operates 17 planes and flies to 25 European cities. Affected passengers have been told to contact their travel agents or insurance and credit card companies.

Lady Falkender, once dubbed the Duchess of Downing Street, died on 6 February. She was Mr Wilson's private and political secretary from 1956 to 1983, which included his leadership of the Labour Party and his time in office. She was one of the most powerful women in politics during Mr Wilson's premiership and came to prominence following his 1976 resignation. Lady Falkender was believed by many to wield more influence than MPs and even cabinet ministers - something she always denied. ""I don't think I ever had any influences on policies because, as I say, it wasn't my role really. Everyone knew where I stood on things,"" she once said. ""If I had any at all, it's because they heard my voice and very often if there were a crowd of people around, mostly civil servants of the prime minister, he would be arguing policy out and he would be saying the things he wanted to hear. ""I might possibly be the only voice in the room saying things he didn't want to hear."" Harold Wilson with Lady Falkender were often described as ""political soulmates"" Paying tribute, Lord Lipsey, who worked as a political adviser in Mr Wilson's government, said Lady Falkender might not have had much influence over policy, but had a ""general influence"" over Mr Wilson and was his ""confidante"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was a ""formidable personality"" who the Labour prime minister could turn to ""when things were getting tough"". Following Mr Wilson's sudden resignation in 1976, it was claimed Lady Falkender drafted his controversial resignation honours list - which included his publisher, his raincoat manufacturer and a property tycoon. The list was dubbed The Lavender List because some of the names were written on lavender-coloured paper in Lady Falkender's handwriting. However, it was later pointed out that it is normal for secretaries to put their employer's dictated thoughts into writing. Harold Wilson pictured with Baroness Falkender following his 1966 election win In 2007, Lady Falkender successfully sued the BBC for libel over her portrayal in a drama-documentary which wrongly claimed she had compiled the list and that she had included people for her own personal interests. The programme also wrongly suggested that she had a brief affair with Mr Wilson and used this to blackmail him. She was awarded Â£75,000 in libel damages. Lady Falkender, born Marcia Field on 10 March, 1932, was educated at Northampton High School before attending Queen Mary College, University of London. She was married for five years to George Williams, but the relationship foundered when he wanted to live and work in the US and she did not. She had a long-running relationship with the late Walter Terry, a one-time political editor of the Daily Mail and Mr Wilson's favourite political reporter. Lady Falkender and Mr Terry had two sons in the late 1960s. Baroness Falkender making her first appearance in the House of Lords She was made a peer in the House of Lords in 1974, but she did not speak during her four decades there. ""My peerage has been a great problem to me because I have never known how to handle it. But now I know myself pretty well,"" she once said. ""And I think if the press has got me wrong there is nothing I can do to put it right."" Remembering Harold Wilson. Video, 00:01:11Remembering Harold Wilson BBC man David Holmes interviews PM.

Hammond's visit to China not going ahead,"A visit to China by Chancellor Phillip Hammond has been called off amid reports a speech by the UK's defence secretary angered Beijing. There were plans for trade talks between Mr Hammond and senior Chinese government figures during the brief visit next week. Earlier this week, Gavin Williamson had indicated the UK's intention to send an aircraft carrier to the Pacific. An MoD source has denied the visit was scrapped because of the speech. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""No trip was ever announced or confirmed."" In the speech, Mr Williamsonannounced the HMS Queen Elizabethwould be deployed to the region, as well as the Middle East and the Mediterranean, on its maiden voyage. China is currently involved in a dispute over territorial claims in the Pacific. Six countries have competing claims over the South China Sea islands. Mr Williamsonalso said that China,externalwas ""developing its modern military capability and its commercial power"". Unconfirmed newspaper reports claimed the Chinese government was unhappy about the speech. But an MoD source told BBC political correspondent Ben Wright it was not the case that the speech had led to the visit being cancelled. The speech was seen and cleared by both Number 10 and the Treasury, the source said. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said Mr Williamson's comments had ""raised eyebrows"". ""While a source has told me that no final decision has been taken on this visit, it does seem clear, at least from the Chinese side, that it is not going to happen for now,"" our correspondent added. Meanwhile, former Chancellor George Osborne said he found it ""very difficult"" to work out the UK government's policy on China. He told BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster: ""You've got the defence secretary engaging in gunboat diplomacy of a quite old-fashioned kind. ""At the same time as the chancellor of the exchequer and the foreign secretary are going around saying they want a close economic partnership with China. ""Ultimately it's the responsibility of Theresa May to sort this out. At the moment it looks all at sea."" Prime Minister Theresa Mayvisited China for three dayslast year in a bid to boost trade and investment. Ahead of the trip, she said her visit would ""intensify the golden era in UK-China relations"". Speaking at the time, she said she expected China to play a ""huge role"" in the economic development which is why she would be ""deepening co-operation with China on key global and economic issues."" UK trade with China has increased dramatically in recent years. The government will be hoping to build on that rise after Brexit when the UK will look to complete more bilateral trade deals. In 2018, China was the UK's fourth largest trading partner behind Germany, the US and the Netherlands,according to HMRC figures for imports and exports.,externalUK-China trade was worth Â£63.4bn. The UK ran a trade deficit of Â£21.8bn with the country last year. Imports from China were worth Â£42.6bn, whereas exports, largely made up from car sales, were worth Â£20.8bn. Thames Water, Hinkley Point nuclear power station, Scottish flight comparison site Skyscanner, Pizza Express and West Bromwich Albion FC are among those to have recently received investment from Chinese companies and entrepreneurs. But growth in China's economy is slowing. Official figures released last month showed its economy expanded at itsslowest rate(6.6%) since 1990, while car sales in the countryfell by 6% in 2018- the first fall in two decades. The rate of expansion has raised worries about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. What does China's slowdown mean for the UK? How does China-UK trade compare globally? This video can not be played In August last year, a BBC team flew over the disputed South China Sea islands in a US military plane Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years. Six countries have competing claims over the territory: China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. They dispute who owns ocean areas, and two island chains - the Paracels and the Spratlys. It is possible the largely uninhabited islands may have reserves of natural resources around them and the sea is also a major shipping route and home to fishing grounds that supply the livelihoods of people across the region.

Reality Check: UK-China trade,"The UK prime minister and the Chinese Premier have agreed on a new trade and investment review, seen as a stepping stone to a full free trade agreement after Brexit. Theresa May says sheexpects deals worth Â£9bn to be signed during the course of her visit. Chinese media is awash withclaims that China and the UK are still living out the ""golden era"",externalof economic ties first proclaimed by David Cameron's government in 2015. But how much is the relationship worth to each country - and how does it compare globally? In terms of total trade in goods and services, China is the UK's fifth largest trading partner (in terms of countries) - and the second largest non-EU partner after the United States. In 2016, UK-China trade was worth Â£59.1bn. The UK ran a trade deficit of Â£25.4bn with China in 2016. Imports from China were Â£42.3bn, whereas UK exports to China were worth Â£16.8bn. However, British exports to China have increased by 64% since 2010. China lifting its ban on British beef might have made the news today, but Dr Jan Knoerich, from King's College London's Lau Institute, says that ""the big story, long-term, is for the UK to increase its export of services to China"". The UK had a surplus of Â£1.6bn on trade in services with China in 2016, the largest being travel services. In contrast, when you look at goods, China exports Â£27.1bn more to the UK than the UK does to China. Chinese companies invested about Â£20bn in Britain in 2017, according to theAmerican Enterprise Institute and Heritage Foundation,external. One of the best known investments is thecontroversial Hinkley Point nuclear power station, but some of their other interesting ones over the years include: The 'Cheesegrater' - the tallest building in London's financial district was sold to Hong Kong-based CC Land for around Â£1.15bn in March 2017. Skyscanner - the Scottish flight price aggregator was sold to the Chinese travel firm Ctrip International in 2016. Hamleys, the toy shop, was bought by C Banner International Holdings in 2015 - and in December the world's largest Hamleys opened in Beijing. The breakfast cereal Weetabix was bought by the Chinese company Bright Food in 2012 - but then sold again in 2017 to an American company, reportedly afterfailing to crack the Chinese breakfast market.,external The EU is China's largest trading partner in goods, with the United States and countries from the Asia-Pacific region making up the rest of the top 10. In 2016, the UK was China's 20th largest source of imports, and its 10th largest market for exports,according to the World Bank.,external However, within the EU, the UK is China's second largest trading partner. Germany is its largest. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Who owned the plane Sala died in?,"Emiliano Sala was flying from Nantes to Cardiff when his plane crashed The obscure world of plane ownership is under the spotlight following the death of Cardiff City player Emiliano Sala. While the wreckage of the aircraft rests at the bottom of the English Channel - holding, investigators hope, at least some of the answers as to how this tragedy unfolded - parallels could be drawn with the impenetrable trail of ownership and registration enveloping this plane. This story has dominated the headlines for more than two weeks and has fuelled speculation in some circles about safety and regulatory issues in this area of aviation. Cardiff's record signing agreed to join the Bluebirds for Â£15m on 19 January- their great hope in a fraught season fighting to stay in the Premier League - but fate conspired that he would never kick a ball for the club. A minute's silence was held for Sala before Cardiff's match against Southampton Two days later, after a quick trip to his previous club Nantes to say farewell to friends, the 28-year-old Argentine boarded the Piper Malibu N264DB. Football agent Willie McKay, whose son Mark was acting for Nantes in the transfer, arranged the flight, which was piloted by David Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire. It lost contact with air traffic control north of Guernsey after requesting permission to descend from 5,000ft (1,500m) to 2,300ft (700m). Wreckage of the plane was found on the seabedtwo weeks later by a private underwater search paid for by a fundraising appeal. One body was still on board andDorset Police confirmed late on Thursday night it was Sala. The body of Mr Ibbotson, a 59-year-old father of three, has not been found. Mystery surrounds who owned the plane The N prefix on the plane means it was registered in the US, but it is thought it was based in Britain - often flying out of Retford Gamston Airport in Nottinghamshire. It is not unusual for US-registered aircraft to be based elsewhere. A source has told us that this might be done for legal or pragmatic reasons, the maintenance and regulatory regime in the US being perceived as less stringent than in Europe. This is entirely lawful and it is estimated there are hundreds of planes flying out of UK airports registered this way. Documents from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US reveal the aircraft was registered in the name of a ""trustee"" firm - Southern Aircraft Consultancy (SAC), based in Bungay, Suffolk. This serves as an administrative ""screen"" and obscures the true beneficial owner or owners of an aircraft - the people with ultimate control and use of it. On its website, SAC says: ""We specialise in providing individual trust agreements to non-US citizens to enable them to legally register their aircraft on the American 'N' register."" SAC said it could not divulge who the owners were due to data protection laws, but had passed this information to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). The registration document can be found on the FAA database, stating the fixed-wing, single-engine aircraft's year of manufacture was 1984. But an associated document disclosing more ownership detail, including any associated companies or individuals, appears to have been removed from the database. It was reported that David Henderson was asked to fly the plane One person who is known to have a connection to the aircraft is David Henderson. Mr Henderson, 60, from York, is an experienced charter pilot who was filmed by the BBC with the plane at Retford Gamston Airport in 2015 for a feature about ferry flying - the perilous but lucrative activity of transporting small planes across continents to new owners. In the hours after the disappearance of N264DB, he was reported by French media as having been on board the plane - it is thought because his name was on Nantes airport documentation relating to the flight. 'A South American warrior' Timeline of Cardiff signing Sala Who is the man behind the Sala plane search? Mr Henderson posted a Facebook message early on the morning of 22 January stating that rumours of his death were untrue. In an interview with a French newspaper, Willie McKay, whose family organised the flight, has been reported as saying that he asked Mr Henderson to fly Emiliano Sala. It is believed that Mr Henderson was unable to do the trip and Mr Ibbotson flew the plane instead. The BBC has tried several times to speak to Mr Henderson but he has not issued any comment. There are restrictions on the use of US-registered aircraft anywhere outside of the country. BBC Wales understands that in order to fly a US-registered aircraft outside the US with paying passengers, the owner or operator must hold an Air Operators' Certificate and the pilot must have a commercial licence. Both UK and US law state private pilots cannot make a profit by carrying passengers. Many pilots who only hold a private licence are signed up withonline flight-sharing platforms such as Wingly- which has been described as ""the Uber of the skies"" - connecting passengers with pilots. As flying is an expensive pastime, this allows pilots to notch up their flying hours while sharing the cost of fuel, landing fees and other expenses with passengers. In a blog post in May 2018, Tony Rapson, head of Civil Aviation Authority's general aviation unit, warned: ""It is important that the risks and the nature of the flight are understood,externalby both parties."" The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu at the bottom of the English Channel The complex nature of pilot licensing and the opaque nature of the aircraft ownership make for many unanswered questions about where liability rests in the event of a disaster such as this. If any illegality is established around the flight carrying Sala from France to Wales, the aircraft's insurers may ultimately question their liability - this could potentially leave the plane's hull and third party liability insurance null and void. The company that insured the plane is understood to be specialist aviation insurers Hayward Aviation, who declined to comment. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch spokesman said, ""We will be looking at operational aspects of the flight including licensing and flight plans."" Its safety investigation ""does not apportion blame or liability"" and any separate inquiry into licensing matters would be instigated by the CAA's enforcement division. David Ibbotson was said to live for flying David Ibbotson was a keen amateur pilot who worked as a gas boiler engineer and sometime DJ. The CAA confirmed he held a private pilot's licence in the UK. He also held a US private pilot's licence, issued in 2014, which he passed a medical for in November. It is not known if he held a pilot's licence in any other country. Described by one friend as a man who ""lived for flying,"" he flew parachutists and skydivers from Hibaldstow Airfield in North Lincolnshire. A former member of the British Parachute Association's council, he was well-known in skydiving circles in the north of England. It is thought that he was flying parachutists on a non-commercial, voluntary basis for expenses only. Mr Ibbotson was a regular at The Red Lion pub in his hometown of Crowle Posting on a skydivers' forum under his nickname of Dibbo in October 2012, he refers to having more than 3,000 hours flying experience, including 2,000 flying parachutists. He said he was ""available at short notice, and very reliable, just back recently from six weeks flying in Norway"". As well as being a man who had a passion for flying it is also known that Mr Ibbotson faced challenges. He had Â£23,400 worth ofcounty court judgements,externalagainst him - at least one of which is thought to be related to his work as a gas boiler engineer. The most recent, for Â£4,412, was imposed just 10 days before the fatal flight left Nantes. While it is known that Saladid not pay for the flightwhat is not known is if Mr Ibbotson would have undertaken such a journey without payment in line with the constraints of his licence. Mr Ibbotson's family have yet to speak publicly about their loss. The pub where he was a regular, The Red Lion in Crowle, has opened a book of condolence and family and friends have been laying flowers and tributes in the centre of the village. In a statement released on Friday,Sala's family said their thoughts went out""to David Ibbotson and his family, hoping that the authorities will do their best to find him"". While the grieving process for the Sala family can begin, the agony and uncertainty for Mr Ibbotson's loved ones goes on.

"MP's outrage at CPS over swastikasThe CPS said no prosecution could be brought because the ""evidential test"" had not been met.Leeds & West Yorkshire","Paula Sherriff says she faces far-right abuse on a regular basis A decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to bring a prosecution after swastikas were left outside Paula Sherriff's office has been branded ""disgraceful"" by the Labour MP.

She said three swastikas were left at her office in July and August, and she has had many death threats and other forms of abuse, and fears for her life. Ms Sherriff, whose constituency neighbours Batley and Spen,where Ms Cox was killed, said the CPS ruled out a prosecution because the suspect ""did not fit any charges"", which she found ""absolutely disgraceful"". In September, localnewspaper editor Danny Lockwood was ""outraged"" when armed police arrested himin connection with suspected hate crimes against Ms Sherriff. He has been ruled out of the investigation. Ms Sherriff said she has been targeted for far-right abuse daily, sometimes suffering hundreds of such incidents in a week. Jo Cox was murdered in a neighbouring constituency in the run-up to the EU referendum Her staff have had to put safety procedures in place around her Wellington Road office, such as going to lunch in pairs. She also said West Yorkshire Police had not taken her complaints of abuse and threats seriously. The MP said she had ""no faith"" in the force, despite her father being in the police. ""My trust in the police has been really eroded,"" she said. MP wears bodycam amid growing abuse MP urges police action over 'Nazi taunts' 'I'm frightened for my safety' - MP Gerry Wareham, chief crown prosecutor for Yorkshire and Humberside, said: ""We considered this case carefully but the evidential test was not met to prove a criminal offence so we could not prosecute. The suspect was issued with a harassment warning. ""We understand Ms Sheriff's concerns and take any potential threat of this nature very seriously. We have offered to meet with her to explain our decision in full."" West Yorkshire Police said: ""We can confirm a complaint has been received in relation to the police handling of an investigation into incidents in July and August 2018, when offensive material was left outside the constituency office of a local MP. ""This matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct who are conducting an independent inquiry."" The force said the ""tragic murder of Jo Cox in 2016 further emphasised the risks our MPs can face and West Yorkshire Police regularly reviews security arrangements, in accordance with national protocols"". ""West Yorkshire Police has local processes to ensure there is an effective response to any threats made towards or concerns raised by local MPs.""

Karl Marx monument vandalised again,"Karl Marx's memorial in Highgate Cemetery has been vandalised for the second time in two weeks Karl Marx's memorial in north London has been vandalised for the second time in two weeks. The words ""Doctrine of Hate"" and ""Architect of Genocide"" are scrawled in red on the Grade I-listed grave in Highgate Cemetery. This latest incident follows a ""deliberate and sustained""hammer attack on 4 Februarythat left the memorial badly damaged. There have been no arrests in connection with either attack. Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust said the German philosopher's memorial would ""never be the same again"" following the previous attack. The words ""Doctrine of Hate"", ""Architect of Genocide"" and ""Memorial to Bolshevik holocaust"" were painted in red on the memorial Maxwell Blowfield, from the British Museum, said he was ""quite shocked"" to see the most recent act of vandalism when he visited the cemetery earlier with his mother. The 31-year-old said it was particularly sad because tourists regularly visited the site. What is Marx's Das Kapital? Karl Marx monument 'mindlessly' attacked The famous cemetery running out of space ""It's a highlight of the cemetery"". ""It's a shame. The red paint will disappear, I assume, but to see that kind of level of damage and to see it happen twice, it's not good,"" he continued. ""I am just surprised that somebody in 2019 feels they need to [go] and do something like that."" The marble plaque on the memorial was attacked with a hammer on 4 February In 1970 a pipe bomb blew up part of the plaque's marble face, that was first used for Marx's wife Jenny von Westphalen in 1881. The plaque was subsequently moved when both Marx and his wife were exhumed and moved to a more prominent location within the cemetery in 1954. It has also been covered in Swastikas and emulsion paint has been thrown at it, in the past. What is Marx's Das Kapital? Is Marxism relevant to the UK today?

'Many civilians' still trapped with IS,"Civilians have been fleeing Baghuz in their hundreds over the past week The battle to claim the last pocket of territory from the Islamic State group (IS) is being held up because thousands of civilians remain trapped there. US-backed Kurdish forces launched an assault on Baghuz, on the Syrian side of the Iraqi border, last week. US President Donald Trump said on Friday the defeat of IS would be announced ""over the next 24 hours"". But those 24 hours passed on Saturday with no announcement from the White House on the defeat of IS. Instead, Kurdish fighters said the news was likely to emerge ""in the coming few days"" as civilians continued to flee. Jiya Furat, the leader of the battle for Baghuz for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said IS fighters were now trapped in a section of the town that was 700 metres long and wide. ""Thousands of civilians are still trapped there as human shields,"" he said on Saturday. ""In the coming few days, in a very short time, we will spread the good tidings to the world of the military end of Daesh [IS]."" SDF spokesman Adnan Afrin told Agence France-Presse they were surprised to learn how many civilians were still inside. The SDF had to slow its approach as a result, he said. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Why is there a war in Syria? The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 440 IS fighters had surrendered over the past few days, but the SDF believes a few hundred remain trapped in Baghuz. The Observatory said efforts were under way to find IS fighters hiding in tunnels they had dug around Baghuz. Four years ago IS controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq, proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"", imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. But in December, Mr Trump surprisingly announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria as he believed IS had been ""beaten"". Islamic State group: The full story What is jihadism? Then on Friday afternoon, he said: ""We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate and that will be announced over the next 24 hours."" This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? IS has suffered substantial losses, but the UN has said it still reportedly controls between 14,000 and 18,000 militants in Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile, there are significant numbers of IS-affiliated militants in Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, South-East Asia and West Africa, and to a lesser extent in Somalia, Yemen and the Sahel.

Downfall's Hitler actor Bruno Ganz dies,"Ganz was well-known in German-language cinema and theatre Bruno Ganz, who played Hitler in the 2004 film Downfall, has died aged 77. The Swiss actor died at home in Zurich on Friday night, his management said. Ganz was well-known in German-language cinema and theatre and also had roles in English-language films including The Reader and The Manchurian Candidate. His most famous role, however, was as Adolf Hitler in Downfall. One particular scene depicting Hitler in apoplectic fury became a meme and spawned thousands of parodies online. The film, called Der Untergang in German, told the story of Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker. It grossed $92m (Â£71.3m) at box offices around the world when it was released. Inside Hitler's WW2 bunker office How the BBC told the world Hitler was dead Is this 1921 cartoon the first ever meme? It was named winner of the BBC Four World Cinema award and was nominated for an Academy award for best foreign language film, but since then it has become almost as famous for a wave of internet parodies of its final scene, poking fun at numerous news events. A New York Times reviewer,externalcalled Ganz's performance ""intriguing"" and ""creepily charismatic"". Tributes were paid to Ganz at the end of the Berlin film festival on Saturday, hosted by actress Anke Engelke In 2005Ganz told The Guardian newspaper that he spent four months preparing,externalfor the role, studying historical records including a secretly-recorded tape of Hitler and observing people with Parkinson's disease, which he came to believe the dictator had. But he said: ""I cannot claim to understand Hitler. Even the witnesses who had been in the bunker with him were not really able to describe the essence of the man. ""He had no pity, no compassion, no understanding of what the victims of war suffered."" Ganz, probably the most famous Swiss actor, had a rich and varied career. He appeared in Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979) and played an angel in Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire (1987) and its sequel Faraway, So Close! (1993). He also starred in noir film The American Friend (1977) and science fiction movie The Boys from Brazil (1978), which starred Sir Laurence Olivier. In 2008 he had a role in The Baader Meinhof Complex and his last role was in Lars von Trier's 2018 film The House that Jack Built. At the time of his death, Ganz was the holder of the Iffland-Ring, an accolade to the German-speaking actor judged ""most significant and worthy"". The ring is passed from person to person, and it is not yet clear who Ganz had intended to transfer it to after his death. It was reported that Ganz had been diagnosed with colon cancer.

Oscars to show awards live after backlash,"Roger Deakins (r), who won his first Oscar for cinematography last year after 14 nominations, criticised the initial decision The organisers of the Oscars have reversed an earlier decision to hand out four awards during ad breaks after facing a major backlash. The presentations for live action short, cinematography, editing and make-up and hair were to be streamed online in an effort to shorten this year's TV broadcast on 24 February. Dozens of directors, cinematographers and actors had criticised the decision. Organisers said they had heard the ""feedback"" and changed their mind. A statement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said: ""All Academy Awards will be presented without edits, in our traditional format. We look forward to Oscar Sunday, February 24."" Oscar nominations: What to expect Oscars 2019: Snubs and surprises This is not the first controversy to hit this year's awards ceremony -the Academy had decided to introduce a new popular film categorybut decided to postpone it after a backlash. The show will also have no main host after actor Kevin Hart pulled out following controversy over homophobic tweets. The Academy emailed its members on 11 February to say that, in order to keep the show down to three hours, they would present four awards during commercial breaks. Previous ceremonies have gone on for more than four hours and last year's broadcast had an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. Prominent figures in the film industry objected, including Russell Crowe who called it ""a fundamentally stupid decision"". Double Oscar winner Alfonso CuarÃ³n, whose film Roma is nominated for 10 Oscars this year including best cinematography, was one of the first to object. Allow Twitter content?

Before reversing its decision, the Academy had tried to reassure its members that no award category ""will be presented in a manner that depicts the achievements of its nominees and winners as less than any others"". The ceremony will be live streamed for the first time this year. The winning speeches for the four categories in question would have been aired later in the TV broadcast in an edited form.

Harold Wilson's powerful secretary dies,"Marcia Williams arriving at Downing Street in 1975 Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson's secretary Baroness Falkender - formerly Marcia Williams - has died aged 86. Lady Falkender, once dubbed the Duchess of Downing Street, died on 6 February. She was Mr Wilson's private and political secretary from 1956 to 1983, which included his leadership of the Labour Party and his time in office. She was one of the most powerful women in politics during Mr Wilson's premiership and came to prominence following his 1976 resignation. Lady Falkender was believed by many to wield more influence than MPs and even cabinet ministers - something she always denied. ""I don't think I ever had any influences on policies because, as I say, it wasn't my role really. Everyone knew where I stood on things,"" she once said. ""If I had any at all, it's because they heard my voice and very often if there were a crowd of people around, mostly civil servants of the prime minister, he would be arguing policy out and he would be saying the things he wanted to hear. ""I might possibly be the only voice in the room saying things he didn't want to hear."" Harold Wilson with Lady Falkender were often described as ""political soulmates"" Paying tribute, Lord Lipsey, who worked as a political adviser in Mr Wilson's government, said Lady Falkender might not have had much influence over policy, but had a ""general influence"" over Mr Wilson and was his ""confidante"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was a ""formidable personality"" who the Labour prime minister could turn to ""when things were getting tough"". Following Mr Wilson's sudden resignation in 1976, it was claimed Lady Falkender drafted his controversial resignation honours list - which included his publisher, his raincoat manufacturer and a property tycoon. The list was dubbed The Lavender List because some of the names were written on lavender-coloured paper in Lady Falkender's handwriting. However, it was later pointed out that it is normal for secretaries to put their employer's dictated thoughts into writing. Harold Wilson pictured with Baroness Falkender following his 1966 election win In 2007, Lady Falkender successfully sued the BBC for libel over her portrayal in a drama-documentary which wrongly claimed she had compiled the list and that she had included people for her own personal interests. The programme also wrongly suggested that she had a brief affair with Mr Wilson and used this to blackmail him. She was awarded Â£75,000 in libel damages. Lady Falkender, born Marcia Field on 10 March, 1932, was educated at Northampton High School before attending Queen Mary College, University of London. She was married for five years to George Williams, but the relationship foundered when he wanted to live and work in the US and she did not. She had a long-running relationship with the late Walter Terry, a one-time political editor of the Daily Mail and Mr Wilson's favourite political reporter. Lady Falkender and Mr Terry had two sons in the late 1960s. Baroness Falkender making her first appearance in the House of Lords She was made a peer in the House of Lords in 1974, but she did not speak during her four decades there. ""My peerage has been a great problem to me because I have never known how to handle it. But now I know myself pretty well,"" she once said. ""And I think if the press has got me wrong there is nothing I can do to put it right."" Remembering Harold Wilson. Video, 00:01:11Remembering Harold Wilson BBC man David Holmes interviews PM.

Oscars to show awards live after backlashThe move reverses an earlier decision to give four awards during TV commercial breaks.Entertainment & Arts,"Roger Deakins (r), who won his first Oscar for cinematography last year after 14 nominations, criticised the initial decision The organisers of the Oscars have reversed an earlier decision to hand out four awards during ad breaks after facing a major backlash. The presentations for live action short, cinematography, editing and make-up and hair were to be streamed online in an effort to shorten this year's TV broadcast on 24 February. Dozens of directors, cinematographers and actors had criticised the decision. Organisers said they had heard the ""feedback"" and changed their mind. A statement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said: ""All Academy Awards will be presented without edits, in our traditional format. We look forward to Oscar Sunday, February 24."" Oscar nominations: What to expect Oscars 2019: Snubs and surprises This is not the first controversy to hit this year's awards ceremony -the Academy had decided to introduce a new popular film categorybut decided to postpone it after a backlash. The show will also have no main host after actor Kevin Hart pulled out following controversy over homophobic tweets. The Academy emailed its members on 11 February to say that, in order to keep the show down to three hours, they would present four awards during commercial breaks. Previous ceremonies have gone on for more than four hours and last year's broadcast had an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. Prominent figures in the film industry objected, including Russell Crowe who called it ""a fundamentally stupid decision"". Double Oscar winner Alfonso CuarÃ³n, whose film Roma is nominated for 10 Oscars this year including best cinematography, was one of the first to object. Allow Twitter content?

Before reversing its decision, the Academy had tried to reassure its members that no award category ""will be presented in a manner that depicts the achievements of its nominees and winners as less than any others"".

Short intense exercise 'aids weight loss',"Sprint interval training is most effective for weight loss, researchers suggest Bursts of high intensity interval training (Hiit) may be more effective for weight loss than longer less intense workouts, a study suggests. The research, published in theBritish Journal of Sports Medicine,external, analysed results from 36 earlier studies. Although all the participants lost weight, those doing Hiit saw a 28.5% greater weight loss. The researchers cautioned that Hiit may not be suitable for everyone. ""Hiit might increase the risk of injury and impose higher cardiovascular stress,"" they said. Researchers from the Federal University of Goias, Brazil, analysed data from 576 men and 522 women of varying levels of fitness. Interval training was defined as cardiovascular exercise which involved repeated brief bursts of intense effort, interspersed with recovery periods. Cycling, swimming, running and boxing were included. These workouts were compared with longer continuous moderate intensity workouts, most of which were between 30 and 45 minutes.  All participants exercised for at least four weeks. Those doing interval training lost on average 1.58kg (3.48lb) compared with the 1.13kg (2.49lb) lost by those doing lower intensity workouts. 'Fit in three minutes' claim tested How to do Hiit at home Is there a shortcut to getting fit? Sprint interval training seemed to be particularly effective for weight loss, although researchers did caution that the wide variety of training programmes made it difficult to recommend one regime in particular. The NHS currently recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as cycling or brisk walking, every week. Dr Niels Vollaard, a lecturer in health and exercise science at the University of Stirling, said the results were counterintuitive as most people burned more calories during longer moderate exercise. ""There are two possible explanations,"" he said. ""Firstly, Hiit may lead to greater energy expenditure after exercise - metabolism may be increased for up to a day following a Hiit session. ""Secondly, after a Hiit session, you may be less hungry. ""In our research, we have shown that appetite hormones are indeed affected. ""It is, however, not easy to study whether energy intake is reduced as a result of this in the longer term when following a Hiit routine, so at the moment we are still unsure exactly what the reason is."" Interval training at the gym Michael Mosley, who was introduced to Hiit seven years ago while making the BBC Horizon documentary The Truth about Exercise, said: ""In 2012, I tested three lots of 20-second high intensity workouts on an exercise bike, three times a week. ""My insulin sensitivity improved by 24%. ""In the programme, we again saw very impressive results with younger, unfit people. ""The biggest problem with exercise is compensatory eating and relaxing afterwards. ""People go on a treadmill for 30 minutes, burn around 120 calories, then lie around and reward themselves with a muffin. ""The theory with Hiit seems to be that it suppresses your appetite and targets the visceral fat in your gut. ""It's not the calories you burn that matter - it's what you do next.""

Reality Check: Thefts of catalytic convertersWhat is the scale of the problem and what may be done to discourage thieves?UK,"There have been many posts on social media in the past few weeks from people shocked at having had the catalytic converters stolen from their cars. There werevideos posted online,externalof masked thieves climbing under cars in broad daylight to saw off the components. Catalytic converters are part of a car's exhaust system that convert some of the pollutants into less harmful substances. They are relatively easy to remove from a car, especially those, such as 4x4s, that are further off the ground, and contain precious metals such as platinum and palladium. The thefts mean large costs for motorists or their insurers because the converter has to be replaced and the damage caused to the vehicle by removing it has to be fixed. Anecdotally, thefts of catalytic converters tend to rise when platinum and palladium prices are high. But it is hard to find figures for how widespread the problem is, becausethe Home Office does not record it,externalas a separate offence. The Times newspaper submitted Freedom of Information requests to the 43 police forces in England and Wales to ask them how many incidents of catalytic converter theft had been reported. It received data from 22 of those forces, which said they had had 637 reported incidents in 2017. But the forces responding did not include the biggest force - the Metropolitan Police. The Met told BBC Reality Check that the only data it held was for the period since July 2018, when it had recorded 900 reported thefts of catalytic converters. The theft of catalytic converters is not a new phenomenon -BBC News reportedthat just over 1,100 had been taken across Britain, not including London, in 2009. The Scrap Metal Dealer Act 2013,externalwas supposed to make it harder for thieves to sell stolen components, by requiring dealers to be licensed and preventing them paying cash for scrap. But after an initial peak in 2014,the number of convictions,externalin the category that includes scrap metal dealing has fallen sharply. Trade association the British Metals Recycling Association has said stretched resources mean the police are unlikely to prosecute scrap dealers operating illegally and are more likely to encourage them to apply for licences retrospectively. Indeed, it is not unusual to see advertisements for illegal scrap metal dealers offering cash for scrap. The Met suggests worried car-owners take steps to make their vehicles less vulnerable, such as: A serial number could be engraved on the catalytic converter to make it easier to trace and harder to sell at a reputable dealer If the converter is bolted on, it may be possible to weld the bolts shut, although that would deter only thieves working with just a spanner Protective coverings are available that make the converters harder to steal, although they are ""quite expensive"" High-clearance vehicles (such as 4x4s) could be parked near walls or other vehicles to make it harder to climb underneath them Security lighting, CCTV or alarms may also deter thieves What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Karl Marx monument vandalised againIt is the second time in two weeks the philosopher's grave has been attacked in Highgate Cemetery.London,"Karl Marx's memorial in Highgate Cemetery has been vandalised for the second time in two weeks Karl Marx's memorial in north London has been vandalised for the second time in two weeks. The words ""Doctrine of Hate"" and ""Architect of Genocide"" are scrawled in red on the Grade I-listed grave in Highgate Cemetery. This latest incident follows a ""deliberate and sustained""hammer attack on 4 Februarythat left the memorial badly damaged. There have been no arrests in connection with either attack. Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust said the German philosopher's memorial would ""never be the same again"" following the previous attack. The words ""Doctrine of Hate"", ""Architect of Genocide"" and ""Memorial to Bolshevik holocaust"" were painted in red on the memorial Maxwell Blowfield, from the British Museum, said he was ""quite shocked"" to see the most recent act of vandalism when he visited the cemetery earlier with his mother. The 31-year-old said it was particularly sad because tourists regularly visited the site. What is Marx's Das Kapital? Karl Marx monument 'mindlessly' attacked The famous cemetery running out of space ""It's a highlight of the cemetery"". ""It's a shame. The red paint will disappear, I assume, but to see that kind of level of damage and to see it happen twice, it's not good,"" he continued. ""I am just surprised that somebody in 2019 feels they need to [go] and do something like that."" The marble plaque on the memorial was attacked with a hammer on 4 February In 1970 a pipe bomb blew up part of the plaque's marble face, that was first used for Marx's wife Jenny von Westphalen in 1881. The plaque was subsequently moved when both Marx and his wife were exhumed and moved to a more prominent location within the cemetery in 1954. It has also been covered in Swastikas and emulsion paint has been thrown at it, in the past. What is Marx's Das Kapital? Is Marxism relevant to the UK today?

Family of pregnant IS teen plead for return,"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 The family of Shamima Begum - the teenager who went to Syria to join the Islamic State group - has called on the UK to bring her back ""urgently"". They said the 19-year-old's unborn baby is ""a total innocent"" and had the right to grow up in the ""peace and security"" of the UK. Ms Begum, from east London, toldthe Times,externalshe feared her child would be taken from her if she returned. The justice secretary said the UK would evaluate each case individually. Ms Begum was one of three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green, east London, who left the UK for Syria in 2015. The teenager was found last week in a Syrian refugee camp by a reporter from the Times and on Wednesday told how she had escaped from Baghuz - IS's last stronghold in eastern Syria. In the second instalment of herinterview with the Times,externalon Saturday, Ms Begum asked: ""What do you think will happen to my child? ""Because I don't want it to be taken away from me, or at least if it is, to be given to my family."" She added she had been taken to hospital because of contractions after arriving at the camp, which meant she could give birth ""any day"". Ms Begum told the newspaper she knew returning to the UK ""wouldn't be a quiet thing"" and she understood she faced possible terrorism charges. However, in an apparent reference to the timemembers of her family appeared before MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committeein March 2015, she said they were told: ""I won't be charged with terrorism or anything"". Ms Begum had previously told the paper she had lost two children in Syria. Her daughter died at the age of one year and nine months and was buried in Baghuz a month ago. Her second child died three months ago at eight months old of an illness compounded by malnutrition, she said. She said she took him to a hospital but there were no drugs and not enough staff. 'Many civilians' still trapped with IS IS teen's return to UK 'could be prevented' What can the UK do about the IS teenager? In a statement issued on Friday, her family said they had previously ""lost all hope"" of seeing Ms Begum again, saying she had risked ""imprisonment and death"" in escaping from IS territory. They said they were ""utterly shocked"" byher lack of regretabout joining IS, but that they were the ""words of a girl who was groomed at the age of 15"" and is surrounded by IS sympathisers. The family said they were concerned that Ms Begum's mental health had been affected by her four years in Syria, during which she married an IS fighter and had two children who died. ""Now we are faced with the situation of knowing that Shamima's young children have died - children we will never come to know as a family. This is the hardest of news to bear,"" the family said. ""The welfare of Shamima's unborn child is of paramount concern to our family, and we will do everything within our power to protect that baby who is entirely blameless in these events."" This video can not be played We asked people in Bethnal Green, where Shamima Begum previously went to school, whether the teenager should be allowed back to the UK They said they would welcome an investigation into her actions in Syria ""under the principles of British justice"". Justice Secretary David Gauke said there were national security risks to allowing people such as Ms Begum to return to Britain but did not rule it out. He told the BBC the UK needed to evaluate each case on ""a case by case basis"". Home SecretarySajid Javid has said she could face charges,externalif she returns. He told the Times this week there were a range of measures to stop IS supporters who posed a serious threat from returning to the UK, such as depriving them of British citizenship or excluding them from the country. Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer for Ms Begum's family, said he did not believe Mr Javid had ""the legal grounds or tools to stop her coming back"". Chief of the intelligence service MI6, Alex Younger, told the Munich Security Conferenceon Friday that British citizens ""have a right to come to the UK"". Ms Begum, along with Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, entered Syria via Turkey in February 2015. She said Kadiza Sultana had died after a house was bombed, but the fate of her other friend is still unknown. Analysis: What can the UK do about IS teenager? Watch: The background to the case of Tareena Shakil Ms Begum escaped from Baghuz two weeks ago, but her husband - a Dutch convert to Islam - surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left. She told the Times that she feared she may never see or be allowed to live with her husband again, adding she loved 26-year-old Yago Riedijk ""very much"". Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police Fighting against IS forces has been continuing in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they have captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks. IS has lost control of most of the territory it held in Syria and Iraq and US president Donald Trump said on Friday he expected to announced its defeat this weekend.

Reality Check: Thefts of catalytic converters,"There have been many posts on social media in the past few weeks from people shocked at having had the catalytic converters stolen from their cars. There werevideos posted online,externalof masked thieves climbing under cars in broad daylight to saw off the components. Catalytic converters are part of a car's exhaust system that convert some of the pollutants into less harmful substances. They are relatively easy to remove from a car, especially those, such as 4x4s, that are further off the ground, and contain precious metals such as platinum and palladium. The thefts mean large costs for motorists or their insurers because the converter has to be replaced and the damage caused to the vehicle by removing it has to be fixed. Anecdotally, thefts of catalytic converters tend to rise when platinum and palladium prices are high. But it is hard to find figures for how widespread the problem is, becausethe Home Office does not record it,externalas a separate offence. The Times newspaper submitted Freedom of Information requests to the 43 police forces in England and Wales to ask them how many incidents of catalytic converter theft had been reported. It received data from 22 of those forces, which said they had had 637 reported incidents in 2017. But the forces responding did not include the biggest force - the Metropolitan Police. The Met told BBC Reality Check that the only data it held was for the period since July 2018, when it had recorded 900 reported thefts of catalytic converters. The theft of catalytic converters is not a new phenomenon -BBC News reportedthat just over 1,100 had been taken across Britain, not including London, in 2009. The Scrap Metal Dealer Act 2013,externalwas supposed to make it harder for thieves to sell stolen components, by requiring dealers to be licensed and preventing them paying cash for scrap. But after an initial peak in 2014,the number of convictions,externalin the category that includes scrap metal dealing has fallen sharply. Trade association the British Metals Recycling Association has said stretched resources mean the police are unlikely to prosecute scrap dealers operating illegally and are more likely to encourage them to apply for licences retrospectively. Indeed, it is not unusual to see advertisements for illegal scrap metal dealers offering cash for scrap. The Met suggests worried car-owners take steps to make their vehicles less vulnerable, such as: A serial number could be engraved on the catalytic converter to make it easier to trace and harder to sell at a reputable dealer If the converter is bolted on, it may be possible to weld the bolts shut, although that would deter only thieves working with just a spanner Protective coverings are available that make the converters harder to steal, although they are ""quite expensive"" High-clearance vehicles (such as 4x4s) could be parked near walls or other vehicles to make it harder to climb underneath them Security lighting, CCTV or alarms may also deter thieves What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Harold Wilson's powerful ex-secretary dies,"Marcia Williams arriving at Downing Street in 1975 Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson's secretary Baroness Falkender - formerly Marcia Williams - has died aged 86. Lady Falkender, once dubbed the Duchess of Downing Street, died on 6 February. She was Mr Wilson's private and political secretary from 1956 to 1983, which included his leadership of the Labour Party and his time in office. She was one of the most powerful women in politics during Mr Wilson's premiership and came to prominence following his 1976 resignation. Lady Falkender was believed by many to wield more influence than MPs and even cabinet ministers - something she always denied. ""I don't think I ever had any influences on policies because, as I say, it wasn't my role really. Everyone knew where I stood on things,"" she once said. ""If I had any at all, it's because they heard my voice and very often if there were a crowd of people around, mostly civil servants of the prime minister, he would be arguing policy out and he would be saying the things he wanted to hear. ""I might possibly be the only voice in the room saying things he didn't want to hear."" Harold Wilson with Lady Falkender were often described as ""political soulmates"" Paying tribute, Lord Lipsey, who worked as a political adviser in Mr Wilson's government, said Lady Falkender might not have had much influence over policy, but had a ""general influence"" over Mr Wilson and was his ""confidante"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was a ""formidable personality"" who the Labour prime minister could turn to ""when things were getting tough"". Following Mr Wilson's sudden resignation in 1976, it was claimed Lady Falkender drafted his controversial resignation honours list - which included his publisher, his raincoat manufacturer and a property tycoon. The list was dubbed The Lavender List because some of the names were written on lavender-coloured paper in Lady Falkender's handwriting. However, it was later pointed out that it is normal for secretaries to put their employer's dictated thoughts into writing. Harold Wilson pictured with Baroness Falkender following his 1966 election win In 2007, Lady Falkender successfully sued the BBC for libel over her portrayal in a drama-documentary which wrongly claimed she had compiled the list and that she had included people for her own personal interests. The programme also wrongly suggested that she had a brief affair with Mr Wilson and used this to blackmail him. She was awarded Â£75,000 in libel damages. Lady Falkender, born Marcia Field on 10 March, 1932, was educated at Northampton High School before attending Queen Mary College, University of London. She was married for five years to George Williams, but the relationship foundered when he wanted to live and work in the US and she did not. She had a long-running relationship with the late Walter Terry, a one-time political editor of the Daily Mail and Mr Wilson's favourite political reporter. Lady Falkender and Mr Terry had two sons in the late 1960s. Baroness Falkender making her first appearance in the House of Lords She was made a peer in the House of Lords in 1974, but she did not speak during her four decades there. ""My peerage has been a great problem to me because I have never known how to handle it. But now I know myself pretty well,"" she once said. ""And I think if the press has got me wrong there is nothing I can do to put it right."" Remembering Harold Wilson. Video, 00:01:11Remembering Harold Wilson BBC man David Holmes interviews PM.

Nigeria poll halted in last-minute drama,"This video can not be played Electoral commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu announced the move Nigeria has delayed its presidential and parliamentary elections for a week, in a dramatic night-time move. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) made the announcement just five hours before the polls were due to open on Saturday. ""Proceeding with the election as scheduled is no longer feasible,"" commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu said, citing logistical issues. The two main candidates have asked people to remain calm and be patient. Mr Yakubu said the difficult decision to postpone was needed to ensure a free and fair vote. Anger and frustration after Nigeria poll delay The superpower with no power Does Nigeria's 'generation democracy' want to vote? The presidential and parliamentary votes have been rescheduled for Saturday 23 February. Governorship, state assembly and federal area council elections have been rescheduled until Saturday 9 March. Main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar urged his supporters to be patient The announcement came after an emergency meeting at the Inec headquarters in the capital, Abuja. Nigeria's two main political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP), swiftly condemned the move and accused each other of trying to manipulate the vote. President Muhammadu Buhari, of the APC party, urged calm and appealed to Nigerians to ""refrain from civil disorder and remain peaceful, patriotic and united to ensure that no force or conspiracy derail our democratic development"". His main rival Atiku Abubakar has called for calm over the next seven days saying: ""I'm appealing to Nigerians to please come out and vote and I'm asking them to be patient about it."" Voters have reacted with a mixture of anger, frustration and resignation. Responses to Inec's tweet about the postponement were brutal with one man calling it ""the height of incompetence"".

In the northern town of Daura, Musa Abubakar, who had travelled 550km (342 miles) from Abuja to take part in the election, told the BBC that he ""couldn't believe"" what had happened. Hajiya Sa'adatu said she was ""greatly disappointed"" to learn of the delay when she came out to cast her vote in the northern city of Kano. Nigerians like Hajiya Sa'adatu only learned of the news when they woke up But others have been saying that the postponement should mean that everything goes smoothly next week. Michael Momodu, in Delta state south-east Nigeria, said that he still believed that ""the right things will take place"" and that ""God will deliver"". Election chief Mahmood Yakubu said the decision was made following a ""careful review"" of the election ""operational plan"", adding that there was a ""determination to conduct free, fair and credible elections"". He said the delay was necessary to give the commission time to address vital issues and ""maintain the quality of our elections"", but did not provide further details. Allow Twitter content?

In the past two weeks several Inec offices have been set alight, with thousands of electronic smart card readers and voter cards destroyed. There have also been claims of shortages of election material in some of the country's 36 states. By Damian Zane, BBC News, in Lagos At first it seemed like another bout of fake news, but disbelief has been replaced by outrage and disappointment. The last elections, in 2015, were also postponed, but the announcement coming five hours before the vote is a new record. Those Nigerians who had intended to vote would have planned their day around it. The whole country was essentially going to shut down as travel was restricted, so the only options were to stay at home or go to the polling station. Many have also already travelled to the places where they were registered to vote. They will be left wondering what they will do for the next week. The country is known for pulling things off at the last minute, but this time it wasn't to be. This will have left a sour taste in the mouths of the electorate, which is already cynical about the political process. Nigeria has been forced to bolster its security, with the run-up to the elections marred by violence. On Friday,officials in north-west Nigeria reported the discovery of the bodies of 66 people, 22 of them children and 12 women, killed by ""criminal elements"". The future of Africa's most populous nation and largest economy is at stake. Whoever wins will have to address power shortages, corruption, security problems and a sluggish economy. There are 73 registered candidates in the presidential election, but campaigning has been dominated by President Buhari, 76, and his main challenger, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, 72. Mr Buhari says he has built a strong foundation for prosperity, but his rival says Nigeria is not functioning. Both men are from the mainly Muslim north of the country. While both are in their 70s, more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35. Nigeria's 'new broom' president The money-making challenger Yes. Nigeria is not new to voting postponements - previous elections in 2011 and 2015 were delayed by several days. In 2015, the country ordered the closure of all its land and sea borders ahead of tightly contested elections amid reports that foreigners planned to cross into Nigeria to vote. That same year, one of the candidates died while the votes were being counted. Does Nigeria's 'generation democracy' want to vote?

Gary Martin was a 15-year veteran of the Henry Pratt company The Chicago Sun-Times newspaper reported his family as saying he was ""stressed out"" at being made redundant by the company, which makes valves for large water pipes. Gary Martin in an undated handout via the Aurora police department Clerks at a local store told USA Today that Martin regularly came in for cigars and was a happy and engaging customer who appeared fine on the day of the shooting. Steve Spizewski, who lived near Martin, told the paper he considered him a friend who had consoled him when his mother died and that he was in ""shock"" at the reports. Ms Ziman said Martin had bought a gun in 2014 before authorities realised he had a conviction from 1994. She said police were investigating why he had not been forced to give it up. Police received a number of reports of an ""active shooter"" in an industrial park in Aurora at about 13:24 local time (19:24 GMT) on Friday.

Three more officers were shot as they tried to rescue people from the building. None of the wounded officers are in a critical condition. Officers located the suspect in the large complex after about 90 minutes and he was shot dead. Chris Southwood of the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police described the Aurora officers who attended and were shot as ""courageous"". ""[These] officers and their colleagues did not hesitate to literally put their lives on the line today to stop further bloodshed,"" Mr Southwood. John Probst, who works at Henry Pratt, told broadcaster ABC7 that he saw the attacker, whom he recognised as a colleague. He said the man was carrying a handgun equipped with a laser sight. ""One of the guys was up in the office [and] he said this person was shooting, and, he come running down and he was bleeding pretty bad... I heard more shots, and we just left the building,"" Mr Probst said. Multiple emergency calls were made to police when the shooting began An employee at nearby Capitol Printing told ABC7 that they hid in a closet when the shooting began. Others in nearby buildings said they locked themselves in. Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth said: ""This is a scary, sad day for all Illinoisans and Americans.""

Return 'could be prevented',"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 A British woman who fled to Syria as a schoolgirl to join the Islamic State group could be prevented from returning to the UK, the home secretary has said. ""My message is clear,"" Sajid Javidtold the Times,external: ""If you have supported terrorist organisations abroad I will not hesitate to prevent your return."" He added that if Shamima Begum, 19, did come home she could be prosecuted. Ms Begum, who is pregnant, told the paper she had no regrets but wanted to have her baby in the UK. ""We must remember that those who left Britain to join Daesh were full of hate for our country,"" Mr Javid said. ""If you do manage to return you should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted."" Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? London schoolgirl 'feared dead in Syria' Mr Javid added that there were a range of measures available to ""stop people who pose a serious threat from returning to the UK, including depriving them of their British citizenship or excluding them from the country"". Security chiefs in London could also control Ms Begum's possible return through a Temporary Exclusion Order. The controversial legal tool bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. However Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum would have to be accepted back into the UK if she had not become a national of any other country. Under international law, it is not possible to render a person stateless. Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. AnotherBritish jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil,who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. Analysis: What can the UK do about IS teenager? Watch: The background to the case of Tareena Shakil In an interview with the Times, Ms Begum, who married an IS fighter, showed little remorse for her involvement with the terror group and saidshe was not fazed by seeing ""beheaded heads""in bins. ""I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago,"" she said. ""I don't regret coming here."" However, she said that after the ""shock"" of losing two children to illness while living in Syria, she was scared her unborn baby would also die if she stayed in the refugee camp to which she fled last month. She said: ""I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child."" Ms Begum said life in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her expectations: ""The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. ""Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that..."" But she said she felt the IS ""caliphate"" was at an end. ""I don't have high hopes. They are just getting smaller and smaller,"" she said. ""And there is so much oppression and corruption going on that I don't really think they deserve victory."" This video can not be played Anthony Loyd, of the Times, describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp Ms Begum's family have appealed for the teenager to be shown mercy. Her brother-in-law Mohammed Rahman, 36, told the Times: ""She was so young - I don't think she had the life experience to make those decisions."" ""I think the hope would be that she would be allowed to return home, as long as the government is satisfied she has turned her back on their ideology,"" he said. Ms Begum was one of three schoolgirls, along with Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, who left the UK for Syria in February 2015. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police She escaped from Baghuz - IS's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a camp in northern Syria. Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was kidnapped and beheaded by IS seven years ago - said that the group's supporters did not ""necessarily"" have to be treated as criminals and deserved a trial. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she felt ""very strongly that Isis continues to be a threat"", adding: ""It's very difficult to discern how much of a threat they continue to be when they want to return home. ""We have to be very careful and very vigilant with any of these folks who have been involved in so many human rights atrocities."" IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

In the northern town of Daura, Musa Abubakar, who had travelled 550km (342 miles) from Abuja to take part in the election, told the BBC that he ""couldn't believe"" what had happened. Hajiya Sa'adatu said she was ""greatly disappointed"" to learn of the delay when she came out to cast her vote in the northern city of Kano. Nigerians like Hajiya Sa'adatu only learned of the news when they woke up But others have been saying that the postponement should mean that everything goes smoothly next week. Michael Momodu, in Delta state south-east Nigeria, said that he still believed that ""the right things will take place"" and that ""God will deliver"". Election chief Mahmood Yakubu said the decision was made following a ""careful review"" of the election ""operational plan"", adding that there was a ""determination to conduct free, fair and credible elections"". He said the delay was necessary to give the commission time to address vital issues and ""maintain the quality of our elections"", but did not provide further details. Allow Twitter content?

In the past two weeks several Inec offices have been set alight, with thousands of electronic smart card readers and voter cards destroyed. There have also been claims of shortages of election material in some of the country's 36 states. By Damian Zane, BBC News, in Lagos At first it seemed like another bout of fake news, but disbelief has been replaced by outrage and disappointment. The last elections, in 2015, were also postponed, but the announcement coming five hours before the vote is a new record. Those Nigerians who had intended to vote would have planned their day around it. The whole country was essentially going to shut down as travel was restricted, so the only options were to stay at home or go to the polling station. Many have also already travelled to the places where they were registered to vote. They will be left wondering what they will do for the next week. The country is known for pulling things off at the last minute, but this time it wasn't to be. This will have left a sour taste in the mouths of the electorate, which is already cynical about the political process. Nigeria has been forced to bolster its security, with the run-up to the elections marred by violence. On Friday,officials in north-west Nigeria reported the discovery of the bodies of 66 people, 22 of them children and 12 women, killed by ""criminal elements"". The future of Africa's most populous nation and largest economy is at stake. Whoever wins will have to address power shortages, corruption, security problems and a sluggish economy. There are 73 registered candidates in the presidential election, but campaigning has been dominated by President Buhari, 76, and his main challenger, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, 72. Mr Buhari says he has built a strong foundation for prosperity, but his rival says Nigeria is not functioning. Both men are from the mainly Muslim north of the country. While both are in their 70s, more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35. Nigeria's 'new broom' president The money-making challenger Yes. Nigeria is not new to voting postponements - previous elections in 2011 and 2015 were delayed by several days. In 2015, the country ordered the closure of all its land and sea borders ahead of tightly contested elections amid reports that foreigners planned to cross into Nigeria to vote. That same year, one of the candidates died while the votes were being counted. Does Nigeria's 'generation democracy' want to vote?

'Killer car seats' sold online for ÃÂ£8,"Children's car seats, dubbed ""killers"" by trading standards officers, have repeatedly appeared for sale on online marketplaces, Which? has warned. The consumer group said the fabric seats, which can cost as little as Â£8, offered almost no protection in a crash and were illegal to use in the UK. The online sites - Amazon, eBay and AliExpress  - all said they had removed the seats from sale. But Which? said the listings should have been deleted quicker. Which? said the seats had been described online as suitable for children from newborns up to the age of five. However, in 2014, Surrey Trading Standards had conducted tests on a fabric seat which fell to pieces in a 30 mph accident. The crash test dummy of a three-year-old child was flung through the windscreen when the straps securing the seat failed. Trading standards officers dubbed them ""killer car seats"" and removed dozens of them from sale. Which? said they lacked the support needed to protect babies and toddlers. However, the consumer group said that they had repeatedly re-appeared for sale on online marketplaces ever since. Alex Neill, from Which?, said: ""Parents will be horrified at the thought they could be unwittingly putting their child's life at risk with one of these 'killer' car seats. Online marketplaces cannot continue to turn a blind eye to dangerous and illegal products being sold on their sites."" Regulations state that only EU-approved child car seats can be used in the UK. Approved seats carry a clear orange label with the codes ECE R44-03, ECE R44-04 or ECE R129 to indicate they have been put through EU safety testing and can therefore be legally sold on the UK market. Consumer groups suggest car seats should never be bought secondhand, as they could have been involved in an accident but damage to the seat may be unclear. Sales site eBay told Which? that it had asked the sellers involved to contact the buyers to organise a return, and to pay for the return shipping. ""Our specialist teams work with regulators and Trading Standards to ensure our block filters stay up to date, using sophisticated software that monitors billions of listings a day to remove any prohibited items,"" an eBay spokesman said. Amazon said: ""All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The products in question are no longer available."" AliExpress said: ""After we were told by Which? about these third-party listings, we took prompt action to remove them. We will continue to take action against sellers who violate our terms of use.""

Review: America through the lens of Diane Arbus âââââ,"This video can not be played The Gompertz Guide to...Diane Arbus They say you can judge people by the company they keep. Oligarchs hang out with art dealers, yacht brokers and muscle-bound bodyguards. Fading film stars winter in Miami among plastic surgeons and country club members. Undertakers chauffeur the dead. But who - outside the Houses of Parliament - would choose oddballs, misfits, and exhibitionists as their squad? Step forward Diane (pronounced Dee-Anne BTW) Arbus. The American photographer loved an eccentric like a salesman loves a sucker. They were her people: outsiders of all shapes and sizes - short, giant, obese, skinny - who had the courage and character to expose their vulnerability in front of her searching lens. Diane Arbus poses for a rare portrait with her beloved camera in New York, circa 1968 You don't just look at the subjects of Diane Arbus's photographs, you meet them. Her New York street photography was quite different from the images produced by the likes of Walker Evans and Robert Frank, who were also documenting mid-century urban America. She wasn't a click-and-run flÃ¢neur surreptitiously snapping away from a camera buried within an overcoat, or one poking out from the passenger window of a passing car. An Arbus image was the product of a collaboration between the seer and the seen: the photographer and the photographed. She would spend hours, days even, building a rapport with the strippers, inkers and razorblade swallowers she portrayed. Arbus established a bond with her subjects, before photographing them, as with Stripper with bare breasts sitting in her dressing room, New Jersey, 1961 The more specific she could be, she learnt, the more universal the image. Inspiration came from an unlikely source. It wasn't another photographer, although she knew and admired many, but sweary Geoffrey Chaucer - the 14th Century Middle English writer. She was particularly taken with The Canterbury Tales, his satirical collection of stories in which a motley bunch of pilgrims travel from London to Canterbury amusing themselves by competing for the title of best storyteller. Arbus was influenced by Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales and his ""tender"" portrayal of the pilgrims Arbus not only admired the range and depth of characters to whom Chaucer gave literary life, but also the ""tenderness"" with which he treated them. It was a humanity she strove to replicate when photographing the discriminated against, the sort of people from whom most turn away but she looked upon with empathy. Female impersonator holding long gloves in Long Island, 1959, is an unflinching portrait but full of humanity ""If you scrutinize reality closely enough,"" she said, ""if in some way you really, really get to it, it becomes fantastic."" Freaks, as she called them (a description of the time that has not endured like her pictures), were her muse: ""They were one of the first things I photographed. It had a terrific excitement for me. I adored them. They made me feel a mixture of shame and awe. There's a quality of legend about freaksâ¦ Most people go through life dreading they will have a traumatic experience. Freaks were born with their trauma. They have already passed their test in life. They are aristocrats."" As was she - a ""department store princess,"" who grew up in New York on the Upper West Side; the daughter of a wealthy retailer with a huge shop on Fifth Avenue. The fur her father sold was real, but she felt like a fake when walking between the aisles - hence, I suppose, the attraction to oddballs brave enough to be themselves. Her parents got into art and wanted their 10-year-old daughter to become a painter. Diane was good but found the process annoying. Eight years later she married Allan Arbus. He gave her that Nikon 35mm camera. It was 1941. Diane Arbus did fashion shoots with her husband Allan, but wanted to explore worlds other photographers shunned They set up as a husband-and-wife team producing fashion photos for glossy magazines: Allan took the pictures, Diane was the stylist. Until she grew bored of the role around 1955 and dug out the Nikon. This is where the Hayward Gallery exhibition starts; with the revelation of Arbus's idiosyncratic aesthetic immediately apparent. Images such as Taxicab Driver at the Wheel with Two Passengers, N.Y.C. 1956, and Lady on a Bus N.Y.C. 1957, demonstrate her innate sensibility for composition, contrast, and content. Every picture she takes is like a single page torn from a novel: a fragment of a story you find yourself reconstructing as you look. Taxicab driver at the wheel with two passengers, N.Y.C, 1956, shows Arbus's talent for composition With Lady on a bus, N.Y.C, 1957, Arbus creates an arresting image and story The Hayward Gallery focuses on her early 35mm pictures taken before she started using a Rolleiflex square format camera in 1962. They are displayed a bit like ""Wanted"" posters pinned to the trees of New York's Central Park. You walk among them in a forest of vertical white columns, on either side of which is a black and white figure staring right back at you. It is an effective and affecting presentation. These are not sentimental photographs. Nor are they eye candy to entertain and titillate. There is a seriousness about them, a solemnity which can drift toward the surreal and macabre: a moment caught between the vernacular and the uncanny. The picture of an elderly woman lying on a hospital bed who appears more dead than alive is neither a celebration of life nor a lament for its imminent end. It is something else altogether, more a reflection on the thin invisible line that divides the two for us all. Arbus doesn't restrict herself to strange folk in order to depict strangeness. For her it is a fact of life. A woman carrying a child, a boy stepping off a kerb - everyday occurrences when isolated and observed become loaded and peculiar. Boy stepping off the curb, N.Y.C, 1957, captures an everyday action but takes on a loaded meaning ""Everybody has that thing where they need to look one way but they come out looking another wayâ¦You see somebody on the street and essentially what you notice about them is the floor. It's just extraordinary."" You can see the occasional flaw in her photographs. Sometimes they feel too staged, her presence too obvious. Others make you question the relationship between photographer and subject: is one taking advantage of the other? A salesman and a sucker, maybe? But which way around? It is, though, that ambivalence that draws you in. The more you look the more you see. Take the photograph of two kids horsing about on the street, for instance. It appears charming at first, but grows darker the longer you spend with it: who is teasing whom and why? It is just one example of the faintly forbidding atmosphere that pervades the show: an ominousness that comes not just from Arbus's work but also from her life, which she ended abruptly in 1971 by taking her own life, at the age of 48. Here we see the work of a photographer blessed with great intelligence and a wonderful eye, both of which were aligned to and informed by a curious, troubled mind. There are a lot of images in this show but no self-portraits. At least, not in the conventional sense. Looked at from another perspective, however, and you can see the sensitive, striving artist that was Diane Arbus in every single one. Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter,external The Gompertz Guide to...

Thousands of criminals to be tracked 24/7,"The technology will mean police will know the whereabouts of an offender at all times Thousands of criminals in England and Wales will be tagged with GPS trackers to allow authorities to trace them 24 hours a day. Currently, electronic tags are linked to a box at a fixed address, such as an offender's home, with alerts generated if they are not there at certain hours. But the new location tags will track a person's movements wherever they go. Justice Secretary David Gauke said the tags will better protect victims of domestic abuse or stalking. Standard electronic tags,external- largely used to enforce a curfew or house arrest - issue an alert if the person wearing the tag is not present at a particular address during the hours they are meant to be. Around 60,000 offenders currently wear these standard tags in England and Wales. The GPS tags can be used to create a no-go zone, check an offender is attending a rehabilitation programme, monitor an offender's behaviour, or ban someone from going within a certain distance of an address - such as a fellow criminal's or victim's home. The GPS tags, which cost Â£9 a day, will be rolled out everywhere in England and Wales from this summer. 'No benefits' from Â£60m GPS offender tags Offenders in London to be tracked using GPS tags Electronic tags up as prisoner numbers fall Officials estimate that around 4,000 people will be GPS-tagged in a year. There will be a maximum of 1,000 tags in use at any one time. Mr Gauke told the BBC the technology could be used for a ""broad range"" of offences - as an alternative to custodial sentences for relatively minor crimes, and to monitor more serious offenders once they have been released. ""GPS tagging will help to better protect victims and give them the reassurance that perpetrators will not be able to breach an exclusion zone without triggering an immediate alert,"" he said. Mr Gauke said the GPS tags could also help keep people out of gangs. Why are community sentences falling out of favour? From prison cell to football coach Anyone who breaches rules that have been imposed on them could then be recalled to prison or brought before the courts. The government has used electronic tagging services as part of the sentencing and supervision of offenders since 1999. It said the new GPS tags will not replace the current system but be an extra option. So far, GPS tags have been rolled out to three regions - north-west and north-east England, and the Midlands. The new technologywill also be trialled in London,externalparticularly for knife crime offenders after they have been released from prison.

Labour pledges to protect universities,"Universities would be prevented from going bust under new plans unveiled by Labour to protect higher education and students from ""rampant"" market forces. The plans to overhaul regulator the Office for Students reflect fears about some universities' viability. Under Labour, the OfS would get an explicit objective of avoiding ""disorderly failure"" at universities, and be able to provide emergency loans. The government said the OfS already had strong powers to regulate universities. There have been increasing concerns about the financial sustainability of higher education institutions, with reports that three are on the brink of bankruptcy, relying on short-term loans to get by. And several others are planning to run deficit budgets and make significant cuts. Would a university really be allowed to go bust? How tuition fees change real-life decisions Lords approves two-year degree course plan Universities minister Chris Skidmore has suggested some ""providers may, in a small number of cases, exit the market altogether as a result of strong competition"". But shadow education minister Angela Rayner has highlighted that the OfS itself has said it would ""not bail out providers in financial difficulty"". She said: ""The Tories have unleashed a failed free market experiment in higher education. ""They have created a system that goes to the very heart of their ideology - a system where market logic is imposed on public goods and where the forces of competition run rampant at the expense of students, staff and communities. ""Students would be left with immense uncertainty about their futures and entire communities would lose one of their major academic, economic and social institutions. ""Education is a public good and should be treated as such. Our universities are there for all of us,"" she added. Universities are in competition with each other to attract students, and the larger and more popular universities have been opening up more places in order to take advantage of the significant funds each student brings with them. This appears to be leaving smaller, or less popular universities, abandoned by prospective students. Mr Skidmore told MPs earlier this week that the government's reforms to regulation were designed to promote diversity, innovation and choice in higher education, in the interests of students. But achieving that, he said, does not equate to propping up any particular failing provider.â He said he hoped the OfS would be able to anticipate any development such as course closure or market exit rather than react to it. Its predecessor, the Higher Education Funding Council, granted at least Â£1m in emergency loans last year. Labour also pledged to set limits on vice-chancellor pay, by limiting it to 20 times that of the lowest paid member of staff in the university. Vice-chancellors would also be banned from sitting on the boards that set their pay. This week an OfS report revealed thatsome university vice-chancellors were being paid 12 or 13 times the median (or the middle) salary of their employees. Other measures planned by Labour include requiring universities to publish more data on disadvantaged students, including details of students' socio-economic background, ethnicity, gender, and those with a disability or a caring responsibility. Responding to Labour's proposals, a Department for Education spokesperson said the OfS was set up ""to champion the interests of students, promote choice and ensure that higher education delivers value for money for both students and taxpayers"". They continued: ""We have given it strong regulatory powers to take action where it deems necessary, including financial penalties and even deregistration. ""The OfS has already made a significant impact on the sector even though the OfS is not yet at full strength, with some of its powers due to come into force later this year.""

Ex-Trump aide 'deserves long prison term',"Paul Manafort also faces a possible fine of between $50,000 and $24m US President Donald Trump's former election campaign chief Paul Manafort should be jailed for up to 24 years, special counsel Robert Mueller says. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud on charges relating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He accepted a plea deal on the charges in return for co-operating with Mr Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election campaign. But he was found guilty earlier this week of breaching his plea deal. The 69 year old, who was one of the first people to be investigated in the probe, was found to have lied to prosecutors. On Thursday, US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Manafort had ""made multiple false statements"" to the FBI, Mr Mueller's office and a grand jury. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Manafort: The man who helped Trump win Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? On Friday, a court document filed by Mr Mueller's office said it agreed with a US Department of Justice calculation that Manafort should face between 19 and 24 years in prison and a fine of between $50,000 (Â£39,000) and $24m. ""While some of these offences are commonly prosecuted, there was nothing ordinary about the millions of dollars involved in the defendant's crimes, the duration of his criminal conduct or the sophistication of his schemes,"" the document reads. ""The sentence here should reflect the seriousness of these crimes, and serve to both deter Manafort and others from engaging in such conduct."" In her ruling on Wednesday, Judge Berman Jackson said there was evidence that showed Manafort had lied about three different topics, including his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant. Prosecutors claim Mr Kilimnik had ties to Russian intelligence. Last August, Mr Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. A month later he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mr Mueller. The agreement avoided a second trial on money laundering and other charges. Mueller: America's most mysterious public figure The plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prisonand would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts - but deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed. It was the first criminal trial arising from the Department of Justice's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. However, the charges related only to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign.

Thousands of criminals to be tracked 24/7Electronic GPS tags which track offenders' every movement will be rolled out across England and Wales.UK,"The technology will mean police will know the whereabouts of an offender at all times Thousands of criminals in England and Wales will be tagged with GPS trackers to allow authorities to trace them 24 hours a day. Currently, electronic tags are linked to a box at a fixed address, such as an offender's home, with alerts generated if they are not there at certain hours. But the new location tags will track a person's movements wherever they go. Justice Secretary David Gauke said the tags will better protect victims of domestic abuse or stalking. Standard electronic tags,external- largely used to enforce a curfew or house arrest - issue an alert if the person wearing the tag is not present at a particular address during the hours they are meant to be. Around 60,000 offenders currently wear these standard tags in England and Wales. The GPS tags can be used to create a no-go zone, check an offender is attending a rehabilitation programme, monitor an offender's behaviour, or ban someone from going within a certain distance of an address - such as a fellow criminal's or victim's home. The GPS tags, which cost Â£9 a day, will be rolled out everywhere in England and Wales from this summer. 'No benefits' from Â£60m GPS offender tags Offenders in London to be tracked using GPS tags Electronic tags up as prisoner numbers fall Officials estimate that around 4,000 people will be GPS-tagged in a year. There will be a maximum of 1,000 tags in use at any one time. Mr Gauke told the BBC the technology could be used for a ""broad range"" of offences - as an alternative to custodial sentences for relatively minor crimes, and to monitor more serious offenders once they have been released. ""GPS tagging will help to better protect victims and give them the reassurance that perpetrators will not be able to breach an exclusion zone without triggering an immediate alert,"" he said. Mr Gauke said the GPS tags could also help keep people out of gangs. Why are community sentences falling out of favour? From prison cell to football coach Anyone who breaches rules that have been imposed on them could then be recalled to prison or brought before the courts. The government has used electronic tagging services as part of the sentencing and supervision of offenders since 1999. It said the new GPS tags will not replace the current system but be an extra option. So far, GPS tags have been rolled out to three regions - north-west and north-east England, and the Midlands. The new technologywill also be trialled in London,externalparticularly for knife crime offenders after they have been released from prison. The move comes after a 17-month pilot of GPS tags was carried out in eight police forces in England. The Ministry of Justice said the pilot showed GPS tags ""can potentially save police investigation time"", and could make criminals more compliant.

Mr Pinkard's family described him as ""a loving husband and father who deeply impacted the community"". In a Facebook post by a family friend, Mr Wehner was described as a ""big brother to many"". Gary Martin was a 15-year veteran of the Henry Pratt company The Chicago Sun-Times newspaper reported his family as saying he was ""stressed out"" at being made redundant by the company, which makes valves for large water pipes. Gary Martin in an undated handout via the Aurora police department Clerks at a local store told USA Today that Martin regularly came in for cigars and was a happy and engaging customer who appeared fine on the day of the shooting. Steve Spizewski, who lived near Martin, told the paper he considered him a friend who had consoled him when his mother died and that he was in ""shock"" at the reports. Ms Ziman said Martin had bought a gun in 2014 before authorities realised he had a conviction from 1994. She said police were investigating why he had not been forced to give it up. Police received a number of reports of an ""active shooter"" in an industrial park in Aurora at about 13:24 local time (19:24 GMT) on Friday. Police secured the area following first reports of a shooting Officers were immediately confronted by the suspect, who was armed with a Smith & Wesson handgun, and two of them were shot and wounded. Three more officers were shot as they tried to rescue people from the building. None of the wounded officers are in a critical condition. Officers located the suspect in the large complex after about 90 minutes and he was shot dead. Chris Southwood of the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police described the Aurora officers who attended and were shot as ""courageous"". ""[These] officers and their colleagues did not hesitate to literally put their lives on the line today to stop further bloodshed,"" Mr Southwood. John Probst, who works at Henry Pratt, told broadcaster ABC7 that he saw the attacker, whom he recognised as a colleague. He said the man was carrying a handgun equipped with a laser sight. ""One of the guys was up in the office [and] he said this person was shooting, and, he come running down and he was bleeding pretty bad... I heard more shots, and we just left the building,"" Mr Probst said. Multiple emergency calls were made to police when the shooting began An employee at nearby Capitol Printing told ABC7 that they hid in a closet when the shooting began. Others in nearby buildings said they locked themselves in. Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth said: ""This is a scary, sad day for all Illinoisans and Americans.""

IS teen return 'could be prevented',"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 A British woman who fled to Syria as a schoolgirl to join the Islamic State group could be prevented from returning to the UK, the home secretary has said. ""My message is clear,"" Sajid Javidtold the Times,external: ""If you have supported terrorist organisations abroad I will not hesitate to prevent your return."" He added that if Shamima Begum, 19, did come home she could be prosecuted. Ms Begum, who is pregnant, told the paper she had no regrets but wanted to have her baby in the UK. ""We must remember that those who left Britain to join Daesh were full of hate for our country,"" Mr Javid said. ""If you do manage to return you should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted."" Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? London schoolgirl 'feared dead in Syria' Mr Javid added that there were a range of measures available to ""stop people who pose a serious threat from returning to the UK, including depriving them of their British citizenship or excluding them from the country"". Security chiefs in London could also control Ms Begum's possible return through a Temporary Exclusion Order. The controversial legal tool bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. However Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum would have to be accepted back into the UK if she had not become a national of any other country. Under international law, it is not possible to render a person stateless. Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. AnotherBritish jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil,who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. Analysis: What can the UK do about IS teenager? Watch: The background to the case of Tareena Shakil In an interview with the Times, Ms Begum, who married an IS fighter, showed little remorse for her involvement with the terror group and saidshe was not fazed by seeing ""beheaded heads""in bins. ""I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago,"" she said. ""I don't regret coming here."" However, she said that after the ""shock"" of losing two children to illness while living in Syria, she was scared her unborn baby would also die if she stayed in the refugee camp to which she fled last month. She said: ""I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child."" Ms Begum said life in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her expectations: ""The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. ""Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that..."" But she said she felt the IS ""caliphate"" was at an end. ""I don't have high hopes. They are just getting smaller and smaller,"" she said. ""And there is so much oppression and corruption going on that I don't really think they deserve victory.""

Her brother-in-law Mohammed Rahman, 36, told the Times: ""She was so young - I don't think she had the life experience to make those decisions."" ""I think the hope would be that she would be allowed to return home, as long as the government is satisfied she has turned her back on their ideology,"" he said. Ms Begum was one of three schoolgirls, along with Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, who left the UK for Syria in February 2015. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police She escaped from Baghuz - IS's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a camp in northern Syria. Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was kidnapped and beheaded by IS seven years ago - said that the group's supporters did not ""necessarily"" have to be treated as criminals and deserved a trial. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she felt ""very strongly that Isis continues to be a threat"", adding: ""It's very difficult to discern how much of a threat they continue to be when they want to return home. ""We have to be very careful and very vigilant with any of these folks who have been involved in so many human rights atrocities."" IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

Nigeria elections postponed for a week,"This video can not be played Electoral commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu announced the move Nigeria has delayed its presidential and parliamentary elections for a week, in a dramatic night-time move. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) made the announcement just five hours before the polls were due to open on Saturday. ""Proceeding with the election as scheduled is no longer feasible,"" commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu said, citing logistical issues. The two main candidates have asked people to remain calm and be patient. Mr Yakubu said the difficult decision to postpone was needed to ensure a free and fair vote. Anger and frustration after Nigeria poll delay The superpower with no power Does Nigeria's 'generation democracy' want to vote? The presidential and parliamentary votes have been rescheduled for Saturday 23 February. Governorship, state assembly and federal area council elections have been rescheduled until Saturday 9 March. Main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar urged his supporters to be patient The announcement came after an emergency meeting at the Inec headquarters in the capital, Abuja. Nigeria's two main political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP), swiftly condemned the move and accused each other of trying to manipulate the vote. President Muhammadu Buhari, of the APC party, urged calm and appealed to Nigerians to ""refrain from civil disorder and remain peaceful, patriotic and united to ensure that no force or conspiracy derail our democratic development"". His main rival Atiku Abubakar has called for calm over the next seven days saying: ""I'm appealing to Nigerians to please come out and vote and I'm asking them to be patient about it."" Voters have reacted with a mixture of anger, frustration and resignation. Responses to Inec's tweet about the postponement were brutal with one man calling it ""the height of incompetence"".

In the northern town of Daura, Musa Abubakar, who had travelled 550km (342 miles) from Abuja to take part in the election, told the BBC that he ""couldn't believe"" what had happened. Hajiya Sa'adatu said she was ""greatly disappointed"" to learn of the delay when she came out to cast her vote in the northern city of Kano. Nigerians like Hajiya Sa'adatu only learned of the news when they woke up But others have been saying that the postponement should mean that everything goes smoothly next week. Michael Momodu, in Delta state south-east Nigeria, said that he still believed that ""the right things will take place"" and that ""God will deliver"". Election chief Mahmood Yakubu said the decision was made following a ""careful review"" of the election ""operational plan"", adding that there was a ""determination to conduct free, fair and credible elections"". He said the delay was necessary to give the commission time to address vital issues and ""maintain the quality of our elections"", but did not provide further details. Allow Twitter content?

In the past two weeks several Inec offices have been set alight, with thousands of electronic smart card readers and voter cards destroyed. There have also been claims of shortages of election material in some of the country's 36 states. By Damian Zane, BBC News, in Lagos At first it seemed like another bout of fake news, but disbelief has been replaced by outrage and disappointment. The last elections, in 2015, were also postponed, but the announcement coming five hours before the vote is a new record. Those Nigerians who had intended to vote would have planned their day around it. The whole country was essentially going to shut down as travel was restricted, so the only options were to stay at home or go to the polling station. Many have also already travelled to the places where they were registered to vote. They will be left wondering what they will do for the next week. The country is known for pulling things off at the last minute, but this time it wasn't to be. This will have left a sour taste in the mouths of the electorate, which is already cynical about the political process. Nigeria has been forced to bolster its security, with the run-up to the elections marred by violence. On Friday,officials in north-west Nigeria reported the discovery of the bodies of 66 people, 22 of them children and 12 women, killed by ""criminal elements"". The future of Africa's most populous nation and largest economy is at stake. Whoever wins will have to address power shortages, corruption, security problems and a sluggish economy. There are 73 registered candidates in the presidential election, but campaigning has been dominated by President Buhari, 76, and his main challenger, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, 72. Mr Buhari says he has built a strong foundation for prosperity, but his rival says Nigeria is not functioning. Both men are from the mainly Muslim north of the country. While both are in their 70s, more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35. Nigeria's 'new broom' president The money-making challenger Yes. Nigeria is not new to voting postponements - previous elections in 2011 and 2015 were delayed by several days. In 2015, the country ordered the closure of all its land and sea borders ahead of tightly contested elections amid reports that foreigners planned to cross into Nigeria to vote. That same year, one of the candidates died while the votes were being counted. Does Nigeria's 'generation democracy' want to vote?

Trump ex-aide 'should get up to 24 years',"Paul Manafort also faces a possible fine of between $50,000 and $24m US President Donald Trump's former election campaign chief Paul Manafort should be jailed for up to 24 years, special counsel Robert Mueller says. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud on charges relating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He accepted a plea deal on the charges in return for co-operating with Mr Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election campaign. But he was found guilty earlier this week of breaching his plea deal. The 69 year old, who was one of the first people to be investigated in the probe, was found to have lied to prosecutors. On Thursday, US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Manafort had ""made multiple false statements"" to the FBI, Mr Mueller's office and a grand jury. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Manafort: The man who helped Trump win Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? On Friday, a court document filed by Mr Mueller's office said it agreed with a US Department of Justice calculation that Manafort should face between 19 and 24 years in prison and a fine of between $50,000 (Â£39,000) and $24m. ""While some of these offences are commonly prosecuted, there was nothing ordinary about the millions of dollars involved in the defendant's crimes, the duration of his criminal conduct or the sophistication of his schemes,"" the document reads. ""The sentence here should reflect the seriousness of these crimes, and serve to both deter Manafort and others from engaging in such conduct."" In her ruling on Wednesday, Judge Berman Jackson said there was evidence that showed Manafort had lied about three different topics, including his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant. Prosecutors claim Mr Kilimnik had ties to Russian intelligence. Last August, Mr Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. A month later he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mr Mueller. The agreement avoided a second trial on money laundering and other charges. Mueller: America's most mysterious public figure The plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prisonand would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts - but deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed. It was the first criminal trial arising from the Department of Justice's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. However, the charges related only to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign.

Call to ban killer robots in wars,"This is not about terminator robots but ""conventional weapons systems with autonomy"" A group of scientists has called for a ban on the development of weapons controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). It says that autonomous weapons may malfunction in unpredictable ways and kill innocent people. Ethics experts also argue that it is a moral step too far for AI systems to kill without any human intervention. The comments were made atthe American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting,externalin Washington DC. Human Rights Watch (HRW) is one of the 89 non-governmental organisations from 50 countries that have formed the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, to press for an international treaty. Among those leading efforts for the worldwide ban is HRW's Mary Wareham. ""We are not talking about walking, talking terminator robots that are about to take over the world; what we are concerned about is much more imminent: conventional weapons systems with autonomy,"" she told BBC News. ""They are beginning to creep in. Drones are the obvious example, but there are also military aircraft that take off, fly and land on their own; robotic sentries that can identify movement. These are precursors to autonomous weapons."" Ryan Gariepy, chief technological officer at Clearpath Robotics, backs the ban proposal. His company takes military contracts, but it has denounced AI systems for warfare and stated that it would not develop them. ""When they fail, they fail in unpredictable ways,"" he told BBC News. ""As advanced as we are, the state of AI is really limited by image recognition. It is good but does not have the detail or context to be judge, jury and executioner on a battlefield. ""An autonomous system cannot make a decision to kill or not to kill in a vacuum. The de-facto decision has been made thousands of miles away by developers, programmers and scientists who have no conception of the situation the weapon is deployed in."" According to Peter Asaro, of the New School in New York, such a scenario raises issues of legal liability if the system makes an unlawful killing. ""The delegation of authority to kill to a machine is not justified and a violation of human rights because machines are not moral agents and so cannot be responsible for making decisions of life and death. ""So it may well be that the people who made the autonomous weapon are responsible.""

The Korean delicacy fished in WalesLondon's secret billion-pound guilds,"There is an ""abundant stock"" of whelks in the Bristol Channel, Gavin Davies says They are closely related to snails, taste like ""nan's toenails"" and, in Wales, you cannot give them away. But those fishing for whelks off the coast of Wales claim they are popular in Japan and South Korea. Each year 10,000 tonnes of them are caught in the Bristol Channel but virtually all end up in Asia. Gavin Davies has spent the last 20 years catching sea snails, but in that time he has not developed a love for the acquired taste of whelks. ""Goodness knows why they like them - they taste like nan's toenails -  but it's given me a living for the last two decades,"" he said. ""I'm not even sure how they developed a taste for whelks, as they're only native to waters around Britain and the Atlantic."" Each night Mr Davies sets off from Saundersfoot and harvests one tonne of whelks from 1,000 pots suspended from 50 buoys in the bay around Carmarthenshire. Feeling peckish? Whelks are all the rage in Seoul, but not in Saundersfoot They are driven to Milford Haven, where they are loaded on to a factory ship which cooks and freezes them en-route to Asia. But Mr Davies said he was lucky if he could give away a couple of carriers to Welsh customers. Hywel Griffith - the Michelin-starred head chef of The Beach House on Swansea's Oxwich Bay - believes whelks are misunderstood. ""There's two issues, really,"" he said. ""One is the traditional image of whelks being cheap food, served out of a barrow on East End back streets, and the other is the idea that they are chewy and rubbery, but it's all about how you cook them. The whelks are loaded on to a factory ship which cooks and freezes them - then, next stop... South Korea The fisherman still whelking in his 90s Trapped whale freed from whelk pots Dolphins attracted to whelk shells ""The same people who turn their noses up at whelks will flock for scallops. ""In Asia they're usually served with chilli and soy sauce, but I think I'd give them a more European twist, maybe some deep-fried and others simmered in white wine, cream and garlic."" Mr Davies said not only are they low in fat and high in vitamins, they are also good for the environment. ""You can't get more sustainable than whelks. There's an abundant stock of them in the Bristol Channel and the pots cause virtually no harm to the seabed. ""And when we're all wondering how we're going to trade after Brexit, well here's this amazing resource which we won't eat, but they can't get enough of on the other side of the world.""

London's secret billion-pound guilds,"The Lord Mayor of London is often a livery company member London's trade guilds date back a thousand years and have billions of pounds in assets. But have they forgotten one of their original purposes - to spend money on the public good? Among the glass skyscrapers of London's financial district, and ancient centre, are nestled some very grand-looking low-rise halls, and a clue to the home of some of the city's more unlikely pockets of wealth. Livery companies, once a combination of lobbying organisations, regulators and trade unions, are now quite different organisations, focused also on fellowship, education and charity. They represented the old industries that used to dominate the city. Many have names which are easy to recognise, such as the Butchers, who can trace their beginnings back to the year 975, and the Fishmongers. Others bear the names of lost trades, like the Mercers and Bowyers, who traded cloth and made longbows. All would set standards for their goods and often held exclusive rights over their trade in the city, thus wielding political power. Probably the most famous guild member, Sir Richard (Dick) Whittington, left his fortune for the Mercers to run, for the benefit of the city The other side of their work was welfare and charity: funerals for deceased members, hospitals, and homes for the poor. Today, they sit on billions of pounds of assets, donated by members over many centuries, including the fortune of Dick Whittington, the former lord mayor. They were ordered as long ago as 1884, after a Royal Commission's investigation, to spend more on the public good orrisk their existence,external. But did they? And are they now? David Ferris is a member of the Vintners - or Worshipful Company of Vintners, to give it its full title - and very much a fan of the companies' history and potential. But he thinks they are not. ""What I like best about them is these are ancient institutions, well alive in our midst, with wonderful old traditions,"" he says. ""They are cultural gems."" However, he says, many of the most ancient have forgotten one of their prime reasons for existence from medieval times: the public good. ""They became gentlemen's clubs generally from about 1700,"" he says, ""and they have a great deal of wealth."" The companies do let out their halls, as the Goldsmith did for a speech by then-Foreign Secretary Lord Hague in 2010. But could they raise more? It's the older institutions that Mr Ferris feels may not be pulling their weight. Many have investments in companies listed on the stock market. Some have large land holdings. Among the richest are the Mercers, which owns a number of blocks in Covent Garden. In fact, the Mercers and Goldsmiths are the 55th and 73rd largest landlords in London respectively, according to Datscha, a commercial property data firm. Together, they are bigger landowners in the city than supermarket chain Sainsbury's or the National Grid. But the companies do not have to offer accounts for public inspection, and many older ones do not. The Goldsmiths are one of the biggest London landlords Still, public records partially covering eight companies and their charities showed Â£1.1bn of assets, BBC research found. Mr Ferris estimates the 110 livery companies in total might have assets worth at least Â£5bn. His own livery, the Vintners, spent Â£210,000 of its 2017 expenditure of Â£2.1m on charitable giving, according to its annual review. This is too low, says Mr Ferris. Although there are no rules the companies must follow when it comes to charitable spending, the Vintners told the BBC a better figure to look at was its income, of which it spent 20% on charity, and that it aimed to increase its charitable endowment over time. It said that it let out its hall to charities for free, and that doing so has raised Â£2.5m in the last three years. A lunch was held by the Drapers in 2017 for the Queen, who has the freedom of the company Mr Ferris has raised his concerns before. He says he was suspended from events at his company for five years and was ordered to ""cease to question the company's governance and administration in any way"" in a letter seen by the BBC. He won't, he says. And so his suspension continues. The company declined to comment. Each company has different aims and varying relevance in industry, so it would be foolish to lump all livery companies together when it comes to their performance. The Haberdashers and Merchant Taylors, for instance, support schools that bear their names. The Gunmakers tests firearms for safety. The Goldsmiths still has a large role in London's jewellery trade, where its Assay Office hallmarks precious metals, and it supports apprentices. Many companies, such as the Tallow Chandlers, have no connection to their original trades Castro Smith, a jeweller who hand-makes rings, says of the Goldsmiths' role in today's industry: ""It [plays] a massive part, especially in training new people. It takes a long time, this sort of skill. ""They help financially, and in training, and it's a hub, an umbrella, a network."" For the newer livery companies, it's a different picture still. Tapping a long history and sense of permanence gives the company a base from which to attract donors for their charities, and a sense of credibility. They are transparent, chatty, and keen to show their works. And many, such as the Arts Scholars, are careful to keep company money - raised from members - separate from funds raised for charitable ends. ""We do encourage education. That's really [our] mainstay,"" says Georgina Gough, Upper Warden of the Arts Scholars, the youngest livery company. It brings together academics, experts and dealers. For David Ferris, though, the older guilds must reform themselves. Their secrecy may not be helping them. What goes on in meetings of their courts - a governing committee similar to a modern company's board - is kept confidential, Mr Ferris says. It is also usual to become a member through patrimony - literally, because your father was a member. Newer and more forward-thinking companies say they try to avoid this. ""We need to remember that the source of our assets is the benevolence of people in medieval times,"" says Mr Ferris. ""They would be deeply shocked if they found out only a paltry amount was going to the public good.""

'Walls work': Trump defends emergency move,"This video can not be played Trump: 'I've signed the order - now we'll be sued' President Trump has confirmed he will use emergency powers to build a wall on the US border with Mexico, saying ""walls work"". Building the wall was a key pledge of Mr Trump's campaign, but Democrats have described the move as a ""gross abuse of power"". He later signed the plan along with a spending bill aimed at preventing a repeat of a recent government shutdown. He announced the plan after Congress refused to pay for a wall in the bill. Senior Democrats immediately said that they would challenge the move in the courts. The declaration will give Mr Trump access to billions of dollars for his project. All you need to know about the US border in seven charts Trump 'scams base' and other reaction Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Making the announcement in the White House Rose Garden, the president said the emergency would allow him to get almost $8bn for the wall. The money is expected to be diverted from military construction projects and efforts to fight the drugs trade. This is still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of the wall along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border. This video can not be played Senator McConnell supports the president; Speaker Pelosi warns it sets a dangerous precedent ""We're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border,"" Mr Trump said. ""We have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it's unacceptable. ""Everyone knows that walls work."" But Mr Trump accepted that he would be sued for the move, and predicted that the emergency order would lead to legal action which was likely to end up in the Supreme Court. Within hours, the first legal challenge against the declaration of national emergency was launched. A liberal advocacy group, Public Citizen, sued on behalf of a nature preserve and three Texas landowners who have been told the wall may be constructed on their properties. By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor The trouble with going nuclear is there is fall-out. This has been presented as a predictably partisan issue. On one side of the wall, Republicans; on the other side Democrats. But by going nuclear the president has made it more complicated than that. There are a lot of Republicans - in the Senate and in the House - deeply uneasy about what Mr Trump is doing. Why? Because the constitutional arrangement of the US is that Congress - not the president - controls the purse strings and allocates funds. This is a major land grab by the president. It undermines their position and sets a very dangerous precedent.

'Walls work': Trump defends emergency moveThe US president confirms he will use emergency powers to build a wall on Mexico's border.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump: 'I've signed the order - now we'll be sued' President Trump has confirmed he will use emergency powers to build a wall on the US border with Mexico, saying ""walls work"". Building the wall was a key pledge of Mr Trump's campaign, but Democrats have described the move as a ""gross abuse of power"". He later signed the plan along with a spending bill aimed at preventing a repeat of a recent government shutdown. He announced the plan after Congress refused to pay for a wall in the bill. Senior Democrats immediately said that they would challenge the move in the courts. The declaration will give Mr Trump access to billions of dollars for his project. All you need to know about the US border in seven charts Trump 'scams base' and other reaction Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Making the announcement in the White House Rose Garden, the president said the emergency would allow him to get almost $8bn for the wall. The money is expected to be diverted from military construction projects and efforts to fight the drugs trade. This is still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of the wall along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border. This video can not be played Senator McConnell supports the president; Speaker Pelosi warns it sets a dangerous precedent ""We're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border,"" Mr Trump said. ""We have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it's unacceptable. ""Everyone knows that walls work."" But Mr Trump accepted that he would be sued for the move, and predicted that the emergency order would lead to legal action which was likely to end up in the Supreme Court. Within hours, the first legal challenge against the declaration of national emergency was launched. A liberal advocacy group, Public Citizen, sued on behalf of a nature preserve and three Texas landowners who have been told the wall may be constructed on their properties. By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor The trouble with going nuclear is there is fall-out. This has been presented as a predictably partisan issue.

"Brothers held over 'attack' on SmollettUS police detain two Nigerian men, one of whom worked on Jussie Smollett's TV show Empire.US & Canada","Chicago police have released two men arrested in connection with an alleged attack on Empire actor Jussie Smollett. The US TV star needed hospital treatment last month aftera suspected racist and homophobic attack. A police spokesperson said on Friday the men were released without charge and were no longer being classified as suspects. Jussie Smollett said he'd been ""forever changed"" by the alleged attack, which took place on 29 January. The 36-year-old actor has said two white men hurling racial and homophobic insults punched him, poured a chemical substance over him, and put a rope around his neck. Earlier,police had dismissed local media reports that the alleged attack was a hoax, and said Mr Smollett continued to be treated as a victim, not a suspect. Who are themen arrested? Two men, Nigerian brothers, were arrested in connection with the incident on Wednesday. They had worked as Empire extras, sometimes going to the gym with the actor, their lawyer said. They had been picked up at Chicago's O'Hare airport, returning from a trip to Nigeria,  their lawyer told US media. ""When they first learned about what happened to [Jussie] they were horrified,"" Gloria Schmidt told CBS Chicago. ""This is someone they've worked with, so they don't want to see somebody go through that."" A police spokesman initially said they were treating the unidentified men as ""potential suspects"" as there was ""probable cause"" that they may have engaged in a crime. No further details were given. This video can not be played Attacked actor 'has tasted brutality of hatred' On Thursday, police had searched their home. At least one of the brothers worked on Empire, police confirmed. Representatives for Smollett have not yet commented on the latest developments in the case. But recounting the night publicly for the first time, he told US network ABC he had hesitated to call police after it happened because of pride. ""We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak. And I am not weak. And we as a people are not weak."" When police came he says he left the rope around his neck and was still wearing clothes that smelled of bleach. ""I went down to where it happened and I walked them through exactly what happened."" Chemical thrown on TV star in 'hate crime' Jussie Smollett: I'm the gay Tupac Police release CCTV in US actor attack case The actor said he had just got back to Chicago that day, and after getting home realised there was no food in the house. He said he had ended up at a Subway sandwich shop getting some food - something people have questioned as strange. He told Good Morning America it was ""ridiculous"" that people thought he would lie about his reasons for being outside at 2am in freezing temperatures. ""Subway is open 24 hours for a reason, so that when you're hungry at night and you ain't got no food, you go to Subway,"" he said. He said he thought he would've been doubted less if he had said his alleged attacker ""was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black"". ""And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now."" Chicago police released this CCTV image of two ""people of interest"" in the case There were claims he had told police his attackers were wearing the Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats that are associated with President Donald Trump. ""I never said that. I didn't need to add anything like that,"" he said. ""I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae."" But the attackers did say ""This is MAGA country"", he said. The actor said he thought he had been targeted because he was outspoken about President Trump - who when asked about the attack said ""That's horrible, it doesn't get worse"". ""I don't know what to say to that. I appreciate him not brushing over it,"" Mr Smollett said of Mr Trump's comments. Writers of Empire have stood behind the actor since the attack - and after reports that plans to write him off the show had led to the hoax, they came out in support of him again.

Trump 'scams base' and other reaction,"US immigration agents parked on the US side of the southern border President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency on the US southern border, claiming that he needs special powers to build a wall to halt all illegal migration. His decision comes as he signs a bipartisan budget deal to avoid a government shutdown. But the deal does not provide funding for the wall, his signature campaign pledge that he repeatedly claimed Mexico would pay for. Some Republicans oppose the move, saying it creates a precedent for other presidents to bypass Congress if they do not fund his the administration's priorities. Democrats are uniformly opposed while legal experts are uncertain about the constitutionality of the executive action. 'Walls work': Trump confirms emergency move South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who often supports the president, said: ""I think this is a political fight worth having."" North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows, who helped pressure Mr Trump to withhold his signature from a spending bill, triggering a 35-day government shutdown, said he supports the decision. Mr Meadows told Fox News that the declaration is necessary ""because Congress has failed this president and the American people"". Allow Twitter content?

Conservative radio host Steve Deace said that Mr Trump should either declare a national emergency or back the spending bill, but not both.

Last Great Escape prisoner dies aged 99Sqn Ldr Dick Churchill was one of 76 airmen who escaped from prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III.Devon,"Dick Churchill was described as ""tenacious, resilient and incredibly brave"" The last surviving member of the real-life Great Escape team has died. Former squadron leader Dick Churchill was one of 76 airmen whose escape from the Stalag Luft III camp in Nazi Germany in 1944 was immortalised in the Hollywood film starring Steve McQueen. Mr Churchill, who lived in Crediton, Devon, died on Wednesday, aged 99. Chief of the Air Staff Sir Stephen Hillier said: ""He was from a selfless generation who offered bravery and sacrifice to secure our freedom."" ""On behalf of the RAF as a whole I would like to offer my condolences to the friends and family of Flt Lt Richard 'Dick' Churchill, one of the RAF personnel involved in the Great Escape. ""He will be sorely missed. Per Ardua [the RAF motto]."" This video can not be played The last survivor of 'The Great Escape' camp tells his story Air Vice-Marshal David Murray, of the RAF Benevolent Fund, said Mr Churchill ""embodied the spirit of the RAF - tenacious, resilient and incredibly brave in the face of adversity."" More news and stories from across Devon and Cornwall. Mr Churchill's deathfollowed that of Australian pilot Paul Royle, who died in Perth, aged 101 in 2015. The survivors formed a sort of club and kept in contact through the Sagan Select Subway Society newsletter, of which Mr Royle and Mr Churchill were the last two recipients. Mr Churchill was among 76 airmen who escaped through a 102m-long tunnel Stalag Luft III opened in spring 1942, and held air forces personnel only At maximum it held 10,000 prisoners of war, covered 59 acres, with five miles (8km) of perimeter fencing Some 600 prisoners helped dig three tunnels, which were referred to as Tom, Dick and Harry The ""Great Escape"" happened on the night of 24 to 25 March, 1944 Seventy-six men attempted a getaway through tunnel Harry, which was 102m (336ft) long and 8.5m deep Seventy-three of them - including Mr Churchill - were recaptured by the Germans within three days. Two-thirds of them were executed on Hitler's orders The camp was liberated by Soviet forces in January 1945 A spokesperson for the RAF Benevolent Fund said it is believed there are at least two remaining RAF veterans who were held at Stalag Luft III, which now stands in Poland. They are named as Charles Clarke, who was not involved in the escape, and Jack Lyon, who was in the tunnel when the plot was uncovered. Last survivor of 'The Great Escape' camp.
