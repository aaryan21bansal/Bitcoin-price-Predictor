Apple reveals 'leap forward' iPhone X,"This video can not be played WATCH: Apple's event in two minutes Apple has revealed a high-end smartphone with an ""edge-to-edge"" screen that has no physical home button. The iPhone X - which is referred to as ""ten"" - uses a facial recognition system to recognise its owner rather than a fingerprint-based one. Apple said FaceID can work in the dark by using 30,000 infra-red dots to check an identity, and was harder to fool than its old TouchID system. It is Apple's most expensive phone yet. A 64 gigabyte capacity model will cost $999 (Â£999 in the UK) when it goes on sale on 3 November. A 256GB version will be priced at $1,149 (Â£1,149 in the UK). This video can not be played WATCH: Dave Lee gets hands on with the new iPhone X By contrast, Samsung is charging $930 (Â£869 in the UK) for its new Note 8 phone, which has 64GB of storage. ""The iPhone X is a long-term investment by Apple that sets a template for the next generation of iPhone hardware,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""An OLED [organic light-emitting diode] display and the new design is likely to be standard on future iPhone models, but Apple must first tackle the challenge of obtaining sufficient supplies."" Apple said the switch to an OLED display would help the phone produce ""true blacks"" and more accurate colours than before. LG and Samsung already use similar tech on their handsets. Prior to the launch, Apple's most expensive phone was an iPhone 7 Plus that cost $969 (Â£919 in the UK). One expert commented that Apple's ability to get consumers to spend more on its smartphones than rivals' was ""legendary"". This video can not be played WATCH: A hands on with the new iPhone 8 Plus ""There may be an element of high pricing to constrain demand and make things match up with how many they can produce,"" said Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics. ""But I suspect Apple always had a $1,000 iPhone in mind - we had seen the price creep up year after year, and there's a lot of pressure from shareholders for the company to hit a $1tn valuation. ""Bumping up the prices on their number one product is one way of doing that."" iPhone X: the internet reacts Apple's augmented ambitions Who are the band on the iPhone X advert? iPhone X: 10 key moments leading to the new handset Apple suffers 'major iPhone X leak' Apple acknowledged that users might have concerns about using facial recognition to verify purchases via Apple Pay or to access their device. But it claimed that while there was a one-in-50,000 chance that TouchID could be unlocked by a random stranger, the odds rose to one-in-one-million with FaceID. Apple said it used a range of technologies to ensure its FaceID system was accurate Nevertheless, one expert said users might still be concerned the handset had no fingerprint sensor as an alternative. ""This is the steepest hurdle that they have,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from market research firm Creative Strategies. ""A lot of consumers will be a little bit reluctant to use facial recognition as an ID system until Apple has proven that it is safe and works all the time. ""In the eyes of consumers TouchID wasn't broken - so they may ask why Apple is trying to fix it."" Other features announced about the handset included: its 5.8in (14.7cm) screen has 458 pixels per inch, making it the firm's most detailed phone display to date. To mark this it has been branded ""super retina"" the lack of a home button is dealt with by requiring users to swipe up to access its apps, and to press a side button to summon its virtual assistant Siri portrait mode - in which the camera blurs a photo's background - and a relighting tool can be used on pictures taken by both the front and rear cameras it has two hours more battery life than the iPhone 7 It's the big(ger) leap that iPhone fans - and Wall Street - had been demanding. The iPhone X brings together many features we'd been expecting - such as FaceID for unlocking the phone, and animated emojis - animojis - that look fun to play with, if not a killer feature that will have people running to stores. All this won't come cheap: at $999+ it's the most expensive iPhone to date. Apple is often accused of being slow to new tech, and I think that criticism will continue. Wireless charging comes years after Samsung first introduced it, for example, and the overall look of the phone - which no longer has the iconic home button - looks strikingly similar to the latest Samsung Galaxy Note. The iPhone X uses its face-mapping sensors to let users control the facial expressions of new animojis The phone was unveiled in the new Steve Jobs Theater, a purpose-built venue for such launches. A beautiful, comfy building, with marble everywhere, it sits alongside Apple's striking new spaceship campus. This is the house that iPhone built, with a decade of phenomenal success. Does iPhone X herald another great era? The audience here cheered, but didn't stand, with applause. I'm reserving my judgement until I've tried it. The iPhone X also adds support for wireless charging. ""Apple chose Qi wireless charging,"" noted Ian Fogg, from the IHS Markit consultancy. ""It was the right decision to use a standard because Apple users will benefit from widely available charge pads."" The feature was also introduced to the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which were introduced earlier at the event. The iPhone 8 models are dust and water resistant The lower-end 4.7in and 5.5in devices are distinguished from their predecessors by having: glass rather than metal backs faster processors improved camera sensors that help them operate in low light stereo speakers that are 25% louder than before The iPhone 8 ranges from $699 to $849 and the iPhone 8 Plus from $799 to $949. They will cost the same amounts in Sterling and go on sale on 22 September. The new models coincide with the release of iOS 11 - the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. It introduces ARKit - software development tools that make it easier for developers to add augmented reality features to their apps, in which graphics are mixed together with real-world views. Marketing chief Phil Schiller showed off one app that - if used by spectators at a sports stadium - would show real-time stats hovering over the live action. Another demo involved the Machines, a multiplayer robot-battle game that can be played over views of close-by table tops and other surfaces. The facility will not work on the iPhone 6 or older devices, so may provide a means to convince owners of ageing Apple kit to upgrade. This video can not be played WATCH: What can AR do on iPhone? ""When Apple first introduced the iPhone users were unsure about how touchscreens would benefit them, but now we know that they're a great way to use a device,"" said Brian Blau, a tech industry analyst at Gartner. ""The same thing will happen with augmented reality - it's as important as touch, if not more. ""Developers have new opportunities and I think they will embrace them, but just as with touch it took them years to perfect those experiences, I also think that will also happen with AR."" Apple also unveiled a version of its smartwatch with its own 4G link. The new watch has a red crown to denote its 4G capability The innovation means that the Watch Series 3 can receive phone calls, access internet services and stream music without being linked to an iPhone. Users will, however, face an additional monthly charge for the benefit. Apple recently overtook Fitbit to become the world's joint-top wearable tech-maker alongside Xiaomi,according to one study,external. Other companies - including LG and Samsung - have previously sold smartwatches with in-built cellular capabilities, but battery-life restrictions and other issues limited interest. ""Apple's ability in the past to generate new markets when others thought they were dead is legendary,"" commented Mr Mawston. ""For people like joggers, runners and cyclists who possibly want to do hardcore sports outdoors without carrying two devices, an LTE Apple Watch could be something of a blessing."" The latest version of the Watch's operating system - which will also be available to earlier models - will include new heart monitor functions. It will warn owners if their heart rate becomes elevated when they are not active or if its rhythm becomes irregular, to flag the possibility of disease. The 4G Apple Watch will cost $399 (Â£300) and be released on 22 September. The launch was held in the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple's new campus Apple also announced a fresh version of its TV set-top box, which now supports 4K video and high dynamic range (HDR) content. In one of the few details not to have leaked in advance, Apple revealed it had struck a deal with several of the major movie studios to ensure that films in the higher-resolution, richer-colour formats would not cost more than their high-definition (HD) equivalents. Consumers have had to pay a premium for 4K HDR movies until now Users' existing iTunes movie libraries will also be upgraded without charge. HDR 4K movies have already been available to rent or buy from services including Amazon, but they tended to be sold at much higher prices than lower-quality formats. Hands on with new iPhone X.

Boy and parents die in volcanic crater,"The three fell into a pit that opened up as the parents tried to save their son A boy and his parents have died after falling into a pit in a volcanic crater at Solfatara near Naples. The drama unfolded during a family trip at the end of the school holidays, when the 11-year-old walked past a barrier into a prohibited area. When his parents tried to pull him to safety, part of the crater collapsed and they fell 3m (10ft) into a hole. It is thought all three were overcome by fumes. Their seven-year-old son did not enter the crater and survived. Solfatara of Pozzuoli is one of a number of volcanoes to the west of Naples and is popular with tourists. A dormant volcano that last erupted in 1198, it has a shallow crater and is known for its sulphurous fumes and emissions of steam. The family was visiting from Meolo near Venice in north-eastern Italy, reports said. The parents were both in their forties.  Italian reports named the three as Massimiliano Carrer, Tiziana Zaramella, and their son, Lorenzo. The hole in the crater was visible along with the chains that rescuers had used to reach the three victims The area where they died is known for a type of quicksand, where the ground is prone to crumbling. When the boy went into the quicksand, his father tried to help him and fell into the pit. His mother went to their aid and all three are thought to have become trapped and lost consciousness because of poisonous gases. The local civil protection department said that inside the pit was boiling hot mud. Firefighters managed to recover the three bodies and Pozzuoli mayor Vincenzo Figliolia said he had never come across such a tragedy at the site in 40 years. Solfatara is one of many volcanic craters in the Campi Flegrei area west of Naples The surviving son was taken to a bar close to the entrance, where owner Armando Guerriero told La Repubblica: ""We tried to calm him down, as he was obviously very shocked. He was repeatedly asking for the rest of his family."" The seven-year-old was later looked after by social workers and a psychologist. He was due to be reunited with his grandparents later. A local worker at the site, Diego Vitagliano, said the accident was the worst thing he had seen in his life.

Town's 'awful' Diana tribute mocked,"This video can not be played Chesterfield Borough Council said it hoped the design would bring more people to the town. A floral tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, displayed as part of a town's well dressing celebrations, has been described as ""horrific"" and ""awful"". The memorial displayed in Chesterfield Market Place marks the 20th anniversary of the death of the princess. However, the portrait has been mocked on social media, with some saying it looked more like Worzel Gummidge. Chesterfield Borough Council said it hoped the design would bring more people to the town. More on this and other stories from the East Midlands The authority published the pictures of the memorial on itsFacebook page,externalearlier, attracting mixed reviews. The floral tribute was installed in Chesterfield Market Place Some have likened the portrait to the TV character Worzel Gummidge Gayla Tuckley thought it was an ""insult to Diana"", while Catherine Bunten commented she was ""crying with laughter"". Richard Wilkins said it looked more like Worzel Gummidge, a living scarecrow played by Jon Pertwee, in the children's 1979 TV show, while Julie White commented: ""I appreciate all the work that goes into the dressing of a well but this is just awful."" The pictures have since gone viral, provoking many more comments, including one by Welbeck Kane who said: ""I live here [Chesterfield] and, let me tell you, I can feel its eyes on me, even now in my house."" Many people said the portrait looked nothing like the princess A spokesman for the authority said: ""The well dressing is produced by 14 volunteers using the ancient Derbyshire art of well dressing, which involves creating designs from flower petals and other natural materials. ""All art is meant to be a talking point and that certainly seems to be the case with this year's design. ""The well dressing is designed to attract visitors to the area and if the publicity encourages more people to come and experience our historic market town and local shops then that can only be good for Chesterfield."" The well dressings are on display until Saturday.

Hope Hicks named Trump media chief,"Twenty-eight-year-old interim White House Communications Director Hope Hicks will serve in the role on a permanent basis. The longtime Trump aide is the fourth person to fill the position, replacing Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired in July after just 10 days on the job. Ms Hicks has served as President Donald Trump's strategic communications director and campaign press secretary. The ex-Trump Organization employee is one of his most trusted aides. As White House communications director she will be responsible for shaping the administration's message - although in a less visible way than press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The appointment of Ms Hicks - a former Ralph Lauren fashion model - comes after a summer of staff shake-ups at the White House. Arrivederci, Mooch - The story of Anthony Scaramucci The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Who is Trump's 28-year-old media director? Mr Scaramucci was fired after he raised eyebrows for calling a reporter to give a profanity-laced tirade against his own colleagues. President Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and spokesman, Sean Spicer, both left their posts after Mr Scaramucci's appointment. General John Kelly, who replaced Mr Priebus, sacked Mr Scaramucci after he was sworn in. Mike Dubke, who was first appointed as communications director, resigned in May. Mr Spicer also filled in as communications director while the post was open over the summer. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House correspondent Reporters say mean things about Hope Hicks. They complain that she's not qualified for the job, and they say she's in over her head. It's true that she did not come from the Washington establishment or the political world. A former Ford model, she started working for Trump in 2015. Still, she has something valuable - the president's trust. Among those in the West Wing, she's the closest to Trump and knows how he wants to achieve his goals. That seems like a good background for someone who's handling his communications strategy.

Brexit talks delayed 'for consultation',"David Davis and Michel Barnier are currently meeting once a month The next round of Brexit talks has been postponed by a week to ""allow more time for consultation"". The fourth round of UK-EU negotiations, due to begin on 18 September, will start on the 25th instead. The government said a short delay ""would give negotiators the flexibility to make progress"". There had been been speculation that the talks could be moved to accommodate a major speech by Prime Minister Theresa May on the issue of Europe. ""The UK and the European Commission have today jointly agreed to start the fourth round of negotiations on September 25,"" the Department for Exiting the European Union said in a statement. ""Both sides settled on the date after discussions between senior officials in recognition that more time for consultation would give negotiators the flexibility to make progress in the September round."" Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has emphasised the need to be flexible while also warning that the ""clock is ticking"" if an agreement is to be reached by the time the UK is scheduled to leave at the end of March 2019. Why it's all about the money All you need to know about Brexit Who's doing the negotiating? Talks between the two sides, led on the British side by Brexit Secretary David Davis, have been taking place once a month since June. The UK is keen to intensify their pace and open discussions on the country's future relationship with the EU, including trade, as soon as possible. At the moment, the focus is on core separation issues, including the rights of EU nationals in the UK and British expats on the continent, the future of the Irish border, and financial matters. Speculation about the delay was fuelled when European Parliament chief negotiator Guy Verhofstadt claimed an ""important intervention"" would be made by the PM ""in the coming days"", although this has not been confirmed by Downing Street. Reuters also quoted diplomatic sources as suggesting that there could be a hold-up in the talks to allow for an event in the UK's ""domestic political calendar"". The PM's loss of her Commons majority following June's snap election caused turmoil in the party and has made her more vulnerable to possible rebellions over key Brexit legislation. Mrs May - who has insisted her Brexit strategy is unchanged and that she wants to stay as leader for the ""long term"" - is due to address the Conservative Party conference at the start of October.

Public sector pay cap to be lifted,"Rank and file police officers will get a 1% bonus on top of a rise in their pay The cap on public sector pay rises in England and Wales is to be lifted. Ministers will now get ""flexibility"" to breach the longstanding 1% limit. The announcement came as the government said police officers would get a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus, with prison officers getting a 1.7% rise - both funded from existing budgets. Unions reacted angrily to the pay awards, branding them a real-terms cut, and the Prison Officers Association threatened industrial action. There was also a warning from police chiefs that making forces pay for the increase themselves would put ""financial pressure on already stretched budgets"". Teachers' pay declining, warns OECD Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private? Unite boss 'would back illegal strikes' Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and since 2013, rises have been capped at 1% - below the rate of inflation. There has been speculation in recent weeks the cap could be lifted in response to worries about its impact on staff recruitment and retention and morale in the public sector. Announcing the increases for police and prison officers, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Elizabeth Truss said ""now is a time to move to a more flexible approach"" to public sector pay. She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One review bodies and departments were being given greater leeway to use pay to address ""pinch points"" within public sector staffing. ""We are making sure that our policy is targeted to where there are specific issues, where we need to make sure we recruit more talent into the public sector, but also where we do need to make sure that we are holding on to those really valued people,"" she said. ""What we are making sure is that we look at it on a workforce-by-workforce basis because there are very different issues for teachers than for nurses and for police officers."" The higher increases for rank-and-file police and prison officers, which are backdated to 1 September and 1 April respectively, are based on the most recent recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Since the general election, Theresa May has been under pressure to respond to voter concerns over squeezed living standards. And today's announcements on pay for police and prison officers mark the beginning of the end for the public sector pay cap. But if the government thought breaching its own pay cap would ease tensions with the trade unions it will need to think again. At the TUC conference there was anger and disappointment. The biggest union, Unite, threatened to press ahead with strike action even if their ballot turnout and margins don't meet levels now required by law. While there was very little support for talk of calling illegal strikes, legal action could be on the horizon. If the unions don't get a commitment from the chancellor in November's Budget to fund larger pay increases next year we should expect the prospect of strikes in the new year. Although next year's pay settlements for other parts of the public sector, such as the NHS, have yet to be decided, a No 10 spokesman confirmed the existing pay cap was at an end. The newly-announced rises are still below the level of inflation, which measured by the Consumer Prices Index rose to 2.9%, from 2.6%, in August. Steve Gillan, the general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said: ""I have made it clear that it is a pay cut. It is not acceptable. Our executive will be looking to co-ordinate action with other trade unions."" Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said the announcement would leave many officers ""angry and deflated"". ""We were not greedy in what we asked for,"" Mr White added. ""Officers have been taking home about 15% less than they were seven years ago."" The federation had asked for a 2.8% increase to basic pay, while the Prison Officers Association had called for a 5% increase. The government has decided to lift the 1% pay cap on the public sector, although at the moment we don't know by how much, except for the police and prison officers. How much it would cost is a tricky question. In the case of the police and prison officers, the money is apparently coming from existing budgets, but that means that there will have to be cuts elsewhere or reserves will be run down. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that an extra 1% pay for the entire public sector would cost about Â£1.8bn a year, although it would get some of that back in income tax and National Insurance. But there are other savings that need to be taken into account, for example, some have argued that raising pay in the NHS would stop staff leaving and reduce absence, so reducing the use of more expensive agency staff and saving money. Chief Constable Francis Habgood, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said forces had budgeted in line with the 1% cap until 2020, adding that without extra government funding the latest award would ""inevitably impact on our ability to deliver policing services and maintain staffing levels"". This was rejected by Policing Minister Nick Hurd, who said the offer was affordable to forces. He added that police forces were ""sitting on"" at least Â£1.5bn in reserves. Responding to the announcement, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said ""this below-inflation pay offer is pathetic"". ""Public sector workers have suffered seven long years of real pay cuts, and are thousands of pounds worse off. Today's announcement means bills will continue to rise faster than their wages."" Speaking at the TUC conference in Brighton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused ministers of playing ""divide and rule"" with different parts of the public sector. He said: ""A pay cut is a pay cut. We must be united in breaking the pay cap for all workers."" Unison said it was a ""tiny step in the right direction but not nearly enough"". Chancellor Philip Hammond had been expected to address the issue in his Autumn Budget amid calls from Labour, and some Tory MPs, for help for million of workers who have suffered years of real-terms pay cuts. As the latest announcements are being funded through existing budgets, they will bring no extra funding for the devolved administrations, who have the power to set their own rates of public sector pay. Last month, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the 1% cap would be scrapped from next year. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the pay cap was ""no longer sustainable"", calling for it to be ""lifted across the board"".

Beach closed over lethal man-of-war,"A Portuguese man-of-war, which was one of a group of six, washed up at Gwithian Large numbers of potentially fatal Portuguese man-of-war have washed up on a Cornish beach, prompting its closure. RNLI lifeguards erected do not swim red flags at Perranporth beach earlier because of the ""unusually large number"" of the creatures. The jellyfish-like organisms, which have long purple tentacles, have also been seen in Wales this month, says the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). With mild sea temperatures of 16C there were fears of swimmers being stung. The RNLI said it placed red flags at Perranporth beach between 10:00 and 13:30 BST to signal that the water was out of bounds, while lifeguards took advice on the level of danger to beachgoers. More on the man-of-war sightings and other stories from Cornwall Man-of-war were spotted at Newgale, Pembrokeshire, on 8 September and the next day on beaches near the holiday destination of Newquay. A leatherback turtle was found washed up at Portreath They have also been seen at Porthmelon Beach on the Isles of Scilly and on the Cornish beaches of Portheras Cove and Summerleaze, Widemouth, Perranporth, Hayle, Holywell Bay and Praa Sands. Six were also reported at Gwithian. Dr Peter Richardson from the MCS said a man-of-war's tentacles, which are usually about 10m (30ft) long, ""deliver an agonising and potentially lethal sting"". ""They are very pretty and look like partially deflated balloons with ribbons but picking one up could be very nasty,"" he said. The man-of-war retain their sting when they are wet, even if they look dead, he warned. He advised anyone who was stung to get the tentacles away from the body as soon as possible. The man-of-war can be tempting to children because it looks like a deflated balloon The (Physalia physalis) isnot a jellyfish, but a floating colony of organisms dependent on one another for survival Its gas-filled bladder (sometimes known as the sail), enables it to float on the ocean surface and drift with the current Its sting - delivered from tentacles which can reach up to 50m below the surface - is extremely painful for humans and can be fatal in rare circumstances Hundreds of swimmers are stung every year,especially when huge numbers appear in coastal waters Leatherback turtles have also been washed up, Dr Richardson said. A leatherback turtle was found at Portreath on 9 September and another one has been reported in Pembrokeshire. The NHSrecommends using tweezers or a clean stick, and gloves if possible, to remove man-of-war tentacles,external. If symptoms become more severe, or a sensitive part of the body has been stung, you should seek medical help. The MCS is asking people toreport any sightings,externalwhich could rise as man-of-war are driven across the Atlantic by recent storms.

28% 'hold anti-Semitic attitudes',"More than a quarter of British people hold at least one anti-Semitic view, according to a study of attitudes to Jewish people. The Institute for Jewish Policy Research (JPR) said the finding came from the largest and most detailed survey of attitudes towards Jews and Israel ever conducted in Britain. But it said the study did not mean that British people were anti-Semitic. Researchers also found a correlation in anti-Jewish and anti-Israel attitudes. The study found a relatively small number of British adults - 2.4% - expressed multiple anti-Semitic attitudes ""readily and confidently"". But when questioned about whether they agreed with a number of statements, including ""Jews think they are better than other people"", and ""Jews exploit holocaust victimhood for their own purposes"", 30% agreed with at least one statement. Despite this, the researchers said they found that levels of anti-Semitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world. A spokesman for the Community Security Trust,which has recorded high levels anti-Semitic crime, said: ""We believe the new findings, data and nuance in this study will help us to work even more effectively with partners inside and outside the Jewish community to tackle this problem."" The report said about 70% of the population of Britain had a favourable opinion of Jews and did not hold any anti-Semitic ideas or views. The JPR's researchers questioned 5,466 people face-to-face and online in the winter of 2016/17 - 995 of these were Muslims, although a smaller number of Muslims were included in the statisticians' nationally representative sample. They found more than half of Muslims (55%) held at least one anti-Semitic attitude. Dr Jonathan Boyd, director of the JPR, said: ""Our intention here was not to make any broad generalisations about the Muslim population and their attitudes towards Jews. ""There does seem to be some relationship between levels of religiosity in the Muslim population and anti-Semitism."" The institute said it wanted to promote an ""elastic view"", making a distinction between people who are clearly anti-Semites, and ideas that are perceived by Jews as anti-Semitic. In December 2016 the governmentadopted an internationally recognised definition of anti-Semitism,external: ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews"". The researchers also questioned people about their views on statements about Israel and the conflict with the Palestinians. Their report said fewer than one in five people questioned (17%) had a favourable opinion of Israel, whereas about one in three (33%) held an unfavourable view. The report said: ""The position of the British population towards Israel can be characterised as one of uncertainty or indifference, but among those who hold a view, people with sympathies towards the Palestinians are numerically dominant."" Dr Boyd said: ""Anti-Israel and anti-Jewish views exist both together and in isolation. ""The higher the level of anti-Israel attitudes measured, the more likely they are to hold anti-Semitic views as well."" The study also revealed that anti-Semitic attitudes were higher than normal among people who classified their politics as ""very right-wing"". Among this group they were two to four times higher than among the general population. The researchers said the prevalence was considerably higher among right-wingers than on the left. Rabbi Charley Baginsky, from the Liberal Judaism movement, said: ""The report is important for helping us understand where the anxiety comes from within the community at large and for understanding why anti-Semitism seems to be the prevailing discourse within the community. ""We must be really careful that it does not come to define us and that we celebrate the positive interactions with society at large. ""What is arguably more important â¦ is to educate and interact, to be more outward facing and open to discussion than inward facing.""

Traveller family slavery gang jailed,"The Rooney family ran a driveway resurfacing business Nine members of a traveller family who kept workers in squalid conditions in caravans have been jailed for modern day slavery offences. One victim, whose ordeal spanned more than 25 years, was made to dig his own grave. The head of the family, Martin Rooney Senior, was jailed for 10 years, while two of his sons were each jailed for more than 15 years. The traveller family were described as ""chilling in their mercilessness"". More on this and other stories from across Lincolnshire The case at Nottingham Crown Court was part of Lincolnshire Police's Operation Pottery investigation, one of the largest investigations of its kind. The Rooneys' victims were beaten and left without running water or toilet facilities at the Drinsey Nook site in Lincolnshire. Beaten, abused and made to dig own grave This video can not be played The sister of one of the victims says he was forced to dig his own grave Sentencing Martin Rooney Senior, Timothy Spencer QC said: ""You brought up your sons in a criminal culture."" The judge also compared the squalid lives of the victims to the lavish lifestyle the family enjoyed. ""It was like the gulf between medieval royalty and peasantry,"" he told him. The head of the family Martin Rooney Senior was jailed for 10 years Ch Supt Chris Davison, of Lincolnshire Police, said: ""The victims will never get the years back that were taken away from them but I hope this provides them with some comfort that justice has been served and demonstrates that we will do everything in our power to try and stop others suffering in the ways that they did."" Mr Davison said there were potentially other victims of modern slavery in the UK and that the force ""would not rest on this result"". ""We are exploring five active investigations and we will continue to put any victims at the very heart of our investigations,"" he added. Police began operations against members of the Rooney family in September 2014 when seven warrants were executed in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and London. A number of victims were found and the UK Human Trafficking Centre concluded 18 men had been illegally brought to the sites. The victims were all described as vulnerable adults, aged between 18 and 63, who were often homeless and had been picked up by the defendants from across the UK. The victims lived in squalor, police said In one attack, a man was beaten with a shovel and left injured in a caravan for days for returning a car with no petrol. The court also heard of one victim's terrifying ordeal which spanned more than a quarter of a century. On one occasion, he was made to dig his own grave if he did not agree to a lifetime of servitude. The Rooneys' victims were beaten at the Drinsey Nook site in Lincolnshire Judge Spencer also spoke of how the family used food as a means of control over their victims. ""They knew if they wanted to eat, they had to stay at Drinsey Nook,"" he said. ""None of the men, in my judgement, were ever truly free to leave at all."" ""You stripped them of dignity and humanity and confined them to a life of drudgery"". Bridget Rooney was told she had the power to stop what was happening but chose to ignore it In a statement which was read in court, one victim said ""life with the Rooneys was a living hell"". Judge Spencer told Bridget Rooney, described as the matriarch of the family, she had ""the power to stop this"". She was jailed for seven years. John Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 15 years and six months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, conspiracy to defraud, fraud by false representation, two counts of theft Patrick Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 15 years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, fraud by abuse of position, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two counts of theft Bridget Rooney, 55, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for seven years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Martin Rooney, 57, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 10 years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, unlawful wounding Martin Rooney, 23, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for six years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm John Rooney, 53, of Chantry Croft, Pontefract - Jailed for five years and 10 months for two counts of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Peter Doran, 36, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - Jailed for six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Gerard Rooney, 46, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - Jailed for six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Lawrence Rooney, 47, of no fixed address - Currently serving a five year prison sentence and once complete, will serve another six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Martin Rooney, 35, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield received a two year suspended sentence for two years Patrick Rooney, 54, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield received a 12 month suspended sentence for two years Two others, Eileen Rooney, 32, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby and Nora Rooney, 31, of the same address, were both acquitted. Janine Smith, from the Crown Prosecution Service, paid tribute to the victims Speaking outside court after sentencing, Janine Smith, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the sentences ""reflect the level of exploitation, control and violence they exhibited and the betrayal of those they condemned to forced labour and the people they defrauded"". She added: ""I hope that seeing their abusers imprisoned will be of some comfort to them and will be a suitable acknowledgement of their courage in giving evidence.""

N Korea threatens US with 'greatest pain',"North Korea says it has developed and tested a hydrogen bomb North Korea has threatened the United States with the ""greatest pain"" it has ever suffered following new sanctions imposed by the United Nations. Pyongyang's envoy to the UN accused Washington of opting for ""political, economic and military confrontation"". US President Donald Trump said the move was nothing compared to what would have to happen to deal with North Korea. The UN sanctions are an attempt to starve the country of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The measuresrestrict oil imports and ban textile exports,and were approved after North Korea's sixth and largest nuclear test earlier this month. Han Tae Song, North Korea's ambassador to the UN, said he ""categorically rejected"" what he called an ""illegal resolution"". ""The forthcoming measures by DPRK [the Democratic Republic of Korea] will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history,"" he told a UN conference in Geneva. ""Instead of making [the] right choice with rational analysis... the Washington regime finally opted for political, economic and military confrontation, obsessed with the wild dream of reversing the DPRK's development of nuclear force - which has already reached the completion phase."" This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? The resolution was only passed unanimously after North Korea's allies Russia and China agreed to softer sanctions than those proposed by the US. The initial text includeda total ban on oil imports, a measure seen by some analysts as potentially destabilising for the regime. The new sanctions agreed by the UN include: Limits on imports of crude oil and oil products. China, Pyongyang's main economic ally, supplies most of North Korea's crude oil A ban on exports of textiles, which is Pyongyang's second-biggest export worth more than $700m (Â£530m) a year A ban on new visas for North Korean overseas workers, which the US estimates would eventually cut off $500m of tax revenue per year A proposed asset freeze and a travel ban on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un were dropped. Reacting on Tuesday, Mr Trump said:  ""We think it's just another very small step, not a big deal. ""I don't know if it has any impact, but certainly it was nice to get a 15 to nothing vote. But those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen,"" he added, without giving details. North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? The US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, told the Security Council after the vote: ""We don't take pleasure in further strengthening sanctions today. We are not looking for war."" ""The North Korean regime has not yet passed the point of no return,"" she added. ""If North Korea continues its dangerous path, we will continue with further pressure. The choice is theirs."" A South Korean presidential office spokesman said on Tuesday: ""North Korea needs to realise that a reckless challenge against international peace will only bring about even stronger sanctions against them."" Monday's resolution was the ninth one unanimously adopted by the UN since 2006. North Korea crisis: What will Russia do? How do you defend against North Korea? The UN Security Council, which includes the US, has repeatedly slapped sanctions on North Korea 30 November 2016:UN targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap. Exports of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and the sale of statues were also banned. What happened next?On 14 May 2017, North Korea tested what it said was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead. 2 June 2017:UN imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations. What happened next?On 4 July, North Korea claimed it carried out its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 6 August:UN banned North Korean exports of coal, ore and other raw materials and limited investments in the country, costing Pyongyang an estimated $1bn - about a third of its export economy. What happened next?On 3 September, North Korea said it tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile. North Korea's missile programme What we know about North Korea nuclear test site How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? China's foreign ministrysaid on Tuesday,external(link in Chinese) that North Korea had ""ignored international opposition and once again conducted a nuclear test, severely violating UN Security Council resolutions"". It also repeated its call for a ""peaceful resolution"" instead of a military response, adding: ""China will never allow the peninsula to descend into war and chaos."" The BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie says Beijing is treading a fine line and wants sanctions tough enough to signal its displeasure to Pyongyang and avoid American accusations of complicity, but not so tough as to threaten North Korea's survival. Both Russia and China reiterated their proposal that the US and South Korea freeze all military drills - which anger North Korea - and asked for a halt in the deployment of the controversial anti-missile system Thaad, in exchange for Pyongyang's cessation of its weapons programmes. Beijing believes Thaad, which employs a powerful radar, is a security threat to China and neighbouring countries. Ms Haley last week dismissed this proposal as ""insulting"".

Is this the world's most powerful person?," It was a mild November night.  And in Berlin something unbelievable was happening. Hundreds, and then thousands, of incredulous East Germans surged towards what was once an impassable divide and found they could cross it unchallenged. Later, crowds cheered as young men with pick axes chipped away at the concrete that had separated them from the West for decades. As they sang and lit candles, reporters, stiff in their overcoats, spoke into the cameras. The Iron Curtain had parted. The Berlin Wall was falling. One of the defining moments of the 20th Century was underway. And Angela Merkel went for her weekly sauna. “It was Thursday,” she said many years later, “and Thursday was my sauna day so that’s where I went.” Merkel did eventually venture to the West that night - and back again the following day - but she was in no rush. “I figured if the Wall had opened it was hardly going to close again.” The response was typical of the young quantum chemist. And her approach – unhurried analysis in the face of high drama  – is one with which the whole world has become familiar. Angela Merkel is one of this century’s most enduring and powerful leaders - chancellor of Germany since 2005 and one of the world’s most recognisable figures. Her strength has grown during Europe’s economic crises. And from her role as a conduit between Russia and the West. For many, Merkel represents stability in an unstable and shifting world. Planning the future of a European Union without the UK. Quietly reinforcing new global alliances in the stormy wake of Donald Trump’s chaotic administration. Admirers declare her the last defender of Western democratic values. But while she is revered by many, she has also been reviled and caricatured for her uncompromising stances - on Greek debt, on refugee policy, on the environment. And yet we know very little about her. Even in her own country, she remains an enigmatic figure. The German chancellor is notoriously private. Her family, friends and staff are scrupulously discreet. Her husband, Joachim Sauer, makes few public appearances. The scientist is her second husband, although Merkel kept her first husband’s surname. Merkel with her husband, Joachim Sauer He and her confidantes form a circle around her as impenetrable as the thick forests of the Uckermark region where she grew up, and where she and Sauer still have a weekend retreat. To understand Merkel, her politics, her motivation, it’s important to consider her rather unusual upbringing in what was then communist East Germany. Her childhood home in Templin still stands - huge, serene, pastel-coloured, but overshadowed by the woodland that lies beyond it. To reach it one must drive through a complex of well-kept gardens and small cottages. In the car park, a young man and woman greet visitors with a formal handshake delivered with a wide trusting smile. Merkel's childhood home in Templin They’re residents at the complex – it houses adults with learning disabilities, as it did during the then Angela Kasner’s childhood. Her father, a Lutheran pastor, moved his family here from Hamburg not long after Angela was born. At a time when almost everyone else was migrating west, the Kasner family were heading east. The border had not yet been closed - that would come seven years later - but the regime in the communist German Democratic Republic was oppressive. Those who were considered dissenters had few prospects. No-one’s really sure what motivated Reverend Kasner’s decision to come here but the job seems to have appealed to him and, as a member of the clergy, he would have enjoyed more freedom than most in East Germany. Ulrich Schöneich – who would later become the mayor of Templin – knows the family well. Horst Kasner, he recalls, was a strict man who gathered around him a circle of intellectuals in Templin and ensured his children joined the GDR’s youth organisations, thus securing their future access to university education and employment. It was a decision that would come back to haunt Merkel later - decades on newspapers would print pictures of her as a teenager, dressed in the uniform of the regime’s Free German Youth movement. She has always insisted that her role within the organisation was a relatively passive one. “I can only rely on my memory,"" she said in 2013. “If something turns out to be different, I can live with that."" Schöneich, whose own father would not let him join the youth organisation, says he sees the influence of both parents on Merkel. Her mother was a schoolteacher although she had to give up her job when the family moved to the GDR. She was politically active, chairing the local social democrat party. Merkel is said to remain close to her mother, discussing political problems with her and travelling straight from the recent G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg to attend her birthday tea. “Both are there,” says Schöneich. “Her father was very career-focused and so is she. She acts tactically. Her mother is a very lovely woman who is loved by everyone.” While her political strategy is, he says, like that of a good chess player, Merkel is also a politician of scruples. “Many here expected that, when Angela became chancellor, Templin would blossom. You’re wrong, I told them, she can’t do that. She would be seen as biased.” Merkel was 35 when the Berlin Wall fell. She’d had a university education, married and divorced in her 20s, and reportedly even lived in a squat at one point, but many other freedoms – including the ability to travel the world – had been denied to her generation. Merkel (r) pictured in Poland in 1989 with her husband, and her colleague Malgorzata Jeziorska She often invokes her youth behind the Iron Curtain and speaks passionately on the subject of personal freedom. After Donald Trump’s election, horrified by his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border, Merkel was quick to remind him of his duty to uphold Western values - “democracy, freedom, respect for the rule of law and human dignity” regardless of “ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or political conviction”. The girl from Templin was undoubtedly moulded by her country’s turbulent history. Merkel may not have been among those who, on that November night in 1989, stood next to the Wall and sang as it fell. But in the decades to come it would be her voice - as the leader of a new Germany - which would resonate across the world. The environment minister was having a bad day. A furious crowd had gathered. Shouting and jeering, the protesters waved their banners. There was no way anyone was sending reprocessed nuclear waste to their village. Angela Merkel would struggle to persuade them otherwise. It was 1997 and she’d held the environment portfolio for three years. During that time, Helmut Kohl’s government had sent several transports of reprocessed waste from Germany’s nuclear power plants to be stored in or around the town of Gorleben. The locals were not impressed. Neither was Germany’s environmental lobby.  Some of the protests became violent. Thousands took to the streets. This was a national scandal and it would taint Merkel for years to come. Angela Merkel in 1994 But she’d come a long way since she cast about for a political party to join after the Wall fell. In less than 10 years she’d gone from helping out in the office of the then-Democratic Awakening (which would later evolve into the modern day Christian Democratic Union) to party spokeswoman and was now rising through the ranks of Helmut Kohl’s cabinet under the tutelage of the chancellor himself. He referred to his protégée as his “mädchen”. Heiko Sakurai's cartoon portrays Merkel impersonating the Statue of Liberty, standing on a plinth reading: ""Give me your tired, your poor..."", holding a tablet reading ""We'll manage it"" It was during those first years that Heiko Sakurai, a young political cartoonist, began to draw Angela Merkel. “What I concentrated on were her eyes,” he says. “Half-closed eyes. How she was watching. That was interesting to me. I thought she’s a bit like a sleepy girl, insecure. But that has changed. “I’m still drawing her with half-closed eyes but now I know it’s a sign of rationality. You can’t look into her mind - that’s still my problem. I still don’t know what the woman is thinking.” Angela Merkel: You just let the men do it...Theresa May: ... and then you get their job in the end. It illustrates, in his view, an ability to keep secrets that may have been born out of necessity during her childhood in East Germany. “That’s helped her in her career - to have a close circle of people who don’t talk and can keep secrets.” Merkel’s mentor Helmut Kohl would learn – too late – just how secretive his protégée could be. 1994: Chancellor Helmut Kohl with Merkel As Kohl and many in his party became mired ina funding scandal, Merkel distanced herself from him in a newspaper article. He never forgave what he perceived as an act of betrayal. Years later, his widow reportedly tried to stop Merkel from speaking at his funeral. Merkel and Kohl in 2007: In his later years he was sometimes a critic of her policies Merkel had helped to facilitate the end of Kohl’s chancellorship and had begun to realise her own ambition for the top job. It was worthy of a plot from one of the Wagnerian operas Merkel so enjoys. A political transformation was underway. The mädchen - the little girl - was gone. In her place stood the mächtig - the mighty. But, once her party regained power, it would be some time before Germany’s first female chancellor would gain the poise and self-assurance which characterise her today. Gradually her appearance changed - the hair cut less severe, the suits more streamlined. The woman Germans initially came to call Mutti (mum) exuded, perhaps cultivated, an image as a safe pair of hands. Trustworthy, straightforward, careful. Despite the nickname - which is rarely used these days - Merkel’s gender has rarely been an issue.  She has shattered a glass ceiling but it is rarely reflected in her own political rhetoric. “There is in Germany,” says Wolfgang Bosbach, a long serving CDU MP, “a decades old advertising slogan which everyone knows and it applies to Angela Merkel too - It’s better to stick with what one has. She’ll never stick to an ideology just for the sake of it, which is very un-German.” “People know she doesn’t tend to extremes and she impresses many also with her personal life. I remember how [former French President Francois] Hollande was photographed at night on his scooter going to see his girlfriend. No one can imagine Angela Merkel at night on a moped going to see her lover - and it will never happen.” But there have been moments where Merkel has surprised the country - and the world. As Sakurai puts it: “She’s predictable but she’ll never stick to an ideology just for the sake of it which is very un-German. Germans are known to stick to their traditions and ideologies.” For him, and for many, Merkel has deviated from her usual script twice. Once when she announced the “energiewende” - her decision to end nuclear power in Germany following the crisis at the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011. And, again in 2015, when she opened the country’s doors to hundreds of thousands of people. Both decisions have defined her politically though at a cost to her reputation and popularity. Both decisions were applauded in some quarters but derided in others. Both had long term consequences. Germany’s energy companies have sued the government over the “energiewende” - which means the last of their nuclear power stations will have to close by 2022. There will be compensation and tax refunds for some time to come. The owners of this German nuclear power station are seeking damages following the decision to close it The administrative, social and financial burden of integrating hundreds of thousands of migrants into German society is impossible to quantify. Perhaps those two decisions were all the more striking because Merkel is so carefully controlled – particularly when it comes to her public image. She is very funny – at off-the-record press briefings, she’ll answer questions with a twinkle in her eye, to a room filled with laughter. But it’s rarely seen on camera. According to Wolgang Bosbach, Merkel ""has a very good sense of humour..."" The first time they met, in his constituency, Wolfgang Bosbach asked Merkel if she wanted to go to the local fair. ""...but as soon as the cameras roll, you don’t see it.” “She didn’t want to but then my children who were very small asked, so she couldn’t say no and with one child on her left, one on the right, they went to the fair, went on the carousel and she relaxed and enjoyed herself. “When she relaxes she’s funny, she is witty,” says Bosbach. “Sometimes I feel she’s embarrassed when the public find that out about her. She has a very good sense of humour but, as soon as the cameras roll, you don’t see it.” Bosbach also knows what it’s like to get on the wrong side of the German chancellor, having openly rebelled against her over the Greek debt crisis. “The flaw she has is common in many who reach the very top. I saw it myself in Helmut Kohl. When someone like me has a different opinion and certain questions, be that the Greece crisis or the refugee problem, they question your loyalty. “She finds it hard to accept when someone tells her ‘I have a different opinion but I will go into any battle for you’.” Controversial subjects have come to characterise Merkel’s time in office – but they’ve also sustained it. She is good at crisis management. Her growing strength on the world stage brought Germany itself into a powerful new position. And these dramas drew focus away from those at home who grumble that she’s only ever reactive and rarely risks new policy. An unflattering verb entered the German lexicon in 2015 - “to Merkel”, which denotes indecisiveness. One of Sakurai’s most recent offerings presents Merkel as an amoeba, changing her political shape, swallowing up the ideas first presented by opposition parties. ""The Merkelamoeba has no fixed bodily form. She surrounds her prey, enclosing them in nourishment vacuoles and digests them."" “Her weakness is that I don’t know what her vision is. I don’t know if she has a vision for which way to lead the country. She’s reacting but she’s not acting.” Neverthless, Sakurai says, after 12 years in office, “no-one underestimates her any more”. The little blonde girl proudly lifted a cardboard box full of knitted toys. A tiny figure in the sprawling concourse of Munich railway station, she grinned, blue eyes shining. “They’re for the refugees!” she squealed, unable to contain her excitement. Around her a crowd of curious Germans smiled indulgently. Minutes later, those refugees arrived. Scores of exhausted men, women and children, clutching grimy plastic bags and battered holdalls, trudging along behind a police escort. For a moment the watching crowd was completely silent. Then someone began to applaud. Slowly the faces of the refugees brightened. The crowd, the cheers, the homemade welcome banners were all for them. Angela Merkel had just taken the biggest gamble of her political career. For months, the number of people seeking refuge in Europe from war, persecution and poverty had been steadily rising.  Families clinging desperately to overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean or trudging along the verges of Europe’s motorways. The EU now faced an unprecedented crisis and its leaders couldn’t agree how to deal with it. Merkel had already suspended the Dublin agreement - which requires asylum seekers to stay in their EU country of arrival - for Syrians. But the Hungarian government had had enough. The authorities closed the main railway station in Budapest, refusing to allow asylum seekers to board trains onwards to Western Europe. Perhaps Merkel was moved by the weary migrants chanting “Germany, Germany” outside Keleti station. Or maybe it was the discovery, days earlier, of the decomposing corpses of 71 asylum seekers in the back of a lorry on an Austrian motorway. Police had been called by a road worker who’d spotted liquid seeping from the vehicle, abandoned on the hard shoulder of a motorway. October 2015: Iraqi Kurdish men carry the body of one of 71 asylum seekers suffocated in an Austrian lorry The men, women and children inside had trusted a gang of traffickers to get them to Western Europe. Instead they’d suffocated, packed together, standing room only, in the back of a meat transporter. Merkel hastily agreed a plan with the Austrian government. Within hours, asylum seekers were joyfully boarding trains to Munich. The doors to Germany were open. Afterwards, Merkel would say she’d acted to prevent a humanitarian crisis. But, according to her former environment minister Norbert Röttgen, this was “not so much a moral or ethical question but – and this is typical for her – a decision based on facts. The refugees were there. Germany was able to deal with 10,000 refugees.” Even so, he says, “collectively, Germany underestimated the longer term implications and consequences” of that decision. As Röttgen puts it, “there was euphoria at first”. Towns threw street parties to welcome the new arrivals, warehouses filled up with donated food and clothing, tens of thousands of volunteers staffed reception centres. Germans revelled in their new international reputation. No longer defined by the echoes of World War Two or the caricature of the economic giant bullying the southern Eurozone. Instead, Germany was now the humanitarian face of Europe. “Wir schaffen das!” Merkel proclaimed. We can do it. It was to become her motto, oft repeated over the coming year. But her interior minister was worried, fearing a backlash. Without the goodwill of the volunteers, Thomas de Maiziere believed the country would struggle to cope with the sheer number of people now seeking asylum. Other EU countries were muttering furiously - Germany was encouraging the influx that affected them too. Merkel repeatedly appealed for a quota system to evenly distribute asylum seekers across the EU. She was ignored. As the months went by and towns and cities tried to house and integrate the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals, attacks on refugee accommodation were gleefully seized upon by her critics as evidence that her policy was failing. Merkel’s approval ratings began to fall. As populist movements gained ground across Europe, Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) campaigned hard and began to attract supporters. “Wir schaffen das,” Merkel insisted. But her electorate were increasingly unconvinced. For many, the real turning point came on the very last day of 2015. During New Year’s Eve celebrations in Cologne, hundreds of women were sexually assaulted by groups of men – mostly described as being of North African or Arab origin. It horrified Germany. And, for the first time since the crisis began, Merkel was in real political trouble. Described at the time as a tired and isolated figure, even those loyal to her were in despair. Demonstrators outside Cologne Cathedral protest at violence against women following the sexual assaults on New Year's Eve 2015 The Merkel brand became so tarnished that some within the party began to cast about for alternatives to lead them into the next general election. Their pessimism was vindicated as the party suffered two humiliating regional election defeats - one of them in Merkel’s own home state of Mecklenburg Vorpommen. But, remarkably, she has survived. Gradually her government has tightened the law - making it easier to deport asylum seekers who commit crime, as well as declaring countries like the former Balkan states safe so that their citizens have no right to asylum in Germany. The number of migrants reaching Germany has dwindled.  The deal Merkel brokered between Turkey and the EU helped. Under its terms, migrants arriving in Greece would be sent back to Turkey. For every Syrian sent back, another Syrian in Turkey would be resettled in the EU. For playing its part, Turkey was promised millions of euros and visa free travel for Turkish citizens. But in the end she also got lucky. Countries along the Balkan route slammed their doors shut. Merkel opposed this development but the closure of the Balkan route was a political lifeline. A migrant camp in Lesbos Greece - numbers have dropped since a 2016 EU/Turkey deal “At the last minute it stopped,” says Norbert Röttgen. “The numbers have decreased rapidly and significantly to a manageable level for the last 18 months. It was a critical period, but it turned out to not be a never-ending story.” As Merkel predicted, the migrant crisis has changed Germany. And it’s perhaps too early to judge whether it’s for the better or the worse. Integration will take time. There are success stories - the teams of migrants, exuberant in their cricket whites,  teaching a hitherto unheard of sport to Germans, or the Syrian guides showing visitors around a museum of Middle Eastern antiquity. But there are still migrants living in poverty, housed in school gyms and unable - or unwilling - to access German language classes. And there are unsettling stories too. The young woman volunteer killed by a Nigerian asylum seeker, or the crowd of Germans who clapped and cheered as a building designed to house refugees burned down in front of them. Nevertheless, Merkel has never regretted the decision she made in the late summer of 2015 - although she’s made it clear that the year which followed will never be repeated. If anything, Merkel said, she wished she’d acted sooner when Greece and Italy struggled single-handed to deal with the people arriving on their shores. “It was,” she said in August 2017, “right and it was important for us to take these people in during this extraordinary situation.” These days, her unwavering stance, and her continued insistence that Germany did the right thing, appears to help rather than hinder her popularity. Merkel seems to have got away with it. But perhaps more by luck than judgement. The two giant pandas chewed impassively on their bamboo, apparently oblivious to the global significance of the piece of diplomatic theatre being performed right in front of their new enclosure at Berlin Zoo. Meng Meng and Jiao Qing are on loan from China. Germany is paying $1m a year for the privilege of hosting the bears. Don’t be fooled by their names – which translate as “sweet dream” and “darling” - the animals symbolise strength and unity. Merkel and Xi Jinping open the panda enclosure at Berlin Zoo And the timing of this piece of panda diplomacy couldn’t have been more carefully stage-managed.  Angela Merkel and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping formally opened the enclosure together – just days before they faced Donald Trump across the G20 summit table in Hamburg. The German chancellor had already helped to secure China’s ongoing commitment to the Paris climate accord, after the Trump administration announced it would pull out. In the preceding weeks she’d also taken the rather unusual step of hosting the Indian prime minister and the leaders of the EU member countries for pre-summit talks. After the twin shocks of Brexit and Donald Trump’s election, Merkel has been seeking to create stability and perhaps new partnerships in this new world. It will change her own and her country’s role on the international stage. She warned that Europe could no longer rely on the traditional alliances with Britain and the US. “The times in which we could completely depend on others is, to an extent, over,” she told voters at a rally in Munich. “We Europeans have to take our fate into our own hands.” Speaking in Munich, May 2017: ""We... have to take our fate into our own hands"" Merkel‘s clout on the world stage sprang initially from her own country’s economic weight and subsequent leadership during the Eurozone crisis. Her stance earned her admirers and critics but, as Konstantin von Hammerstein and Rene Pfister wrote in Der Spiegel in December 2012, there was no doubting her power. “All eyes in Europe are directed at Merkel. No other politician on the Continent arouses as many hopes - or as much hatred - as the German chancellor. When she visits Greece, protesters wearing Nazi uniforms march through the streets of Athens, and yet a word from Merkel can also mean saving a euro country from bankruptcy.” A 2012 protest in Athens against EU austerity measures depicts Merkel as Hitler The crisis cemented Merkel’s position as de facto leader of the EU. But two relationships were crucial to a more powerful global position - one to the east and one to the west. The story of one of Merkel’s meetings with Vladimir Putin is well-known and often repeated. During talks, Putin allowed his black Labrador Connieto wander into the roomdespite knowing that the German chancellor had a profound fear of dogs.  The Russian leader later apologised but over the years the story has come to symbolise a fractious relationship. Putin allowed his labrador into the room where he was meeting Merkel, despite her fear of dogs The leaders share a grudging respect for one another. They also share a history. She grew up in East Germany where she learned to speak Russian. He wasa KGB officerstationed in Dresden, in the east, and speaks German. Merkel is credited with brokering regular talks over Russia’s activities in Ukraine, with France the fourth partner in the so-called Normandy format. Critics argue that the terms of theresulting Minsk agreementhave never actually been met. But by intervening to stop the US sending weapons to Ukraine, for example, it has been argued that Merkel has limited some of the bloodshed. The format of the talks also illustrated her perceived status as a link between Russia and the West and, in particular, the US. When Merkel discovered in 2013 thatAmerican spies had listened into her mobile phone, she was furious. “Spying on friends,” she said at the time, “that’s just not on.” But the revelation did little to sour her relationship with then-President Barack Obama and the two leaders fostered a warm, trusting and mutually beneficial relationship, speaking frequently over the phone. Barack Obama with Merkel in Berlin, May 2017 She supported and advised the president who, at the time, had little real domestic power. And President Obama, who enjoys rock star status in Germany, and is as popular among many Germans as his successor is reviled, reciprocated. In April 2016, well before Donald Trump’s election, a survey for die Zeit newspaper found that nearly two-thirds of Germans (62%) regretted the fact that Obama couldn’t serve another term. In May 2017, 70,000 people cheered and chanted his name as Obama stood in front of the Brandenburg gate and told the crowd: “We can’t hide behind a wall.” His friendship with Merkel, and his public support for her refugee policy, has done much to soothe her voters. The two leaders were unable to push through the doomed US/European trade deal TTIP but they did build a transatlantic alliance which bound Europe and America together. It’s a partnership unlikely to be replicated with the new administration. Merkel initially decided the way to Donald Trump’s heart was via trade,visiting the USwith the chief executives of Siemens and BMW. Merkel and Trump at the G20 meeting in Hamburg, July 2017 Then she tried the family route, appearing on stage alongside his daughter Ivanka at a women’s business event in Berlin. Behind the scenes, advisers spoke – without much conviction - of a new style of transatlantic diplomacy. But, one confided, it was like dealing with a five-year-old. With Ivanka Trump at a women's business event in Berlin Merkel’s strength now may depend on her opposition to Trump’s rhetoric. “She relies on her immense reputation as one of the world’s longest serving leaders,” says Wolfgang Bosbach. “Others have come and gone but Angela Merkel stays and she also relies on her strong nerves, her poker face. You can’t really tell from her expression which way she’s going to decide, she’s not extrovert, she’s not a big tweeter like Donald Trump but that doesn’t mean that she isn’t completely focused on her political goal.” That poker face slips occasionally, particularly when it comes to the UK, where Merkel - and most Germans - have a profound fondness. On 24 June 2015 Merkel’s spokesman tweeted footage of the world’s most powerful woman showing one of its most famous women around her office. Merkel gives the Queen a tour of her offices, 2015 Merkel, speaking in English, which she rarely does in public, points out the former course of the Berlin Wall and her former home in the old East to the Queen. Viewed now, the footage has a certain poignancy. A year later to the day a visibly shocked Merkel would speak – this time in German – of her great sorrow at Britain’s decision to leave the EU. She, like many Germans, was completely flummoxed by the result of the 2016 referendum. 24 June 2016: Merkel arrives at a press conference to give her reaction to the UK referendum In a country where people identify themselves as European first and German second, the EU represents an ideal of post-war unity. While not without imperfections and challenges, the institution isviewed as broadly beneficial politically and economically. Aware of the situation in the UK before the vote, Merkel showed willing, suggesting that she wouldn’t rule out treaty changes in the future, saying “where there’s a will there’s a way”, but in reality her position has never changed. With former British Prime Minister David Cameron - the two reportedly had a warm personal relationship There would be, she emphasised time and again, no access to the single market without the free movement of people. Confronted by Britain’s decision to leave the EU, Merkel’s initial reaction was to present a united front. Within days of the Brexit vote EU foreign ministers, and then the leaders of France and Italy, held meetings in Berlin. By 2017, when Brexit negotiations began, that united front was still in evidence. Germany under Merkel won’t break away from the official EU position. And she’s the one setting the tone. She never wanted to go down in the history books as the German chancellor under whom Britain left the EU It’s based on the desire to satisfy two principles. To keep Brexit as clean as possible - Britain is an important partner and a break which damages its economy will adversely affect Germany too. But the terms of the British departure cannot be so generous that they risk encouraging other countries to leave too. If anything, Brexit – or at least dealing with the fallout - has strengthened Angela Merkel domestically. But, as one commentator noted, she never wanted to go down in the history books as the German chancellor under whom Britain left the European Union. Koblenz is a city where two great European rivers meet. The very name of this ancient settlement originates from the confluence of the French Moselle and the German Rhine. And it was here, in January 2017, that hopes of a very different union briefly flared. To flashing lights and loud music, flanked by their country’s flags, the giants of Europe’s right-wing, Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders, marched through a crowd of cheering supporters and on to a stage where they were joined by Frauke Petry, then leader of Germany’s own populist movement, Alternative für Deutschland. (l-r) Geert Wilders, Frauke Petry and Marine Le Pen meet in Koblenz, January 2017 What began life as an anti-euro party on Germany’s political fringe, then evolved into a right-wing movement which gathered pace and support during the migrant crisis. Its xenophobic rhetoric and nationalist fervour repulsed many Germans. Nevertheless its anti-migrant and anti-Islam stance appealed to those perturbed by Angela Merkel’s refugee policy. There was a broader appeal too. AfD began to attract voters who felt forgotten, even ignored by Germany’s centrist politics and mainstream parties. Donald Trump had just been elected when the Koblenz meeting took place. The EU was still digesting the shock of Britain’s decision to leave. Le Pen and Wilders sensed triumph. A patriotic spring was underway, they declared. This unstoppable force would revolutionise Europe. Beyond the police cordon, protesters demonstrated against this so-called summit of the right (from which the mainstream German press had been banned). Protesters demonstrate outside the Koblenz event But away from the conference hall, the Moselle continued its quiet and endless flow into the Rhine. There is little appetite for revolution here. Post-war Germany is, by and large, a philosophical nation, which tends towards compromise and distrusts impetuous decision making. No wonder perhaps that its leader, who embodies those qualities, has lasted for so long. Merkel has been in the job for 12 years. Her political fortunes have risen, fallen and risen again. But her personal popularity rating - measured monthly for broadcaster ARD - has never dropped below 46%. That’s part skill and part fortune. Ever since the Brexit referendum and Trump’s election, Merkel, to many German voters, is a stable figure in an unstable world. She took her time deciding whether to stand for a fourth term, admitting that she was torn. Exhausted by the migrant crisis, unsure of the electorate’s support, she also, Ulrich Schöneich says, wanted to spend more time with her elderly mother. At the time, some suspected her of deliberate prevarication - and it wasn’t long before her party, and the country, started to feel mildly panicked. There is no obvious successor to Merkel. To coin the phrase often employed by Merkel herself to defend her nuclear and economic policies, Germany found itself “alternativlos” (without alternative). This may not be entirely accidental. As Schöneich notes: “She learned her lesson from Kohl who would not tolerate anyone being at his level. She managed to get rid of all the men with ambitions to her job.” At the age of 63, Merkel is unrivalled and at the height of her political confidence. She has always made an awkward hand gesture – thumb and fingertips pressing together to create a diamond shape. It has often been ridiculed but is now being perceived differently. Andreas Kluth, editor-in-chief of Handelsblatt, wrote recently that the chancellor’s body language, undramatic as it is, subtly exudes power and control. But Merkel’s future political path will not be easy and it’s perhaps no accident that she so often appeals publicly for international or European solidarity and co-operation. The global challenges make for a daunting agenda - an erratic US administration, migration and trafficking, Syria, Ukraine. And then there’s the fractious relationship with an increasingly belligerent Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Germany is home to around three million people of Turkish descent. Erdogan was furious after several of his ministers were prevented from campaigning on German soil ahead of Turkey’s constitutional referendum in 2017. Diplomatic relations – never easy – reached a new low when a number of German nationals, including several journalists, were detained in Turkey. Merkel has never supported Turkish accession to the EU. Nevertheless she has, thus far, refused calls from some political quarters to call off accession negotiations. Her argument is that the talks are barely happening as it is and that there is no consensus within the EU on the issue. She may also be thinking of that migrant deal. It’s a delicate balance. Wolfgang Bosbach, German politician Merkel is also preoccupied by, and expected by many to shape, the future of a post-Brexit EU. She has indicated support for French President Emmanuel Macron’s ambition for deeper integration within the Eurozone, although hopes for a renewed Franco-German axis at the heart of Europe are fading somewhat as Macron’s domestic popularity leaches away. Merkel has indicated support for her new French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron But the international stateswoman must please her home crowd too. She knows she barely survived the migrant crisis - voters want a clear integration and asylum policy. The scandal over bypassing tests on diesel cars casts a shadow still. Air pollution regularly exceeds legal levels in many German cities and at least one, Stuttgart, may impose a ban on all diesel vehicles. Merkel must protect the health of her citizens but she must also safeguard Germany’s automobile industry. And, as Wolfgang Bosbach puts it, Merkel has a tough challenge ahead - “future-proofing” the economy in a globalised marketplace. Many wonder how much longer she will continue. Will she see out a fourth term? Bosbach believes so. After all, he says, the chancellor is motivated solely by a sense of duty. “She understands her role as being a servant of the state. She grew up in East Germany, far removed from democracy, which is why she perceives her life in reunited Germany as a gift and she wants to show gratitude to this country and give back in return for the freedom and rights she received after the Wall came down.” It’s not clear whether the far-right leaders who gathered in Koblenz at the beginning of 2017 realised that they were meeting not far from the city’s most famous landmark. A huge statue of Kaiser Wilhelm I on his horse was built there in the 19th Century to commemorate the celebrated emperor who unified Germany. Those who promised a patriotic spring here never fully realised their ambitions. Marine le Pen and Geert Wilders were defeated at the ballot box, although the AfD has gained a significant number of seats in the federal German parliament. Kaiser Wilhelm still stands, implacable. Beneath him the rivers flow, slow and constant. And, quietly, in her office in Berlin, Angela Merkel gets on with her job. Built with Shorthand"
Sir Peter Hall: A giant of British theatre,"Sir Peter Hall was one of the great champions of British theatre. In a career spanning seven decades, he acted, directed theatre and opera, and, occasionally, made forays into film and TV. He founded the Royal Shakespeare Company and was director of the National Theatre for 15 years. And he fought tenaciously to persuade governments of all colours to maintain public funding for the arts. Theatre director Sir Peter Hall dies at 86 Peter Reginald Frederick Hall was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 22 November 1930. His father was a railway clerk, later a stationmaster. The family was not well-off. ""People always giggle when I say that I grew up on a single-line railway station with no running water and no electricity,"" hetold the Guardian in 2005,external. ""But, in the 1930s, that's the way it was."" Hall directing actress Yvonne Mitchell at the London Arts Theatre Sir Peter remembered his father as a man of little ambition, adding that it was his mother, Grace, who was the driving force in the family. The daughter of a butcher, she had a sound belief in the principles of a good education and ""getting on"", and Hall inherited her drive. The family moved to Cambridge, where Hall had his first taste of a public production - Mozart's Requiem in King's College. He was immediately smitten and began staying regularly with a relative in London so he could attend the theatre and opera. ""I saw Gielgud's Hamlet when I was 12,"" he later recalled, ""standing at the back for sixpence."" Although German bombs were falling on London, people crowded into theatres as an escape from the war, and he witnessed some of the greatest actors of the age. Watching Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier and Peggy Ashcroft quickly convinced Hall that he wanted to become a theatre director. He married French actress Leslie Caron in 1956 ""There wasn't any question in my head of doing anything else,"" he said. Following a spell of National Service in the RAF, he won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, to study English. In his third year, he booked a theatre and made his directorial debut with a performance of Jean Anouilh's Point of Departure. ""I remember an almost physical sense of release and pleasure rehearsing a play,"" he later recalled. ""I thought, this is what I want to do."" His final play at Cambridge, Luigi Pirandello's Henry IV, brought him good reviews and an invitation to make his professional directorial debut at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, in 1953. He also secured a job at London's Arts Theatre as a script reviewer. When the artistic director John Fernald left, Hall found himself running his own West End theatre at the age of 24. A Midsummer Night's Dream, with Judi Dench, was one of his last productions for the RSC Within weeks of beginning his tenure, the script of Waiting for Godot arrived. Hall was initially unimpressed. ""I haven't the foggiest idea what some of it is about,"" he told the cast. ""But if we stop to discuss every line, we will never open."" In the event, Hall's production of what was the play's British debut had the effect of making him one of the most talked-about directors in the country. He appeared on the BBC, was interviewed for Vogue magazine and was invited to direct the stage version of the musical Gigi. That show starred the French actress Leslie Caron. She and Hall married in 1956. But the biggest boost that Godot gave to Hall's career was the invitation to run the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the time, the theatre merely ran a regional Shakespeare festival - not nearly enough for the ambitious Hall. Hall succeeded Sir Laurence Olivier (left) at the National Theatre The concept of a Royal Shakespeare Company was born in Hall's imagination, in which he envisaged a London theatre and a move into a wider range of drama. He alternately bullied and cajoled the theatre management and eventually got his way. The newly-born RSC opened its first London season at the Aldwych Theatre in 1961. Its ensemble cast - a relatively new concept at the time - included exciting young actors such as Peter O'Toole and Vanessa Redgrave. He also recruited Trevor Nunn and later Peter Brook. The appointment of the latter led to the controversial Theatre of Cruelty season in 1964. It was an exciting time both for the theatre and the wider arts world, and Hall revelled in the new socially liberal scene of the 1960s. But the pressures were taking their toll after a series of mental and physical breakdowns. His marriage to Leslie Caron had ended in 1965 after her affair with the actor Warren Beatty, and Hall later married his assistant, Jacky Taylor. Hall brought a young and enthusiastic team to the National In 1968, he quit the RSC and briefly disappeared from the limelight. For a time, he turned his attention to directing opera, both at Glyndebourne and the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. In 1972, it emerged that he had been offered the job of running the National Theatre, which was due to move into its new modernist home on London's South Bank. His appointment attracted a great deal of flak, not least from those who had been passed over for the job. Jonathan Miller referred to him as ""a safari-suited bureaucrat"" who would suck all of Britain's talent and cash into the new theatre. Hall, never the most gregarious of men, was prone to rub people up the wrong way. He was accused of theatrical class distinction, grovelling to the stars and treating lesser mortals with disdain. With cast members from a 1988 production of Twelfth Night However, others praised him for going into battle - not least to secure the funds the theatre needed to achieve a sound financial footing. Not only did he have to contend with funding, there was also the problem of the building itself, which was behind schedule and over budget. Hall finally got things under way in 1976 with a production of Beckett's Happy Days, before the unions walked out and closed the building down. A year later he received a knighthood for services to British theatre. But, after the early trials and tribulations, things improved. Sir Peter managed to successfully establish the theatre and sent the company out on a series of well-received foreign tours. He quit the National in 1986. ""I was ready to leave,"" he said. ""Fifteen years is probably five years too long."" With Elaine Paige in a production of The Misanthrope at the Piccadilly Theatre He continued to direct, highlights being his 1988 production of Orpheus Descending and a musical version of Ionesco's Rhinoceros, for which Hall wrote the lyrics and co-wrote the libretto. Sir Peter was still working on the eve of his ninth decade, with a production of Pygmalion at the Hong Kong Arts Festival. While his first love was the stage, he occasionally ventured into film and television. Most of these forays involved classical plays and opera, although he did direct Channel 4's 1992 adaptation of Mary Wesley's novel The Camomile Lawn. He was appointed director emeritus of the Rose Theatre, Kingston upon Thames, enticing Dame Judi Dench to appear in his sell-out production of A Midsummer's Night Dream in 2010. After divorcing Jacky Taylor in 1981, he married the opera singer Maria Ewing in 1982. The marriage ended in 1990 and he married his fourth wife, Nicky Frei, the same year. Sir Peter Hall's great gift was that he excelled as an administrator as well as a theatre director. He was a skilled administrator and director ""I love politics,"" he once said. ""I do love committees, I do love getting things done."" His detractors saw him as a schemer and a manipulator, but there was little doubt about his talent as a director. He always preferred to act as an interpreter of playwright's work, rather than imposing his own concept. The playwright Harold Pinter, many of whose works Sir Peter directed, was clear about his abilities. ""I've seen productions of my work in various places that have really distorted the whole thing,"" he said. ""Peter never allows this. He doesn't impose, he discovers.""

Rory Cellan-Jones: Appleâs augmented ambitions,"This video can not be played WATCH: What can AR do on iPhone? Face recognition, an OLED screen and a Â£999 price tag will grab all the headlines. But software developers around the world were waiting on one thing from the Apple event - more news on augmented reality. And slap bang in the middle of the iPhone 8 unveiling, a long section about AR, and a demo from a games developer - a clear signal that the company sees the technology as a key attraction in its new phones. Back in May, Apple released ARKit, its augmented reality development tool, hoping that developers would rush to try it out and give the company a lead in the fast growing technology, which imposes virtual objects on the real world. And it has done just that. Developers have been quick to experiment, showing off all kinds of apps, from a simple AR measuring tape to work out whether that chunky sofa will fit through the door, to a restaurant app that puts a virtual burger on your real plate. This video can not be played WATCH: Apple's event in two minutes This week I found myself chasing pigeons around a cool shared office space in Shoreditch with Jamie Shoard. His tiny four-person company has used ARKit to develop Pigeon Panic, which he describes as ""an utterly ridiculous game, built to live out your very achievable fantasies of running haphazardly into large flocks of virtual pigeons"". Augmented reality has been around for a long time, but it was only with the arrival of Pokemon Go last year that it entered the lives of millions of smartphone users. Apple reveals 'leap forward' iPhone X Hands on with new iPhone X Who are the band on the iPhone X advert? iPhone X: 10 key moments leading to the new handset Apple suffers 'major iPhone X leak' Jamie Shoard says that until now developing AR apps was a complex business that could only be contemplated by major developers, and ARKit has changed that: ""The technology would have taken years to create and a team of hundreds - now it can be done in matter of months by small teams like ours."" He now expects a new flowering of creativity in an app landscape that has been getting quite stale. Apple showed off AR games played via its new smartphones But if Apple is to spark this AR revolution, it has a number of hurdles to clear. First, there is plenty of competition. For some years Google has been pushing its Tango augmented reality platform, but with just a couple of smartphones boasting the tech to make it work, the company saw the writing on the wall when ARKit came out. It has ditched the brand and unveiled ARCore, which will work on millions of Android phones, with a big pitch to the developer community to get involved. Google's own designers have also demonstrated their first experiments, showing off a Streetview animation which allows you tozoom into the British Museum,externalfrom the front of the building, and a training app demonstratinghow to use an espresso machine,external. The other big player is Microsoft with its Hololens headset, which the firm is using to bring what it calls mixed reality into the workplace and the classroom. While it may provide a more convincing experience than AR seen through a mobile phone, the headset is expensive and is not at this stage aimed at the consumer market. This video can not be played Microsoft's Kudo Tsunoda spoke to Rory Cellan-Jones about HoloLens If anyone can be considered a veteran of the augmented reality world, it is Steve Dann, whose Amplified Robot studio is based in Soho. His first AR project was for the Times newspaper 10 years ago and involved the use of a laptop's camera - smartphones were not in common use back then. He admits that the revolution has taken longer to take off than he imagined - ""the technology has not advanced quite as quickly as we hoped it would"". But he does believe that Apple's initiative is a key moment for augmented reality. ""ARKit makes a big difference because it's an Apple statement of intent,"" he explained. ""Any time you get Apple entering into something, it is fully committed, and that will drag other companies in."" But however intense the competition to create compelling new uses for AR, there is another nagging question - do we really want to see our world through the lens of our smartphone camera? The buzz has faded around pioneering augmented reality game Pokemon Go The buzz around Pokemon Go has died down, and new augmented reality apps have not taken off in the same way. Paul Lee, head of technology research at Deloitte, says get ready for a big upsurge in interest: ""I expect there will be hundreds or millions of smartphone users who use augmented reality enhanced digital apps at least five times in 2018."" He says we are already using AR without realising it when for instance we use filters in photo apps to improve the real world. AR will become a feature of many existing apps. ""Augmenting reality is a very human activity - hence the appeal. It's a form of digital make up."" But Mr Dann thinks another technology advance may be needed before most people are ready to augment their world. ""I think ARKit is a step on the road to the future. I think augmented reality will really take off when you can see it through head mounted displays or a pair of glasses,"" he says. Of course, that has already been tried - but Google Glass proved unpalatable to its users. Maybe somewhere inside the Apple Park spaceship, engineers are working on an iHeadset, but for now the company is counting on the iPhone as its weapon to barge its way into another new market.

Brexit: What next for the government's EU repeal bill?,"This video can not be played The moment the government's attempt to take the UK out of EU law passed its first parliamentary test After two long days of debate,a majority of MPs have voted in support of the general principles of the government's repeal billwhich will extract the UK from EU law in time for Brexit. The bill - formally known asthe European Union (Withdrawal) Bill,external- passed the ""second reading"" stage by 326 votes to 290. This means a majority of MPs support the bill's broad principles, but not necessarily every little detail. The government says it is essential to carry out Brexit. Opposition MPs have called it a power grab. There is a long road ahead before the repeal bill becomes law. A lot of MPs, including many who backed the bill at second reading, want to amend it at the next stage of parliamentary scrutiny. Kuenssberg: Victory, but ministers can't relax EU Withdrawal Bill: How your MP voted A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Repeal bill 'not a blank cheque' A long list of amendments has been published on the House of Commons website,external. Not all will get through. But some - especially those backed by Conservatives - could mean big changes. Here are some of the key points of contention. Brexit Secretary David Davis says the legislation will not grant ministers too much power The bill repeals the 1972 law which took the UK into the EU, and copies EU legislation into domestic law to ensure a smooth transition the day after Brexit. However, a simple copy-and-paste approach would not be enough: swathes of UK law ""will no longer work"" on exit, the government says. For example, many bits of law refer to EU institutions. Therefore the government wants to avoid a ""black hole in our statute book"" by making ""corrections"" to EU laws: copy, paste, edit. The bill grants ministers powers to tweak existing laws without the usual safeguards. Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's Brexit spokesman, says the bill is, in effect, a ""blank cheque"" which gives ministers too much power. The government points to safeguards written into the bill. The correcting powers ""can be used only to correct problems with the statute book arising directly from our withdrawal from the European Union,"" said Brexit Secretary David Davis. ""Ministers cannot use it simply to replace European Union laws that they do not like,"" he said, pointing to various restrictions. For example powers cannot be used to create serious criminal offences, impose new taxes, or amend the 1998 Human Rights Act. Hilary Benn, a Labour MP, thinks this does not go far enough. ""How can we accept a bill if on the one hand ministers get up and say, 'Look at the safeguards; they are in the legislation,' and on the other, they propose in another part of the bill to give themselves the power to remove every one of those safeguards, if they are so inclined?"" Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer believes parliamentary scrutiny could be bypassed by the bill Critics also say the bill could mean massive changes being made to UK law without appropriate levels of scrutiny. After the copy and paste, the tweaks will be made by ministers using ""statutory instruments"". These are a kind of law usually passed without a debate or vote on the floor of the House of Commons. Statutory instruments can be voted down, though this rarely happens. The government says the repeal bill will involve 800-1,000 statutory instruments, though the opposition says this number could be higher. These devices are primarily used for technical and non-contentious pieces of legislation. ""[The repeal bill] aims to maintain the laws that we currently have... it is primarily technical in that respect,"" said David Davis. Lots of changes could indeed be uncontroversial - like changing the name of an EU regulatory body to a UK one - but not everything. ""The secretary of state is keen to portray the bill as a technical exercise converting EU law into our own law without raising any serious constitutional issues about the role of Parliament,"" said Sir Keir Starmer. ""Nothing could be further from the truth."" Statutory instruments could be used to change primary legislation passed by MPs as well as making tweaks to EU laws carried over - granting so-called ""Henry VIII powers"" to ministers. Therefore some MPs have called for a beefed up ""sifting"" process for all the new statutory instruments. A long amendment has been put forward which would ""set up a triage and scrutiny system under the control of Parliament, for determining how Statutory Instruments under Clause 7 of the bill will be dealt with."" Crucially this tweak is backed by several Conservative MPs, meaning it has a good chance of becoming law. While we are set to leave the EU in March 2019, the exact nature of the future arrangement is unknown. Ministers accept there will be some kind of transitional arrangement after Britain leaves the EU and before the details of a future relationship are decided. Labour wants the UK to stay in the EU's single market and customs union during a transitional period. This is hard to reconcile with the repeal bill, which kicks in on the Brexit day. Several Labour MPs gave this as a reason to oppose the bill at second reading. Conservative Europhile Ken Clarke was the only member of his party to vote against the bill giving the government permission to trigger Article 50 earlier this year. He abstained this time around, arguing ""we should stay in the single market and the customs union until we know that we can smoothly transfer to some new and equally beneficial arrangement"". The government's response to this is simple - leaving the single market and customs union in 2019 is government policy - so the wording of the bill is a feature, not a bug. Ministers Philip Hammond and Liam Fox, from opposite wings of the Conservative Party,confirmed this policy last month. The government wants to get on with its top Brexit priorities: ending the free movement of people, ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, and signing new trade deals. Ministers don't think these goals are compatible with staying in the single market and customs union beyond 2019. Since the referendum last year, ministers have insisted Brexit will not mean watering down workers' rights, many of which are underpinned by EU rules. But in the repeal bill debate several MPs argued that the repeal bill will weaken the legal force behind these rights. At the moment British citizens can go to European courts, putting these rights on a higher plane than other bits of law. ""[The rights] do not survive with their enhanced status; they survive only in delegated form,"" said Keir Starmer. ""From the date of this bill, they are amendable by delegated legislation."" The repeal bill does transfer rulings from European courts into UK law, but subsequent legal challenges will have to be based on precise legal cases, not on broader principles. ""There is no right of action in domestic law on or after exit day based on a failure to comply with any of the general principles of EU law,"" the bill says. Several Conservative MPs, including former attorney general Dominic Grieve, want to delete this line. Grieve argues the wording as things stand would mean a ""marked diminution in the rights of the individual and of corporate entities"". The government says the rights currently enjoyed by Brits have a range of origins - UK law, EU law, international law - all of which will be continued under the repeal bill. Ministers believe removing the right to rely on ""general principles"" of EU law is an inevitable consequence of leaving the EU. Another amendment with Tory backing would allow the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights to continue to apply in the UK. Critics say quitting the charter would weaken human rights protections in the UK. But all the rights included in the charter will be copied and pasted on to the UK's statute book. David Davis says: ""Why on earth we need an extra layer of declaratory law, I do not know."" Over the past two decades, power has been transferred from Westminster to the devolved administrations in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. While some areas - like currency and defence - are the sole preserve of the UK government, others are devolved. For example, in Scotland, agriculture is devolved. But lots of agricultural laws are set by the EU. Under the text of the repeal bill, after Brexit these powers will flow back to Westminster rather than the devolved legislatures. David Davis says this is a ""transitional arrangement"", and has pledged to involve the devolved administrations closely in shaping the future arrangements, though they will not have a veto. Four nations making four different sets of rules would create barriers to doing business within the UK, says Mr Davis. ""The bill therefore provides certainty and continuity for people across the UK by recreating in UK law the common frameworks currently provided by EU law, and providing that the devolved institutions cannot generally modify them."" This restriction has been described by opposition politicians as a ""power grab"". Wayne David, a Welsh Labour MP, said ""power is going from Brussels to London, bypassing and therefore undermining devolution"". The SNP's Patrick Grady called the repeal bill a ""fundamental breach of the principles"" of the 1998 law setting up the Scottish parliament. The government says the process will eventually result in a ""significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration"". At the moment the EU can fine the UK government for breaching its rules - a legal battle over air pollution has been going on for several years. When Britain leaves the EU and the remit of the European Court of Justice, this threat will disappear. ""An alternative system does need to be introduced,"" said Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who backed Leave in last year's referendum. ""If the present or a future government fail, for example, to stay within air pollution limits, it must be possible for sanctions to be applied and for that government to be held to account... that is a core ingredient in any healthy democracy."" His colleague Richard Benyon agrees. ""To ensure that the environment is protected, a proper body with the ability to audit the government, working with non-governmental organisations, needs to be put in place."" Mr Benyon voted for the bill at second reading, like virtually all Conservative MPs, but wants to ""improve"" it at the committee stage by making amendments to address this concern. ""Labour voted for the article 50 legislation, because we accept the referendum result. As a result, the UK is leaving the EU. That we are leaving is settled. How we leave is not,"" said Sir Keir Starmer on the first day of debate. ""This bill invites us to surrender all power and influence over that question to the government and to ministers. That would betray everything that we are sent here to do."" New Conservative MP Vicky Ford directed a simple question at the shadow Brexit secretary: ""What is he proposing?"" The government says it is impossible to carry out Brexit without some kind of repeal bill extracting the UK from EU law. Ministers appear to be in ""listening mode"", and accept there are some valid criticisms over the bill's details. Some of the amendments - especially those proposed by Conservative MPs - have a good chance of being passed. But they say voting down the bill in its entirety would make it very hard for the government to carry out Brexit ahead of March 2019. Other laws - on customs, immigration, and other areas - cannot be passed until this fundamental issue is sorted out. With this hugely contentious bill, a government without a majority, and fractious coalitions forming and dissolving across party lines, Westminster could be seeing lots of late nights this autumn.

Slavery victim 'made to dig own grave',"This video can not be played The sister of one of the victims says he was forced to dig his own grave Members of a traveller family have been jailed for enslaving 18 men who were made to work for little or no wages while their captors lived a life of lavish luxury. The workers were illegally trafficked and exploited by the Rooney family - 10 men and one woman - whose actions left a gruelling mark on their victims. One man's terrifying ordeal spanned more than a quarter of a century. On one occasion, he was made to dig his own grave if he did not agree to a lifetime of servitude. ""You're going to work for me for the rest of your life... if you don't sign this contract that is where you're going,"" John Rooney told his victim, pointing at the hole he had been forced to dig. The harrowing details have been told to the BBC by the victim's sister. Police said the living quarters of 18 men who were trafficked into a modern slavery ring were ""truly shocking"" She described how her brother was beaten with a rake and had his front teeth smashed with a concrete slab in savage attacks which left him ""psychologically damaged"". ""I think one of the worst stories he told me was about digging his own grave,"" his sister, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the BBC. ""John Rooney had asked him to dig a hole and he said, 'I kept digging and digging and digging. I said to John: Crikey how much more have I got to dig? And he said keep digging'. ""According to my brother, John produced a contract and said to him 'you're going to work for me for the rest of your life... if you don't sign this contract that is where you're going'. ""On another occasion, he was late getting up and John came into his van with a rake and hit him over the head. You can see evidence of scarring on the left side of his head. ""It's harrowing."" Animal faeces were found inside the workers' squalid accommodation The victims were aged between 18 and 63, held in squalor and forced to work up to 12-hour days, seven days a week, for the family's tarmacking company. While the Rooneys led an extravagant lifestyle, their slaves lived in filth - some in stables next to dog kennels, many in unkempt caravans without running water or toilet facilities. ""Many were very, very thin and they were absolutely filthy,"" said Ch Supt Nikki Mayo, of Lincolnshire Police. ""These individuals didn't have a toilet so many had to go into the woods and, in fact, some were kept in a stable block nearby with animals. So, absolutely disgraceful."" The 11 members of the Rooney led extravagant lifestyles while their victims suffered Many were alcoholics and estranged from their relatives, while several had learning disabilities and mental health issues. Half were British nationals targeted from all over the country because they were homeless. Ch Supt Mayo said the victims were left ""completely institutionalised and isolated from society"". ""They were given scraps of food that were mainly leftovers from family meals, complete with bite marks, but only after working long hard hours tarmacking driveways and fitting block paving,"" she said. ""When they weren't working for the company the men had to collect scrap, sweep, tidy up or look after pets around the sites. ""Often their only payment was a packet of tobacco and a limited amount of alcohol, which didn't help those with addictions and was another way in which the defendants exerted control over them."" The men worked long hard hours for little more than a packet of tobacco Even though the victims were ""not physically trapped"", they were ""financially, emotionally and physically abused making any escape seem impossible"", the detective added. The threat of violence also made them too scared to leave. One victim told police he was afraid of the Rooney gang because he had seen the brutality they had inflicted on others. ""There was one moment one of the [Rooneys] took a shovel... and then I [saw] three people kicking [the slave] as he was lying on the ground,"" he said. ""I've been quite scared because I've seen what they're capable of."" The family operated from a number of sites in Lincolnshire and were caught as part of Operation Pottery, which detectives described as ""one of the largest and most complex"" cases in the force's history. Reverend Jeremy Cullimore, who worked in a homeless shelter in Lincoln, said he had tried to protect potential victims. ""We were aware that the Rooneys [had] a series of vans driving around the streets, seeking out people, to persuade them that they could offer them a nice caravan and so on. ""We introduced a number of systems so that people who were vulnerable would not be alone."" The defendants led a lavish lifestyle and operated from a number of sites He recalled the moment he came head-to-head with the gang. ""The family [came] to recover a man who escaped from them and they were saying quite clearly 'he's ours, he owes us money and we want him'. ""I turned around and said 'You know I'm a priest and I can absolve you from your sins, but beware I can bind them to you forever. Now think on this' and they left. ""It was a challenge."" When police officers dismantled the ring in 2014, the force set up a refuge for the victims aided by the NHS, social services, British Red Cross and the UK Human Trafficking Centre. One charity worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, said one individual used ""an entire bottle of shampoo to make themselves feel clean"". ""When I first saw them they looked completely bedraggled. One of them asked how long he could shower for. We said 'as long as you like' and he was completely taken aback by the response. ""After 20 minutes he came out looking like a different person. The colour in his skin came back. He just felt like a normal human being."" But how did the Rooney slavery ring operate undetected for so long? Kevin Hyland, the UK's Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, said there was a lack of awareness about slavery legislation and recognising the signs. ""People in the communities haven't recognised this for what it is or haven't really understood what it is,"" he said. ""But this case really does demonstrate how serious this crime is and it can be happening on your own front drive. ""There has been a lack of understanding and awareness but, then also, what do you do when you recognise it? The authorities themselves need to understand this and realise this is a crime and they have a duty to respond."" Under the Modern Slavery Act, introduced in 2015, it is illegal to hold someone in slavery or servitude and force them to carry out compulsory labour. For the woman whose brother was captive for 26 years, the mark left by his experience is indelible. On seeing him for the first time after his release, she said she wanted to ""fall on my knees and sob"". ""He was very thin. His teeth are terrible, they're all rotten and he's not got many left. ""He's damaged... but he's now enjoying his freedom.""

'Nobody saw it coming' - Northern Rock 10 years on,"Northern Rock was a key sponsor for Newcastle United In the summer of 2007, Newcastle had much to look forward to. The Toon - Newcastle United - had a new owner, the billionaire retail tycoon Mike Ashley, and much was expected under the management of Sam Allardyce. The performance of the team's shirt sponsor, Northern Rock, was a source of pride; after decades of hard times following the end of shipbuilding and mining, the North East had a new economic champion, one that was giving the financial services giants of the South a real run for their money. The former building society had demutualised and scaled the heights of the FTSE 100, the elite club of Britain's biggest quoted companies, and in the process had become the fourth biggest bank in the UK by share of lending. Bank bailout 'should have been secret' How the crisis improved savings safety 'That was chilling': The financial crash remembered The chairman, Matt Ridley, summed it up in the annual report, lauding ""another excellent year"" and said ""our strategy of using growth, cost efficiency and credit quality to reward both shareholders and customers continues to run well."" A few months later, Northern Rock's empire was in ruins. The fuel it had used to grow so quickly turned out to be toxic. Northern Rock had borrowed heavily on the international money markets Rather than using customer deposits as the source of funds to lend out to homeowners, it borrowed in the international money markets. When the sub-prime crisis hit America, those markets took fright, and stopped lending to anything that looked like it might be over-exposed to the housing market. Northern Rock was an obvious first casualty. The BBC broke the news that it needed Bank of England support 10 years ago tomorrow, and the day after there were queues outside branches, the first run on a British bank in 150 years. After limping on for a few more months, Northern Rock was nationalised in February 2008. Councillor Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle City Council, remembers walking out of the civic offices to nearby Northumberland Street where Northern Rock had its main city centre branch. ""There was a queue outside going right down the street. That really was the first sign that something was wrong. No-one really saw it coming."" Customers queued for hours to take out their savings Northern Rock's demise - it was split into ""bad"" and ""good"" sets of assets and operations, with Virgin Money buying the latter - was a shock to the region's economy, as was the banking crisis that followed. ""We were early into recession and late out,"" said Mr Forbes.  ""It's only now really that we have recaptured that lost ground."" About 2,500 jobs were lost. There was another heavy blow, little understood outside the North East - the loss of the Northern Rock Foundation, a charitable trust which received 5% of the bank's profits each year. Many who lost their savings want the government to change its mind on compensation It had given Â£235m to good causes before the bank was nationalised and broken up. Mr Forbes is now pressing the Treasury to give back some of the profits it expects to make from its intervention on Northern Rock to make up for the loss of the foundation. Northern Rock shareholders are also making a claim on the potential profits, which independent experts think could eventually reach about Â£8bn. An association of small shareholders, many of whom lost their life savings when the bank was nationalised, has asked the chancellor to think again on compensation, which has been denied before. Any surplus from Northern Rock's privatisation should go to taxpayers, says the Treasury Jon Wood, a fund manager who was a big Northern Rock shareholder and has been severely critical of the Bank of England's action, is also thought be to considering fresh legal action. The Treasury has said that any surplus from the Northern Rock nationalisation should compensate taxpayers for the amounts risked in the rescue. A decade on, important strands of ""the run on the Rock"" story are only now being uncovered. In an interview with the BBC Gary Hoffman, who was parachuted in as chief executive after privatisation, said he found an organisation with an unquestioning - and unhappy - culture. ""The management had completely lost touch with the coal face,  and did not know what was happening. There was an attitude that you did not question what was going on, which was a tragedy because there were extremely good people at the bank."" Hoffman reveals that the Treasury had considered all options for the future of the bank when he was in charge - not just a sale to a banking rival, but also a refloating of the bank as an independent business, and its complete run-down and closure. The collapse was the first sign in Britain of the coming global financial crisis Other senior banking sources have told the BBC that the last option - closure - was the favourite right up until Christmas Eve 2008, when the bank's leadership was able to convince the Treasury it could be sold as a going concern. Mr Hoffman says that the UK's banking sector is now safer than in the run-up to the crisis, with greater capital reserves at the big institutions. Others disagree, however, saying the increases have been largely illusory. Kevin Dowd, professor of finance and economics at the University of Durham, says changes in bank regulations have not greatly improved banks' resilience. ""The Bank of England looks at the book value of bank assets - the value that they themselves put on their assets. But if you look at the stock market, investors don't believe it because most of our big banks have stock market values less than their book values.""

Laura Kuenssberg: Ministers can't relax,"In the early hours the government won its vote on the behemoth-like task of transferring laws incorporated from the EU on to a new statute book. In the end Labour doubts and a strict hand from the Tory whips won the day and the numbers were more comfortable than the squeaky feeling at the start of the political week suggested. But ministers can't relax, not for a moment. Tories with unease about the withdrawal bill have already drawn up proposed amendments, changes to the bill and here's the rub - they say they already have at least a dozen colleagues signed up, including four influential chairs of Westminster committees. Why does that matter? Remember, the government's majority (with the DUP) is so slim only six grumpy Tories can sink a bill. So a dirty dozen, as ministers might see them, can force them to change their position or lose.

Who are the band on the iPhone X advert?,"Art-pop band Sofi Tukker feature on the advert for the new iPhone X - but who are they? Formed in 2014, the New York duo are Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern (hence the name). Their song, Best Friends,external, recalls the anything-goes psychedelia of Deee-Lite, with an infectious bassline punctuated by horn stabs and cowbells. ""You are my best friend and we've got some things to do,"" sing-speaks Hawley-Weld in the track's whimsical chorus. The singer and guitar player (who, in the lyrics, claims to be ""addictive like some Pokemon"") met Halpern at an art gallery while studying at Browns University in Rhode Island. ""I was playing acoustic bossa nova music in a trio and Tucker was the DJ that night,""Hawley-Weld explained to the Huffington Post last year,external. ""He came early and saw what we were doing and ended up remixing one of my songs on the spot... We have been working together ever since!"" Hawley-Weld was born in Germany and grew up in international school communities in Brazil, Italy and Canada. Her upbringing introduced her to a wide variety of music - as did her degree in West African dance and drumming at university - all of which filter into the band's eclectic sound. Halpern, meanwhile, is a Boston native who was set to play professional basketball (he's 6ft 8in) until health issues forced him out of the sport. Laid up in bed for eight months, he taught himself to be a DJ - leading to that fateful meeting with his bandmate. The band's debut singleDrinkee,external, a colourful, danceable slice of pop, was released in 2016 and earned the band a Grammy nomination for best dance recording. ""It was the first song we wrote,""Halpern told Billboard,external. ""It's why we started the band, really, because we believed in the vibe."" Based on the poem Relogio by the Brazilian-Portuguese writer Chacal, the song is partly sung in Portuguese. ""We wanted it to act like a chant in which the point is just the act of repetition,"" theyexplained to NPR,external- who presciently commented that the record sounded like the soundtrack to ""a fashion week party or an Apple ad"". Now that they've landed one of those coveted adverts, the band join a club that includes Feist, U2 and Florence + The Machine. They might be more self-consciously quirky than those acts, but there's a strand of playfulness to their music that suggests they could cross over to the mainstream. Hawley-Weld summed it up perfectly last year when she was asked how she'd explain her music to visiting aliens. ""Hi Aliens,""she told Mat Mag,external. ""We're Sofi Tukker. This is called dancing, it is what people do when they want to be happy and feel free. Let's be friends!""

The surprising new strategy of pro-Russia bots,"Co-ordinated groups of Twitter bots pushing pro-Russian propaganda have developed an odd but occasionally effective strategy - retweeting messages that the bot-makers disagree with and flooding their enemies with followers. Brian Krebs is an investigative journalist with a big social media following. But even he was surprised when one of his tweets was retweeted thousands of times: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. ""I woke up the next morning and found about 12,000 retweets... I also found I had about the same number of new followers,"" he told BBC Trending radio. ""Part of me wanted this to be true [and all the followers to be real]."" Krebs,who wrote about the experience on his blog,external, immediately suspected he'd been on the receiving end of a bot attack. Bots - automated or semi-automated accounts which tweet or retweet automatically - have been at the centre of allegations of Russian interference in Western elections. US intelligence agencies claim that bots spread false news stories and misinformation during the 2016 presidential election campaign. And networks of bots were also involved in spreading memes, gifs and misinformation in the run-up to the French presidential election in spring 2017. The Russian government denies that they operate or fund bot networks. And there's no definitive evidence connecting botnets, even if they do push pro-Russia stories, to the Kremlin. The pro-Russian bots could be operated, as President Vladimir Putin once put it, by ""patriotic"" Russian citizens acting independently. But why would pro-Russia accounts retweet a message like Krebs' tweet, which runs contrary to their views? My conversations with Guccifer 2.0 Macron Leaks: the anatomy of a hack Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Experts say the bots could be trying to clog up accounts with mentions, or even get their enemies suspended from the social network. When Joseph Cox, a journalist for the liberal news site The Daily Beast, posted about a story he wrote about pro-Russian bots, he was hit with a similar flood of retweets. His account was briefly suspended. Twitter prohibits bots and told Trending it is expanding its efforts dedicated to fighting the automated accounts. At the same time the company says it can't get specific about the tools it uses to detect bots, because that would allow bot makers to find a way around them. Another researcher who has been targeted by the automated accounts is Ben Nimmo, research fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab - part of the Atlantic Council, an American think tank. After the violence arounda far-right rally and counter-protests in Charlottesville, Virginiain August, Nimmo published a report comparing far-right commentators in the US with pro-Kremlin commentators who wrote about the war in Ukraine. The report was picked up by investigative website ProPublica, and a Twitter account with a tiny following sent out a message accusing ProPublica of being an ""altleft hate group"". The message was retweeted thousands of times. ""This was a classic obvious bot operation where the first account to do so had only posted 12 times in its entire life, it was only following six accounts and yet suddenly after this original tweet it got 23,000 retweets,"" Nimmo says. ""There's no way that's a natural pattern of behaviour."" Nimmo says there's several motivations behind a bot attack. Listen toBBC Trendingon the BBC World Service. The latest programmecan be streamed here, and you can also download theTrending podcast. ""Partly it's a simple intimidation technique,"" Nimmo says. ""The other thing is that it makes it very hard for you to use your Twitter notifications because they're just getting overwhelmed."" And the bots weren't done. After Nimmo published his findings about ProPublica, he was targeted by several accounts - one of which faked his death with a message which read: ""Our beloved friend and colleague Ben Nimmo passed away this morning."" ""Now that didn't really upset me - I knew I was alive,"" he told Trending. ""But it certainly startled a number of my friends and that was a much more sinister development. Again that tweet was retweeted something like 23,000 times by the same botnet."" Nimmo also noticed that the bots seemed to be triggered by some key words, so he put several of the triggers in a tweet along with the user name of the Twitter support team. Tens of thousands of the bots retweeted the message, exposing themselves to Twitter support. In less than two days, more than 70,000 appeared to have been taken offline. However, Nimmo and other experts say there could be millions of automated accounts still operating on the social network.

iPhone X: 10 leaps forward to new phone,"Attendees at the original iPhone's unveiling could look at but not touch the handset Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone launch is expected to be the biggest single upgrade the handset has seen since its launch. A revamped design with an edge-to-edge display, facial recognition ID system and advanced augmented reality featuresis expected. Several analysts have predicted the asking price for the top-end models will hit new heights too. In a world in which the smartphone has become ubiquitous, it's easy to forget how much of a surprise Steve Jobs's unveiling of the original was a decade ago, and how divided opinion was about whether it was truly a game-changer. To mark the occasion, we have picked 10 key moments from its past. This design - codenamed Purple - was created by Apple's designers in August 2005 After the success of first the iMac and then the iPod, Apple began developing a tablet as its next breakthrough product. But around 2004, ex-iOS chief Scott Forstall recalls having a critical conversation over lunch with chief executive Steve Jobs. ""We were both using our phones and hated them,""he told an audience,externalearlier this year. ""We looked around, and like everyone around us has a phone, and everyone looks very angsty as they're using them. ""And Steve said, 'Do you think we can take that demo we are doing with the tablet and multi-touch and shrink it down to somethingâ¦ small enough to fit in your pocket?'"" This prompted Apple's engineers to create a basic contacts app that was constrained to a corner of the prototype tablet's display. ""The second [Steve Jobs] saw this demo, he knew this was it,"" Mr Forstall said. ""There was no question. This was the way a phone had to behave."" As alegal filing would later reveal,external, by August 2005 Apple's industrial designers had already created a concept form factor - codenamed Purple - that is recognisable as the basis for the iPhone that followed. One of the original third-party iPhone apps is still available via the App Store There are now well over two million native apps available for the iPhone's iOS operating system, and most owners have several pages and folders worth of the programs. But for a while, after the first iPhone launched, there weren't enough to fill even a single screen. That's because third-party developers were initially limited to creating software that ran within the device's web browser. Steve Jobs reportedlybelieved policing a native app marketplace,externalwould be too complicated. It wasn't until more than a year after the handset went on sale that the App Store was launched. And history was made on 9 July when Apple made a handful of native apps live in advance of the marketplace opening its virtual doors. Among them was Moo - a cow sound simulator - from Denver-based developer Erica Sadun. ""I had come from the jailbreak community [in which developers modify smartphones to add capabilities], which put a lot of pressure on Apple to have its own store,"" Ms Sadun said. ""The App Store completely revolutionised how independent developers could create businesses, monetise their product and present it to a community of people that was larger than anybody had ever dreamed of. ""It created a gold rush that I don't think we are ever going to see again."" The original Android phone did not feature multi-touch capabilities It sounds fanciful now, but once upon a time Google's chief executive was a member of Apple's board of directors. Eric Schmidt did not resign from the post until 2009, but his days were numbered as soon as the first commercial Android phone was announced. The HTC Dream offered features the iPhone still lacked, including copy and paste, Street View and multimedia messaging. And while reviews were tepid -suggesting it was,external""best suited for early adopters"" - they recognised the potential of a more open smartphone platform to iOS. Curiously, the Dream was theoretically capable of supporting ""multi-touch"" gestures - recognising how many fingers were in contact with the screen - but the feature was disabled. That was probably because Apple had patented the technology. When HTC added the feature to a follow-up handset in 2010, Steve Jobs was infuriated. ""I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product,"" he subsequently told his biographer Walter Isaacson. ""I'm willing to go to thermonuclear war on this."" Siri allowed Apple to enter the Search market These days, Apple spends millions making adverts starring Siri and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, among other celebrity co-stars. But when the virtual assistant was first released on iOS, it was a relatively low-profile app from a fairly obscure Californian research institute, which had been part-funded by the Pentagon. Its business model was to charge restaurants and event promoters a fee for any voice-controlled bookings made for their businesses, and the plan was to release follow-up versionsfor Android and Blackberry,external. But that changed two months after its launch,when Apple bought,externalthe technology,reportedly for more than $200m,external(Â£150m). The app remained live on the App Store until October 2011, at which point an upgraded version became an exclusive feature for the newly launched iPhone 4S. The iPhone 4's front camera took only 0.3 megapixel photos When the iPhone 4 was released, reviews highlighting itsaddition of a front camera,externalfocused on its use for video calls rather than self-portraits. Perhaps that was understandable. Although the word ""selfie""had already been coined, it had yet to become commonplace. And while the iPhone 4 was not the first handset to feature a camera on both its sides - Sony Ericsson did so in 2003 - it can claim to have been a driving force in the rise of selfie culture. ""The iPhone 4 was important as you had a device that was very easy to use, a big teen demographic with access to it, and an explosion of mobile apps,"" said Charles Arthur, author of Digital Wars. ""It's a classic example of unintended consequences. ""Now, the selfie has taken over from the autograph. ""Watch people at any public event where they are meeting stars, and they're always trying to get a selfie with them."" Steve Jobs died from a rare form of pancreatic cancer When Tim Cook - rather than Steve Jobs - unveiled the 4S on 4 October 2011, he faced criticism for his performance.The BBC even accused himof appearing ""dull"". What wasn't apparent at the time was that Mr Cook must have been aware that his mentor and friend Steve Jobs was close to death. He died the next day. It is likely that Apple would have collapsed had Mr Jobs not returned in 1997 to the company he had co-founded, meaning there would never have been an iPhone. Or had he not subsequently stayed at Apple, it's possible the company's engineers might have pursued a rival mobile phone design based around the iPod's click wheel. Certainly,  since his death, Apple has yet to launch a product that has come anywhere close to achieving the iPhone's level of success, and some question whether it ever will. Mr Jobs's last public appearance was at Cupertino City Council in June 2011, where he sought permission for Apple to build a new headquarters. The new iPhone will be the first product to be launched at the new campus, within an event space called the Steve Jobs Theater. If ever proof were needed of the disruptive economic impact of the iPhone, the takeover of Instagram provided it. The app had been in existence only 18 months when the deal was announced. It had just 13 employees and had been an iOS-exclusive until the week before the revelation. Its takeover provided a bonanza to both Instagram's investors as well as to other smartphone-related start-ups seeking venture capital cash. At the time, many thought Facebookhad wildly overpaid,external. Now, as Instagram sucks in ever more advertising dollars while offline media's funding struggles worsen, it seems like a bargain. Other apps that debuted on the iPhone - including Uber, Deliveroo and Airbnb - have shaken up industry in other ways. And by one estimate, thetotal value of the global app economy,external- including software sales, advertising and mobile commerce - was $1.3tn (Â£993bn) for last year. It took Apple just over a year to add AuthenTec's technology to its iPhones Apple's $356m takeover of a fingerprint sensor chip-maker in 2012 caused a particular problem for Samsung. The South Korean company was already using the Florida-based company's components in its laptops and had just announced a deal toadd another of its security products,externalto its Android phones. But while the idea of frustrating its arch-rival probably had some appeal, the biggest benefit to Apple was the ability to launch its Touch ID system in 2013's iPhone 5S. As reviews noted, previous attempts to introduce fingerprint scanning to phoneshad proven,external""unreliable, often causing more aggravation than they're worth"" but thenew system worked,external""pretty much flawlessly"". Initially, the feature was limited to being used to unlock the phone and make digital purchases from Apple. But it later made it possible for the company to introduce Apple Pay and add security to third-party apps without requiring the hassle of typing in a password each time. One side-effect of the sensor's success is it may have prolonged the life of a physical home button on the iPhone. Ifrumours are to be believed,external, Apple has struggled to replace it with a part that could be hidden beneath the screen and may be about to replace it altogether with facial recognition scans on the iPhone X. Although Windows Phone achieved a double-digit market share in Europe, it never looked like it would outsell the iPhone In 1997, Microsoft threw Apple a lifeline by taking a $150m stake in the failing company. Apple returned the favour by launching a product that Microsoft first failed to properly understand and then struggled to match. Chief executive Steve Ballmer famously laughed at the iPhone's prospects after he first heard about it. ""That is the most expensive phone in the world, and it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard,""he said in 2007,external. Six years later, he announced the takeover of Nokia's phone business for 5.4bn euros ($6.5bn; Â£5bn) in an attempt to catch up, only for the sum to be written off in 2015 after he had departed and his successor finally accepted Windows Phone was a flop. The irony is that if Microsoft's stake in Apple had not been sold off under Mr Ballmer, it would now be worth more than $40bn and he might have shared in its success. ""Like so many other people, Steve Ballmer completely underestimated the impact of the iPhone,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""His arrogant dismissal has certainly come back to haunt him."" This video can not be played WATCH: What will AR do on the new iPhones? Pokemon Go fever is now well past its peak, and the app more likely to make headlinesfor botched eventsthan rare monster sightings. But its legacy has been to prove that augmented reality (AR) apps - in which graphics are mixed with real-world views - can have mass appeal. AR actually dates back to 2009 on the iPhone, when a French developercreated an app,externalthat shows nearby shops and other points of interest in Paris. But it's set to come of age with the imminent release of iOS 11,which includes ARKit- software that makes it easier for developers to anchor graphics to the world beyond and take account of its lighting conditions. Several demos released in advance have looked impressive, not leasta version of PacMan,externalwhere you walk through the maze.

Bell Pottinger goes into administration,"Bell Pottinger is based in Holborn, central London Bell Pottinger has collapsed into administration in the UK after running a racially charged PR campaign in South Africa. The troubled public relations firm put itself up for sale last week, but could not find a buyer. The administrators BDO said the firm had been ""heavily financially impacted"" by the scandal. The level of its losses and the inability to win new clients left the firm with no other option, BDO said. Bell Pottinger wasejected from the UK's industry bodylast week for a PR campaign that emphasised the power of white-owned businesses in South Africa. A string of clients, including HSBC, Investec and luxury goods company Richemont, cut ties with the firm over its work on the campaign. Bell Pottinger filed plans to appoint three BDO administrators on Friday, and the appointment became effective on Tuesday. A BDO spokesman said: ""Following an immediate assessment of the financial position, the administrators have made a number of redundancies. ""The administrators are now working with the remaining partners and employees to seek an orderly transfer of Bell Pottinger's clients to other firms in order to protect and realise value for creditors."" Bell Pottinger's Middle East and Asian units had already announced plans to separate from the UK parent company. South Africa's opposition party filed a complaint over the campaign The PR firm worked on the controversial campaign for Oakbay, a company owned by the wealthy Guptas family in South Africa. The work was criticised for presenting opponents of President Jacob Zuma and the Guptas as agents of ""white monopoly capital"". Bell Pottinger and its co-founder, Lord Bell, had a reputation for taking risks. Lord Bell, who was a PR adviser to Margaret Thatcher, resigned from the firm last year. The company represented Oscar Pistorius, the South African Olympic athlete, after he was charged with murder. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has used the firm's services, as well as Syria's first lady Asma al-Assad. In the late 1990s the PR firm worked on a campaign to release former Chilean dictator General Pinochet after his arrest in London on a Spanish extradition warrant on murder charges.

Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Itâs the big(ger) leap that iPhone fans - and Wall Street - had
been demanding. The iPhone X - âTenâ, not âXâ - brings together many features weâd
been expecting - such as FaceID for unlocking the phone, and animated emojis -
animojis - that look fun to play with, if not a killer feature thatâll have
people running to stores. All this wonât come cheap: at $999 - or Â£999 in the UK - itâs the most expensive iPhone
to date. Apple is often accused of being slow to new tech, and I think that
criticism will continue. Wireless charging comes years after Samsung first
introduced it, for example, and the overall look of the phone, which no longer
has the iconic home button, looks strikingly similar to the latest Samsung
Galaxy Note. The phone was unveiled in the new Steve Jobs Theater, a purpose-built venue or such launches. A beautiful, comfy building, with marble
everywhere, it sits alongside Appleâs striking new spaceship campus. This is
the house that iPhone built, with a decade of phenomenal success. Does iPhone X
herald another great era? The audience here cheered, but didnât stand, with
applause. Iâm reserving my judgement until Iâve tried it. The FT's Tim Bradshaw tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has attacked bitcoin, calling the digital currency ""a fraud"" that will blow up sooner or later. ""The currency isn't going to work. You can't have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,"" he told an investor conference in New York. ""It's worse than tulip bulbs - it won't end well. If we had a trader who traded bitcoin Iâd fire him in a second for two reasons. It is against our rules and they are stupid, and both are dangerous."" Mr Dimon also predicted big losses for bitcoin buyers: ""Don't ask me to short it. It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up. Honestly, I am just shocked that anyone can't see it for what it is."" Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Itâs the big(ger) leap that iPhone fans - and Wall Street - had
been demanding. The iPhone X - âTenâ, not âXâ - brings together many features weâd
been expecting - such as FaceID for unlocking the phone, and animated emojis -
animojis - that look fun to play with, if not a killer feature thatâll have
people running to stores. All this wonât come cheap: at $999 - or Â£999 in the UK - itâs the most expensive iPhone
to date. Apple is often accused of being slow to new tech, and I think that
criticism will continue. Wireless charging comes years after Samsung first
introduced it, for example, and the overall look of the phone, which no longer
has the iconic home button, looks strikingly similar to the latest Samsung
Galaxy Note. The phone was unveiled in the new Steve Jobs Theater, a purpose-built venue or such launches. A beautiful, comfy building, with marble
everywhere, it sits alongside Appleâs striking new spaceship campus. This is
the house that iPhone built, with a decade of phenomenal success. Does iPhone X
herald another great era? The audience here cheered, but didnât stand, with
applause. Iâm reserving my judgement until Iâve tried it. The FT's Tim Bradshaw tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Apple's new iPhone X - which is referred to as ""ten"" - uses a facial recognition system to recognise its owner rather than a fingerprint-based one. FaceID can work in the dark by using 30,000 infra-red dots to check an identity, Apple says, and is harder to fool than its old TouchID system. The firm has yet to reveal the cost but analysts predict it will be the first mainstream handset to be priced above $1,000/Â£1,000. Apple also unveiled the lower-end iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which are its first to feature in-built wireless charging. Read our full story here. Allow Twitter content?

JJ Abrams to direct Star Wars: Episode IX,"JJ Abrams will direct, co-write and co-produce Episode IX JJ Abrams, who launched the new era of Star Wars films with The Force Awakens in 2015, is returning to the series as director of Star Wars: Episode IX. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said ""JJ delivered everything we could have possibly hoped for"" in the earlier instalment, and she was excited he was returning to ""close out this trilogy"". Abrams replaces Colin Trevorrow, whodropped out of the film last month. Meanwhile the release has been delayed by six months, to December 2019. The announcement was made on Twitter by Walt Disney Studios, which owns Lucasfilm, on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Force Awakens was a big box office hit Chris Terrio will co-write the ninth instalment with Abrams. He won an Oscar for writing Argo in 2013 and his other scripts include Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the forthcoming Justice League. The return of JJ Abrams to the Star Wars universe is a big deal for fans and for Lucasfilm. After the lacklustre prequel films, he made the series relevant again - delivering, in The Force Awakens, a movie that satisfied fans of the original 70s/80s trilogy, and excited a new audience, not to mention taking $2bn in ticket sales. Since Disney bought Lucasfilm from George Lucas, the production giant has often had trouble marrying the visions of individual directors with its own clear view of how its most lucrative property should develop. Several directors have been left by the wayside. JJ Abrams has so far proved to be one of the few directors who's been able to balance his individuality as a film-maker with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy's more than firm hand on the movies. This news signals a return to stability in the saga of Star Wars series. Episode IX is expected to star Daisy Ridley and John Boyega. Rian Johnson is directing the second in the current trilogy, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which will be released this December.Deadline reported,externalthat Johnson had declined an offer to take over Episode IX before Abrams was approached. Most Star Wars fans on Twitter welcomed Abrams' return to the franchise. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Monster' fatberg found blocking sewer,"This video can not be played The fatberg was filmed by Thames Water engineers who are trying to remove the blockage A 250-metre long fatberg weighing 130 tonnes has been found blocking a sewer. The solid mass of congealed fat, wet wipes, nappies, oil and condoms formed in the Victorian-era tunnel in Whitechapel, London. Thames Water described it as one of the largest it had seen and said it would take three weeks to remove. The company's head of waste networks Matt Rimmer said: ""It's a total monster and taking a lot of manpower and machinery to remove as it's set hard."" What causes fatbergs? The company says fatbergs form when people put things they shouldn't down sinks and toilets. This video can not be played What causes fatbergs? ""It's basically like trying to break up concrete,"" Mr Rimmer said. ""It's frustrating as these situations are totally avoidable and caused by fat, oil and grease being washed down sinks and wipes flushed down the loo. ""The sewers are not an abyss for household rubbish and our message to everyone is clear - please bin it - don't block it."" The fatberg is about as heavy as 11 double decker buses. Work at Whitechapel Road to remove the immense fatberg started this week. Eight workers will break up the mass with high-pressure hoses, suck up the pieces into tankers and take it to a recycling site in Stratford. In 2013, Thames Water found abus-size fatbergin a sewer in Kingston-upon-Thames. A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council said: ""We know this is a major issue across London. ""We have set up a waste oil collection point with Truman Brewery in Brick Lane, and strongly encourage businesses to set up collection contracts for their waste oil with companies for recycling.""

More than 100 prisoners escaped during Irma,"About 1,000 British troops are in the region providing aid in the wake of the hurricane A number of prisoners are still on the run after more than 100 escaped when Hurricane Irma hit the British Virgin Islands. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said there was a ""serious threat of the complete breakdown of law and order"". Police and troops have been sent to recapture the prisoners, the Foreign Office said, but some remain at large. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has arrived in the Caribbean, amid criticism over the UK's response. Speaking during the flight, Mr Johnson said his visit was a ""very important statement"" to show people the government was ""here for UK nationals"" in a time of need. More than 500,000 British nationals have been in the path of Hurricane Irma, Sir Alan said, adding that five people are now known to have died in the British Virgin Islands and four in Anguilla. 'Our hotel roof blew off during Irma' Florida to re-open storm-ravaged Keys What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories? Addressing the House of Commons, Sir Alan said there were 997 troops in the region and 47 police officers had been sent to the British Virgin Islands (BVI). ""We have maintained and kept law and order on the BVI which at one point could have dramatically threatened the already unfortunate plight of those that have been hit by the hurricane."" This video can not be played The hurricane-hit islands' needs are ""unprecedented"", says the international development secretary He added that dealing with the security breach ""was what ministers and the ministry of defence was for"". The Foreign Office said the BVI was a ""priority"" and it was working as quickly as possible to fully restore law and order. British overseas territories, including Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands, are self-governing but rely on the UK government for protection against natural disasters. How the British Virgin Islands look now France, UK and Netherlands step up response The UK relief fund of Â£32m has so far provided more than 40 tonnes of aid including 2,608 shelter kits and 2,304 solar lanterns. RFA Mounts Bay, which was pre-positioned in the Caribbean ahead of hurricane season, started helping in Anguilla on 7 September. Meanwhile, a second ship HMS Ocean has been deployed to provide aid and assist the reconstruction effort. Some 250 military personnel will be sent to the Caribbean ""in the next few days"" bringing the total to around 1,250. The foreign secretary said the UK's military presence on the islands was ""really ratcheting up"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says his visit is a ""very important statement"" to reassure the UK nationals Some people in the British Virgin Islands are still lacking basic supplies Another flight of supplies arrives in the BVI ready to be dispatched by soldiers But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the British government's response was ""too little and too late"" and talking about potential evacuation a week on from the disaster was ""alarming"". The first flights for holidaymakers stranded by the hurricane in Florida, Cuba and the Caribbean will start to arrive back in the UK on Wednesday morning. The international development secretary said the UK was in the region for the ""long haul"" and would help reconstruct the British territories. Priti Patel told the BBC: ""We are in no doubt this is an open-ended operation - the support will continue."" She said the needs were ""unprecedented"", but admitted getting kit and people into the region had been challenging. Anguilla:Hit by the full blast of the hurricane on 6 September, killing four. British Virgin Islands:At least five people have died. Expected to require extensive humanitarian assistance. Montserrat:""Swiped"" by Irma but suffered less serious damage. Turks and Caicos:Battered by the hurricane on 7 September, with roofs ripped off, streets flooded, utility poles snapped and a widespread black-out on the main island of Grand Turk.

How Sweden is becoming a cashless economy,"Senobar Johnsen says it's ""visibly noticeable"" that Swedes prefer cards to cash these days Sweden is the most cashless society on the planet, with barely 1% of the value of all payments made using coins or notes last year. So how did the Nordic nation get so far ahead of the rest of us? Warm cinnamon buns are stacked next to mounds of freshly-baked sourdough bread at a neighbourhood coffee shop in Kungsholmen, just west of Stockholm city centre. Amongst the other typically Scandinavian touches - minimalist white tiles and exposed filament light bulbs - is another increasingly common sight in the Swedish capital: a ""We don't accept cash"" sign. ""We wanted to minimise the risk of robberies and it's quicker with the customers when they pay by card,"" says Victoria Nilsson, who manages two of the bakery chain's 16 stores across the city. Listen to Maddy Savage's report for Radio 4's PM programme ""It's been mainly positive reactions. We love to use our cards here in Stockholm."" Across the country, cash is now used in less than 20% of transactions in stores - half the number five years ago, according to the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank. Coins and banknotes have been banned on buses for several years after unions raised concerns over drivers' safety. Even tourist attractions have started to gamble on taking plastic-only payments, including Stockholm's Pop House Hotel and The Abba Museum. Bjorn Ulvaeus (left) back in his Abba heyday. Now he's a keen supporter of a cashless Sweden. The iconic band's Bjorn Ulvaeus is, in fact, one of the nation's most vocal supporters of Sweden's cash-free trend, after his son lost cash in an apartment burglary. Smaller retailers are jumping on the bandwagon, too, making use of home-grown technologies such as iZettle, the Swedish start-up behind Europe's first mobile credit card reader. Such portable technologies have enabled market traders - and even homeless people promoting charity magazines - to take card payments easily. ""I took my kids to the funfair and there was a guy selling balloons and he had a card machine with him,"" remarks Senobar Johnsen, one of the Swedish customers back at the bakery. Currently living in Portsmouth in southern England, she's visiting Sweden for the first time in a year and says it's ""visibly noticeable"" that people are paying more with cards. ""It's not like the UK where there's often a minimum spend when you go to a kiosk or you're in the middle of nowhere. I think it's great"". Swish, a smartphone payment system, is another popular Swedish innovation used by more than half the country's 10 million strong population. Signs like this are becoming increasingly common in Sweden Backed by the major banks, it allows customers to send money securely to anyone else with the app, just by using their mobile number. A staple at flea markets and school fetes, it's also a popular way to transfer money instantly between friends: Swedes can no longer get away with delaying their share of a restaurant bill using the excuse that they're short on cash. ""In general, consumers are very interested in new technologies, so we're quite early to adopt [them],"" explains Niklas Arvidsson, a professor at Stockholm's Royal Institute of Technology. This is partly down to infrastructure (Sweden is among the most connected countries in the EU); a relatively small population that is an ideal test-bed for innovations; and the country's historically low corruption levels, he argues. ""Swedes tend to trust banks, we trust institutions... people are not afraid of the sort-of 'Big Brother' issues or fraud connected to electronic payment."" Somewhat paradoxically, Sweden's decision to update its coins and banknotes, a move announced by the Riksbank in 2010 and fully implemented this year, actually boosted cashless transactions, explains Prof Arvidsson. ""You would have thought that a new kind of cash would have created an interest, but the reaction seems to have been the opposite,"" he says. ""Some retailers thought it's easier not to accept these new forms of cash because there's learning to be done, maybe investment in cash registration machines and so-on."" There has also been a ""ripple effect"", he says, with more shops signing up to the cashless idea as it becomes increasingly socially acceptable. Former Interpol president Bjorn Eriksson is worried about a cashless future Riksbank figures reveal that the average value of Swedish krona in circulation fell from around 106 billion (Â£10bn) in 2009 to 65 billion (Â£6bn) in 2016. Barely 1% of the value of all payments were made using coins or notes last year, compared to around 7% across the EU and in the US. Prof Arvidsson predicts that the use of cash will most likely be reduced to ""a very marginal payment form"" by 2020. Retailers seem to agree. A survey - not yet published - of almost 800 small retailers carried out by his research team found that two thirds of respondents said they anticipated phasing out cash payments completely by 2030. But the trend is not to everyone's liking, as Bjorn Eriksson, formerly national police commissioner and president of Interpol, explains from the suburb of Alvik. Here, his local coffee shop still accepts old-fashioned money, but several of the banks no longer offer cash deposits or over-the-counter withdrawals. ""I like cards. I'm just angry because about a million people can't cope with cards: the elderly, former convicts, tourists, immigrants. The banks don't care because [these groups] are not profitable,"" he argues. The 71-year-old is the face of a national movement called Kontantupproret (Cash Rebellion), which is also concerned about identity theft, rising consumer debt and cyber-attacks. ""This system could easily be disturbed or manipulated. Why invade us when it's so easy? Just cut off the payment system and we're completely helpless,"" says Mr Eriksson. Should you let a 'robot' manage your retirement savings? Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen? Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think? His arguments haven't escaped the notice of politicians in Sweden, where debates about security are increasingly making their way onto the agendain the wake of a government agency data leakthat almost brought down the ruling coalition in July. Meanwhile, the backdrop of an increasingly divided electorate suggests that rural and elderly voters could prove crucial in the Nordic country's next general election, scheduled for September 2018. Back at Stockholm's Royal Institute of Technology, Prof Arvidsson points out that while most Swedes have embraced the nation's cash-free innovations, two thirds don't want to get rid of notes and coins completely. ""There's a very strong emotional connection to cash among Swedes, even though they do not use it,"" he says. Sweden may leading the global trend towards a cashless future, but its tech-savvy population also appears to be guided by another, more traditional Swedish trait: caution.

Chancellor announces Budget date,"The next Budget will be held on Wednesday 22 November, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has said. It will be the first Budget since the Conservatives lost their majority in the House of Commons in the snap election in June. Mr Hammond delivered another Budget earlier this year in the spring. But he has previously indicated that the main date for the annual speech, which outlines fiscal forecasts and tax changes, will move to the autumn. The chancellor said the Budget was an opportunity for the government to ""set out our thinking on how to keep the economy strong and resilient and fair"". Mr Hammond told the Lords Economics Affairs Committee that the UK economy had ""inevitably been overshadowed by the uncertainty of the Brexit negotiation process"". ""The quicker we can generate some clarity about the future for business and consumers, the better, so that we can get back to the business of pursuing what I think looked like a very positive outlook for the UK economy in early 2016,"" he added. Also on Tuesday, the government moved on public sector pay, announcing pay rises for police and prison officers which go beyond the current cap. Downing Street signalled the end of the 1% pay freeze for other public sector workers, saying they recognised the need for more flexibility in future. Budget 2017: So, farewell then Spring Budget...

Listen to Maddy Savage's report for Radio 4's PM programme ""It's been mainly positive reactions. We love to use our cards here in Stockholm."" Across the country, cash is now used in less than 20% of transactions in stores - half the number five years ago, according to the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank. Coins and banknotes have been banned on buses for several years after unions raised concerns over drivers' safety. Even tourist attractions have started to gamble on taking plastic-only payments, including Stockholm's Pop House Hotel and The Abba Museum. Bjorn Ulvaeus (left) back in his Abba heyday. Now he's a keen supporter of a cashless Sweden. The iconic band's Bjorn Ulvaeus is, in fact, one of the nation's most vocal supporters of Sweden's cash-free trend, after his son lost cash in an apartment burglary. Smaller retailers are jumping on the bandwagon, too, making use of home-grown technologies such as iZettle, the Swedish start-up behind Europe's first mobile credit card reader. Such portable technologies have enabled market traders - and even homeless people promoting charity magazines - to take card payments easily. ""I took my kids to the funfair and there was a guy selling balloons and he had a card machine with him,"" remarks Senobar Johnsen, one of the Swedish customers back at the bakery. Currently living in Portsmouth in southern England, she's visiting Sweden for the first time in a year and says it's ""visibly noticeable"" that people are paying more with cards. ""It's not like the UK where there's often a minimum spend when you go to a kiosk or you're in the middle of nowhere. I think it's great"". Swish, a smartphone payment system, is another popular Swedish innovation used by more than half the country's 10 million strong population. Signs like this are becoming increasingly common in Sweden Backed by the major banks, it allows customers to send money securely to anyone else with the app, just by using their mobile number. A staple at flea markets and school fetes, it's also a popular way to transfer money instantly between friends: Swedes can no longer get away with delaying their share of a restaurant bill using the excuse that they're short on cash. ""In general, consumers are very interested in new technologies, so we're quite early to adopt [them],"" explains Niklas Arvidsson, a professor at Stockholm's Royal Institute of Technology. This is partly down to infrastructure (Sweden is among the most connected countries in the EU); a relatively small population that is an ideal test-bed for innovations; and the country's historically low corruption levels, he argues. ""Swedes tend to trust banks, we trust institutions... people are not afraid of the sort-of 'Big Brother' issues or fraud connected to electronic payment."" Somewhat paradoxically, Sweden's decision to update its coins and banknotes, a move announced by the Riksbank in 2010 and fully implemented this year, actually boosted cashless transactions, explains Prof Arvidsson. ""You would have thought that a new kind of cash would have created an interest, but the reaction seems to have been the opposite,"" he says. ""Some retailers thought it's easier not to accept these new forms of cash because there's learning to be done, maybe investment in cash registration machines and so-on."" There has also been a ""ripple effect"", he says, with more shops signing up to the cashless idea as it becomes increasingly socially acceptable. Former Interpol president Bjorn Eriksson is worried about a cashless future Riksbank figures reveal that the average value of Swedish krona in circulation fell from around 106 billion (Â£10bn) in 2009 to 65 billion (Â£6bn) in 2016. Barely 1% of the value of all payments were made using coins or notes last year, compared to around 7% across the EU and in the US. Prof Arvidsson predicts that the use of cash will most likely be reduced to ""a very marginal payment form"" by 2020. Retailers seem to agree. A survey - not yet published - of almost 800 small retailers carried out by his research team found that two thirds of respondents said they anticipated phasing out cash payments completely by 2030. But the trend is not to everyone's liking, as Bjorn Eriksson, formerly national police commissioner and president of Interpol, explains from the suburb of Alvik. Here, his local coffee shop still accepts old-fashioned money, but several of the banks no longer offer cash deposits or over-the-counter withdrawals. ""I like cards. I'm just angry because about a million people can't cope with cards: the elderly, former convicts, tourists, immigrants. The banks don't care because [these groups] are not profitable,"" he argues. The 71-year-old is the face of a national movement called Kontantupproret (Cash Rebellion), which is also concerned about identity theft, rising consumer debt and cyber-attacks. ""This system could easily be disturbed or manipulated. Why invade us when it's so easy? Just cut off the payment system and we're completely helpless,"" says Mr Eriksson. Should you let a 'robot' manage your retirement savings? Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen? Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think? His arguments haven't escaped the notice of politicians in Sweden, where debates about security are increasingly making their way onto the agendain the wake of a government agency data leakthat almost brought down the ruling coalition in July. Meanwhile, the backdrop of an increasingly divided electorate suggests that rural and elderly voters could prove crucial in the Nordic country's next general election, scheduled for September 2018. Back at Stockholm's Royal Institute of Technology, Prof Arvidsson points out that while most Swedes have embraced the nation's cash-free innovations, two thirds don't want to get rid of notes and coins completely. ""There's a very strong emotional connection to cash among Swedes, even though they do not use it,"" he says. Sweden may leading the global trend towards a cashless future, but its tech-savvy population also appears to be guided by another, more traditional Swedish trait: caution.

Pay cap lifted for police and prison staff,"Rank and file police officers will get a 1% bonus on top of a rise in their pay The cap on public sector pay rises in England and Wales is to be lifted. Ministers will now get ""flexibility"" to breach the longstanding 1% limit. The announcement came as the government said police officers would get a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus, with prison officers getting a 1.7% rise - both funded from existing budgets. Unions reacted angrily to the pay awards, branding them a real-terms cut, and the Prison Officers Association threatened industrial action. There was also a warning from police chiefs that making forces pay for the increase themselves would put ""financial pressure on already stretched budgets"". Teachers' pay declining, warns OECD Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private? Unite boss 'would back illegal strikes' Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and since 2013, rises have been capped at 1% - below the rate of inflation. There has been speculation in recent weeks the cap could be lifted in response to worries about its impact on staff recruitment and retention and morale in the public sector. Announcing the increases for police and prison officers, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Elizabeth Truss said ""now is a time to move to a more flexible approach"" to public sector pay. She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One review bodies and departments were being given greater leeway to use pay to address ""pinch points"" within public sector staffing. ""We are making sure that our policy is targeted to where there are specific issues, where we need to make sure we recruit more talent into the public sector, but also where we do need to make sure that we are holding on to those really valued people,"" she said. ""What we are making sure is that we look at it on a workforce-by-workforce basis because there are very different issues for teachers than for nurses and for police officers."" The higher increases for rank-and-file police and prison officers, which are backdated to 1 September and 1 April respectively, are based on the most recent recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Since the general election, Theresa May has been under pressure to respond to voter concerns over squeezed living standards. And today's announcements on pay for police and prison officers mark the beginning of the end for the public sector pay cap. But if the government thought breaching its own pay cap would ease tensions with the trade unions it will need to think again. At the TUC conference there was anger and disappointment. The biggest union, Unite, threatened to press ahead with strike action even if their ballot turnout and margins don't meet levels now required by law. While there was very little support for talk of calling illegal strikes, legal action could be on the horizon. If the unions don't get a commitment from the chancellor in November's Budget to fund larger pay increases next year we should expect the prospect of strikes in the new year. Although next year's pay settlements for other parts of the public sector, such as the NHS, have yet to be decided, a No 10 spokesman confirmed the existing pay cap was at an end. The newly-announced rises are still below the level of inflation, which measured by the Consumer Prices Index rose to 2.9%, from 2.6%, in August. Steve Gillan, the general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said: ""I have made it clear that it is a pay cut. It is not acceptable. Our executive will be looking to co-ordinate action with other trade unions."" Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said the announcement would leave many officers ""angry and deflated"". ""We were not greedy in what we asked for,"" Mr White added. ""Officers have been taking home about 15% less than they were seven years ago."" The federation had asked for a 2.8% increase to basic pay, while the Prison Officers Association had called for a 5% increase. The government has decided to lift the 1% pay cap on the public sector, although at the moment we don't know by how much, except for the police and prison officers. How much it would cost is a tricky question. In the case of the police and prison officers, the money is apparently coming from existing budgets, but that means that there will have to be cuts elsewhere or reserves will be run down. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that an extra 1% pay for the entire public sector would cost about Â£1.8bn a year, although it would get some of that back in income tax and National Insurance. But there are other savings that need to be taken into account, for example, some have argued that raising pay in the NHS would stop staff leaving and reduce absence, so reducing the use of more expensive agency staff and saving money. Chief Constable Francis Habgood, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said forces had budgeted in line with the 1% cap until 2020, adding that without extra government funding the latest award would ""inevitably impact on our ability to deliver policing services and maintain staffing levels"". This was rejected by Policing Minister Nick Hurd, who said the offer was affordable to forces. He added that police forces were ""sitting on"" at least Â£1.5bn in reserves. Responding to the announcement, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said ""this below-inflation pay offer is pathetic"". ""Public sector workers have suffered seven long years of real pay cuts, and are thousands of pounds worse off. Today's announcement means bills will continue to rise faster than their wages."" Speaking at the TUC conference in Brighton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused ministers of playing ""divide and rule"" with different parts of the public sector. He said: ""A pay cut is a pay cut. We must be united in breaking the pay cap for all workers."" Unison said it was a ""tiny step in the right direction but not nearly enough"". Chancellor Philip Hammond had been expected to address the issue in his Autumn Budget amid calls from Labour, and some Tory MPs, for help for million of workers who have suffered years of real-terms pay cuts. As the latest announcements are being funded through existing budgets, they will bring no extra funding for the devolved administrations, who have the power to set their own rates of public sector pay. Last month, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the 1% cap would be scrapped from next year. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the pay cap was ""no longer sustainable"", calling for it to be ""lifted across the board"".

Monkey selfie legal fight settled,"Mr Slater said that he had to earn the trust of the monkeys over several days before venturing close enough to get the selfie A photographer has settled a two-year legal fight against an animal rights group over a ""monkey selfie"" picture. Naruto the macaque monkey took the image in the Indonesian jungle in 2011 when it picked up a camera owned by David Slater from Monmouthshire. USjudges had saidcopyright protection could not be applied to the monkey butPeta,externalsaid theanimal should benefit. Peta's appeal on the ""monkey's behalf"" was dismissed but Mr Slater has agreed to donate 25% of any future revenue. In a joint statement from Peta and Mr Slater, it said the photographer will give a quarter of the funds he receives from selling the monkey selfies to registered charities ""dedicated to protecting the welfare or habitat of Naruto"". ""Peta's groundbreaking case sparked a massive international discussion about the need to extend fundamental rights to animals for their own sake, not in relation to how they can be exploited by humans,"" said Peta lawyer Jeff Kerr. Mr Slater, of Chepstow, said he put in a lot of effort which was more than enough for him to claim copyright. Peta claimed the monkey is a female called Naruto but Mr Slater claimed it was a different male macaque He also said he was a conservationist and interest in the image had already helped animals in Indonesia. The case was listed as ""Naruto v David Slater"" but the identity of the monkey had also been in dispute, with Peta claiming it is a female called Naruto and Mr Slater saying it is a different male macaque. But appeal judges at a court in San Francisco ruled in Mr Slater's favour after a two-year legal fight. In the joint-statement between Peta and Mr Slater, they say this case ""raises important, cutting-edge issues about expanding legal rights for non-human animals"".

Family slavery gang jailed for 80 years,"The Rooney family ran a driveway resurfacing business Nine members of a traveller family who kept workers in squalid conditions in caravans have been jailed for modern day slavery offences. One victim, whose ordeal spanned more than 25 years, was made to dig his own grave. The head of the family, Martin Rooney Senior, was jailed for 10 years, while two of his sons were each jailed for more than 15 years. The traveller family were described as ""chilling in their mercilessness"". More on this and other stories from across Lincolnshire The case at Nottingham Crown Court was part of Lincolnshire Police's Operation Pottery investigation, one of the largest investigations of its kind. The Rooneys' victims were beaten and left without running water or toilet facilities at the Drinsey Nook site in Lincolnshire. Beaten, abused and made to dig own grave This video can not be played The sister of one of the victims says he was forced to dig his own grave Sentencing Martin Rooney Senior, Timothy Spencer QC said: ""You brought up your sons in a criminal culture."" The judge also compared the squalid lives of the victims to the lavish lifestyle the family enjoyed. ""It was like the gulf between medieval royalty and peasantry,"" he told him. The head of the family Martin Rooney Senior was jailed for 10 years Ch Supt Chris Davison, of Lincolnshire Police, said: ""The victims will never get the years back that were taken away from them but I hope this provides them with some comfort that justice has been served and demonstrates that we will do everything in our power to try and stop others suffering in the ways that they did."" Mr Davison said there were potentially other victims of modern slavery in the UK and that the force ""would not rest on this result"". ""We are exploring five active investigations and we will continue to put any victims at the very heart of our investigations,"" he added. Police began operations against members of the Rooney family in September 2014 when seven warrants were executed in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and London. A number of victims were found and the UK Human Trafficking Centre concluded 18 men had been illegally brought to the sites. The victims were all described as vulnerable adults, aged between 18 and 63, who were often homeless and had been picked up by the defendants from across the UK. The victims lived in squalor, police said In one attack, a man was beaten with a shovel and left injured in a caravan for days for returning a car with no petrol. The court also heard of one victim's terrifying ordeal which spanned more than a quarter of a century. On one occasion, he was made to dig his own grave if he did not agree to a lifetime of servitude. The Rooneys' victims were beaten at the Drinsey Nook site in Lincolnshire Judge Spencer also spoke of how the family used food as a means of control over their victims. ""They knew if they wanted to eat, they had to stay at Drinsey Nook,"" he said. ""None of the men, in my judgement, were ever truly free to leave at all."" ""You stripped them of dignity and humanity and confined them to a life of drudgery"". Bridget Rooney was told she had the power to stop what was happening but chose to ignore it In a statement which was read in court, one victim said ""life with the Rooneys was a living hell"". Judge Spencer told Bridget Rooney, described as the matriarch of the family, she had ""the power to stop this"". She was jailed for seven years. John Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 15 years and six months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, conspiracy to defraud, fraud by false representation, two counts of theft Patrick Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 15 years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, fraud by abuse of position, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two counts of theft Bridget Rooney, 55, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for seven years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Martin Rooney, 57, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 10 years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, unlawful wounding Martin Rooney, 23, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for six years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm John Rooney, 53, of Chantry Croft, Pontefract - Jailed for five years and 10 months for two counts of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Peter Doran, 36, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - Jailed for six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Gerard Rooney, 46, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - Jailed for six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Lawrence Rooney, 47, of no fixed address - Currently serving a five year prison sentence and once complete, will serve another six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Martin Rooney, 35, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield received a two year suspended sentence for two years Patrick Rooney, 54, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield received a 12 month suspended sentence for two years Two others, Eileen Rooney, 32, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby and Nora Rooney, 31, of the same address, were both acquitted. Janine Smith, from the Crown Prosecution Service, paid tribute to the victims Speaking outside court after sentencing, Janine Smith, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the sentences ""reflect the level of exploitation, control and violence they exhibited and the betrayal of those they condemned to forced labour and the people they defrauded"". She added: ""I hope that seeing their abusers imprisoned will be of some comfort to them and will be a suitable acknowledgement of their courage in giving evidence.""

Nadine: Girls Aloud split was 'silly',"Nadine has recorded a new album with Girls Aloud's ""mad scientist"" Brian Higgins ""My favourite smell is bleach,"" says Nadine Coyle. ""If I walk into the house and there's things being bleached, it just makes me feel at home, euphoric almost."" She pauses and laughs. ""I can't believe we're having a whole discussion about bleach. Real pop star things!"" The topic has come up because Coyle's new song,Go To Work,external, is a withering riposte to a lover who's not pulling their weight. ""Tell me what I got to do / To get you up in the morning?"" she sings over an infectious house piano. ""Why don't you go to work?"" The song sees the 32-year-old reunited with Xenomania, the songwriting geniuses behind her old band Girls Aloud. Together they scored 21 Top 10 singles, more than any other female band in history, before calling it a day in 2013.  (Coyle says the split was ""silly"" and refused to put her name to it. But more on that later.) ""LA is a beautiful place, but it doesn't feel like real life,"" says the singer Go To Work was inspired, says Coyle, by ""general annoyance"" with people ""who just don't do anything"" to help out, at home or at work. But she's quick to point out the lyrics have nothing to do with her partner, American Football player Jason Bell. ""It's funny, we were watching this programme,Married to a Celebrity,external, the other night, and people had to write lists of whinges about their partner. ""I said to Jason, 'what would we write on our lists?' and he said, 'I wouldn't write anything.' ""I was like, 'that's a good answer. Well done, Jason!' ""We live really well together,"" she adds. ""He doesn't cook and he doesn't clean, but he makes really good coffees."" Home life has been Coyle's priority since Girls Aloud split in 2013. She moved back to Northern Ireland after nine years in Los Angeles to raise her three-year-old daughter Anaiya. Now, though, she's all fired up and ready to return to the charts. Nadine's first solo record was released, somewhat disastrously,in partnership with Tesco. Six years on she's signed a deal with Virgin EMI, home to Justin Bieber and Katy Perry, and says there's already a ""four-single plan"" for her new album. Coyle had almost 100 songs to choose from, recorded over a two-year period in Brighton. The overwhelming theme, she says, is feel-good pop. ""We're not trying to change the world. There's enough people trying to do that,"" she explains. ""We just want songs you can put on and have fun, that make your day better for those three minutes"". Girls Aloud at the start of their career (L-R): Sarah Harding, Cheryl, Nicola Roberts, Nadine and Kimberley Walsh Born and raised in Derry, Northern Ireland, Coyle first came to attention in 2001 on the Irish version of reality show Pop Stars. She made it through to the final band, Six. But then it was discovered she was 16, two years below the show's age limit, and had been lying throughout the audition process. The revelation saw her make a tearful exit from the competition. But Louis Walsh, a judge on the series, kept in touch and encouraged the singer to audition for ITV's Pop Stars: The Rivals in 2002. She was thethird member to be selected,externalfor Girls Aloud, joining Cheryl Tweedy (as she was then), Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh and Sarah Harding. What followed were some of the best, most unconventional pop hits of the 21st Century. Biology,external, for example, took two minutes and five (five!)musical movements to get to the chorus, whileSexy... No! No! No!,externalgrafted a lyric about sexual liberation onto a '70s heavy metal sample. The singer says her new album is ""all uptempo"", despite her love of big R&B ballads To begin with, Coyle was very much seen as the star. ""She's the one with the big solo career,"" Louis Walsh told the BBC in an (unpublished) interview from 2005. ""All she wants to do is sing. ""She's kind of lost in the group really, because no one knows how good she is. But if they were the Supremes, she would be Diana Ross."" It didn't quite turn out like that. When Cheryl signed up for X Factor, she began to eclipse her bandmates. On later Girls Aloud albums, she received a bigger share of the lead vocals. And it was Cheryl's solo career, not Coyle's, that produced platinum albums and number one singles. But there was no bad blood, and Coyle happily signed up for a Girls Aloud reunion tour in 2013 - an experience that nearly ended in disaster when a floating platform malfunctioned during rehearsals. ""We came down on the platform and it tilted and nearly tipped us off,"" she recalls. ""We were all screaming and clinging on for dear life. Thankfully, we were all fine."" The band won a Brit Award in 2009 for their number one single The Promise The tour was a huge success. After 20 dates, though, the band called it a day, announcing their split in abrief tweet,external. The statement was famously issued against Coyle's wishes. Informed of the decision just 20 minutes before they were due on stage for their final show, Coyle refused to sign a contract formalising their separation. ""I was in my robe and I'd got my hair and make-up on, and I was like, 'What? Everybody wants to do that?' And they said, 'Yes, everybody'. ""I thought it was silly. Why would you want to do that?  I thought everybody was tired because it was the end of the tour and they'd change their minds. ""Then they said, 'We're going to put out a statement' - and it was a tweet. ""I thought, 'What?What?! We came back with apress conference, and you're going to end 10 years with a tweet? Then remove my name completely from the whole thing. I do not agree with any of this.'"" The statement may have gone out but, to this day, Coyle has not put pen to paper - technically making her the sole remaining member of the band. ""I'm not saying that!"" she guffaws. ""You know that's what the headline will be! 'Nadine says sheisGirls Aloud!'"" But she's still in touch with the rest of the band, and says she voted ""all day"" for Sarah Harding to win the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother. The role of Erin was ""one of the best jobs I've had in my life,"" says Coyle Following the band's split and the birth of her daughter, Coyle signed up to appear as Erin the Goddess in Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance - finding herself dumbstruck by the dancers' physical prowess. ""It's like a sport,"" she says. ""When they were getting ready for the big finale, they would literally jump way above the height of me, just to get themselves pumped up. ""They were like gazelles, then they'd run on stage."" Did she ever harbour ambitions to join in? ""Are you joking?"" she laughs. ""I tried Irish dancing when I was younger but I wasn't any good. I just thought, 'this is a waste of time.'"" No, singing has always been in her blood - from her early days in a local restaurant called The Drunken Duck, all the way to Wembley Stadium. You get the sense that nothing makes her happier than being in the vocal booth, running through scales and recording harmonies. Making the new album with Xenomania supremo Brian Higgins, she says, pushed herself to discover new shades and tones to her voice. ""Brian would say, 'Oh, there's a lot to get through - we've got 25 vocal parts to record, but we'll do it over two or three days'. ""And I'd be like, 'No, we'll get this done in two hours.' ""You have to get into a zone where you're so focused that you're hearing melodies you've never heard before."" Nadine's Uber rating is going to suffer if she leaves a mark on that door Coyle says her favourite songs on the record include Girls On Fire, a celebration of strong women, and I Fall, ""which is about feeling connected to somebody, even when you're not in the same room."" Soon enough, though, she's back to talking about domestic life and describing how she pined for the Irish winter when she was out in America. ""I love being at home and hearing the rain on the window,"" she says. ""I missed that cosiness."" Nor was she impressed by LA's health-conscious food trends. ""You know how everybody's into this 'fresh from the farm' organic produce? That's how we grew up! ""You went to the farm to pick up your eggs and your potatoes. We were on that years ago - now it's trendy!"" If her music's as ahead of the curve as her diet, we're sure to be hearing a lot more from Nadine Coyle over the next 12 months.

The teen actors taking Toronto by storm,"Madison Wolfe (left) and Sydney Wade star in Anders Walter's I Kill Giants It's not often you ask an actor how they felt about working with their co-star and they reply: ""We hated each other."" Fortunately Madison Wolfe is only kidding, and she and Sydney Wade collapse into giggles as they explain how close they grew on the set of their new movie I Kill Giants. ""At the beginning of production we were just kind of polite to each other or whatever, but by the end we were really good friends,"" 14-year-old Madison says. Her co-star Sydney, 15, picks up: ""By the time we finished we were roasting each other, 'I don't like your shoes', 'Oh yeah, well I don't like your hair!' ""But honestly all jokes aside... she's an okay person."" The pair descend into more laughter. The duo struck up a firm friendship on set By quite some distance, Sydney and Madison must be two of the youngest movie stars at this year's Toronto Film Festival. But they're not exactly newcomers to the industry. ""I've been acting since I was four, so 11 years now,"" Sydney explains. ""Building up to this film was a very difficult process for me, it was challenging. I had to graft. I was doing non-speaking roles, non-paid roles. I didn't mind what I did as long as I was doing what I loved. ""But when I got on to I Kill Giants I thought 'this is it - this is everything that I wanted.'"" Wolfe plays the introverted Barbara in I Kill Giants Similarly, audiences (and horror fans in particular) may have already seen films starring Madison without even realising it. ""A lot of people saw me in The Conjuring, that was probably my biggest role so far,"" she says. ""But people didn't realise that I'd been working for almost six years before that. It takes a long time."" Madison and Sydney's new film I Kill Giants is the big-screen adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name by Joe Kelly and Ken Niimura. It tells the story of Barbara (Madison), a young girl who escapes to her own imaginary world to deal with the grief and trauma of something she's experiencing at home. Sydney plays Sophia, an English girl to whom Barbara somewhat reluctantly grows close through the course of the film. The young actress and the character she plays are both from Leeds - but there's little hint of a northern accent. L-R: Rory Jackson, Madison Wolfe, Imogen Poots, director Anders Walter and Sydney Wade ""We did try a stronger accent, but we thought, for the film to go globally, it's very hard for some people to understand the Leeds accent, because it can be really strong,"" Sydney says. She has a point. ""But I'm kind of neutral. I'm not RP [received pronunciation], I'm not from London or anything, so my own accent is quite plain, and you can understand it. ""I feel like it works well with Madison's accent too, which isn't too strong American."" Madison's character is far from your stereotypical teen girl heroine. She's a social outcast at school, dresses awkwardly and is generally quite eccentric and introverted - quite the opposite of Madison's outgoing real-life personality. ""Getting to play a character that's so different from myself is so cool,"" the actress says. Zoe Saldana plays Barbara's school psychologist in the film ""I don't dress like her or anything or wear bunny ears, but this is why I love acting so much, you can be anyone you want to be. ""Barbara being so scruffy and hard, it kind of betrays that she has a bit of a shell on her and she is kind of an introvert."" The film is directed by Anders Walter and also stars Imogen Poots and Zoe Saldana. Working on major film projects like this must be quite exhausting when you've got homework and exams to worry about, right? ""It's my last year at school, so I'm trying to pass through that,"" Sydney says. ""I tried a private school which worked really well, but towards the end I was struggling to manage both because I had loads of lessons. ""And then I did a year of home schooling, which was easier in terms of going off to work, but it was harder in terms of learning exactly what you needed to. ""So now I'm back at school, who are just incredible. They're so lenient with me going off and everything."" Madison and Sydney clearly have a long and bright future in film ahead of them - and when asked which other actresses they look up to, they're both full of names. Sydney cites Chloe Grace Moretz and Nicole Kidman as her acting inspirations ""One of the biggest icons I have is Meryl Streep,"" Madison says instantly. ""If I ever met her I think I would die. ""But I also love Natalie Portman, Emma Roberts, Margot Robbie - there's so many."" Sydney adds: ""I really appreciate Chloe Grace Moretz, I think she's a really great, interesting actor. And she's really diverse with everything she does. ""And Nicole Kidman, I saw her yesterday, very close-up! They are my top two."" Kidman is just one of several Hollywood A-listers Madison and Sydney have been rubbing shoulders with while in Toronto. Promotion and film festivals can be overwhelming, especially at such a young age, but it's a process the pair are clearly enjoying. ""It's quite rewarding, everyone worked so hard on this film,"" Madison says. ""You see all the reviews and people wanting to know more about it, it's just great - you feel like you've really accomplished something."" The same photographers who have mostly spent their time chasing Matt Damon, Jennifer Lawrence and George Clooney around Toronto this week could well be turning their attention to Madison and Sydney in a few years' time.

Head of family slavery gang jailed,"The Rooney family ran a driveway resurfacing business Nine members of a traveller family who kept workers in squalid conditions in caravans have been jailed for modern day slavery offences. One victim, whose ordeal spanned more than 25 years, was made to dig his own grave. The head of the family, Martin Rooney Senior, was jailed for 10 years, while two of his sons were each jailed for more than 15 years. The traveller family were described as ""chilling in their mercilessness"". More on this and other stories from across Lincolnshire The case at Nottingham Crown Court was part of Lincolnshire Police's Operation Pottery investigation, one of the largest investigations of its kind. The Rooneys' victims were beaten and left without running water or toilet facilities at the Drinsey Nook site in Lincolnshire. Beaten, abused and made to dig own grave This video can not be played The sister of one of the victims says he was forced to dig his own grave Sentencing Martin Rooney Senior, Timothy Spencer QC said: ""You brought up your sons in a criminal culture."" The judge also compared the squalid lives of the victims to the lavish lifestyle the family enjoyed. ""It was like the gulf between medieval royalty and peasantry,"" he told him. The head of the family Martin Rooney Senior was jailed for 10 years Ch Supt Chris Davison, of Lincolnshire Police, said: ""The victims will never get the years back that were taken away from them but I hope this provides them with some comfort that justice has been served and demonstrates that we will do everything in our power to try and stop others suffering in the ways that they did."" Mr Davison said there were potentially other victims of modern slavery in the UK and that the force ""would not rest on this result"". ""We are exploring five active investigations and we will continue to put any victims at the very heart of our investigations,"" he added. Police began operations against members of the Rooney family in September 2014 when seven warrants were executed in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and London. A number of victims were found and the UK Human Trafficking Centre concluded 18 men had been illegally brought to the sites. The victims were all described as vulnerable adults, aged between 18 and 63, who were often homeless and had been picked up by the defendants from across the UK. The victims lived in squalor, police said In one attack, a man was beaten with a shovel and left injured in a caravan for days for returning a car with no petrol. The court also heard of one victim's terrifying ordeal which spanned more than a quarter of a century. On one occasion, he was made to dig his own grave if he did not agree to a lifetime of servitude. The Rooneys' victims were beaten at the Drinsey Nook site in Lincolnshire Judge Spencer also spoke of how the family used food as a means of control over their victims. ""They knew if they wanted to eat, they had to stay at Drinsey Nook,"" he said. ""None of the men, in my judgement, were ever truly free to leave at all."" ""You stripped them of dignity and humanity and confined them to a life of drudgery"". Bridget Rooney was told she had the power to stop what was happening but chose to ignore it In a statement which was read in court, one victim said ""life with the Rooneys was a living hell"". Judge Spencer told Bridget Rooney, described as the matriarch of the family, she had ""the power to stop this"". She was jailed for seven years. John Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 15 years and six months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, conspiracy to defraud, fraud by false representation, two counts of theft Patrick Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 15 years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, fraud by abuse of position, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two counts of theft Bridget Rooney, 55, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for seven years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Martin Rooney, 57, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for 10 years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, unlawful wounding Martin Rooney, 23, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Jailed for six years and nine months for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm John Rooney, 53, of Chantry Croft, Pontefract - Jailed for five years and 10 months for two counts of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Peter Doran, 36, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - Jailed for six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Gerard Rooney, 46, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - Jailed for six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Lawrence Rooney, 47, of no fixed address - Currently serving a five year prison sentence and once complete, will serve another six years for conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Martin Rooney, 35, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield received a two year suspended sentence for two years Patrick Rooney, 54, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield received a 12 month suspended sentence for two years Two others, Eileen Rooney, 32, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby and Nora Rooney, 31, of the same address, were both acquitted. Janine Smith, from the Crown Prosecution Service, paid tribute to the victims Speaking outside court after sentencing, Janine Smith, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the sentences ""reflect the level of exploitation, control and violence they exhibited and the betrayal of those they condemned to forced labour and the people they defrauded"". She added: ""I hope that seeing their abusers imprisoned will be of some comfort to them and will be a suitable acknowledgement of their courage in giving evidence.""

Where is the best place to be a woman?,"East Dunbartonshire is the best place to live in Britain if you are a woman, according to research for BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. The Scottish local authority, which borders Glasgow, came out top when a number of factors, include some gender-specific measures, were analysed. Islington, in north London, was rated the worst place for women to live. TheNational Centre for Social Research analysis,externalfactored in issues such as the gender pay gap and education. It used data from a number of sources, including the Office for National statistics' 2016 Annual Population Survey and the 2011 Census covering England, Wales and Scotland but not Northern Ireland. Of the 380 local authorities analysed, East Dunbartonshire came out top for women, rating highly on a number of factors, from happiness to access to green spaces - and top-scoring on general living and wellbeing. Explore how other parts of Britain rated using this interactive map. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Users of Google AMP or Facebook Instant Articles may need to clickhere,externalto see the map. The average full-time salary for women in East Dunbartonshire was Â£15.07 per hour, 46th in Britain. It also ranked highly for education, quality of the local environment and life satisfaction. The area, which contains many of Glasgow's suburbs and commuter towns, ranked 192nd for housing affordability with an average property costing 7.5 times the area's average salary. The research excluded Northern Ireland due to lack of comparable data but, anecdotally, the researchers said Mid-Antrim and East Antrim showed similar scores to Britain's top five. It's not the first time East Dunbartonshire's desirability has been recognised. In 2007,a Reader's Digest poll,externalsaw it voted the best place in the UK to raise a family, citing ""safe streets, strong schools and thriving towns"", backed by a strong community. Ellie, 17, goes to Bishopbriggs Academy in East Dunbartonshire and says she feels supported by both the school and the community it is part of. ""I've not met one person in Bishopbriggs who said that you can't do something, or you cannot achieve what you want to achieve. I think we all know that we do live in a really nice place and it is a great place to live."" Classmate Stephanie, 16, said: ""I'd like to live here and hopefully have a family here and just be a good role model to all the younger citizens of Bishopbriggs."" But Nieve, 16, said it was unlikely she'd live in Bishopbriggs forever, adding: ""I feel like when you're here you are quite tied down. I don't want to be stuck here."" Islington is ranked worst in large part because it is one of the least affordable places to buy a home in the country, with the median house price 16 times the median income. The north London borough was actually ranked 16th across Britain for women's full-time wages, with the median being Â£16.35 per hour, but due to a large gender pay gap it was bumped into 105th place out of 380. Residents here also reported the lowest levels of happiness (371st), life satisfaction (372nd), and feelings that their life is worthwhile (379th). Allow Twitter content?

Scotland, south-east England and the West Midlands dominate the top 10 list for best overall place for women to live. West Oxfordshire and West Berkshire both rank highly in the South East, and Stafford and Shropshire are also placed in the top 10. But four London boroughs feature in the 10 worst places for women to live, with Camden, Westminster, and the City of London featuring alongside Islington. The analysis divided women into three age groups: those under 30; 30 to 65; and over 65s. Kingston upon Hull ranked the worst place to live as a woman under the age of 30 due to high levels of unemployment. South Oxfordshire was the best place for women to grow old, boasting low female mortality, a low crime rate and fewer women living alone - which the Women's Hour report says can lead to isolation and a diminished social network. Woman's Hourwill be broadcast live from East Dunbartonshire, at 10:00 - 10:45am on Wednesday on Radio 4. If you're a woman in East Dunbartonshire, we'd like to hear from you.

Holby star's festival death tribute,"John Michie said his daughter Louella was ""so very positive"" Grieving Holby City actor John Michie has paid tribute to his daughter following her death at a music festival in Dorset. Louella Michie was found in a wooded area of the Bestival site at Lulworth Castle in the early hours of Monday. Her 60-year-old dad toldThe Sun,externalthat the family had ""lost an angel"". Dorset Police said a 28-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murdering the 25-year-old is continuing to assist officers with inquiries. The force said Miss Michie and the arrested man, who is also being interviewed on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug, knew each other. An initial post-mortem examination which revealed no clear signs of an assault was inconclusive. More tests, including toxicology to establish if there were any substances in her system, will now be carried out, police said. The force has urged anyone with information to get in touch. Mr Michie, who also starred in Coronation Street and Taggart, told the paper: ""She touched so many lives. She was so very positive, so bright, so out there. ""She had such energy.

Beach closed over lethal men-of-war,"A Portuguese man-of-war, which was one of a group of six, washed up at Gwithian Large numbers of potentially fatal Portuguese man-of-war have washed up on a Cornish beach, prompting its closure. RNLI lifeguards erected do not swim red flags at Perranporth beach earlier because of the ""unusually large number"" of the creatures. The jellyfish-like organisms, which have long purple tentacles, have also been seen in Wales this month, says the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). With mild sea temperatures of 16C there were fears of swimmers being stung. The RNLI said it placed red flags at Perranporth beach between 10:00 and 13:30 BST to signal that the water was out of bounds, while lifeguards took advice on the level of danger to beachgoers. More on the man-of-war sightings and other stories from Cornwall Man-of-war were spotted at Newgale, Pembrokeshire, on 8 September and the next day on beaches near the holiday destination of Newquay. A leatherback turtle was found washed up at Portreath They have also been seen at Porthmelon Beach on the Isles of Scilly and on the Cornish beaches of Portheras Cove and Summerleaze, Widemouth, Perranporth, Hayle, Holywell Bay and Praa Sands. Six were also reported at Gwithian. Dr Peter Richardson from the MCS said a man-of-war's tentacles, which are usually about 10m (30ft) long, ""deliver an agonising and potentially lethal sting"". ""They are very pretty and look like partially deflated balloons with ribbons but picking one up could be very nasty,"" he said. The man-of-war retain their sting when they are wet, even if they look dead, he warned. He advised anyone who was stung to get the tentacles away from the body as soon as possible. The man-of-war can be tempting to children because it looks like a deflated balloon The (Physalia physalis) isnot a jellyfish, but a floating colony of organisms dependent on one another for survival Its gas-filled bladder (sometimes known as the sail), enables it to float on the ocean surface and drift with the current Its sting - delivered from tentacles which can reach up to 50m below the surface - is extremely painful for humans and can be fatal in rare circumstances Hundreds of swimmers are stung every year,especially when huge numbers appear in coastal waters Leatherback turtles have also been washed up, Dr Richardson said.

Pro-Russia Twitter bots have a new strategy,"Co-ordinated groups of Twitter bots pushing pro-Russian propaganda have developed an odd but occasionally effective strategy - retweeting messages that the bot-makers disagree with and flooding their enemies with followers. Brian Krebs is an investigative journalist with a big social media following. But even he was surprised when one of his tweets was retweeted thousands of times: Allow Twitter content?

""I woke up the next morning and found about 12,000 retweets... I also found I had about the same number of new followers,"" he told BBC Trending radio. ""Part of me wanted this to be true [and all the followers to be real]."" Krebs,who wrote about the experience on his blog,external, immediately suspected he'd been on the receiving end of a bot attack. Bots - automated or semi-automated accounts which tweet or retweet automatically - have been at the centre of allegations of Russian interference in Western elections. US intelligence agencies claim that bots spread false news stories and misinformation during the 2016 presidential election campaign. And networks of bots were also involved in spreading memes, gifs and misinformation in the run-up to the French presidential election in spring 2017. The Russian government denies that they operate or fund bot networks. And there's no definitive evidence connecting botnets, even if they do push pro-Russia stories, to the Kremlin. The pro-Russian bots could be operated, as President Vladimir Putin once put it, by ""patriotic"" Russian citizens acting independently. But why would pro-Russia accounts retweet a message like Krebs' tweet, which runs contrary to their views? My conversations with Guccifer 2.0 Macron Leaks: the anatomy of a hack Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Experts say the bots could be trying to clog up accounts with mentions, or even get their enemies suspended from the social network. When Joseph Cox, a journalist for the liberal news site The Daily Beast, posted about a story he wrote about pro-Russian bots, he was hit with a similar flood of retweets. His account was briefly suspended. Twitter prohibits bots and told Trending it is expanding its efforts dedicated to fighting the automated accounts. At the same time the company says it can't get specific about the tools it uses to detect bots, because that would allow bot makers to find a way around them. Another researcher who has been targeted by the automated accounts is Ben Nimmo, research fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab - part of the Atlantic Council, an American think tank. After the violence arounda far-right rally and counter-protests in Charlottesville, Virginiain August, Nimmo published a report comparing far-right commentators in the US with pro-Kremlin commentators who wrote about the war in Ukraine. The report was picked up by investigative website ProPublica, and a Twitter account with a tiny following sent out a message accusing ProPublica of being an ""altleft hate group"". The message was retweeted thousands of times. ""This was a classic obvious bot operation where the first account to do so had only posted 12 times in its entire life, it was only following six accounts and yet suddenly after this original tweet it got 23,000 retweets,"" Nimmo says. ""There's no way that's a natural pattern of behaviour."" Nimmo says there's several motivations behind a bot attack. Listen toBBC Trendingon the BBC World Service. The latest programmecan be streamed here, and you can also download theTrending podcast. ""Partly it's a simple intimidation technique,"" Nimmo says. ""The other thing is that it makes it very hard for you to use your Twitter notifications because they're just getting overwhelmed."" And the bots weren't done. After Nimmo published his findings about ProPublica, he was targeted by several accounts - one of which faked his death with a message which read: ""Our beloved friend and colleague Ben Nimmo passed away this morning."" ""Now that didn't really upset me - I knew I was alive,"" he told Trending. ""But it certainly startled a number of my friends and that was a much more sinister development. Again that tweet was retweeted something like 23,000 times by the same botnet."" Nimmo also noticed that the bots seemed to be triggered by some key words, so he put several of the triggers in a tweet along with the user name of the Twitter support team. Tens of thousands of the bots retweeted the message, exposing themselves to Twitter support. In less than two days, more than 70,000 appeared to have been taken offline. However, Nimmo and other experts say there could be millions of automated accounts still operating on the social network.

Football manager in drink-driving arrest,"Michael O'Neill has enjoyed a successful five-and-a-half-year tenure as Northern Ireland manager Northern Ireland's football team manager, Michael O'Neill, has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. He was detained by police on the outskirts of Edinburgh on Sunday. Police Scotland said they arrested and charged a 48-year-old man in connection with drink-driving eastbound on the A720 at about 00.55 BST on Sunday. He is due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on 10 October, two days after Northern Ireland's final World Cup qualifier match against Norway. In a statement, the Irish Football Association (IFA) said it was ""aware of an alleged drink-driving incident involving Michael O'Neill"". The IFA added that it was a ""police matter"" and would make no further comment,after the story first appeared in the Scottish Sun,external. Mr O'Neill became manager of the Northern Ireland international football team in February 2012. He has enjoyed considerable success during his five-and-a-half-year tenure, guiding the team to their first ever European Championship finals last year. Under his leadership, Northern Ireland made it through to the last 16. Michael O'Neill was lauded after taking his side - featuring Steven Davies - to the Euro 2016 finals A few months before the team travelled to France for the Euro finals, Mr O'Neillsigned a new four-year contract with the IFA. His success has continued into the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign. The team is currently second in their qualifying group after a string of impressive results. Both of their final two qualifiers - at home to Germany on 5 October and away to Norway on 8 October - take place in the week before Mr O'Neill's court case. During his playing career, Mr O'Neill won 33 caps for Northern Ireland and scored seven international goals. The midfielder started out playing for Irish League club Coleraine and went on to play for Newcastle United, Dundee United and Hibernian. When he hung up his boots, he entered management as an assistant at Cowdenbeath in Scotland, before taking charge of another Scottish side, Brechin City. In 2008, he was appointed manager of Dublin team, Shamrock Rovers, and guided them to successive League of Ireland titles in 2010 and 2011. He made history by becoming the first manager of a League of Ireland team to reach the group stages of the Europa League.

Monster 'fatberg' found blocking sewer,"This video can not be played The fatberg was filmed by Thames Water engineers who are trying to remove the blockage A 250-metre long fatberg weighing 130 tonnes has been found blocking a sewer. The solid mass of congealed fat, wet wipes, nappies, oil and condoms formed in the Victorian-era tunnel in Whitechapel, London. Thames Water described it as one of the largest it had seen and said it would take three weeks to remove. The company's head of waste networks Matt Rimmer said: ""It's a total monster and taking a lot of manpower and machinery to remove as it's set hard."" What causes fatbergs? The company says fatbergs form when people put things they shouldn't down sinks and toilets. This video can not be played What causes fatbergs? ""It's basically like trying to break up concrete,"" Mr Rimmer said. ""It's frustrating as these situations are totally avoidable and caused by fat, oil and grease being washed down sinks and wipes flushed down the loo. ""The sewers are not an abyss for household rubbish and our message to everyone is clear - please bin it - don't block it."" The fatberg is about as heavy as 11 double decker buses. Work at Whitechapel Road to remove the immense fatberg started this week. Eight workers will break up the mass with high-pressure hoses, suck up the pieces into tankers and take it to a recycling site in Stratford. In 2013, Thames Water found abus-size fatbergin a sewer in Kingston-upon-Thames. A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council said: ""We know this is a major issue across London. ""We have set up a waste oil collection point with Truman Brewery in Brick Lane, and strongly encourage businesses to set up collection contracts for their waste oil with companies for recycling.""

Nadine Coyle: Girls Aloud split was 'silly',"Nadine has recorded a new album with Girls Aloud's ""mad scientist"" Brian Higgins ""My favourite smell is bleach,"" says Nadine Coyle. ""If I walk into the house and there's things being bleached, it just makes me feel at home, euphoric almost."" She pauses and laughs. ""I can't believe we're having a whole discussion about bleach. Real pop star things!"" The topic has come up because Coyle's new song,Go To Work,external, is a withering riposte to a lover who's not pulling their weight. ""Tell me what I got to do / To get you up in the morning?"" she sings over an infectious house piano. ""Why don't you go to work?"" The song sees the 32-year-old reunited with Xenomania, the songwriting geniuses behind her old band Girls Aloud. Together they scored 21 Top 10 singles, more than any other female band in history, before calling it a day in 2013.  (Coyle says the split was ""silly"" and refused to put her name to it. But more on that later.) ""LA is a beautiful place, but it doesn't feel like real life,"" says the singer Go To Work was inspired, says Coyle, by ""general annoyance"" with people ""who just don't do anything"" to help out, at home or at work. But she's quick to point out the lyrics have nothing to do with her partner, American Football player Jason Bell. ""It's funny, we were watching this programme,Married to a Celebrity,external, the other night, and people had to write lists of whinges about their partner. ""I said to Jason, 'what would we write on our lists?' and he said, 'I wouldn't write anything.' ""I was like, 'that's a good answer. Well done, Jason!' ""We live really well together,"" she adds. ""He doesn't cook and he doesn't clean, but he makes really good coffees."" Home life has been Coyle's priority since Girls Aloud split in 2013. She moved back to Northern Ireland after nine years in Los Angeles to raise her three-year-old daughter Anaiya. Now, though, she's all fired up and ready to return to the charts. Nadine's first solo record was released, somewhat disastrously,in partnership with Tesco. Six years on she's signed a deal with Virgin EMI, home to Justin Bieber and Katy Perry, and says there's already a ""four-single plan"" for her new album. Coyle had almost 100 songs to choose from, recorded over a two-year period in Brighton. The overwhelming theme, she says, is feel-good pop. ""We're not trying to change the world. There's enough people trying to do that,"" she explains. ""We just want songs you can put on and have fun, that make your day better for those three minutes"". Girls Aloud at the start of their career (L-R): Sarah Harding, Cheryl, Nicola Roberts, Nadine and Kimberley Walsh Born and raised in Derry, Northern Ireland, Coyle first came to attention in 2001 on the Irish version of reality show Pop Stars. She made it through to the final band, Six. But then it was discovered she was 16, two years below the show's age limit, and had been lying throughout the audition process. The revelation saw her make a tearful exit from the competition. But Louis Walsh, a judge on the series, kept in touch and encouraged the singer to audition for ITV's Pop Stars: The Rivals in 2002. She was thethird member to be selected,externalfor Girls Aloud, joining Cheryl Tweedy (as she was then), Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh and Sarah Harding. What followed were some of the best, most unconventional pop hits of the 21st Century. Biology,external, for example, took two minutes and five (five!)musical movements to get to the chorus, whileSexy... No! No! No!,externalgrafted a lyric about sexual liberation onto a '70s heavy metal sample. The singer says her new album is ""all uptempo"", despite her love of big R&B ballads To begin with, Coyle was very much seen as the star. ""She's the one with the big solo career,"" Louis Walsh told the BBC in an (unpublished) interview from 2005. ""All she wants to do is sing. ""She's kind of lost in the group really, because no one knows how good she is. But if they were the Supremes, she would be Diana Ross."" It didn't quite turn out like that. When Cheryl signed up for X Factor, she began to eclipse her bandmates. On later Girls Aloud albums, she received a bigger share of the lead vocals. And it was Cheryl's solo career, not Coyle's, that produced platinum albums and number one singles. But there was no bad blood, and Coyle happily signed up for a Girls Aloud reunion tour in 2013 - an experience that nearly ended in disaster when a floating platform malfunctioned during rehearsals. ""We came down on the platform and it tilted and nearly tipped us off,"" she recalls. ""We were all screaming and clinging on for dear life. Thankfully, we were all fine."" The band won a Brit Award in 2009 for their number one single The Promise The tour was a huge success. After 20 dates, though, the band called it a day, announcing their split in abrief tweet,external. The statement was famously issued against Coyle's wishes. Informed of the decision just 20 minutes before they were due on stage for their final show, Coyle refused to sign a contract formalising their separation. ""I was in my robe and I'd got my hair and make-up on, and I was like, 'What? Everybody wants to do that?' And they said, 'Yes, everybody'. ""I thought it was silly. Why would you want to do that?  I thought everybody was tired because it was the end of the tour and they'd change their minds. ""Then they said, 'We're going to put out a statement' - and it was a tweet. ""I thought, 'What?What?! We came back with apress conference, and you're going to end 10 years with a tweet? Then remove my name completely from the whole thing. I do not agree with any of this.'"" The statement may have gone out but, to this day, Coyle has not put pen to paper - technically making her the sole remaining member of the band. ""I'm not saying that!"" she guffaws. ""You know that's what the headline will be! 'Nadine says sheisGirls Aloud!'"" But she's still in touch with the rest of the band, and says she voted ""all day"" for Sarah Harding to win the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother. The role of Erin was ""one of the best jobs I've had in my life,"" says Coyle Following the band's split and the birth of her daughter, Coyle signed up to appear as Erin the Goddess in Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance - finding herself dumbstruck by the dancers' physical prowess. ""It's like a sport,"" she says. ""When they were getting ready for the big finale, they would literally jump way above the height of me, just to get themselves pumped up. ""They were like gazelles, then they'd run on stage."" Did she ever harbour ambitions to join in? ""Are you joking?"" she laughs. ""I tried Irish dancing when I was younger but I wasn't any good. I just thought, 'this is a waste of time.'"" No, singing has always been in her blood - from her early days in a local restaurant called The Drunken Duck, all the way to Wembley Stadium. You get the sense that nothing makes her happier than being in the vocal booth, running through scales and recording harmonies. Making the new album with Xenomania supremo Brian Higgins, she says, pushed herself to discover new shades and tones to her voice. ""Brian would say, 'Oh, there's a lot to get through - we've got 25 vocal parts to record, but we'll do it over two or three days'. ""And I'd be like, 'No, we'll get this done in two hours.' ""You have to get into a zone where you're so focused that you're hearing melodies you've never heard before."" Nadine's Uber rating is going to suffer if she leaves a mark on that door Coyle says her favourite songs on the record include Girls On Fire, a celebration of strong women, and I Fall, ""which is about feeling connected to somebody, even when you're not in the same room."" Soon enough, though, she's back to talking about domestic life and describing how she pined for the Irish winter when she was out in America. ""I love being at home and hearing the rain on the window,"" she says. ""I missed that cosiness."" Nor was she impressed by LA's health-conscious food trends. ""You know how everybody's into this 'fresh from the farm' organic produce? That's how we grew up! ""You went to the farm to pick up your eggs and your potatoes. We were on that years ago - now it's trendy!"" If her music's as ahead of the curve as her diet, we're sure to be hearing a lot more from Nadine Coyle over the next 12 months.

RSC founder Sir Peter Hall dies at 86,"Sir Peter Hall staged premieres of Waiting for Godot and Homecoming Sir Peter Hall, the founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company and former National Theatre director, has died at the age of 86. He died on Monday at University College hospital in London, surrounded by his family, the National Theatre said. During his career he staged the English language premiere of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot and the world premiere of Harold Pinter's Homecoming. Sir Peter had been diagnosed with dementia in 2011. Obituary: A giant of British theatre Sir Peter on the BBC Arts archive What it's like directing your daughter Sir Peter with his wife Nicki and daughter Rebecca at the London Evening Standard Theatre Awards Sir Peter became director of the National in 1973 and was responsible for the theatre's move from the Old Vic to the purpose-built complex on the South Bank. He founded the RSC at the age of just 29 in 1960 and led the company until 1968. Tributes have been paid to Sir Peter by many in the theatre world. Speaking toRadio 4's World at One, actress Vanessa Redgrave described Sir Peter as ""a very extraordinary, interesting and fascinating director"". ""He was very mischievous, very handsome, an extremely attractive man who everyone fell in love with... he was everything really, a kind of Shelley in the theatre."" Actor Sir Michael Gambon said Sir Peter ""never stopped working"". Several stars have credited Sir Peter with helping launch their careers, Sir Patrick Stewart being among them.

Playwright Sir David Hare also praised Sir Peter for his legacy. This video can not be played ""He was fearless about giving young people their head,"" says playwright David Hare Rufus Norris, current director of the National Theatre, said: 'We all stand on the shoulders of giants and Peter Hall's shoulders supported the entirety of British theatre as we know it. ""All of us, including those in the new generation of theatre-makers not immediately touched by his influence, are in his debt. His legendary tenacity and vision created an extraordinary and lasting legacy for us all."" Sir Peter Hall was, in many ways, the single most influential figure in British theatre in the second half of the 20th Century. Not just because he was the man who launched Beckett in Britain, or founded the Royal Shakespeare Company, or transformed the National Theatre from a niche affair operating out of the Old Vic into a three-stage, globally respected, highly ambitious production house - all of which were great achievements. But what really made him special was what he did for others - the way in which he helped playwrights, actors and fellow directors flourish. Read more from Will Gompertz. Other former National Theatre directors lined up to pay tribute. Sir Nicholas Hytner said: ""Peter Hall was one of the great figures in British theatrical history, up there in a line of impresarios that stretches back to [Richard] Burbage. ""He was the great theatrical buccaneer of the 20th Century and has left a permanent mark on our culture."" Sir Peter's career spanned more than half a century Sir Trevor Nunn described Sir Peter as ""not only a thrilling and penetrating director, he was also the great impresario of the age"". And Sir Richard Eyre said Sir Peter ""was - and is - the godfather (in both senses) of British theatre"". Greg Doran, director of the RSC, said of his predecessor: ""Sir Peter Hall was a colossus, bestriding the British theatre. He was a visionary. ""Not only was he a great director of theatre and opera, he was a politician who fought for the arts... his greatest legacy without doubt will be judged to be the formation of the Royal Shakespeare Company."" Dame Judi Dench worked with Sir Peter Hall many times After leaving the National Theatre in 1988, Sir Peter formed the Peter Hall Company (1988 - 2011) and in 2003 became the founding director of the Rose Theatre Kingston. Throughout his career, Sir Peter was also a champion of public funding for the arts. His other works included the London and Broadway premieres of Alan Ayckbourn's Bedroom Farce (1977) and the 1987 production of Antony and Cleopatra, starring Dame Judi Dench and Anthony Hopkins. Sir Peter directed his daughter Rebecca Hall in Twelfth Night He also directed his daughter, the actress Rebecca Hall, in a 2003 production of Shakespeare's As You Like It. Sir Peter's last production at the National Theatre was Twelfth Night in 2011. He was also a renowned opera director and was the artistic director of Glyndebourne Festival Opera between 1984 and 1990. Gus Christie, Glyndebourne's executive chairman, said in a statement: ""It was a golden era for Glyndebourne when Peter was artistic director. He was loved by both audiences and artists. The productions he created were timeless."" In 1983, Sir Peter staged Wagner's Ring Cycle in Bayreuth, Germany, to honour the 100th anniversary of the composer's death. Sir Peter is survived by his wife Nicki, children Christopher, Jennifer, Edward, Lucy, Rebecca and Emma, and nine grandchildren. His former wives Leslie Caron, Jacqueline Taylor and Maria Ewing also survive him. There will be a private family funeral, with details of a memorial service to be announced at a later date.

The collapse of Northern Rock: Ten years on,"Northern Rock was a key sponsor for Newcastle United In the summer of 2007, Newcastle had much to look forward to. The Toon - Newcastle United - had a new owner, the billionaire retail tycoon Mike Ashley, and much was expected under the management of Sam Allardyce. The performance of the team's shirt sponsor, Northern Rock, was a source of pride; after decades of hard times following the end of shipbuilding and mining, the North East had a new economic champion, one that was giving the financial services giants of the South a real run for their money. The former building society had demutualised and scaled the heights of the FTSE 100, the elite club of Britain's biggest quoted companies, and in the process had become the fourth biggest bank in the UK by share of lending. Bank bailout 'should have been secret' How the crisis improved savings safety 'That was chilling': The financial crash remembered The chairman, Matt Ridley, summed it up in the annual report, lauding ""another excellent year"" and said ""our strategy of using growth, cost efficiency and credit quality to reward both shareholders and customers continues to run well."" A few months later, Northern Rock's empire was in ruins. The fuel it had used to grow so quickly turned out to be toxic. Northern Rock had borrowed heavily on the international money markets Rather than using customer deposits as the source of funds to lend out to homeowners, it borrowed in the international money markets. When the sub-prime crisis hit America, those markets took fright, and stopped lending to anything that looked like it might be over-exposed to the housing market. Northern Rock was an obvious first casualty. The BBC broke the news that it needed Bank of England support 10 years ago tomorrow, and the day after there were queues outside branches, the first run on a British bank in 150 years. After limping on for a few more months, Northern Rock was nationalised in February 2008. Councillor Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle City Council, remembers walking out of the civic offices to nearby Northumberland Street where Northern Rock had its main city centre branch. ""There was a queue outside going right down the street. That really was the first sign that something was wrong. No-one really saw it coming."" Customers queued for hours to take out their savings Northern Rock's demise - it was split into ""bad"" and ""good"" sets of assets and operations, with Virgin Money buying the latter - was a shock to the region's economy, as was the banking crisis that followed. ""We were early into recession and late out,"" said Mr Forbes.  ""It's only now really that we have recaptured that lost ground."" About 2,500 jobs were lost. There was another heavy blow, little understood outside the North East - the loss of the Northern Rock Foundation, a charitable trust which received 5% of the bank's profits each year. Many who lost their savings want the government to change its mind on compensation It had given Â£235m to good causes before the bank was nationalised and broken up. Mr Forbes is now pressing the Treasury to give back some of the profits it expects to make from its intervention on Northern Rock to make up for the loss of the foundation. Northern Rock shareholders are also making a claim on the potential profits, which independent experts think could eventually reach about Â£8bn. An association of small shareholders, many of whom lost their life savings when the bank was nationalised, has asked the chancellor to think again on compensation, which has been denied before. Any surplus from Northern Rock's privatisation should go to taxpayers, says the Treasury Jon Wood, a fund manager who was a big Northern Rock shareholder and has been severely critical of the Bank of England's action, is also thought be to considering fresh legal action. The Treasury has said that any surplus from the Northern Rock nationalisation should compensate taxpayers for the amounts risked in the rescue. A decade on, important strands of ""the run on the Rock"" story are only now being uncovered. In an interview with the BBC Gary Hoffman, who was parachuted in as chief executive after privatisation, said he found an organisation with an unquestioning - and unhappy - culture. ""The management had completely lost touch with the coal face,  and did not know what was happening. There was an attitude that you did not question what was going on, which was a tragedy because there were extremely good people at the bank."" Hoffman reveals that the Treasury had considered all options for the future of the bank when he was in charge - not just a sale to a banking rival, but also a refloating of the bank as an independent business, and its complete run-down and closure. The collapse was the first sign in Britain of the coming global financial crisis Other senior banking sources have told the BBC that the last option - closure - was the favourite right up until Christmas Eve 2008, when the bank's leadership was able to convince the Treasury it could be sold as a going concern. Mr Hoffman says that the UK's banking sector is now safer than in the run-up to the crisis, with greater capital reserves at the big institutions. Others disagree, however, saying the increases have been largely illusory. Kevin Dowd, professor of finance and economics at the University of Durham, says changes in bank regulations have not greatly improved banks' resilience. ""The Bank of England looks at the book value of bank assets - the value that they themselves put on their assets. But if you look at the stock market, investors don't believe it because most of our big banks have stock market values less than their book values.""

Nadine Coyle on life after Girls Aloud,"Nadine has recorded a new album with Girls Aloud's ""mad scientist"" Brian Higgins ""My favourite smell is bleach,"" says Nadine Coyle. ""If I walk into the house and there's things being bleached, it just makes me feel at home, euphoric almost."" She pauses and laughs. ""I can't believe we're having a whole discussion about bleach. Real pop star things!"" The topic has come up because Coyle's new song,Go To Work,external, is a withering riposte to a lover who's not pulling their weight. ""Tell me what I got to do / To get you up in the morning?"" she sings over an infectious house piano. ""Why don't you go to work?"" The song sees the 32-year-old reunited with Xenomania, the songwriting geniuses behind her old band Girls Aloud. Together they scored 21 Top 10 singles, more than any other female band in history, before calling it a day in 2013.  (Coyle says the split was ""silly"" and refused to put her name to it. But more on that later.) ""LA is a beautiful place, but it doesn't feel like real life,"" says the singer Go To Work was inspired, says Coyle, by ""general annoyance"" with people ""who just don't do anything"" to help out, at home or at work. But she's quick to point out the lyrics have nothing to do with her partner, American Football player Jason Bell. ""It's funny, we were watching this programme,Married to a Celebrity,external, the other night, and people had to write lists of whinges about their partner. ""I said to Jason, 'what would we write on our lists?' and he said, 'I wouldn't write anything.' ""I was like, 'that's a good answer. Well done, Jason!' ""We live really well together,"" she adds. ""He doesn't cook and he doesn't clean, but he makes really good coffees."" Home life has been Coyle's priority since Girls Aloud split in 2013. She moved back to Northern Ireland after nine years in Los Angeles to raise her three-year-old daughter Anaiya. Now, though, she's all fired up and ready to return to the charts. Nadine's first solo record was released, somewhat disastrously,in partnership with Tesco. Six years on she's signed a deal with Virgin EMI, home to Justin Bieber and Katy Perry, and says there's already a ""four-single plan"" for her new album. Coyle had almost 100 songs to choose from, recorded over a two-year period in Brighton. The overwhelming theme, she says, is feel-good pop. ""We're not trying to change the world. There's enough people trying to do that,"" she explains. ""We just want songs you can put on and have fun, that make your day better for those three minutes"". Girls Aloud at the start of their career (L-R): Sarah Harding, Cheryl, Nicola Roberts, Nadine and Kimberley Walsh Born and raised in Derry, Northern Ireland, Coyle first came to attention in 2001 on the Irish version of reality show Pop Stars. She made it through to the final band, Six. But then it was discovered she was 16, two years below the show's age limit, and had been lying throughout the audition process. The revelation saw her make a tearful exit from the competition. But Louis Walsh, a judge on the series, kept in touch and encouraged the singer to audition for ITV's Pop Stars: The Rivals in 2002. She was thethird member to be selected,externalfor Girls Aloud, joining Cheryl Tweedy (as she was then), Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh and Sarah Harding. What followed were some of the best, most unconventional pop hits of the 21st Century. Biology,external, for example, took two minutes and five (five!)musical movements to get to the chorus, whileSexy... No! No! No!,externalgrafted a lyric about sexual liberation onto a '70s heavy metal sample. The singer says her new album is ""all uptempo"", despite her love of big R&B ballads To begin with, Coyle was very much seen as the star. ""She's the one with the big solo career,"" Louis Walsh told the BBC in an (unpublished) interview from 2005. ""All she wants to do is sing. ""She's kind of lost in the group really, because no one knows how good she is. But if they were the Supremes, she would be Diana Ross."" It didn't quite turn out like that. When Cheryl signed up for X Factor, she began to eclipse her bandmates. On later Girls Aloud albums, she received a bigger share of the lead vocals. And it was Cheryl's solo career, not Coyle's, that produced platinum albums and number one singles. But there was no bad blood, and Coyle happily signed up for a Girls Aloud reunion tour in 2013 - an experience that nearly ended in disaster when a floating platform malfunctioned during rehearsals. ""We came down on the platform and it tilted and nearly tipped us off,"" she recalls. ""We were all screaming and clinging on for dear life. Thankfully, we were all fine."" The band won a Brit Award in 2009 for their number one single The Promise The tour was a huge success. After 20 dates, though, the band called it a day, announcing their split in abrief tweet,external. The statement was famously issued against Coyle's wishes. Informed of the decision just 20 minutes before they were due on stage for their final show, Coyle refused to sign a contract formalising their separation. ""I was in my robe and I'd got my hair and make-up on, and I was like, 'What? Everybody wants to do that?' And they said, 'Yes, everybody'. ""I thought it was silly. Why would you want to do that?  I thought everybody was tired because it was the end of the tour and they'd change their minds. ""Then they said, 'We're going to put out a statement' - and it was a tweet. ""I thought, 'What?What?! We came back with apress conference, and you're going to end 10 years with a tweet? Then remove my name completely from the whole thing. I do not agree with any of this.'"" The statement may have gone out but, to this day, Coyle has not put pen to paper - technically making her the sole remaining member of the band. ""I'm not saying that!"" she guffaws. ""You know that's what the headline will be! 'Nadine says sheisGirls Aloud!'"" But she's still in touch with the rest of the band, and says she voted ""all day"" for Sarah Harding to win the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother. The role of Erin was ""one of the best jobs I've had in my life,"" says Coyle Following the band's split and the birth of her daughter, Coyle signed up to appear as Erin the Goddess in Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance - finding herself dumbstruck by the dancers' physical prowess. ""It's like a sport,"" she says. ""When they were getting ready for the big finale, they would literally jump way above the height of me, just to get themselves pumped up. ""They were like gazelles, then they'd run on stage."" Did she ever harbour ambitions to join in? ""Are you joking?"" she laughs. ""I tried Irish dancing when I was younger but I wasn't any good. I just thought, 'this is a waste of time.'"" No, singing has always been in her blood - from her early days in a local restaurant called The Drunken Duck, all the way to Wembley Stadium. You get the sense that nothing makes her happier than being in the vocal booth, running through scales and recording harmonies. Making the new album with Xenomania supremo Brian Higgins, she says, pushed herself to discover new shades and tones to her voice. ""Brian would say, 'Oh, there's a lot to get through - we've got 25 vocal parts to record, but we'll do it over two or three days'. ""And I'd be like, 'No, we'll get this done in two hours.' ""You have to get into a zone where you're so focused that you're hearing melodies you've never heard before."" Nadine's Uber rating is going to suffer if she leaves a mark on that door Coyle says her favourite songs on the record include Girls On Fire, a celebration of strong women, and I Fall, ""which is about feeling connected to somebody, even when you're not in the same room."" Soon enough, though, she's back to talking about domestic life and describing how she pined for the Irish winter when she was out in America. ""I love being at home and hearing the rain on the window,"" she says. ""I missed that cosiness."" Nor was she impressed by LA's health-conscious food trends. ""You know how everybody's into this 'fresh from the farm' organic produce? That's how we grew up! ""You went to the farm to pick up your eggs and your potatoes. We were on that years ago - now it's trendy!"" If her music's as ahead of the curve as her diet, we're sure to be hearing a lot more from Nadine Coyle over the next 12 months.

UN imposes new sanctions on North Korea,"North Korea says it has developed and tested a hydrogen bomb The United Nations has imposed a fresh round of sanctions on North Korea after its sixth and largest nuclear test. The measures restrict oil imports and ban textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The US had originally proposed harsher sanctions including a total ban on oil imports. Pyongyang said it ""categorically rejected"" what it called an ""illegal"" resolution. North Korea's ambassador to the UN, Han Tae Song, told a conference in Geneva: ""The forthcoming measures by DPRK [the Democratic Republic of Korea] will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history.""

The US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, told the Security Council after the vote: ""We don't take pleasure in further strengthening sanctions today. We are not looking for war.""

Both Russia and China reiterated their proposal that the US and South Korea freeze all military drills - which anger North Korea - and asked for a halt in the deployment of the controversial anti-missile system Thaad, in exchange for Pyongyang's cessation of its weapons programmes. Beijing believes Thaad, which employs a powerful radar, is a security threat to China and neighbouring countries. Ms Haley last week dismissed this proposal as ""insulting"".

Cassini turns towards its death plunge,"Methane rains out of Titan's orange sky The international Cassini spacecraft at Saturn has executed the course correction that will send it to destruction at the end of the week. The probe flew within 120,000km of the giant moon Titan on Monday - an encounter that bent its trajectory just enough to put it on a collision path with the ringed planet. Nothing can now stop the death plunge in Saturn's atmosphere on Friday. Cassini will be torn to pieces as it heads down towards the clouds. Its components will melt and be dispersed through the planet's gases. Titan's surface: Pebbles rounded by the action of a flowing liquid Ever since it arrived at Saturn 13 years ago, the probe has used the gravity of Titan - the second biggest moon in the Solar System - to slingshot itself into different positions from which to study the planet and its stunning rings. It has been a smart strategy because Cassini would otherwise have had to fire up its propulsion system and drain its fuel reserves every time it wanted to make a big change in direction. As it is, those propellants are almost exhausted and Nasa is determined the spacecraft will not be permitted to just drift around Saturn uncontrolled; it must be disposed of properly and fully. The agency called Monday's last encounter with Titan the ""kiss goodbye"". ""Cassini has been in a long-term relationship with Titan, with a new rendezvous nearly every month for more than a decade,"" said Earl Maize, the Cassini project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ""This final encounter is something of a bittersweet goodbye, but as it has done throughout the mission, Titan's gravity is once again sending Cassini where we need it to go."" Closest approach to the moon's surface occurred at 19:04 GMT (20:04 BST; 15:04 EDT; 12:04 PDT). As the probe passed Titan, it gathered some images and other science data that will be streamed back to Earth on Tuesday. The investigation of the 5,150km-wide moon has been one of the outstanding successes of the Cassini mission. The spacecraft put a small robot called Huygens on its surface in 2005. It returned a remarkable image of rounded pebbles that had been smoothed by the action of flowing liquid methane. This hydrocarbon rains from Titan's orange sky and runs into huge seas at northern latitudes. Cassini also spied what are presumed to be volcanoes that spew an icy slush and vast dunes made from a plastic-like sand. Cassini began its study of the ringed planet in 2004 Cassini turns towards its death plunge Cassini scientist Michelle Dougherty from Imperial College London, UK, says there will be an effort in the days up to Friday to try to squeeze out every last scientific observation. ""We're now running on fumes,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science programme. ""The fact that we've got as far as we have, so close to the end of mission, is spectacular. We're almost there and it's going to be really sad watching it happen."" Besides a last look at Titan, scientists want to get a few more pictures of the rings and the moon Enceladus, before then configuring the spacecraft for its dramatic scuttling. The idea is to use only those instruments at the end that can sense Saturn's near-space environment, such as its magnetic field, or can sample the composition of its gases. In the final three hours or so before ""impact"" on Friday, all data acquired by the spacecraft will be relayed straight to Earth, bypassing the onboard solid state memory. Contact with the probe after it has entered the atmosphere will be short, measured perhaps in a few tens of seconds. The signal at Earth is expected to drop off around 11:55 GMT (12:55 BST; 07:55 EDT; 04:55 PDT). Engineers will be able to be more precise once they have looked at the position of the probe after Monday's change in course. ""The Cassini mission has taught us so very much, and to me personally I find great comfort from the fact that Cassini will continue teaching us right up to the very last seconds,"" said Curt Niebur, the Cassini programme scientist at Nasa Headquarters in Washington, DC. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a joint endeavour of Nasa, and the European and Italian space agencies. BBC News will have live coverage of the ending of the mission on both TV and radio.Inside Sciencewill preview the climax this Thursday at 16:30 BST on Radio 4.A Horizon documentarywill also review the mission and the final hours in a special programme to be broadcast on Monday 18 September at 21:00 BST on BBC Two.

The teen actors gaining plaudits in Toronto,"Madison Wolfe (left) and Sydney Wade star in Anders Walter's I Kill Giants It's not often you ask an actor how they felt about working with their co-star and they reply: ""We hated each other."" Fortunately Madison Wolfe is only kidding, and she and Sydney Wade collapse into giggles as they explain how close they grew on the set of their new movie I Kill Giants. ""At the beginning of production we were just kind of polite to each other or whatever, but by the end we were really good friends,"" 14-year-old Madison says. Her co-star Sydney, 15, picks up: ""By the time we finished we were roasting each other, 'I don't like your shoes', 'Oh yeah, well I don't like your hair!' ""But honestly all jokes aside... she's an okay person."" The pair descend into more laughter. The duo struck up a firm friendship on set By quite some distance, Sydney and Madison must be two of the youngest movie stars at this year's Toronto Film Festival. But they're not exactly newcomers to the industry. ""I've been acting since I was four, so 11 years now,"" Sydney explains. ""Building up to this film was a very difficult process for me, it was challenging. I had to graft. I was doing non-speaking roles, non-paid roles. I didn't mind what I did as long as I was doing what I loved. ""But when I got on to I Kill Giants I thought 'this is it - this is everything that I wanted.'"" Wolfe plays the introverted Barbara in I Kill Giants Similarly, audiences (and horror fans in particular) may have already seen films starring Madison without even realising it. ""A lot of people saw me in The Conjuring, that was probably my biggest role so far,"" she says. ""But people didn't realise that I'd been working for almost six years before that. It takes a long time."" Madison and Sydney's new film I Kill Giants is the big-screen adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name by Joe Kelly and Ken Niimura. It tells the story of Barbara (Madison), a young girl who escapes to her own imaginary world to deal with the grief and trauma of something she's experiencing at home. Sydney plays Sophia, an English girl to whom Barbara somewhat reluctantly grows close through the course of the film. The young actress and the character she plays are both from Leeds - but there's little hint of a northern accent. L-R: Rory Jackson, Madison Wolfe, Imogen Poots, director Anders Walter and Sydney Wade ""We did try a stronger accent, but we thought, for the film to go globally, it's very hard for some people to understand the Leeds accent, because it can be really strong,"" Sydney says. She has a point. ""But I'm kind of neutral. I'm not RP [received pronunciation], I'm not from London or anything, so my own accent is quite plain, and you can understand it. ""I feel like it works well with Madison's accent too, which isn't too strong American."" Madison's character is far from your stereotypical teen girl heroine. She's a social outcast at school, dresses awkwardly and is generally quite eccentric and introverted - quite the opposite of Madison's outgoing real-life personality. ""Getting to play a character that's so different from myself is so cool,"" the actress says. Zoe Saldana plays Barbara's school psychologist in the film ""I don't dress like her or anything or wear bunny ears, but this is why I love acting so much, you can be anyone you want to be. ""Barbara being so scruffy and hard, it kind of betrays that she has a bit of a shell on her and she is kind of an introvert."" The film is directed by Anders Walter and also stars Imogen Poots and Zoe Saldana. Working on major film projects like this must be quite exhausting when you've got homework and exams to worry about, right? ""It's my last year at school, so I'm trying to pass through that,"" Sydney says. ""I tried a private school which worked really well, but towards the end I was struggling to manage both because I had loads of lessons. ""And then I did a year of home schooling, which was easier in terms of going off to work, but it was harder in terms of learning exactly what you needed to. ""So now I'm back at school, who are just incredible. They're so lenient with me going off and everything."" Madison and Sydney clearly have a long and bright future in film ahead of them - and when asked which other actresses they look up to, they're both full of names. Sydney cites Chloe Grace Moretz and Nicole Kidman as her acting inspirations ""One of the biggest icons I have is Meryl Streep,"" Madison says instantly. ""If I ever met her I think I would die. ""But I also love Natalie Portman, Emma Roberts, Margot Robbie - there's so many."" Sydney adds: ""I really appreciate Chloe Grace Moretz, I think she's a really great, interesting actor. And she's really diverse with everything she does. ""And Nicole Kidman, I saw her yesterday, very close-up! They are my top two."" Kidman is just one of several Hollywood A-listers Madison and Sydney have been rubbing shoulders with while in Toronto. Promotion and film festivals can be overwhelming, especially at such a young age, but it's a process the pair are clearly enjoying. ""It's quite rewarding, everyone worked so hard on this film,"" Madison says. ""You see all the reviews and people wanting to know more about it, it's just great - you feel like you've really accomplished something."" The same photographers who have mostly spent their time chasing Matt Damon, Jennifer Lawrence and George Clooney around Toronto this week could well be turning their attention to Madison and Sydney in a few years' time.
