New Covid rules trigger wave of cancellations,"Sleeping Beauty at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh wraps up early on Christmas Eve Scotland's new Covid rules have triggered a wave of cancellations across the country. Edinburgh's Hogmanayevents have already been called off and the popular panto season is ending prematurely. TheIrn-Bru Carnival, billed as the biggest indoor attraction of its kind in Europe, will now finish on Christmas Eve instead of 16 January. And Scottish Premiership clubs have beenasked to voteon when the winter break should be introduced. Meanwhile the Scottish government has confirmed details of a Â£21m support package for organisations and freelancers who have been hit hard by the fresh restrictions. Under new rules designed to slow the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, all outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people from Boxing Day. Indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing. Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened Crowds vastly reduced for Scottish sport Edinburgh cancellation 'incredibly sad' Table service and 1m social distancing will return to the hospitality sector from 27 December. All the new restrictions will be in place for three weeks - although there will be no limit to how many people can meet up at Christmas. Bar owner Jo De Sylva said trade has been hit hard by the restrictions Jo De Sylva, owner of MacGregor's Bar in Inverness, said the new rules meant there would be fewer tables, fewer seats, and fewer people coming through the door. ""Clearly that is going to affect the income we are going to get over this festive period,"" she said. ""Traditionally, this is a busy period for us but now it is not going to be any different than a Tuesday night in November."" Among events set to be affected by the restrictions are theOld Firm derbyon 2 January and aHearts-Hibs matchthe following day. Meanwhile, crowds at thehorseracing at Kelsoare due to be capped at 500, while meetings atMusselburghandAyrearly next month will be held behind closed doors. The Old Firm match is the most high-profile fixture affected by the new regulations Iain Gordon, of thePavilion Theatre in Glasgow, said the sector would ""just have to get on with it"" but the situation was hugely frustrating for his staff and customers alike. Its panto, The Magical Adventures of Cinderella, will now end its festive run on Friday. Mr Gordon said his theatre has spent at least Â£65,000 on new ventilation measures and air flow monitors in order to meet new Covid guidelines. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We've done it all and it seems like it has all been nothing. Why go through the vaccines, the passports and then you keep doing the same thing. There's going to be a halt on it sometime."" In Edinburgh, the final performance of theSleeping Beauty pantoat theKing's Theatrehas been brought forward to Christmas Eve. TheHydro in Glasgowhas cancelled the Wizard of Oz panto on 28 Dec, a gig by comedian Bill Bailey and the L.O.L Surprise! LIVE event for children.

Tighter restrictions see pub group limits in Wales,"This video can not be played New restrictions for hospitality, retail and workplaces come into force on Boxing Day No more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales from 26 December. Two-metre social distancing rules will also return in public places. Licensed premises will have to offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected. Outdoor events will be limited to 50, with 30 indoors, but no restrictions were brought in for smaller meetings in private homes. First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to limit the amount of socialising they do and take a lateral flow tests before they go to meet other people. Wales' rules for fully-vaccinated people who are a contact of someone with coronavirus have been changed - with a switch to daily testing instead of self-isolation, including for the Omicron variant. Hospitality firms saidthe new hospitality rules could severely hit their businesses. Call to publish updated expert Covid advice Wales records highest number of daily cases Children at risk from Covid to get jab in Wales The changes come amid the spread of Omicron - 301 more cases have been found in Wales, bringing total to 941. But a senior Welsh Conservative warned some may struggle to understand the complexity of the new rules. Wales recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus caseson Wednesday, with 4,662 new cases and three deaths reported by Public Health Wales. Following the announcement, the Wales Millennium Centre and some other theatres announced they would close their doors from 26 December. Cardiff and Swansea's Winter Wonderlands both said they would close from from 20:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. Parkrun, which organises 5km runs every Saturday morning throughout the UK, has cancelled all of its events in Wales from 1 January onwards. However, as Welsh government rules on outdoor gatherings do not include children, junior Parkrun events will not be affected. Pubs face new restrictions - such as the rule of six - after Christmas Mr Drakeford announced the return to somealert level two restrictions,externalat a Welsh government press briefing. From 06:00: Social distancing rules apply in workplaces and public spaces, including cinemas, shops and theatres Restrictions apply in hospitality, including the rule of six for groups of customers, table service and mask wearing Large events will be restricted, with exceptions for smaller sports events where up to 50 spectators can gather, and exceptions for events involving children Nightclubs, originally planned to close on 27 December, will now shut a day earlier. But events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will not be subjected to the same limits. Mr Drakeford said the numbers that could attend sporting events would be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. There will be specific offence for having gatherings of more than 30 people in private homes. The first minister set no end date for the new restrictions but said he wanted them in place for the shortest possible time. New sports rules come into effect from Boxing Day Close contacts of people who have Covid will no longer have to self-isolate, provided they have been fully vaccinated, and will now have to take a lateral flow test instead. For most people, fully-vaccinated means they have had two jabs. Mr Drakeford has not gone as far as England,where people with Covid will now have to self-isolate for seven days instead of 10, providing they have a negative test result. Mr Drakeford said: ""A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious Omicron variant is headed our way. ""This new form of coronavirus could infect large numbers of people in Wales, disrupting daily lives and businesses and could cause an increase in the number of people who need hospital care in the coming weeks."" He said early action was needed to try and control the spread of Omicron, and it was a ""misunderstanding"" to think that if the variant was less severe ""that solves the problem"". ""If Omicron was even half as severe as Delta, because of the extra speed a which it's transmitted, that would buy you 48 hours before you see those numbers of people going in to hospital climb to the very steep numbers we have seen,"" he said. At a recalled Senedd meeting, he later added: ""We are quite definitely not on an unstoppable journey to lockdown."" Cardiff's Wales Millennium Centre said social distancing and restrictions on indoor events made it ""impossible for us to open the theatre in a way that provides a good audience experience and is economically viable"". It will cancel all showings from 26 December until 15 January. The city's New Theatre is also cancelling its pantomime from the same date. The Swansea Grand said its pantomime, Snow White, was cancelled from 26 December. Cinderella at Blackwood Miner's Institute will do the same. After several days of chopping and changing, ministers will hope today's announcement provides a sustainable way forward over the Christmas period. In imposing these restrictions, the first minister has gone further than the other home nations and he also has the cushion of Wales being behind both England and Scotland in the progress of the Omicron advance. What happens there over the next week will be instructive in terms of whether measures here can be tightened or relaxed going forward. Businesses want this to be as short lived as possible and it's possible that a sharp rise in cases could be followed by a sharp drop. The modelling has yet to be made public, but Mark Drakeford says it's the volume of potential that cases remains his major concern, both in terms of demand on the NHS and the impact on the workforce of our public services. Leader of the Tories in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, criticised the Welsh government's approach to announcing new restrictions over the past week. ""I would not have had the drip, drip, drip effect that has gone on over the last couple of days. ""People I speak to do want to adhere to the rules... but with the complexities that are coming out now it's going to be very difficult for people to understand exactly what their responsibility is going to be."" The rules may have to be ""firmed up"" again in the new year, said Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. He added: ""If nothing was done now, we'd be in real trouble in January. ""I am in no doubt that the seriousness of the threat we face means we have to take firm action."" The Senedd was recalled to hear from the first minister on the new measures on Wednesday, wherehe faced calls to publish the latest scientific advice. Wales now has some of the most stringent Covid restrictions in the UK. Measures are also being imposed inScotlandandNorthern Ireland. On different approaches by the nations, Mr Drakeford said UK ministers ""get all the advice that we get about the need to act and to act urgently in the light of the Omicron wave that is coming our way and is already there, in very, very significant numbers in London and in other parts of England. ""I think that the UK government is in a state of paralysis about all of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidthere will be no new rules in Englandbefore Christmas, but ""can't rule out"" measures after then. No new Covid restrictions will be brought in for England before Christmas, the prime minister has said The Welsh government said a total of Â£120m will be made available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses. That includes Â£60m announced last week. But the first minister also repeated his calls for furlough arrangements to be put in place for the sectors most directly affected by restrictions. ""In order to go further, were that to become necessary, the Welsh government simply does not have the financial fire power or even the practical ways of getting help to people who might not be able to be in work - for that we need the help of the UK government,"" he added. The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out The Welsh government had already announced some restrictions it plans to impose after Christmas, with sports eventsgoing behind closed doors, including Cardiff v Scarlets on 26 December and the Welsh Grand National. But up to 50 people can still watch grassroots or junior team sports. There had been some confusion following an announcement earlier this week that sports events would have to be played behind closed doors from 26 December. Workerscould face fines of Â£60if they are not working from home with good reason. ""They are designed to protect workers, not to punish them,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""When these same rules were there earlier in the pandemic, no fines were issued at all."" But Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said that was inaccurate. ""At the time all of Wales was under a stay at home mandate, while at the present time the guidance only applies to certain employers and employees,"" she said.

Self-isolation rule change 'considered' in Scotland,"Changes to the self-isolation rules in Scotland are being considered in a bid to ease pressure on public services, the deputy first minister has said. Fully-vaccinated people who have coronavirus currently have to self-isolate for 10 days. In England, that has been cut to a weekfor people who get negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven. John Swinney said such a change could help tackle the ""immediate threat"" of public sector staff absences. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that reducing isolation periods was a measure ""that would contribute"" towards tackling staffing issues. But he warned that stopping the circulation of the virus - and the now-dominant Omicron variant - remained ""the inescapable challenge that we face"". He said: ""We will of course consider the proposition that the United Kingdom government has brought forward. ""There are options that can be taken forward about the self-isolation arrangements which can try to ease pressure on public services. ""But what we have to recognise is that the number of cases is likely to become so significant that it is going to give rise to significant absence levels from our private and public services."" What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Omicron symptoms: Is a runny nose a cold or Covid? It comes as the number of daily positive tests in Scotland increased to about 5,500 a day compared to 3,500 a week ago. Mr Swinney said that ""brings into question the sustainability of some of these services, which is why we have to act to try to slow down the circulation of the virus"". UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change in England would minimise disruption caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. He said the move was based on the latest guidance from health experts. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland's large-scale Hogmanay celebrations ""will not proceed"" Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said expert groups in Scotland would look at the latest data ""over the next few days"" before advising on any rule change. He said: ""Self-isolation has changed over time - we went from 14 days down to 10. We now test and release quite a lot of people for critical infrastructure, health and social care and other things. ""We will put that (data) to our expert groups and we will then give advice to the politicians in Scotland about what we should do."" The Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane described the current rules on self-isolation as ""unsustainable"". He said: ""If there are not urgent changes, the consequences for our emergency services, our transport network and the economy could be dire. ""People understand the need to self-isolate until they have a negative test but keeping people inside beyond that is likely to result in the breakdown of essential services over the coming weeks."" Labour's health spokesperson Jackie Baillie said: ""Increasing staff absences are set to bring hospitality to its knees and pile pressure onto already-stretched services. ""If the evidence says we can safely help ease this, there is no excuse for delaying while businesses and public services suffer."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced on Tuesday thattough new Covid rules would be introduced in Scotland after Christmas Dayin a bid to help slow the spread of Omicron. Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will, in effect, be spectator-free for at least three weeks. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people, while indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. Hospitality bosses described the latest moves - which come two weeks afteradvice from Public Health Scotland for people to cancel Christmas parties- as a ""knockout blow"" to many businesses already struggling because of the pandemic. Colin Wilkinson, managing director of Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said the industry had faced a ""tsunami of cancellations"" and that ""we effectively remain open in name only"". He told Good Morning Scotland: ""The industry is in a far more precarious position than last year when we had the furlough scheme. ""The problem we have is we can see when we get through the winter period a number of businesses will be folding because of the Covid debt they have accrued over this period. ""We've gone beyond the point of calling for support. We're in the position where it is aid the industry needs if we are to survive."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Northern Ireland nightclubs to close from 26 December,"The closure of nightclubs is among a number of measures announced by Northern Ireland ministers Nightclubs will have to close from 06:00 on 26 December and indoor standing events will be prohibited. From then, dancing will also be prohibited in hospitality venues, but this will not apply to weddings. Stormont ministers met for more than four hours this afternoon to agree measures to tackle rising Covid cases. From 27 December, hospitality venues will return to table-service only, with limits of no more than six people allowed to sit together at a table. Again, this measure will not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations. Northern Ireland today recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases- 3,231 - since the pandemic began. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? The exemption of wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress is to be removed It's understood that Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid in Northern Ireland and makes up almost 60% of cases. Also from 27 December, people will also be urged to limit meetings inside private homes to no more than three households, but this will be guidance and students returning home will be part of their original household. Sporting events can continue with no limit on capacitybut this will be reviewed on 30 December - but there will be guidance to those travelling to and from games not to car share. The work from home message is to be bolstered, with legislation to require 2m social distancing in the workplace or provide alternative mitigations. The rules on face coverings will also be strengthened, with some exemptions removed and a statutory duty placed on businesses to promote compliance. Ministers said they will keep the measures under review. From 06:00 on 26 December: Nightclubs will close Dancing in all hospitality venues will not be allowed (does not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations) All indoor standing events will not be allowed From 06:00 on 27 December: It is strongly recommended that household mixing should be reduced to a maximum of three households There will be a legal requirement for businesses to take reasonable measures to achieve 2m social distancing in office spaces or, where this cannot be achieved, to provide alternative mitigations It is strongly recommended that you should work from home where possible and where that is not possible that there should be regular workplace testing There will be a statutory duty on businesses to take reasonable measures to promote compliance with face coverings requirements, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented The exemption of wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress will be removed and the onus of proving an exemption on medical grounds will be on the individual, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented There will be a legal duty on businesses to take all reasonable steps to minimize transmission of the spread of the virus, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented You will be required to be seated in all indoor hospitality settings with a maximum of six people, or 10 people from a single household, allowed at a table (children aged 12 and under are not counted and this requirement does not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations) Indoor seated and all outdoor events can proceed and it is strongly recommended that face coverings should be worn, LFD tests should be taken before attending events and there should be no multi-household travel in the same vehicle Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan say measures are 'proportionate' First Minister Paul Givan said the new restrictions were ""balanced and proportionate and based on where we are today"". He added: ""The message is the same, whether it is in regulation or guidance, we appeal to public to follow us and to put into practice those public health messages."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ministers are working on a financial package to support affected businesses affected and said they would continue to press Westminster for more support. She added: ""This intervention is informed by the medical and scientific advice and it takes account of the wider economic and societal impacts."" She said it was an ""evolving situation"" and that the data will be reviewed ""night and day"". Health Minister Robin Swann said the Omicron surge ""is deeply concerning for us in the health service"". Robin Swann says the Omicron surge is deeply worrying He hinted that limits on funding have prevented Stormont from imposing tougher restrictions. Last week, health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. The vaccination and booster programme have been stepped up in a bid to tackle the rise in cases. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has tweeted criticism of the executive's decision to close businesses without providing financial support. He said ""it is very disappointing to see Northern Ireland hospitality businesses closing without support in place"". ""The NI Executive must urgently offer clarity on the financial support available to those affected,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, the Department of Finance has previously said that extra Covid-19 funding announced by the Treasury last weekwas mostly not new money and that much of it already featured in Stormont's spending plans. Table service will return to hospitality businesses from 27 December with limits of no more than six people to a table Stephen Boyd from Thompsons nightclub in Belfast said he ""doesn't feel great"" following the announcement but that it was ""expected"". Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme he said: ""I am disappointed because we did put a lot of mitigations in place. ""We would have been happy enough if they had of said - to get into nightclubs you need a Covid pass and a negative lateral flow - but that is obviously not going to happen now. ""We are going to have to remodel ourselves as a lounge now with table service and that is something we can deal with. ""However, it will be interesting to see if a curfew will be introduced later."" The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, said the industry was ""crying out for support"". ""Business owners and staff have been left high and dry about their future over Christmas,"" said Mr Neill. ""Announcing business closure without financial support is contemptable and shows no consideration for staff and business owners."" Restrictions have already been announced for elsewhere in the UK Fiona Davey, who owns Brunel's restaurant in Newcastle in County Down, said the hospitality industry is ""effectively closed"". Speaking on Evening Extra, Ms Davey said: ""The amount of cancellations we are seeing is staggering. ""For an industry that is already in a critical state and the lack of staff we have - these restrictions are just creating more problems. ""We're asking the executive for some sort of package to help staff."" Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said the measures were ""unacceptable and unforgivable"". He added: ""As well as having to deal with the impact of additional measures, businesses haven't been offered a single penny in financial support."" Northern Ireland Hotels Federation (NIHF) said the uncertainty of the last month, including ""lack of clarity"" around Covid passports, had taken a ""real toll"". Chief executive Janice Gault said the industry would continue to work with government to ensure support, adding: ""A scheme is being developed, but without intervention from the Treasury, anything of a meaningful nature may not be possible."" Earlier, Wales' first minister announced thatgroups of no more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurantsfrom 26 December. Scotland has also announced new measures to come into force from 26 December andEdinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled. Tighter restrictions are already in place in the Republic of Ireland, where hospitality and cultural venues including pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres have been required to close by 20:00 since Monday.

Between 2018 and 2020, Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to Â£2.94m a year in director's loans from Saliston Ltd, a UK-based property company he owned. He said the loans had been primarily taken out to buy and refurbish his central London home, and that all loans had been repaid with interest. On 29 November, Kathryn Stone launched an inquiry to determine if the North East Somerset MP had breached the rules by failing to declare these loans. Responding to Ms Stone, Mr Rees-Mogg confirmed he had taken loans from Saliston and said he had not received any ""taxable expenses, allowances or benefits"". He added that he had ""tried conscientiously to declare my interests and have never sought to be anything other thank frank with the House"". Rees-Mogg investigated by standards watchdog Which MPs have second jobs? Offering her reasoning for exonerating Mr Rees-Mogg, the standards commissioner said there were two ""initial tests"" that determined whether an MP needed to register a financial interest. Firstly, she said, the rules were not meant to regulate ""what MPs do in their purely private and personal lives"", and, secondly, MPs should register financial interests which ""might reasonably be thought by others to influence his or her actions, speeches or votes in Parliament"". Ms Stone concluded that the loans had been solely connected to Mr Rees-Mogg's private life and that they could not be considered to have influence his actions as an MP. On these grounds she decided to reject the complaint made against him and promised to publish her full decision ""in due course"".

Howes was born into showbiz, as the daughter of British performer Bobby Howes and actress/singer Patricia Malone, she became a star of the screen and stage in her own right. Taking over the role from Julie Andrews, she shone as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady on New York's Broadway in 1958. And in 1963 she was nominated for a Tony Award for best lead actress in a musical for her work in Brigadoon. How Chitty Chitty Bang Bang took off Later, in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang she played the daughter of a confectionery magnate, performing classic songs including Toot Sweets and Hushabye Mountain and Doll On A Music Box. The latter song was memorably performed as she danced on a music box. And Howes told US TV show host and actress Rosie O'Donnell she was proud to have got it down in one take,especially as she had lied about being able to dance in order to get the role. Sally Ann Howes and Dick Van Dyke were the stars of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Asked if she could describe Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which was written by 007 author Ian Fleming, Howes replied: 'Well, I suppose if you put Mary Poppins together with James Bond, this would be their child."" She went on to tell O'Donnell that she and Van Dyke had been ""just thrown together"" out of the blue. ""I just got the role,"" she explained. ""I didn't have to test for it, which was a joy because I never get anything I auditioned for. I'm terrible - I get kind of frozen and I become terribly English. And they think, 'who's this cold woman?' and I'm not a bit like that - I have a good time. ""But I never ever win anything that way. So I was thrilled when they said I didn't have to test, so I got the role. And then I met Dick, literally when we started rehearsing, and we did all these very difficult dances."" Van Dyke and Howes attended a special screening of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Blu-Ray release party in Los Angeles in 2010 Despite her success on-screen in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, the theatre remained her true love. ""I would have liked a film career, but I didn't pursue it - I just loved connecting with an audience,"" she once said. ""The theatre is a drug. The problem is that to be remembered, you have to do films."" Sally Ann Howes was born in London, and held a dual British-American citizenship In 2007, she returned to My Fair Lady, appearing as Mrs Higgins in a Cameron Mackintosh-produced tour of the US. Her other notable on-stage performances included Summer Song and A Hatful Of Rain.

From then, dancing will also be prohibited in hospitality venues, but this will not apply to weddings. Stormont ministers met for more than four hours this afternoon to agree measures to tackle rising Covid cases. From 27 December, hospitality venues will return to table-service only, with limits of no more than six people allowed to sit together at a table. Again, this measure will not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations. Northern Ireland today recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases- 3,231 - since the pandemic began. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? The exemption of wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress is to be removed It's understood that Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid in Northern Ireland and makes up almost 60% of cases. Also from 27 December, people will also be urged to limit meetings inside private homes to no more than three households, but this will be guidance and students returning home will be part of their original household. Sporting events can continue with no limit on capacitybut this will be reviewed on 30 December - but there will be guidance to those travelling to and from games not to car share. The work from home message is to be bolstered, with legislation to require 2m social distancing in the workplace or provide alternative mitigations. The rules on face coverings will also be strengthened, with some exemptions removed and a statutory duty placed on businesses to promote compliance. Ministers said they will keep the measures under review. From 06:00 on 26 December: Nightclubs will close Dancing in all hospitality venues will not be allowed (does not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations) All indoor standing events will not be allowed From 06:00 on 27 December: It is strongly recommended that household mixing should be reduced to a maximum of three households There will be a legal requirement for businesses to take reasonable measures to achieve 2m social distancing in office spaces or, where this cannot be achieved, to provide alternative mitigations It is strongly recommended that you should work from home where possible and where that is not possible that there should be regular workplace testing There will be a statutory duty on businesses to take reasonable measures to promote compliance with face coverings requirements, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented The exemption of wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress will be removed and the onus of proving an exemption on medical grounds will be on the individual, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented There will be a legal duty on businesses to take all reasonable steps to minimize transmission of the spread of the virus, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented You will be required to be seated in all indoor hospitality settings with a maximum of six people, or 10 people from a single household, allowed at a table (children aged 12 and under are not counted and this requirement does not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations) Indoor seated and all outdoor events can proceed and it is strongly recommended that face coverings should be worn, LFD tests should be taken before attending events and there should be no multi-household travel in the same vehicle Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan say measures are 'proportionate' First Minister Paul Givan said the new restrictions were ""balanced and proportionate and based on where we are today"". He added: ""The message is the same, whether it is in regulation or guidance, we appeal to public to follow us and to put into practice those public health messages."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ministers are working on a financial package to support affected businesses affected and said they would continue to press Westminster for more support. She added: ""This intervention is informed by the medical and scientific advice and it takes account of the wider economic and societal impacts."" She said it was an ""evolving situation"" and that the data will be reviewed ""night and day"". Health Minister Robin Swann said the Omicron surge ""is deeply concerning for us in the health service"". Robin Swann says the Omicron surge is deeply worrying He hinted that limits on funding have prevented Stormont from imposing tougher restrictions. Last week, health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. The vaccination and booster programme have been stepped up in a bid to tackle the rise in cases. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has tweeted criticism of the executive's decision to close businesses without providing financial support. He said ""it is very disappointing to see Northern Ireland hospitality businesses closing without support in place"". ""The NI Executive must urgently offer clarity on the financial support available to those affected,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, the Department of Finance has previously said that extra Covid-19 funding announced by the Treasury last weekwas mostly not new money and that much of it already featured in Stormont's spending plans. Table service will return to hospitality businesses from 27 December with limits of no more than six people to a table Stephen Boyd from Thompsons nightclub in Belfast said he ""doesn't feel great"" following the announcement but that it was ""expected"". Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme he said: ""I am disappointed because we did put a lot of mitigations in place. ""We would have been happy enough if they had of said - to get into nightclubs you need a Covid pass and a negative lateral flow - but that is obviously not going to happen now. ""We are going to have to remodel ourselves as a lounge now with table service and that is something we can deal with. ""However, it will be interesting to see if a curfew will be introduced later."" The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, said the industry was ""crying out for support"". ""Business owners and staff have been left high and dry about their future over Christmas,"" said Mr Neill. ""Announcing business closure without financial support is contemptable and shows no consideration for staff and business owners."" Restrictions have already been announced for elsewhere in the UK Fiona Davey, who owns Brunel's restaurant in Newcastle in County Down, said the hospitality industry is ""effectively closed"". Speaking on Evening Extra, Ms Davey said: ""The amount of cancellations we are seeing is staggering. ""For an industry that is already in a critical state and the lack of staff we have - these restrictions are just creating more problems. ""We're asking the executive for some sort of package to help staff."" Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said the measures were ""unacceptable and unforgivable"". He added: ""As well as having to deal with the impact of additional measures, businesses haven't been offered a single penny in financial support."" Northern Ireland Hotels Federation (NIHF) said the uncertainty of the last month, including ""lack of clarity"" around Covid passports, had taken a ""real toll"". Chief executive Janice Gault said the industry would continue to work with government to ensure support, adding: ""A scheme is being developed, but without intervention from the Treasury, anything of a meaningful nature may not be possible."" Earlier, Wales' first minister announced thatgroups of no more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurantsfrom 26 December. Scotland has also announced new measures to come into force from 26 December andEdinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled.

Gove pressures Ulster Rugby over Kingspan links,"Kingspan is a shirt sponsor for Ulster's and hold naming rights to the province's Ravenhill stadium Michael Gove has written to Ulster Rugby asking them to reconsider their relationship with Kingspan over the firm's role in the Grenfell Tower fire. The Irish company is Ulster's primary shirt sponsor and hold naming rights to the province's Ravenhill stadium. TheGrenfell Inquiry has heard evidence criticising its business practices. Kingspan says that its K15 insulation made up only 5% of the insulation in the block and was used without its recommendation. It points out that the exterior cladding, which it did not manufacture, was deemed by the inquiry to be the ""principal reason"" for how quickly the fire spread. Earlier this month the Mercedes Formula 1 teamended a sponsorship deal with Kingspanafter the Grenfell United victims and survivors group criticised the arrangement. Grenfell United subsequently wrote to Ulster Rugby asking the club to reconsider its Kingspan deal. Ulster said it would not be making any comment whilst the inquiry is ongoing. Ulster decline response to Grenfell link In his letter, Mr Gove, the UK housing minister, said: ""I would like you to consider the evidence that has been presented to the the inquiry before deciding whether continuing with this arrangement is consistent with the values of your club. ""I do not believe that the public across these islands will feel that it is right that a community club should risk its reputation by partnering with a company whose practices have been so seriously called into question."" Mr Gove asked Ulster Rugby to consider the evidence heard at the Grenfell Inquiry Among the evidence heard at the inquiry was that Kingspan misleadingly marketed K15 as being generally suitable for use on high rise buildings when it had only been approved for use as part of a specific cladding set-up. The public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire is currently examining how the building was covered in flammable materials, which contributed to the spread of flames that took hold of the tower in June 2017, killing 72 people. Ulster Rugby has confirmed that its CEO Jonny Petrie received a letter from Mr Gove. ""The information contained within will be considered as part of an existing active review, and we won't be making any further comment at this time,"" the spokesperson added. Previously Kingspan has said: ""The Grenfell Tower fire was a tragedy that should never have happened, and Kingspan supports the vitally important work of the inquiry to determine what went wrong and why. ""Kingspan played no role in the design of the cladding system on Grenfell Tower, where its K15 product constituted approximately 5% of the insulation and was used as a substitute product without Kingspan's knowledge in a system that was not compliant with the buildings regulations."" Kingspan is headquartered in County Cavan and employs up to 15,000 people across its global operations. It also sponsors Breffni Park, the home of Cavan GAA. Although the Irish company has argued that its products made up only 5% of the insulation on Grenfell Tower, the public inquiry exposed some concerning revelations about some of its working practices. In particular, the firm's testing of its Kooltherm K15 insulation in 2005 to 2007 has raised serious questions about the company's approach to safety regulations. The Grenfell Inquiry heard: That Kingspan carried out its first large-scale fire test on K15 in 2005, which passed, but included the use of non-weatherproofed cement fibre cladding panels, which critics said could not be used on a real high-rise building. Kingspan continued to use these test results to sell the material as appropriate for high-rise buildings, despite changing how K15 was produced and conductinga subsequent fire test on the product, which resulted in a ""raging inferno"". The test's result was described as shocking by the firm's ex-technical director Ivor Meredith. That the firm's technical manager, Philip Heath, sent an email to friends regarding a contractor's concerns over the material's use on high-rise buildings, sayinghe was being confused ""for someone who gives a dam""and that he was ""trying to think of a way out of this one, imagine a fire running up this tower! Any ideas?"" Mr Heath told the inquiry he was in a dark place because of a friend's terminal illness. That in 2007, the firm carried out fire tests only on the foil covering K15, using its interpretation of the testing guidance to claim the entire product had achieved a ""Class 0"" industry-best safety standard. The inquiry heard evidence of two company employees joking that it was ""all lies mate"" and ""all we do is lie here"". Lead counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett, suggested that using Kingspan's interpretation of the regulations in England and Wales,a stick of dynamite wrapped in foil could be advertised as Class 0. In Scotland, where it was made clear that the whole product needed to be tested, the firm did not make the same claim about K15's safety standard. Kingspan has already admitted that the inquiry has highlighted ""historic process shortcomings and unacceptable conduct within a part of its UK insulation business"" and it has apologised unreservedly.

Pubs and restaurants fear 'crippling' Covid rules,"Ashley Stephens and Porscha Hilton are concerned about customers staying away from the Unicorn in Pontypool Pubs and restaurants in Wales say they fear they could be ""crippled"" by new Covid rules brought in for the hospitality industry. From 26 December the Welsh government has saidno more than six people will be allowed to go out in groups for food and drinks. Two metre social distancing is also back, along with mask wearing, table service rules and contact tracing. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the measures on Wednesday. Ashley Stephens, landlord of the Unicorn pub in Pontypool, Torfaen, said he understood precautions were needed. But he worried that being short of staff would mean customers would stop coming. ""It's going to cripple us even more than the state that we're in at the moment, so that's another 25% business lost,"" Mr Stephens said. ""A good Sunday lunch you could do 120-plus people, you're not going to be able to do those numbers anymore."" Simon Buckley fears he may have to temporarily close Plas Hafod in Gwernymynydd in January Simon Buckley, owner of Plas Hafod in Gwernymynydd, Flintshire, said business had already been hit by Omicron uncertainty. Bookings for lunch on Thursday were down from from 100 to 18. He feared he may have to close temporarily in January. ""We're still not getting cold, hard advice about what what to do,"" Mr Buckley said. ""They've put the rule of six in. That's going to affect us, as we have families in, and functions and birthday parties. It will hit our revenue.Â ""We do most of our business in December. We are down about 70% trade. ""Even before this it's just been devastating."" Covid in Wales: Groups of six allowed to meet in pubs Covid: Wales records highest number of daily cases Mark Drakeford 'storm' warning prompts nightclub closures The business normally hosts 20 big functions in a dedicated room, but has only done three this Christmas. ""We might just close for a few weeks in January,"" Mr Buckley said. Gareth Evans, of Aberystwyth's Baravin, said social distancing could ""cripple"" them Gareth Evans, manager of Baravin restaurant in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, said they had been expecting the face mask rules, track and trace and the rule of six. Other measures they already had in place. ""The two metre rule is the one that is going to be crippling to us,"" Mr Evans said. ""This Christmas hasn't been what it was meant to be with cancellations, and we are going to lose 24 seats with the two metre rule. ""And these 24 seats are crucial for us as a business in quiet times.""

However, the Department of Finance has previously said that extra Covid-19 funding announced by the Treasury last weekwas mostly not new money and that much of it already featured in Stormont's spending plans. Table service will return to hospitality businesses from 27 December with limits of no more than six people to a table Stephen Boyd from Thompsons nightclub in Belfast said he ""doesn't feel great"" following the announcement but that it was ""expected"". Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme he said: ""I am disappointed because we did put a lot of mitigations in place. ""We would have been happy enough if they had of said - to get into nightclubs you need a Covid pass and a negative lateral flow - but that is obviously not going to happen now. ""We are going to have to remodel ourselves as a lounge now with table service and that is something we can deal with. ""However, it will be interesting to see if a curfew will be introduced later."" The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, said the industry was ""crying out for support"". ""Business owners and staff have been left high and dry about their future over Christmas,"" said Mr Neill. ""Announcing business closure without financial support is contemptable and shows no consideration for staff and business owners."" Restrictions have already been announced for elsewhere in the UK Fiona Davey, who owns Brunel's restaurant in Newcastle in County Down, said the hospitality industry is ""effectively closed"". Speaking on Evening Extra, Ms Davey said: ""The amount of cancellations we are seeing is staggering. ""For an industry that is already in a critical state and the lack of staff we have - these restrictions are just creating more problems. ""We're asking the executive for some sort of package to help staff."" Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said the measures were ""unacceptable and unforgivable"". He added: ""As well as having to deal with the impact of additional measures, businesses haven't been offered a single penny in financial support."" Northern Ireland Hotels Federation (NIHF) said the uncertainty of the last month, including ""lack of clarity"" around Covid passports, had taken a ""real toll"". Chief executive Janice Gault said the industry would continue to work with government to ensure support, adding: ""A scheme is being developed, but without intervention from the Treasury, anything of a meaningful nature may not be possible."" Earlier, Wales' first minister announced thatgroups of no more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurantsfrom 26 December. Scotland has also announced new measures to come into force from 26 December andEdinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled. Tighter restrictions are already in place in the Republic of Ireland, where hospitality and cultural venues including pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres have been required to close by 20:00 since Monday.

"Tighter restrictions see pub group limits in WalesThere will be strict limits on the number of people who can meet in pubs, restaurants and cinemas.WalesComments","This video can not be played New restrictions for hospitality, retail and workplaces come into force on Boxing Day No more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales from 26 December. Two-metre social distancing rules will also return in public places. Licensed premises will have to offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected. Outdoor events will be limited to 50, with 30 indoors, but no restrictions were brought in for smaller meetings in private homes. First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to limit the amount of socialising they do and take a lateral flow tests before they go to meet other people. Wales' rules for fully-vaccinated people who are a contact of someone with coronavirus have been changed - with a switch to daily testing instead of self-isolation, including for the Omicron variant. Hospitality firms saidthe new hospitality rules could severely hit their businesses. Call to publish updated expert Covid advice Wales records highest number of daily cases Children at risk from Covid to get jab in Wales The changes come amid the spread of Omicron - 301 more cases have been found in Wales, bringing total to 941. But a senior Welsh Conservative warned some may struggle to understand the complexity of the new rules. Wales recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus caseson Wednesday, with 4,662 new cases and three deaths reported by Public Health Wales. Following the announcement, the Wales Millennium Centre and some other theatres announced they would close their doors from 26 December. Cardiff and Swansea's Winter Wonderlands both said they would close from from 20:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. Parkrun, which organises 5km runs every Saturday morning throughout the UK, has cancelled all of its events in Wales from 1 January onwards. However, as Welsh government rules on outdoor gatherings do not include children, junior Parkrun events will not be affected. Pubs face new restrictions - such as the rule of six - after Christmas Mr Drakeford announced the return to somealert level two restrictions,externalat a Welsh government press briefing. From 06:00: Social distancing rules apply in workplaces and public spaces, including cinemas, shops and theatres Restrictions apply in hospitality, including the rule of six for groups of customers, table service and mask wearing Large events will be restricted, with exceptions for smaller sports events where up to 50 spectators can gather, and exceptions for events involving children Nightclubs, originally planned to close on 27 December, will now shut a day earlier. But events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will not be subjected to the same limits. Mr Drakeford said the numbers that could attend sporting events would be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. There will be specific offence for having gatherings of more than 30 people in private homes. The first minister set no end date for the new restrictions but said he wanted them in place for the shortest possible time. New sports rules come into effect from Boxing Day Close contacts of people who have Covid will no longer have to self-isolate, provided they have been fully vaccinated, and will now have to take a lateral flow test instead. For most people, fully-vaccinated means they have had two jabs. Mr Drakeford has not gone as far as England,where people with Covid will now have to self-isolate for seven days instead of 10, providing they have a negative test result. Mr Drakeford said: ""A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious Omicron variant is headed our way. ""This new form of coronavirus could infect large numbers of people in Wales, disrupting daily lives and businesses and could cause an increase in the number of people who need hospital care in the coming weeks."" He said early action was needed to try and control the spread of Omicron, and it was a ""misunderstanding"" to think that if the variant was less severe ""that solves the problem"". ""If Omicron was even half as severe as Delta, because of the extra speed a which it's transmitted, that would buy you 48 hours before you see those numbers of people going in to hospital climb to the very steep numbers we have seen,"" he said. At a recalled Senedd meeting, he later added: ""We are quite definitely not on an unstoppable journey to lockdown."" Cardiff's Wales Millennium Centre said social distancing and restrictions on indoor events made it ""impossible for us to open the theatre in a way that provides a good audience experience and is economically viable"". It will cancel all showings from 26 December until 15 January. The city's New Theatre is also cancelling its pantomime from the same date. The Swansea Grand said its pantomime, Snow White, was cancelled from 26 December. Cinderella at Blackwood Miner's Institute will do the same. After several days of chopping and changing, ministers will hope today's announcement provides a sustainable way forward over the Christmas period. In imposing these restrictions, the first minister has gone further than the other home nations and he also has the cushion of Wales being behind both England and Scotland in the progress of the Omicron advance. What happens there over the next week will be instructive in terms of whether measures here can be tightened or relaxed going forward. Businesses want this to be as short lived as possible and it's possible that a sharp rise in cases could be followed by a sharp drop. The modelling has yet to be made public, but Mark Drakeford says it's the volume of potential that cases remains his major concern, both in terms of demand on the NHS and the impact on the workforce of our public services. Leader of the Tories in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, criticised the Welsh government's approach to announcing new restrictions over the past week. ""I would not have had the drip, drip, drip effect that has gone on over the last couple of days. ""People I speak to do want to adhere to the rules... but with the complexities that are coming out now it's going to be very difficult for people to understand exactly what their responsibility is going to be."" The rules may have to be ""firmed up"" again in the new year, said Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. He added: ""If nothing was done now, we'd be in real trouble in January. ""I am in no doubt that the seriousness of the threat we face means we have to take firm action."" The Senedd was recalled to hear from the first minister on the new measures on Wednesday, wherehe faced calls to publish the latest scientific advice. Wales now has some of the most stringent Covid restrictions in the UK. Measures are also being imposed inScotlandandNorthern Ireland. On different approaches by the nations, Mr Drakeford said UK ministers ""get all the advice that we get about the need to act and to act urgently in the light of the Omicron wave that is coming our way and is already there, in very, very significant numbers in London and in other parts of England. ""I think that the UK government is in a state of paralysis about all of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidthere will be no new rules in Englandbefore Christmas, but ""can't rule out"" measures after then. No new Covid restrictions will be brought in for England before Christmas, the prime minister has said The Welsh government said a total of Â£120m will be made available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses. That includes Â£60m announced last week. But the first minister also repeated his calls for furlough arrangements to be put in place for the sectors most directly affected by restrictions. ""In order to go further, were that to become necessary, the Welsh government simply does not have the financial fire power or even the practical ways of getting help to people who might not be able to be in work - for that we need the help of the UK government,"" he added. The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out The Welsh government had already announced some restrictions it plans to impose after Christmas, with sports eventsgoing behind closed doors, including Cardiff v Scarlets on 26 December and the Welsh Grand National. But up to 50 people can still watch grassroots or junior team sports. There had been some confusion following an announcement earlier this week that sports events would have to be played behind closed doors from 26 December. Workerscould face fines of Â£60if they are not working from home with good reason. ""They are designed to protect workers, not to punish them,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""When these same rules were there earlier in the pandemic, no fines were issued at all."" But Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said that was inaccurate. ""At the time all of Wales was under a stay at home mandate, while at the present time the guidance only applies to certain employers and employees,"" she said.

What are the new self-isolation rules?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well.

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus updates from the
UK and around the world: Austrian hospitality settings, including Christmas markets, re-opened just 10 days ago after a three week lockdown in November Austria has announced pans to re-introduce coronavirus restrictions after Christmas, including a 10pm closing time for hospitality venues, in a bid to slow the spread
of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health officials have announced. The new closing time will be imposed on the hospitality
sector from 27 December and will remain in place for New Year's Eve, Covid-19 policy co-ordinator Katharina
Reich said during a press conference. She urged the public to celebrate the holiday in
small groups and with vaccinated people only. Reich also announced the classification of the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Norway as risk areas, meaning arrivals from the countries must go into
quarantine if they have not received a booster vaccination. Austria only emerged from a three-week lockdown 10 days ago but fears have been raised in recent days over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the country. The wave of Omicron appears to be milder according to preliminary studies published in the UK and South Africa. Early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment - potentially about a two-thirds reduction - than with other variants. The researchers said their findings were a ""qualified good news story"". However, the concern remains that even if Omicron is milder, the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm hospitals. A study in Scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital. It said that if Omicron behaved the same as Delta then they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already. At the moment there are only 15. However, the study is based on very few cases and had few people over age 65, who are most at risk of severe disease. Read the full storyhere. Smitha MundasadNews reporter Health
and care staff who test positive for coronavirus in England can now return to
work up to three days before their 10-day isolation period is complete - 
but must do extra tests, according tonew
guidance,external. Englandâs
health chiefs will be keeping their fingers crossed that the tweaked guidelines
go some way to maintaining staffing levels during a difficult winter while
limiting the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. According
to the document, if health and care staff are well, and no longer have any
symptoms, they can take lateral flow tests on day six and seven. If
negative â unlike most other adults - they are asked to test again on day eight, nine and 10. They
can return to work on day eight provided they have a negative lateral flow. But if
any of their lateral flow tests return a positive result they need to isolate
once more. Some
staff, particularly those working with patients most vulnerable to Covid, could
be asked to work in less risky areas until the original 10-day isolation period
is complete. Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. Ex-prime minister Tony Blair has described eligible people who are not vaccinated against Covid and have no medical reason not to get the jab as idiots. The former Labour PM tells Times Radio those who choose not to have a vaccine should not be targeted in a heavy-handed way but persuaded to have a jab. He says: ""There may be all sorts of reasons, but honestly it is in their own interest, never mind the public interest, for them to get vaccinated."" He also says the decision to vaccinate people under the age of 12 should have been taken ""some time ago"", adding: ""I don't know what we're waiting for."" He says he backs the government in not imposing further further restrictions before Christmas but describes the decision as ""incredibly difficult"" and a ""gamble"". This video can not be played 'Where is the PM?' Javid is asked During his visit to a hospital in south London earlier the health secretary was asked by a reporter whether the prime minister was ""in hiding"". Boris Johnson's most recent address to the nation yesterday came via a video statement uploaded to Twitter, rather than the traditional press conference format where he is asked questions by journalists. In his recent appearances, the prime minister has faced questions over reported gatherings in Downing Street when the country was under Covid restrictions. But Sajid Javid says Johnson ""couldn't be working harder"" and tht he is having meetings with the prime minister ""two or three times a day"". Wales' health minister says she plans to begin offering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds in the ""at risk"" group, after thatlatest recommendation from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation(JCVI). Eluned Morgan says she has accepted the JCVI's advice, adding that NHS Wales will start identifying eligible children in the new year, and people under the age of 18 will get a booster jab appointment when they become eligible. Baroness Morgan pledges that the ""appropriate information"" on the ""potential benefits and risks"" of having the jab will be shared with children, young people and their parents or guardians so they can make an informed choice. The recommendations by the scientific experts have to be officially approved by ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but this is normally a formality. As we reported earlier, the government's vaccine advisers have recommended that a low-dose Covid vaccine should be given to vulnerable children aged 5 to 11. But who is currently eligible for the vaccine?  What about boosters? InEnglandboosters are available to over 18s - as long as it's three months since their second dose. Boostersare also available to people aged 16 or over,externalwith a health condition that puts them at high risk of serious illness from Covid or if they care or live with someone at high risk. Boosters can be booked,externaltwo months after a second dose. Somewalk-in appointments may be available,external- depending on where you live. Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. As in England, boosterscan be booked online,external. Walesalso hopes tohit the end of December target. People should wait to be invited for their booster, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised. Northern Ireland'sbooster plan is also being accelerated. People aged 18 to 29will be able to go to walk-in hubs from Mondayand make booster appointments from Wednesday, 22 December. You can read morehere. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 238,350 or 58.9% in the past seven days, compared
with the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 2.7% in the last seven days, compared
with the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. You can read our full report on the latest figureshere. There have been a further 106,122 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government
figures,external. It is the first time more than 100,000 cases have been reported in a single day. And
there have been another 140 deaths, of people who had tested
positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. BBC Radio 5 Live Emma Downey is co-owner of Tides Kitchen and Wine Bar in Newport, Pembrokeshire. She tells5 Liveâs Naga Munchettytighter restrictions on hospitality in Wales mean she will have to close the restaurant side of her business. âWe knew it was coming,â she says. âWe knew something was going to changeâ¦ but the damage has already been done in the past week. âI feel completely despondent today, weâll honour our bookings for next week to include New Yearâs Eve, but after that weâll close the restaurant side of the business until we can open with some normality."" Nightclubs in Northern Ireland will have to close on 27 December as fresh restrictions are imposed to tackle the Omicron Covid variant, BBC News NI understands. Stormont ministershave been meeting to agree measuresto help manage rising Covid cases across Northern Ireland. It is understood they are also likely to agree tighter restrictions on hospitality including table service and limits on numbers at tables. Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected as â100% incorrectâ social media claims that its
director general thinks Covid vaccine boosters are being used to kill children. A brief clip from Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusâs press
briefing on Monday is being promoted by online anti-vaccine activists as
evidence that vaccinating children is deadly. Addressing the rollout of Covid vaccine boosters, he said
vaccinating old and vulnerable groups in developing nations was a higher
priority than offering booster shots to children in high income nations. âItâs better to focus on those groups who have the risk of
severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to
give boosters to children, which is not right,â Dr Tedros said. However, he stumbles on his words at the end, which makes it
appear as though he is suggesting booster jabs âkill childrenâ. A WHO spokesperson told the BBC that
Dr Ghebreyesus âgot stuck on the first syllable âchilâ and
it came out sounding like âcil/kil'. âHe repeated the same
syllable, with it coming out âcil-childrenâ. Any other interpretation of this
is 100% incorrect.â Nigeria has destroyed more than one million doses of coronavirus vaccines, saying  international donors delivered the vials just before their expiry date, sparing little time for distribution around the country. The AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Nigeria over the course of October, but expired the next month authorities said. At a dump site in Abuja, a bulldozer crushed the shots which were packed in cardboard boxes and plastic as
reporters and health officials watched. AstraZeneca doses can normally be stored safely for at least six months from the time of manufacture, under suitable conditions. But Nigeria's health minister Osagie Ehanire told the BBC earlier this month that the late delivery ""left us very short time, some just weeks, to use them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to users"". New coronavirus infections have increased by over 500% in the past two weeks in Africa's most populous nation, where just 4% of the 200 million strong population are fully vaccinated. An early assessment of the Omicron variant in South Africa suggests the risk of severe disease may be lower than with earlier strains of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was carried out by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and found that people diagnosed with Omicron in South Africa between 1 October and and 30 November were 80% less likely to be admitted to hospital than
those diagnosed with other variants over the same period. But the authors stressed that some of the findings may be attributed to higher levels of population immunity caused by vaccinations and past infections, and stressed that further research is needed. It is estimated that 60-70% of South Africans have had a prior coronavirus infection. ""Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive
story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other

countries where there are high levels of vaccination but very
low levels of previous infection,"" she added. Results of a major study released by Imperial College London last week found that there are no indications that Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, although data on hospitalisations remains very limited and the study has not been peer reviewed. France has become the first country to announce publicly that it has cancelled its order for Merck & Co's Covid-19 antiviral drug following the publication of disappointing trial data. Merck released results from trials at the end of November which suggested the drug was markedly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalisations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by just 30%. French officials had placed an order for 50,000 doses of the drug molnupiravir. But Health Minister Olivier Veran told local media that the ""latest studies weren't good"" and added that the cancellation would not incur any cost. France will instead order an antiviral drug manufactured by the American pharmaceuticals manufacturer Pfizer, which studies suggest cuts the risk of severe illness and death by 90%. Several other European countries, including Germany and Italy, have also placed orders for Merck's pill and it remains unclear whether they will continue with the purchase. A record 968,665 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were reported in the UK on Tuesday, new figures show. The previous record was 940,606 doses on Saturday. More than 30.8 million booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 6.1 million in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK's four health agencies. We've just brought you news of the JCVI's recommendation that vulnerable primary school aged children should be offered low-dose Covid vaccines. We've got a bit more detail on what that might mean. A low-dose version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for five to 11-year-olds has just been approved for use in the UK after being deemed safe and effective.

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus updates from the
UK and around the world: Austrian hospitality settings, including Christmas markets, re-opened just 10 days ago after a three week lockdown in November Austria has announced pans to re-introduce coronavirus restrictions after Christmas, including a 10pm closing time for hospitality venues, in a bid to slow the spread
of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health officials have announced. The new closing time will be imposed on the hospitality
sector from 27 December and will remain in place for New Year's Eve, Covid-19 policy co-ordinator Katharina
Reich said during a press conference. She urged the public to celebrate the holiday in
small groups and with vaccinated people only. Reich also announced the classification of the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Norway as risk areas, meaning arrivals from the countries must go into
quarantine if they have not received a booster vaccination. Austria only emerged from a three-week lockdown 10 days ago but fears have been raised in recent days over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the country. The wave of Omicron appears to be milder according to preliminary studies published in the UK and South Africa. Early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment - potentially about a two-thirds reduction - than with other variants. The researchers said their findings were a ""qualified good news story"". However, the concern remains that even if Omicron is milder, the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm hospitals. A study in Scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital. It said that if Omicron behaved the same as Delta then they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already. At the moment there are only 15. However, the study is based on very few cases and had few people over age 65, who are most at risk of severe disease. Read the full storyhere. Smitha MundasadNews reporter Health
and care staff who test positive for coronavirus in England can now return to
work up to three days before their 10-day isolation period is complete - 
but must do extra tests, according tonew

health chiefs will be keeping their fingers crossed that the tweaked guidelines
go some way to maintaining staffing levels during a difficult winter while
limiting the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. According
to the document, if health and care staff are well, and no longer have any
symptoms, they can take lateral flow tests on day six and seven. If
negative â unlike most other adults - they are asked to test again on day eight, nine and 10. They
can return to work on day eight provided they have a negative lateral flow. But if
any of their lateral flow tests return a positive result they need to isolate
once more. Some
staff, particularly those working with patients most vulnerable to Covid, could
be asked to work in less risky areas until the original 10-day isolation period
is complete. Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. Ex-prime minister Tony Blair has described eligible people who are not vaccinated against Covid and have no medical reason not to get the jab as idiots. The former Labour PM tells Times Radio those who choose not to have a vaccine should not be targeted in a heavy-handed way but persuaded to have a jab. He says: ""There may be all sorts of reasons, but honestly it is in their own interest, never mind the public interest, for them to get vaccinated."" He also says the decision to vaccinate people under the age of 12 should have been taken ""some time ago"", adding: ""I don't know what we're waiting for."" He says he backs the government in not imposing further further restrictions before Christmas but describes the decision as ""incredibly difficult"" and a ""gamble"".

Boris Johnson's most recent address to the nation yesterday came via a video statement uploaded to Twitter, rather than the traditional press conference format where he is asked questions by journalists. In his recent appearances, the prime minister has faced questions over reported gatherings in Downing Street when the country was under Covid restrictions. But Sajid Javid says Johnson ""couldn't be working harder"" and tht he is having meetings with the prime minister ""two or three times a day"". Wales' health minister says she plans to begin offering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds in the ""at risk"" group, after thatlatest recommendation from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation(JCVI). Eluned Morgan says she has accepted the JCVI's advice, adding that NHS Wales will start identifying eligible children in the new year, and people under the age of 18 will get a booster jab appointment when they become eligible. Baroness Morgan pledges that the ""appropriate information"" on the ""potential benefits and risks"" of having the jab will be shared with children, young people and their parents or guardians so they can make an informed choice. The recommendations by the scientific experts have to be officially approved by ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but this is normally a formality. As we reported earlier, the government's vaccine advisers have recommended that a low-dose Covid vaccine should be given to vulnerable children aged 5 to 11. But who is currently eligible for the vaccine?  What about boosters? InEnglandboosters are available to over 18s - as long as it's three months since their second dose.

People should wait to be invited for their booster, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised. Northern Ireland'sbooster plan is also being accelerated.

hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to

Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected as â100% incorrectâ social media claims that its
director general thinks Covid vaccine boosters are being used to kill children. A brief clip from Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusâs press
briefing on Monday is being promoted by online anti-vaccine activists as
evidence that vaccinating children is deadly. Addressing the rollout of Covid vaccine boosters, he said
vaccinating old and vulnerable groups in developing nations was a higher
priority than offering booster shots to children in high income nations. âItâs better to focus on those groups who have the risk of
severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to
give boosters to children, which is not right,â Dr Tedros said. However, he stumbles on his words at the end, which makes it
appear as though he is suggesting booster jabs âkill childrenâ. A WHO spokesperson told the BBC that
Dr Ghebreyesus âgot stuck on the first syllable âchilâ and
it came out sounding like âcil/kil'. âHe repeated the same
syllable, with it coming out âcil-childrenâ. Any other interpretation of this

The AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Nigeria over the course of October, but expired the next month authorities said. At a dump site in Abuja, a bulldozer crushed the shots which were packed in cardboard boxes and plastic as
reporters and health officials watched. AstraZeneca doses can normally be stored safely for at least six months from the time of manufacture, under suitable conditions. But Nigeria's health minister Osagie Ehanire told the BBC earlier this month that the late delivery ""left us very short time, some just weeks, to use them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to users"". New coronavirus infections have increased by over 500% in the past two weeks in Africa's most populous nation, where just 4% of the 200 million strong population are fully vaccinated. An early assessment of the Omicron variant in South Africa suggests the risk of severe disease may be lower than with earlier strains of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was carried out by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and found that people diagnosed with Omicron in South Africa between 1 October and and 30 November were 80% less likely to be admitted to hospital than
those diagnosed with other variants over the same period. But the authors stressed that some of the findings may be attributed to higher levels of population immunity caused by vaccinations and past infections, and stressed that further research is needed. It is estimated that 60-70% of South Africans have had a prior coronavirus infection. ""Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive

First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to limit the amount of socialising they do and take a lateral flow tests before they go to meet other people. Wales' rules for fully-vaccinated people who are a contact of someone with coronavirus have been changed - with a switch to daily testing instead of self-isolation, including for the Omicron variant. Hospitality firms saidthe new hospitality rules could severely hit their businesses. Call to publish updated expert Covid advice Wales records highest number of daily cases Children at risk from Covid to get jab in Wales The changes come amid the spread of Omicron - 301 more cases have been found in Wales, bringing total to 941. But a senior Welsh Conservative warned some may struggle to understand the complexity of the new rules. Wales recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus caseson Wednesday, with 4,662 new cases and three deaths reported by Public Health Wales. Following the announcement, the Wales Millennium Centre and some other theatres announced they would close their doors from 26 December. Cardiff and Swansea's Winter Wonderlands both said they would close from from 20:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. Parkrun, which organises 5km runs every Saturday morning throughout the UK, has cancelled all of its events in Wales from 1 January onwards. However, as Welsh government rules on outdoor gatherings do not include children, junior Parkrun events will not be affected. Pubs face new restrictions - such as the rule of six - after Christmas Mr Drakeford announced the return to somealert level two restrictions,externalat a Welsh government press briefing. From 06:00: Social distancing rules apply in workplaces and public spaces, including cinemas, shops and theatres Restrictions apply in hospitality, including the rule of six for groups of customers, table service and mask wearing Large events will be restricted, with exceptions for smaller sports events where up to 50 spectators can gather, and exceptions for events involving children Nightclubs, originally planned to close on 27 December, will now shut a day earlier. But events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will not be subjected to the same limits. Mr Drakeford said the numbers that could attend sporting events would be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. There will be specific offence for having gatherings of more than 30 people in private homes. The first minister set no end date for the new restrictions but said he wanted them in place for the shortest possible time. New sports rules come into effect from Boxing Day Close contacts of people who have Covid will no longer have to self-isolate, provided they have been fully vaccinated, and will now have to take a lateral flow test instead. For most people, fully-vaccinated means they have had two jabs. Mr Drakeford has not gone as far as England,where people with Covid will now have to self-isolate for seven days instead of 10, providing they have a negative test result. Mr Drakeford said: ""A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious Omicron variant is headed our way. ""This new form of coronavirus could infect large numbers of people in Wales, disrupting daily lives and businesses and could cause an increase in the number of people who need hospital care in the coming weeks."" He said early action was needed to try and control the spread of Omicron, and it was a ""misunderstanding"" to think that if the variant was less severe ""that solves the problem"". ""If Omicron was even half as severe as Delta, because of the extra speed a which it's transmitted, that would buy you 48 hours before you see those numbers of people going in to hospital climb to the very steep numbers we have seen,"" he said. At a recalled Senedd meeting, he later added: ""We are quite definitely not on an unstoppable journey to lockdown."" Cardiff's Wales Millennium Centre said social distancing and restrictions on indoor events made it ""impossible for us to open the theatre in a way that provides a good audience experience and is economically viable"". It will cancel all showings from 26 December until 15 January. The city's New Theatre is also cancelling its pantomime from the same date. The Swansea Grand said its pantomime, Snow White, was cancelled from 26 December. Cinderella at Blackwood Miner's Institute will do the same. After several days of chopping and changing, ministers will hope today's announcement provides a sustainable way forward over the Christmas period. In imposing these restrictions, the first minister has gone further than the other home nations and he also has the cushion of Wales being behind both England and Scotland in the progress of the Omicron advance. What happens there over the next week will be instructive in terms of whether measures here can be tightened or relaxed going forward. Businesses want this to be as short lived as possible and it's possible that a sharp rise in cases could be followed by a sharp drop. The modelling has yet to be made public, but Mark Drakeford says it's the volume of potential that cases remains his major concern, both in terms of demand on the NHS and the impact on the workforce of our public services. Leader of the Tories in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, criticised the Welsh government's approach to announcing new restrictions over the past week. ""I would not have had the drip, drip, drip effect that has gone on over the last couple of days. ""People I speak to do want to adhere to the rules... but with the complexities that are coming out now it's going to be very difficult for people to understand exactly what their responsibility is going to be."" The rules may have to be ""firmed up"" again in the new year, said Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. He added: ""If nothing was done now, we'd be in real trouble in January. ""I am in no doubt that the seriousness of the threat we face means we have to take firm action."" The Senedd was recalled to hear from the first minister on the new measures on Wednesday, wherehe faced calls to publish the latest scientific advice. Wales now has some of the most stringent Covid restrictions in the UK. Measures are also being imposed inScotlandandNorthern Ireland. On different approaches by the nations, Mr Drakeford said UK ministers ""get all the advice that we get about the need to act and to act urgently in the light of the Omicron wave that is coming our way and is already there, in very, very significant numbers in London and in other parts of England. ""I think that the UK government is in a state of paralysis about all of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidthere will be no new rules in Englandbefore Christmas, but ""can't rule out"" measures after then. No new Covid restrictions will be brought in for England before Christmas, the prime minister has said The Welsh government said a total of Â£120m will be made available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses. That includes Â£60m announced last week. But the first minister also repeated his calls for furlough arrangements to be put in place for the sectors most directly affected by restrictions. ""In order to go further, were that to become necessary, the Welsh government simply does not have the financial fire power or even the practical ways of getting help to people who might not be able to be in work - for that we need the help of the UK government,"" he added. The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out The Welsh government had already announced some restrictions it plans to impose after Christmas, with sports eventsgoing behind closed doors, including Cardiff v Scarlets on 26 December and the Welsh Grand National. But up to 50 people can still watch grassroots or junior team sports. There had been some confusion following an announcement earlier this week that sports events would have to be played behind closed doors from 26 December. Workerscould face fines of Â£60if they are not working from home with good reason. ""They are designed to protect workers, not to punish them,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""When these same rules were there earlier in the pandemic, no fines were issued at all."" But Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said that was inaccurate. ""At the time all of Wales was under a stay at home mandate, while at the present time the guidance only applies to certain employers and employees,"" she said.

Stormont ministers met for more than four hours this afternoon to agree measures to tackle rising Covid cases. From 27 December, hospitality venues will return to table-service only, with limits of no more than six people allowed to sit together at a table. Again, this measure will not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations. Northern Ireland today recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases- 3,231 - since the pandemic began. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? The exemption of wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress is to be removed It's understood that Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid in Northern Ireland and makes up almost 60% of cases. Also from 27 December, people will also be urged to limit meetings inside private homes to no more than three households, but this will be guidance and students returning home will be part of their original household. Sporting events can continue with no limit on capacitybut this will be reviewed on 30 December - but there will be guidance to those travelling to and from games not to car share. The work from home message is to be bolstered, with legislation to require 2m social distancing in the workplace or provide alternative mitigations. The rules on face coverings will also be strengthened, with some exemptions removed and a statutory duty placed on businesses to promote compliance. Ministers said they will keep the measures under review. From 06:00 on 26 December: Nightclubs will close Dancing in all hospitality venues will not be allowed (does not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations) All indoor standing events will not be allowed From 06:00 on 27 December: It is strongly recommended that household mixing should be reduced to a maximum of three households There will be a legal requirement for businesses to take reasonable measures to achieve 2m social distancing in office spaces or, where this cannot be achieved, to provide alternative mitigations It is strongly recommended that you should work from home where possible and where that is not possible that there should be regular workplace testing There will be a statutory duty on businesses to take reasonable measures to promote compliance with face coverings requirements, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented The exemption of wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress will be removed and the onus of proving an exemption on medical grounds will be on the individual, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented There will be a legal duty on businesses to take all reasonable steps to minimize transmission of the spread of the virus, with a grace period until 7 January before enforcement is implemented You will be required to be seated in all indoor hospitality settings with a maximum of six people, or 10 people from a single household, allowed at a table (children aged 12 and under are not counted and this requirement does not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations) Indoor seated and all outdoor events can proceed and it is strongly recommended that face coverings should be worn, LFD tests should be taken before attending events and there should be no multi-household travel in the same vehicle Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan say measures are 'proportionate' First Minister Paul Givan said the new restrictions were ""balanced and proportionate and based on where we are today"". He added: ""The message is the same, whether it is in regulation or guidance, we appeal to public to follow us and to put into practice those public health messages."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ministers are working on a financial package to support affected businesses affected and said they would continue to press Westminster for more support. She added: ""This intervention is informed by the medical and scientific advice and it takes account of the wider economic and societal impacts."" She said it was an ""evolving situation"" and that the data will be reviewed ""night and day"". Health Minister Robin Swann said the Omicron surge ""is deeply concerning for us in the health service"". Robin Swann says the Omicron surge is deeply worrying He hinted that limits on funding have prevented Stormont from imposing tougher restrictions. Last week, health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. The vaccination and booster programme have been stepped up in a bid to tackle the rise in cases. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has tweeted criticism of the executive's decision to close businesses without providing financial support. He said ""it is very disappointing to see Northern Ireland hospitality businesses closing without support in place"". ""The NI Executive must urgently offer clarity on the financial support available to those affected,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, said the industry was ""crying out for support"". ""Business owners and staff have been left high and dry about their future over Christmas,"" said Mr Neill.

Speaking on Evening Extra, Ms Davey said: ""The amount of cancellations we are seeing is staggering. ""For an industry that is already in a critical state and the lack of staff we have - these restrictions are just creating more problems. ""We're asking the executive for some sort of package to help staff."" Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said the measures were ""unacceptable and unforgivable"".

Rees-Mogg cleared of breaking MP rules over loansThe senior minister says he is grateful to the standards commissioner for rejecting a complaint.,"The MPs' standards watchdog has dismissed a complaint against senior government minister Jacob Rees-Mogg concerning his outside earnings. The Commons standards commissioner opened an inquiry into whether he had failed to declare loans worth nearly Â£6m from one of his own companies. Butshe concluded,externalthat he had not broken the rules. Mr Rees-Mogg said he was ""grateful to the commissioner for swiftly rejecting this accusation"". Quoting the Shakespeare play Othello in a tweet, the House of Commons leader added: ""Who steals my purse steals trashâ¦ but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed."" Between 2018 and 2020, Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to Â£2.94m a year in director's loans from Saliston Ltd, a UK-based property company he owned. He said the loans had been primarily taken out to buy and refurbish his central London home, and that all loans had been repaid with interest. On 29 November, Kathryn Stone launched an inquiry to determine if the North East Somerset MP had breached the rules by failing to declare these loans. Responding to Ms Stone, Mr Rees-Mogg confirmed he had taken loans from Saliston and said he had not received any ""taxable expenses, allowances or benefits"". He added that he had ""tried conscientiously to declare my interests and have never sought to be anything other thank frank with the House"". Rees-Mogg investigated by standards watchdog Which MPs have second jobs? Offering her reasoning for exonerating Mr Rees-Mogg, the standards commissioner said there were two ""initial tests"" that determined whether an MP needed to register a financial interest. Firstly, she said, the rules were not meant to regulate ""what MPs do in their purely private and personal lives"", and, secondly, MPs should register financial interests which ""might reasonably be thought by others to influence his or her actions, speeches or votes in Parliament"". Ms Stone concluded that the loans had been solely connected to Mr Rees-Mogg's private life and that they could not be considered to have influence his actions as an MP. On these grounds she decided to reject the complaint made against him and promised to publish her full decision ""in due course"".

"NI ministers meeting to discuss Covid restrictionsExecutive to set out plans to get through January, when the peak of Omicron cases is likely to occur.Northern IrelandComments","A mass vaccination centre opened in Belfast on Tuesday A meeting of the NI Executive to discuss the possible reintroduction of Covid restrictions is under way. Last week,health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. The vaccination and booster programme have been stepped up in a bid to tackle a rise in cases of the Omicron variant. The health minister has said the more people that come forward for vaccination, ""the less chance there is of severe restrictions"". Thehighest ever daily number of Covid cases in Northern Ireland- 3,231 - was reported by Department of Health on Wednesday. Speaking at the opening of the mass vaccination centre at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast on Tuesday, Robin Swann said up to two thirds of Covid-19 patients in hospital aged under-50 are unvaccinated. While he would not pre-empt any decisions on restrictions, Mr Swann said there would be ""additional asks"" made of the public following the executive meeting. ""We have to look at pressures on our health service, on our hospital system, but also the pressures on other key infrastructure as well. ""We'll not boost our way simply out of the Omicron and the threat of what is actually in front of us at this minute in time,"" he said. Chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride has previously said that the variant is likely to become the dominant strain in Northern Ireland in January. Ministers had hoped it wouldn't be another Christmas with Covid, but Omicron has meant all of us making changes to our festive traditions. Today the executive will spell out its plans to get through January, when the peak is likely to occur. Full closure of most sectors is off the cards without furlough - something the Treasury isn't for budging on yet. But the executive could shut nightclubs again, while social distancing requirements and table service-only could be re-imposed on hospitality. Fresh financial support will also have to be considered. Whatever measures are agreed today, concerns remain it won't be enough in what's becoming an increasingly hard winter. Robin Swann said ""additional asks"" would be made of the public BBC News NI understands that ministers have about Â£190m to work with in terms of additional financial support. The Department of Finance has developed proposals that ministers will be asked to consider, such as additional business grants and extra help for sectors like close-contact services, which may be affected by a reduction in footfall due to the spread of cases. Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Prison Service has said visits will be ""temporarily suspended, pending review"" from Monday, 27 December. It said the move was one of a number of ""cautionary steps"" to protect prisons from the threat of Covid-19 over the Christmas period. Owner of Cafolla's cafÃ© in Newtownards, Michael Cafolla, said if social distancing is reintroduced it would reduce the downstairs capacity of his cafÃ© from 12 tables to six. ""We don't see the problem, if people are vaccinated and can provide Covid certification then why can't sit together?"" he said. ""We're providing a safer environment, sanitising, we've done risk assessments we've put everything in place."" Bob McCoubrey, owner of Mourne Seafood Bar, took the decision to close his Belfast restaurant due to ""all the uncertainty around at the minute"". ""We have seen business drop off in the city centre, footfall is down. We took the best decision for our business to survive in the new year."" Hospitality businesses say the re-introduction of social distancing and table service-only would have financial implications Club and events promotor Joe Dougan said the nightclub industry has ""caught the brunt of restrictions"" previously. ""We've been open for seven weeks having been closed for 87 weeks before that - we're just about getting back on our feet,"" he said. Hospitality venues, cinemas and theatres in the Republic of Irelandhave a closing time of 20:00 to curb the spread of Covid-19. Pat Courtney who owns Courtney's Steakhouse in Newry said they have had ""an influx of bookings"" from customers over the border since the curfew was introduced. ""We were doing about 50% of trade up until the curfew,"" he said. ""In the period between Christmas and New Year we have seen an awful influx of Southern people coming down here where we have no curfew."" Matthew Tipton, Portadown football manager, said there will be a ""massive financial impact"" if restrictions prevent the the team's Boxing Day match from going ahead. In England, the prime minister said hecould not rule out curbs on activity after Christmas Day. Boris Johnson said people can go ahead with their Christmas plans but advised them to be cautious and appealed for everyone to avail of a booster vaccination. Rules regarding self-isolation have changed in England, with the isolation period dropping from 10 days to seven. However, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said there was no change in the isolation requirements here, with the situation to be ""kept under review"". Scotland hasalso announced further restrictions,with Hogmanay events cancelled in Edinburgh and a limit of 500 spectators brought in for football matches. Social distancing of at least 1m and table service will be reintroduced from 27 December. In Wales, spectators have been banned from all indoor, outdoor, professional and community sports events from 26 December. It has also been announced thatno more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurantsfrom 26 December, with hospitality venues offering table service only.

"Tighter Welsh restrictions see pub group limitsThere will be strict limits on the number of people who can meet in pubs, restaurants and cinemas.WalesComments","This video can not be played New restrictions for hospitality, retail and workplaces come into force on Boxing Day No more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales from 26 December. Two-metre social distancing rules will also return in public places. Licensed premises will have to offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected. Outdoor events will be limited to 50, with 30 indoors, but no restrictions were brought in for smaller meetings in private homes. First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to limit the amount of socialising they do and take a lateral flow tests before they go to meet other people. Wales' rules for fully-vaccinated people who are a contact of someone with coronavirus have been changed - with a switch to daily testing instead of self-isolation, including for the Omicron variant. Hospitality firms saidthe new hospitality rules could severely hit their businesses. Call to publish updated expert Covid advice Wales records highest number of daily cases Children at risk from Covid to get jab in Wales The changes come amid the spread of Omicron - 301 more cases have been found in Wales, bringing total to 941. But a senior Welsh Conservative warned some may struggle to understand the complexity of the new rules. Wales recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus caseson Wednesday, with 4,662 new cases and three deaths reported by Public Health Wales. Following the announcement, the Wales Millennium Centre and some other theatres announced they would close their doors from 26 December. Cardiff and Swansea's Winter Wonderlands both said they would close from from 20:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. Parkrun, which organises 5km runs every Saturday morning throughout the UK, has cancelled all of its events in Wales from 1 January onwards. However, as Welsh government rules on outdoor gatherings do not include children, junior Parkrun events will not be affected. Pubs face new restrictions - such as the rule of six - after Christmas Mr Drakeford announced the return to somealert level two restrictions,externalat a Welsh government press briefing. From 06:00: Social distancing rules apply in workplaces and public spaces, including cinemas, shops and theatres Restrictions apply in hospitality, including the rule of six for groups of customers, table service and mask wearing Large events will be restricted, with exceptions for smaller sports events where up to 50 spectators can gather, and exceptions for events involving children Nightclubs, originally planned to close on 27 December, will now shut a day earlier. But events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will not be subjected to the same limits. Mr Drakeford said the numbers that could attend sporting events would be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. There will be specific offence for having gatherings of more than 30 people in private homes. The first minister set no end date for the new restrictions but said he wanted them in place for the shortest possible time. New sports rules come into effect from Boxing Day Close contacts of people who have Covid will no longer have to self-isolate, provided they have been fully vaccinated, and will now have to take a lateral flow test instead. For most people, fully-vaccinated means they have had two jabs. Mr Drakeford has not gone as far as England,where people with Covid will now have to self-isolate for seven days instead of 10, providing they have a negative test result. Mr Drakeford said: ""A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious Omicron variant is headed our way. ""This new form of coronavirus could infect large numbers of people in Wales, disrupting daily lives and businesses and could cause an increase in the number of people who need hospital care in the coming weeks."" He said early action was needed to try and control the spread of Omicron, and it was a ""misunderstanding"" to think that if the variant was less severe ""that solves the problem"". ""If Omicron was even half as severe as Delta, because of the extra speed a which it's transmitted, that would buy you 48 hours before you see those numbers of people going in to hospital climb to the very steep numbers we have seen,"" he said. At a recalled Senedd meeting, he later added: ""We are quite definitely not on an unstoppable journey to lockdown."" Cardiff's Wales Millennium Centre said social distancing and restrictions on indoor events made it ""impossible for us to open the theatre in a way that provides a good audience experience and is economically viable"". It will cancel all showings from 26 December until 15 January. The city's New Theatre is also cancelling its pantomime from the same date. The Swansea Grand said its pantomime, Snow White, was cancelled from 26 December. Cinderella at Blackwood Miner's Institute will do the same. After several days of chopping and changing, ministers will hope today's announcement provides a sustainable way forward over the Christmas period. In imposing these restrictions, the first minister has gone further than the other home nations and he also has the cushion of Wales being behind both England and Scotland in the progress of the Omicron advance. What happens there over the next week will be instructive in terms of whether measures here can be tightened or relaxed going forward. Businesses want this to be as short lived as possible and it's possible that a sharp rise in cases could be followed by a sharp drop. The modelling has yet to be made public, but Mark Drakeford says it's the volume of potential that cases remains his major concern, both in terms of demand on the NHS and the impact on the workforce of our public services. Leader of the Tories in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, criticised the Welsh government's approach to announcing new restrictions over the past week. ""I would not have had the drip, drip, drip effect that has gone on over the last couple of days. ""People I speak to do want to adhere to the rules... but with the complexities that are coming out now it's going to be very difficult for people to understand exactly what their responsibility is going to be."" The rules may have to be ""firmed up"" again in the new year, said Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. He added: ""If nothing was done now, we'd be in real trouble in January. ""I am in no doubt that the seriousness of the threat we face means we have to take firm action."" The Senedd was recalled to hear from the first minister on the new measures on Wednesday, wherehe faced calls to publish the latest scientific advice. Wales now has some of the most stringent Covid restrictions in the UK. Measures are also being imposed inScotlandandNorthern Ireland. On different approaches by the nations, Mr Drakeford said UK ministers ""get all the advice that we get about the need to act and to act urgently in the light of the Omicron wave that is coming our way and is already there, in very, very significant numbers in London and in other parts of England. ""I think that the UK government is in a state of paralysis about all of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidthere will be no new rules in Englandbefore Christmas, but ""can't rule out"" measures after then. No new Covid restrictions will be brought in for England before Christmas, the prime minister has said The Welsh government said a total of Â£120m will be made available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses. That includes Â£60m announced last week. But the first minister also repeated his calls for furlough arrangements to be put in place for the sectors most directly affected by restrictions. ""In order to go further, were that to become necessary, the Welsh government simply does not have the financial fire power or even the practical ways of getting help to people who might not be able to be in work - for that we need the help of the UK government,"" he added. The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out The Welsh government had already announced some restrictions it plans to impose after Christmas, with sports eventsgoing behind closed doors, including Cardiff v Scarlets on 26 December and the Welsh Grand National. But up to 50 people can still watch grassroots or junior team sports. There had been some confusion following an announcement earlier this week that sports events would have to be played behind closed doors from 26 December. Workerscould face fines of Â£60if they are not working from home with good reason. ""They are designed to protect workers, not to punish them,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""When these same rules were there earlier in the pandemic, no fines were issued at all."" But Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said that was inaccurate. ""At the time all of Wales was under a stay at home mandate, while at the present time the guidance only applies to certain employers and employees,"" she said.

Howes was born into showbiz, as the daughter of British performer Bobby Howes and actress/singer Patricia Malone, she became a star of the screen and stage in her own right. Taking over the role from Julie Andrews, she shone as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady on New York's Broadway in 1958. And in 1963 she was nominated for a Tony Award for best lead actress in a musical for her work in Brigadoon. How Chitty Chitty Bang Bang took off Later, in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang she played the daughter of a confectionery magnate, performing classic songs including Toot Sweets and Hushabye Mountain and Doll On A Music Box. The latter song was memorably performed as she danced on a music box. And Howes told US TV show host and actress Rosie O'Donnell she was proud to have got it down in one take,especially as she had lied about being able to dance in order to get the role. Sally Ann Howes and Dick Van Dyke were the stars of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Asked if she could describe Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which was written by 007 author Ian Fleming, Howes replied: 'Well, I suppose if you put Mary Poppins together with James Bond, this would be their child."" She went on to tell O'Donnell that she and Van Dyke had been ""just thrown together"" out of the blue. ""I just got the role,"" she explained. ""I didn't have to test for it, which was a joy because I never get anything I auditioned for. I'm terrible - I get kind of frozen and I become terribly English. And they think, 'who's this cold woman?' and I'm not a bit like that - I have a good time. ""But I never ever win anything that way. So I was thrilled when they said I didn't have to test, so I got the role. And then I met Dick, literally when we started rehearsing, and we did all these very difficult dances."" Van Dyke and Howes attended a special screening of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Blu-Ray release party in Los Angeles in 2010 Despite her success on-screen in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, the theatre remained her true love. ""I would have liked a film career, but I didn't pursue it - I just loved connecting with an audience,"" she once said. ""The theatre is a drug. The problem is that to be remembered, you have to do films."" Sally Ann Howes was born in London, and held a dual British-American citizenship In 2007, she returned to My Fair Lady, appearing as Mrs Higgins in a Cameron Mackintosh-produced tour of the US. Her other notable on-stage performances included Summer Song and A Hatful Of Rain.

NI ministers meeting to discuss Covid restrictions,"A mass vaccination centre opened in Belfast on Tuesday A meeting of the NI Executive to discuss the possible reintroduction of Covid restrictions is under way. Last week,health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. The vaccination and booster programme have been stepped up in a bid to tackle a rise in cases of the Omicron variant. The health minister has said the more people that come forward for vaccination, ""the less chance there is of severe restrictions"". Thehighest ever daily number of Covid cases in Northern Ireland- 3,231 - was reported by Department of Health on Wednesday. Speaking at the opening of the mass vaccination centre at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast on Tuesday, Robin Swann said up to two thirds of Covid-19 patients in hospital aged under-50 are unvaccinated. While he would not pre-empt any decisions on restrictions, Mr Swann said there would be ""additional asks"" made of the public following the executive meeting. ""We have to look at pressures on our health service, on our hospital system, but also the pressures on other key infrastructure as well. ""We'll not boost our way simply out of the Omicron and the threat of what is actually in front of us at this minute in time,"" he said.

Self-isolation rule change 'considered' in ScotlandThe deputy first minister says Scotland may follow England in reducing isolation to a week.ScotlandComments,"Changes to the self-isolation rules in Scotland are being considered in a bid to ease pressure on public services, the deputy first minister has said. Fully-vaccinated people who have coronavirus currently have to self-isolate for 10 days. In England, that has been cut to a weekfor people who get negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven. John Swinney said such a change could help tackle the ""immediate threat"" of public sector staff absences. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that reducing isolation periods was a measure ""that would contribute"" towards tackling staffing issues. But he warned that stopping the circulation of the virus - and the now-dominant Omicron variant - remained ""the inescapable challenge that we face"". He said: ""We will of course consider the proposition that the United Kingdom government has brought forward. ""There are options that can be taken forward about the self-isolation arrangements which can try to ease pressure on public services. ""But what we have to recognise is that the number of cases is likely to become so significant that it is going to give rise to significant absence levels from our private and public services."" What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Omicron symptoms: Is a runny nose a cold or Covid? It comes as the number of daily positive tests in Scotland increased to about 5,500 a day compared to 3,500 a week ago. Mr Swinney said that ""brings into question the sustainability of some of these services, which is why we have to act to try to slow down the circulation of the virus"". UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change in England would minimise disruption caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. He said the move was based on the latest guidance from health experts. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland's large-scale Hogmanay celebrations ""will not proceed"" Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said expert groups in Scotland would look at the latest data ""over the next few days"" before advising on any rule change. He said: ""Self-isolation has changed over time - we went from 14 days down to 10. We now test and release quite a lot of people for critical infrastructure, health and social care and other things. ""We will put that (data) to our expert groups and we will then give advice to the politicians in Scotland about what we should do."" The Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane described the current rules on self-isolation as ""unsustainable"". He said: ""If there are not urgent changes, the consequences for our emergency services, our transport network and the economy could be dire. ""People understand the need to self-isolate until they have a negative test but keeping people inside beyond that is likely to result in the breakdown of essential services over the coming weeks."" Labour's health spokesperson Jackie Baillie said: ""Increasing staff absences are set to bring hospitality to its knees and pile pressure onto already-stretched services. ""If the evidence says we can safely help ease this, there is no excuse for delaying while businesses and public services suffer."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced on Tuesday thattough new Covid rules would be introduced in Scotland after Christmas Dayin a bid to help slow the spread of Omicron. Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will, in effect, be spectator-free for at least three weeks. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people, while indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. Hospitality bosses described the latest moves - which come two weeks afteradvice from Public Health Scotland for people to cancel Christmas parties- as a ""knockout blow"" to many businesses already struggling because of the pandemic. Colin Wilkinson, managing director of Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said the industry had faced a ""tsunami of cancellations"" and that ""we effectively remain open in name only"". He told Good Morning Scotland: ""The industry is in a far more precarious position than last year when we had the furlough scheme. ""The problem we have is we can see when we get through the winter period a number of businesses will be folding because of the Covid debt they have accrued over this period.

Post-Christmas restrictions as Omicron spreads in Wales,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been laying out changes to Covid rules to come in after Christmas Day He had already announced the closure of nightclubs and that social distancing requirements would return No fans are allowed to go to sporting events as of Boxing Day, 26 December A maximum of six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales from the same day Two-metre social distancing rules are to return in public places and places of work Licensed premises will have to offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected Outdoor events will be limited to 50, with 30 indoors, but weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will not be subject to the rules Close contacts of people who have Covid will no longer have to self-isolate provided they have been fully vaccinated The rules on mixing are guidance rather than law, first minister says The Welsh Conservatives criticise the Welsh government's ""drip, drip, drip"" approach, while Plaid supported the new restrictions Public Health Wales has reported 4,662 new cases of coronavirus - the highest recorded in a 24-hour period since the start of the pandemic Tyler Edwards and Caleb Spencer Thanks for being with us as we brought you the latest news as it happened from the Welsh government's Covid press briefing.

Liz Loughlin, from Mold, in Flintshire, said she would be happy to ask her guests to take lateral-flow tests (LFTs) before they come to her home. On the guidance, she said: âI will be following it. âPeople will do what they want to do anyway. Itâs just common sense really. You go with your own instinct.â Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""I am in no doubt that the seriousness of the threat we face means we have to take firm action. ""It's a balance between those very, very firm actions and the need to look after people's wellbeing and the wellbeing of the economy."" He said the rules may have to be ""firmed up"" again in the new year and stressed the need to remain cautious. ""If nothing was done now, we'd be in real trouble in January,"" he added. The Welsh government has outlined âfive simple measuresâ for people visiting other people's homes. They are: Leader of the Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, has criticised the Welsh government's approach to announcing restrictions in a ""drip, drip, drip"" effect over the past week. He said it makes it hard for people to ""understand exactly their responsibility"" when they ""do want to adhere to the rules"". ""I do take issue with the point the first minister addressed about the workplace fines where now you'll be able to go to the pub without a fine, but you'll get fined if you go into work,"" said Mr Davies. But Mr Davies accepted people taking personal responsibility was how the country will overcome the virus. There are 4,662 new cases of coronavirus today and three people have died, Public Health Wales (PHW) has reported. It brings the total number of cases in Wales to 566,995, and the number of deaths reported by PHW to 6,525. A PHW spokesman said today's case numbers were the
highest reported in a 24-hour period - but added that because of the way the figures
are collated, the data is provisional - and doesn't necessarily reflect the
number of new cases today. Read more about the Covid-19 situation in Wales by clickinghere. The first minister said he would see his children and their families on different days over Christmas because of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said they were following Welsh government advice to âspace outâ visits of friends and relatives. âMy own daughter will be coming with her family to see us and theyâll come on one day,"" he explained. âMy son and family will come, but theyâll come on a different day. âYou can have a good Christmas at the same time if you do things carefully.â Simon Buckley, owner of Plas Hafod in Gwernymynydd, Mold, said the business had already been badly affected by the uncertainty surrounding Omicron. His bookings for lunch today have dropped from 100 to 18, and suggested he may have to close in January after today's announcement. âWeâre still not getting cold hard advice about what if what to,"" said Mr Buckley. ""Theyâve put the rule of six in - thatâs going to affect us as we have families in and functions and birthday parties - it will hit our revenue."" He added: ""We normally do 20 big functions but weâve done three."" If new Covid rules reduce the number of cases, no new restrictions will be needed in the New Year, Mark Drakeford suggested. âThatâs why weâve moved early, earlier than other parts of the United Kingdom,â he said. âThatâs why these changes kick in straight after Christmas, and if they have the intended effect it will mitigate the risk that we will need to do more.â Allow Twitter content?

Mark Drakeford said his government regularly releases the scientific evidence on which its reviews of Covid-19 regulations in Wales are based. He said decisions take into account advice from the Welsh government's own expert Technical Advisory Group (TAG), a report from Walesâ Chief Medical Officer, as well as information from SAGE, the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group. ""What we are seeing is... the number of new cases is accelerating every day, where the doubling time means those cases will be in thousands within a short number of days and where the impact on people becoming so ill to be in hospital is very significant indeed.

Gareth Evans, manager at Baravin restaurant in Aberystwyth, said he was expecting some of the measures introduced today, but others would hit the business hard. A maximum of six people will be allowed to meet in pubs and restaurants from 26 December, and people will be required to observe social distancing. ""The 2m rule is the one that is going to be crippling to us,"" said Mr Evans. ""This Christmas hasnât been what it was meant to be with cancellations, and we are going to lose 24 seats with the 2m [rule] and these 24 seats are crucial for us as a business in quiet times.â Advice has been given to limit household mixing and use lateral flow tests beforehand, with a specific offence for having gatherings of more than 30 people. But a maximum of three households meeting at the same time would be a ""rule of thumb"" for people to follow, Mr Drakeford said. ""We will be relying on guidance for the way that people behave in their own private lives."" He said this was possible because of the booster and vaccination programme and the availability of lateral flow tests. The re-introduction of fines for unnecessarily going in to work is designed to protect workers rather than punish them, the first minister said. From Monday, workers could get a Â£60 fixed penalty notice and companies can be fined Â£1,000 every time they break the rules. Until now there has just been guidance encouraging home working. Mr Drakeford said: âThey are not some new set of rules. âThey are designed to protect workers, not to punish them. When these same rules were there earlier in the pandemic, no fines were issued at all.â The purpose of the rules are to give legal protection to workers who feel they are being unfairly forced to come in to work, he added. The first minister repeated his calls for furlough arrangements to be put in place for the sectors most directly affected by restrictions. He said the Welsh government ""simply does not have the financial fire power"" to help those who may not be able to work. It would need the help of the UK government, he said. âI joined my colleagues in Scotland and Northern Ireland in calling on the Treasury to put those furlough arrangements in place for the sectors that are most directly affected by the extra protections that will need to be there when they reopen after Christmas.â Mr Drakeford said Â£120m will be available for nightclubs, events, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses affected by the move to Alert Level Two. He said that is double the new funding of Â£60m announced last week. There would be a specific offence for large gatherings in private homes, the first minister said. Mark Drakeford said he wanted the measures announced today to be in place for the shortest possible time. He said they will be kept âvery regularlyâ under review. Welsh coronavirus rules are usually reviewed every three weeks, but that has since changed to weekly. Mark Drakeford said the cabinet had decided not to make new legal rules on indoor mixing, but said there would be updated guidance. âWe are doing this because we are in a different position this year than the position we faced the last time we saw coronavirus rise in this way,â he said, citing lateral-flow tests and vaccines. âWe have all learned a great deal about how we can best protect ourselves and others.""

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus updates from the
UK and around the world: Austrian hospitality settings, including Christmas markets, re-opened just 10 days ago after a three week lockdown in November Austria has announced pans to re-introduce coronavirus restrictions after Christmas, including a 10pm closing time for hospitality venues, in a bid to slow the spread
of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health officials have announced. The new closing time will be imposed on the hospitality
sector from 27 December and will remain in place for New Year's Eve, Covid-19 policy co-ordinator Katharina
Reich said during a press conference. She urged the public to celebrate the holiday in
small groups and with vaccinated people only. Reich also announced the classification of the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Norway as risk areas, meaning arrivals from the countries must go into
quarantine if they have not received a booster vaccination. Austria only emerged from a three-week lockdown 10 days ago but fears have been raised in recent days over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the country. The wave of Omicron appears to be milder according to preliminary studies published in the UK and South Africa. Early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment - potentially about a two-thirds reduction - than with other variants. The researchers said their findings were a ""qualified good news story"". However, the concern remains that even if Omicron is milder, the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm hospitals. A study in Scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital. It said that if Omicron behaved the same as Delta then they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already. At the moment there are only 15. However, the study is based on very few cases and had few people over age 65, who are most at risk of severe disease. Read the full storyhere. Smitha MundasadNews reporter Health
and care staff who test positive for coronavirus in England can now return to
work up to three days before their 10-day isolation period is complete - 
but must do extra tests, according tonew
guidance,external. Englandâs
health chiefs will be keeping their fingers crossed that the tweaked guidelines
go some way to maintaining staffing levels during a difficult winter while
limiting the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. According
to the document, if health and care staff are well, and no longer have any
symptoms, they can take lateral flow tests on day six and seven. If
negative â unlike most other adults - they are asked to test again on day eight, nine and 10. They
can return to work on day eight provided they have a negative lateral flow. But if
any of their lateral flow tests return a positive result they need to isolate
once more. Some
staff, particularly those working with patients most vulnerable to Covid, could
be asked to work in less risky areas until the original 10-day isolation period
is complete. Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. Ex-prime minister Tony Blair has described eligible people who are not vaccinated against Covid and have no medical reason not to get the jab as idiots. The former Labour PM tells Times Radio those who choose not to have a vaccine should not be targeted in a heavy-handed way but persuaded to have a jab. He says: ""There may be all sorts of reasons, but honestly it is in their own interest, never mind the public interest, for them to get vaccinated."" He also says the decision to vaccinate people under the age of 12 should have been taken ""some time ago"", adding: ""I don't know what we're waiting for."" He says he backs the government in not imposing further further restrictions before Christmas but describes the decision as ""incredibly difficult"" and a ""gamble"". This video can not be played 'Where is the PM?' Javid is asked During his visit to a hospital in south London earlier the health secretary was asked by a reporter whether the prime minister was ""in hiding"". Boris Johnson's most recent address to the nation yesterday came via a video statement uploaded to Twitter, rather than the traditional press conference format where he is asked questions by journalists. In his recent appearances, the prime minister has faced questions over reported gatherings in Downing Street when the country was under Covid restrictions. But Sajid Javid says Johnson ""couldn't be working harder"" and tht he is having meetings with the prime minister ""two or three times a day"". Wales' health minister says she plans to begin offering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds in the ""at risk"" group, after thatlatest recommendation from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation(JCVI). Eluned Morgan says she has accepted the JCVI's advice, adding that NHS Wales will start identifying eligible children in the new year, and people under the age of 18 will get a booster jab appointment when they become eligible. Baroness Morgan pledges that the ""appropriate information"" on the ""potential benefits and risks"" of having the jab will be shared with children, young people and their parents or guardians so they can make an informed choice. The recommendations by the scientific experts have to be officially approved by ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but this is normally a formality. As we reported earlier, the government's vaccine advisers have recommended that a low-dose Covid vaccine should be given to vulnerable children aged 5 to 11. But who is currently eligible for the vaccine?  What about boosters? InEnglandboosters are available to over 18s - as long as it's three months since their second dose. Boostersare also available to people aged 16 or over,externalwith a health condition that puts them at high risk of serious illness from Covid or if they care or live with someone at high risk. Boosters can be booked,externaltwo months after a second dose. Somewalk-in appointments may be available,external- depending on where you live. Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. As in England, boosterscan be booked online,external. Walesalso hopes tohit the end of December target. People should wait to be invited for their booster, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised. Northern Ireland'sbooster plan is also being accelerated. People aged 18 to 29will be able to go to walk-in hubs from Mondayand make booster appointments from Wednesday, 22 December. You can read morehere. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 238,350 or 58.9% in the past seven days, compared
with the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 2.7% in the last seven days, compared
with the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. You can read our full report on the latest figureshere. There have been a further 106,122 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government
figures,external. It is the first time more than 100,000 cases have been reported in a single day. And
there have been another 140 deaths, of people who had tested
positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. BBC Radio 5 Live Emma Downey is co-owner of Tides Kitchen and Wine Bar in Newport, Pembrokeshire. She tells5 Liveâs Naga Munchettytighter restrictions on hospitality in Wales mean she will have to close the restaurant side of her business. âWe knew it was coming,â she says. âWe knew something was going to changeâ¦ but the damage has already been done in the past week. âI feel completely despondent today, weâll honour our bookings for next week to include New Yearâs Eve, but after that weâll close the restaurant side of the business until we can open with some normality."" Nightclubs in Northern Ireland will have to close on 27 December as fresh restrictions are imposed to tackle the Omicron Covid variant, BBC News NI understands. Stormont ministershave been meeting to agree measuresto help manage rising Covid cases across Northern Ireland. It is understood they are also likely to agree tighter restrictions on hospitality including table service and limits on numbers at tables. Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected as â100% incorrectâ social media claims that its
director general thinks Covid vaccine boosters are being used to kill children. A brief clip from Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusâs press
briefing on Monday is being promoted by online anti-vaccine activists as
evidence that vaccinating children is deadly. Addressing the rollout of Covid vaccine boosters, he said
vaccinating old and vulnerable groups in developing nations was a higher
priority than offering booster shots to children in high income nations. âItâs better to focus on those groups who have the risk of
severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to
give boosters to children, which is not right,â Dr Tedros said. However, he stumbles on his words at the end, which makes it
appear as though he is suggesting booster jabs âkill childrenâ. A WHO spokesperson told the BBC that
Dr Ghebreyesus âgot stuck on the first syllable âchilâ and
it came out sounding like âcil/kil'. âHe repeated the same
syllable, with it coming out âcil-childrenâ. Any other interpretation of this
is 100% incorrect.â Nigeria has destroyed more than one million doses of coronavirus vaccines, saying  international donors delivered the vials just before their expiry date, sparing little time for distribution around the country. The AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Nigeria over the course of October, but expired the next month authorities said. At a dump site in Abuja, a bulldozer crushed the shots which were packed in cardboard boxes and plastic as
reporters and health officials watched. AstraZeneca doses can normally be stored safely for at least six months from the time of manufacture, under suitable conditions. But Nigeria's health minister Osagie Ehanire told the BBC earlier this month that the late delivery ""left us very short time, some just weeks, to use them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to users"". New coronavirus infections have increased by over 500% in the past two weeks in Africa's most populous nation, where just 4% of the 200 million strong population are fully vaccinated. An early assessment of the Omicron variant in South Africa suggests the risk of severe disease may be lower than with earlier strains of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was carried out by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and found that people diagnosed with Omicron in South Africa between 1 October and and 30 November were 80% less likely to be admitted to hospital than
those diagnosed with other variants over the same period. But the authors stressed that some of the findings may be attributed to higher levels of population immunity caused by vaccinations and past infections, and stressed that further research is needed. It is estimated that 60-70% of South Africans have had a prior coronavirus infection. ""Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive
story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other
variants,"" Professor Cheryl Cohen of the NICD said. ""What is unclear is whether the picture will be similar in
countries where there are high levels of vaccination but very
low levels of previous infection,"" she added. Results of a major study released by Imperial College London last week found that there are no indications that Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, although data on hospitalisations remains very limited and the study has not been peer reviewed. France has become the first country to announce publicly that it has cancelled its order for Merck & Co's Covid-19 antiviral drug following the publication of disappointing trial data. Merck released results from trials at the end of November which suggested the drug was markedly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalisations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by just 30%. French officials had placed an order for 50,000 doses of the drug molnupiravir. But Health Minister Olivier Veran told local media that the ""latest studies weren't good"" and added that the cancellation would not incur any cost. France will instead order an antiviral drug manufactured by the American pharmaceuticals manufacturer Pfizer, which studies suggest cuts the risk of severe illness and death by 90%. Several other European countries, including Germany and Italy, have also placed orders for Merck's pill and it remains unclear whether they will continue with the purchase. A record 968,665 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were reported in the UK on Tuesday, new figures show. The previous record was 940,606 doses on Saturday. More than 30.8 million booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 6.1 million in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK's four health agencies. We've just brought you news of the JCVI's recommendation that vulnerable primary school aged children should be offered low-dose Covid vaccines. We've got a bit more detail on what that might mean. A low-dose version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for five to 11-year-olds has just been approved for use in the UK after being deemed safe and effective. It contains one-third of the adult dose and should be given eight weeks apart. But despite the recommendation, a final decision on vaccinating this age group has not yet been made. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said: ""Parents and carers can be reassured that no new vaccine for children would have been approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met."" The JCVI also recommended booster doses be offered to: â¢	Children aged aged 16 and 17(the JCVI recommended they be allowed a second dose last month),external â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 if they are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 who have a severely weakened immune system should get four doses Â© 2025 BBC.

Stormont ministers to discuss Covid restrictions,"A mass vaccination centre opened in Belfast on Tuesday A meeting of the NI Executive to discuss the possible reintroduction of Covid restrictions is under way. Last week,health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. The vaccination and booster programme have been stepped up in a bid to tackle a rise in cases of the Omicron variant. The health minister has said the more people that come forward for vaccination, ""the less chance there is of severe restrictions"". Thehighest ever daily number of Covid cases in Northern Ireland- 3,231 - was reported by Department of Health on Wednesday. Speaking at the opening of the mass vaccination centre at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast on Tuesday, Robin Swann said up to two thirds of Covid-19 patients in hospital aged under-50 are unvaccinated. While he would not pre-empt any decisions on restrictions, Mr Swann said there would be ""additional asks"" made of the public following the executive meeting. ""We have to look at pressures on our health service, on our hospital system, but also the pressures on other key infrastructure as well. ""We'll not boost our way simply out of the Omicron and the threat of what is actually in front of us at this minute in time,"" he said. Chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride has previously said that the variant is likely to become the dominant strain in Northern Ireland in January. Ministers had hoped it wouldn't be another Christmas with Covid, but Omicron has meant all of us making changes to our festive traditions. Today the executive will spell out its plans to get through January, when the peak is likely to occur. Full closure of most sectors is off the cards without furlough - something the Treasury isn't for budging on yet. But the executive could shut nightclubs again, while social distancing requirements and table service-only could be re-imposed on hospitality. Fresh financial support will also have to be considered. Whatever measures are agreed today, concerns remain it won't be enough in what's becoming an increasingly hard winter. Robin Swann said ""additional asks"" would be made of the public BBC News NI understands that ministers have about Â£190m to work with in terms of additional financial support. The Department of Finance has developed proposals that ministers will be asked to consider, such as additional business grants and extra help for sectors like close-contact services, which may be affected by a reduction in footfall due to the spread of cases. Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Prison Service has said visits will be ""temporarily suspended, pending review"" from Monday, 27 December. It said the move was one of a number of ""cautionary steps"" to protect prisons from the threat of Covid-19 over the Christmas period. Owner of Cafolla's cafÃ© in Newtownards, Michael Cafolla, said if social distancing is reintroduced it would reduce the downstairs capacity of his cafÃ© from 12 tables to six. ""We don't see the problem, if people are vaccinated and can provide Covid certification then why can't sit together?"" he said. ""We're providing a safer environment, sanitising, we've done risk assessments we've put everything in place."" Bob McCoubrey, owner of Mourne Seafood Bar, took the decision to close his Belfast restaurant due to ""all the uncertainty around at the minute"". ""We have seen business drop off in the city centre, footfall is down. We took the best decision for our business to survive in the new year."" Hospitality businesses say the re-introduction of social distancing and table service-only would have financial implications Club and events promotor Joe Dougan said the nightclub industry has ""caught the brunt of restrictions"" previously. ""We've been open for seven weeks having been closed for 87 weeks before that - we're just about getting back on our feet,"" he said. Hospitality venues, cinemas and theatres in the Republic of Irelandhave a closing time of 20:00 to curb the spread of Covid-19. Pat Courtney who owns Courtney's Steakhouse in Newry said they have had ""an influx of bookings"" from customers over the border since the curfew was introduced. ""We were doing about 50% of trade up until the curfew,"" he said. ""In the period between Christmas and New Year we have seen an awful influx of Southern people coming down here where we have no curfew."" Matthew Tipton, Portadown football manager, said there will be a ""massive financial impact"" if restrictions prevent the the team's Boxing Day match from going ahead. In England, the prime minister said hecould not rule out curbs on activity after Christmas Day. Boris Johnson said people can go ahead with their Christmas plans but advised them to be cautious and appealed for everyone to avail of a booster vaccination. Rules regarding self-isolation have changed in England, with the isolation period dropping from 10 days to seven. However, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said there was no change in the isolation requirements here, with the situation to be ""kept under review"". Scotland hasalso announced further restrictions,with Hogmanay events cancelled in Edinburgh and a limit of 500 spectators brought in for football matches. Social distancing of at least 1m and table service will be reintroduced from 27 December. In Wales, spectators have been banned from all indoor, outdoor, professional and community sports events from 26 December. It has also been announced thatno more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurantsfrom 26 December, with hospitality venues offering table service only.

Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey axes ground rent rises,"Jo Darbyshire has campaigned for change since buying a home from Taylor Wimpey Thousands of leaseholders who bought homes from housebuilder Taylor Wimpey will no longer be subjected to ground rents that double every 10 years. The change follows action by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The builder had voluntarily given formal commitments to remove the terms from leasehold contracts and exclude them from new contracts, the CMA said. The company said it had ""always sought to do the right thing"". ""We are pleased that today's voluntary undertakings will draw this issue to a full close, within our original financial provision,"" its chief executive Pete Redfern said. Campaigners described the decision as a ""massive win"" because the effect of these increases was that people often struggled to sell or obtain a mortgage on their home. MPs back setting ground rents at one peppercorn Leasehold campaigners welcome new changes Affected Taylor Wimpey leaseholders will now see their ground rents revert to the original amount - that is, when the property was first sold - and they will not increase over time. The company is also paying third party freeholders of leases that Taylor Wimpey originally, but no longer, owns to enable their leaseholders to do the same. Taylor Wimpey has also confirmed to the CMA that it has stopped selling leasehold properties with doubling ground rent clauses. Jo Darbyshire, a co-founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, is one of those celebrating after the move by Taylor Wimpey. She bought her house near Bolton in 2010 for Â£400,000, with ground rent of Â£295, doubling every 10 years. ""Throughout our years of campaigning against this leasehold scandal, Taylor Wimpey have repeatedly done the minimum they think they can get away with,"" she said. ""It's an early Christmas present for me to see that the CMA have finally forced them to do the right thing."" With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property, but they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold. However, leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. There were an estimated 4.6 million leasehold dwellings in England between 2019 and 2020, which equated to 19% of the English housing stock. More than two-thirds (3.2 million) of the leasehold dwellings were flats and 1.5 million were houses,official figures said.,external Taylor Wimpey had originally said it would replace the increasing ground rent contracts with rises pegged to the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation, but the CMA said that too was unfair and has now been stopped. The developer has also confirmed to the CMA that it has stopped selling leasehold properties with doubling ground rent clauses. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said Taylor Wimpey's action was ""a huge step forward"" for its leaseholders. He described the ground rent rises as ""totally unwarranted obligations that lead to people being trapped in their homes, struggling to sell or obtain a mortgage"". He added: ""Other developers and freehold investors should now do the right thing for homeowners and remove these problematic clauses from their contracts. ""If they refuse, we stand ready to step in and take further action - through the courts if necessary."" The CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. These were Countryside and Taylor Wimpey, for using ""possibly unfair contract terms"", and Barratt Developments and Persimmon Homes over the possible mis-selling of leasehold homes. Countryside and Persimmon have already agreed to make changes. The CMA's investigation into Barratt Developments is continuing. As part of its review of the leasehold sector, the CMA is also investigating two investment groups, Brigante Properties and Abacus Land and Adriatic Land. It wrote to the firms earlier this year setting out its concerns and requiring them to remove doubling ground rent terms from their contracts. Housing Secretary Michael Gove said: ""We continue our work to protect and support all leaseholders and our legislation to restrict ground rents in new leases to zero will put a stop to such unfair charges for future homeowners once and for all."" Labour says ministers need to go further and completely ban the selling of houses without a freehold.

"Cancel culture could wipe out comedy, says Lipman","Dame Maureen Lipman: ""Sooner or later the cancellers will win"" Dame Maureen Lipman has said comedy is in danger of being ""wiped out"" due to fears over being cancelled. She told the BBC she believes comedians are now so worried about offending, ""a revolution"" is taking place. ""It's in the balance whether we will ever be funny again,"" she said. Her comments come as more than half of Britons say they have stopped themselves from expressing political and social views for fear of being judged. A YouGov poll seen exclusively by the BBC found 57% of those asked said they censor themselves on issues including immigration and trans rights, particularly if their views are deemed at the less politically correct end of the spectrum. YouGov questioned 1,677 people in mid November to find out their views on what's become known as ""cancel culture"". It is a term, first used in the US, to describe attempts to block or ""cancel"" people or groups with certain viewpoints. While only a third (35%) of those polled said they knew what cancel culture was, many more effectively said they felt cancelled from time to time. The less politically correct the views held, the more likely people were to say they feel shouted down. They are most likely to keep quiet about what they really think when they are with people they've just met (49%) or are at work (40%), according to the data. A third (31%) also self-censor with friends, a fifth (21%) with family. Russell Kane says it's ""complete nonsense"" that comedians are sacrificing being funny for fear of cancellation The cultural world often reflects what's happening in real life. I met Dame Maureen in Manchester, where she was filming Coronation Street. She told me: ""Cancel culture, this cancelling, this punishment, it's everywhere. Punishment. An eye for an eye. 'You said that, therefore you must never work again.' Sooner or later the cancellers will win."" She highlighted the world of comedy, which she claims is in danger of being ""wiped out"" because comedians fear audiences will take offence so they tone down their material. It's a dramatic prediction. ""Something has to be forbidden to make you laugh, really belly laugh. It's when you shouldn't be laughing,"" she said. ""All the things that have been cancelled out by being correct are, I'm afraid, all the things that make people laugh."" But is she right? Many comedians say their industry is in fine - and funny - form. Nobody is being censored, they claim. And in the end, it is audiences who decide what's funny and what's offensive. Take comedian Russell Kane, who knows a thing or two about cancellation. He presents Radio 4's Evil Genius, which each week takes a different figure from history and decides, based on their actions, whether they should be saved or cancelled. Services such as TweetDelete can reduce the chances of someone being cancelled for previously expressed opinions He told me it's ""complete nonsense"" that comedians are sacrificing being funny because they don't want to be cancelled. ""I don't think anyone is saying you can't be offended, nobody is saying that, what we're saying is you can't use hate speech that would prompt a gender-related crime, a sex-related crime or a race-related crime."" ""There's been a massive, much needed shift in the conversation around gender, around men's attitudes to women, around consent. Society has moved on."" However, he does think he and his fellow comedians worry about being cancelled for things they might have said in the past which have since become less acceptable. ""I signed up for a website called TweetDelete and all my posts that are older than six months have gone. It's a bit of self-protection."" The whole issue of ""cancel culture"" and whether it really exists is contentious. In one corner are those who claim that a new, judgmental world exists, particularly on social media, which leads to censorship and puts freedom of speech under attack. Recently, London's Old Vic theatreannounced it would not be staginga planned production of Sondheim's Into the Woods, co-directed by Terry Gilliam. The former Monty Python star claimed on social media that the Old Vic was ""intimidated"" into cancelling the show by what he called ""a small group of closed-minded, humour averse ideologues"" because, he said, he recommended his Facebook followers watch a show by the comedian Dave Chappelle. Dave Chappelle was criticised by some for his comments on trans issues Chappelle has been accused of making anti-transgender comments in a Netflix special. The Old Vic says the decision not to put on Into the Woods was ""mutually agreed"" and wished the show ""well for its future life"".  The musical will now open at the Theatre Royal in Bath instead. In the other corner of the debate are those who argue that calling people out for views that are deemed offensive is a form of social justice. They point out that the people who complain about being cancelled are very often celebrities with huge platforms to air their views and while they still have their voices listened to, it's the opposing arguments that have for too long gone unheard. They say this is about creating a kinder, more tolerant world. The Harry Potter author JK Rowling is the most high-profile celebrity to find her views under attack. She has beenaccused of transphobiaby those who say her views discriminate against trans people. She says she is ""speaking up for women's sex-based rights"". According to those polled by YouGov, nearly a third (29%) of people who hold gender critical views said they always or mostly don't say what they really think when they are talking about this controversial topic. Other difficult areas where the people polled said they don't speak freely are those who believe immigration has been a bad thing for the UK (one third - 33% - of people who held that view said they keep quiet about it). Author JK Rowling is one of the most high-profile people to have been caught in the so-called culture wars A fifth of people who believe women have things as good as men in the UK feel they can't say it. I asked Russell Kane specifically about the poll's findings. ""I don't believe freedom of speech is under threat,"" he said. ""Why would we want to use hateful language? Why should we tolerate it? I think there's a lot of people with much more extreme views, illegal views, hate crime provoking views, who are driving this narrative that those with moderate concerns about immigration, for example, can't say it."" He believes it's being driven by people on the right and left, who are ""trying to create culture wars at either end of the spectrum"". Simon Fanshawe co-founded Stonewall, though he has been publicly critical of the LGBTQ+ charity's current approach to campaigning. He has recently published a book, The Power of Difference, and believes we are facing a crisis of dialogue. He told the BBC: ""At Stonewall, we only ever talked to people we didn't agree with.  When somebody says something, you need to argue with it even if you think it's offensive or damaging or hurtful. That's the only way to get them to change their minds. ""What the poll is telling us is that the inability to discuss differences is seeping into every area of our lives. Even with friends, a third don't express their opinions. Divisions are being exacerbated. We need to try and bridge those divides."" The consequences for society are difficult to measure, especially when cancel culture and censorship have become political pawns in a polarised debate. Much of the argument is around whether freedom of speech is under attack from a new ""woke"" agenda. YouGov's poll suggests younger generations particularly prioritise preventing hateful offensive speech over being able to say what you want. These tensions get to the heart of the so-called culture wars. Some will argue people are being silenced, others that outdated views are simply being weeded out, in real life and in comedy too. Ricky Gervais has joked that the woke generation will eventually in turn be cancelled by the next generation Comedian Ricky Gervais recently said: ""I want to live long enough to see the younger generation not be woke enough for the next generation. It's going to happen. Don't they realise that, it's like, they're next. That's what's funny."" The YouGov poll shared with the BBC suggests younger people are more confident their views won't age than older respondents. While nearly half (47%) of the oldest Britons expect future generations to take a dim view of some of their views, only one in three (36%) 18-24 year olds feel the same way. Will they be proved right - or will Ricky Gervais have the last laugh?

Maximum of six allowed to meet in Welsh pubs,"This video can not be played New restrictions for hospitality, retail and workplaces come into force on Boxing Day No more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales from 26 December. Two-metre social distancing rules will also return in public places. Licensed premises will have to offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected. Outdoor events will be limited to 50, with 30 indoors, but no restrictions were brought in for smaller meetings in private homes. First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to limit the amount of socialising they do and take a lateral flow tests before they go to meet other people. Wales' rules for fully-vaccinated people who are a contact of someone with coronavirus have been changed - with a switch to daily testing instead of self-isolation, including for the Omicron variant. Hospitality firms saidthe new hospitality rules could severely hit their businesses. Call to publish updated expert Covid advice Wales records highest number of daily cases Children at risk from Covid to get jab in Wales The changes come amid the spread of Omicron - 301 more cases have been found in Wales, bringing total to 941. But a senior Welsh Conservative warned some may struggle to understand the complexity of the new rules. Wales recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus caseson Wednesday, with 4,662 new cases and three deaths reported by Public Health Wales. Following the announcement, the Wales Millennium Centre and some other theatres announced they would close their doors from 26 December. Cardiff and Swansea's Winter Wonderlands both said they would close from from 20:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. Parkrun, which organises 5km runs every Saturday morning throughout the UK, has cancelled all of its events in Wales from 1 January onwards. However, as Welsh government rules on outdoor gatherings do not include children, junior Parkrun events will not be affected. Pubs face new restrictions - such as the rule of six - after Christmas Mr Drakeford announced the return to somealert level two restrictions,externalat a Welsh government press briefing. From 06:00: Social distancing rules apply in workplaces and public spaces, including cinemas, shops and theatres Restrictions apply in hospitality, including the rule of six for groups of customers, table service and mask wearing Large events will be restricted, with exceptions for smaller sports events where up to 50 spectators can gather, and exceptions for events involving children Nightclubs, originally planned to close on 27 December, will now shut a day earlier. But events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will not be subjected to the same limits. Mr Drakeford said the numbers that could attend sporting events would be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. There will be specific offence for having gatherings of more than 30 people in private homes. The first minister set no end date for the new restrictions but said he wanted them in place for the shortest possible time. New sports rules come into effect from Boxing Day Close contacts of people who have Covid will no longer have to self-isolate, provided they have been fully vaccinated, and will now have to take a lateral flow test instead. For most people, fully-vaccinated means they have had two jabs. Mr Drakeford has not gone as far as England,where people with Covid will now have to self-isolate for seven days instead of 10, providing they have a negative test result. Mr Drakeford said: ""A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious Omicron variant is headed our way. ""This new form of coronavirus could infect large numbers of people in Wales, disrupting daily lives and businesses and could cause an increase in the number of people who need hospital care in the coming weeks."" He said early action was needed to try and control the spread of Omicron, and it was a ""misunderstanding"" to think that if the variant was less severe ""that solves the problem"". ""If Omicron was even half as severe as Delta, because of the extra speed a which it's transmitted, that would buy you 48 hours before you see those numbers of people going in to hospital climb to the very steep numbers we have seen,"" he said. At a recalled Senedd meeting, he later added: ""We are quite definitely not on an unstoppable journey to lockdown."" Cardiff's Wales Millennium Centre said social distancing and restrictions on indoor events made it ""impossible for us to open the theatre in a way that provides a good audience experience and is economically viable"". It will cancel all showings from 26 December until 15 January. The city's New Theatre is also cancelling its pantomime from the same date. The Swansea Grand said its pantomime, Snow White, was cancelled from 26 December. Cinderella at Blackwood Miner's Institute will do the same. After several days of chopping and changing, ministers will hope today's announcement provides a sustainable way forward over the Christmas period. In imposing these restrictions, the first minister has gone further than the other home nations and he also has the cushion of Wales being behind both England and Scotland in the progress of the Omicron advance. What happens there over the next week will be instructive in terms of whether measures here can be tightened or relaxed going forward. Businesses want this to be as short lived as possible and it's possible that a sharp rise in cases could be followed by a sharp drop. The modelling has yet to be made public, but Mark Drakeford says it's the volume of potential that cases remains his major concern, both in terms of demand on the NHS and the impact on the workforce of our public services. Leader of the Tories in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, criticised the Welsh government's approach to announcing new restrictions over the past week. ""I would not have had the drip, drip, drip effect that has gone on over the last couple of days. ""People I speak to do want to adhere to the rules... but with the complexities that are coming out now it's going to be very difficult for people to understand exactly what their responsibility is going to be."" The rules may have to be ""firmed up"" again in the new year, said Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. He added: ""If nothing was done now, we'd be in real trouble in January. ""I am in no doubt that the seriousness of the threat we face means we have to take firm action."" The Senedd was recalled to hear from the first minister on the new measures on Wednesday, wherehe faced calls to publish the latest scientific advice. Wales now has some of the most stringent Covid restrictions in the UK. Measures are also being imposed inScotlandandNorthern Ireland. On different approaches by the nations, Mr Drakeford said UK ministers ""get all the advice that we get about the need to act and to act urgently in the light of the Omicron wave that is coming our way and is already there, in very, very significant numbers in London and in other parts of England. ""I think that the UK government is in a state of paralysis about all of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidthere will be no new rules in Englandbefore Christmas, but ""can't rule out"" measures after then. No new Covid restrictions will be brought in for England before Christmas, the prime minister has said The Welsh government said a total of Â£120m will be made available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses. That includes Â£60m announced last week. But the first minister also repeated his calls for furlough arrangements to be put in place for the sectors most directly affected by restrictions. ""In order to go further, were that to become necessary, the Welsh government simply does not have the financial fire power or even the practical ways of getting help to people who might not be able to be in work - for that we need the help of the UK government,"" he added. The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out The Welsh government had already announced some restrictions it plans to impose after Christmas, with sports eventsgoing behind closed doors, including Cardiff v Scarlets on 26 December and the Welsh Grand National. But up to 50 people can still watch grassroots or junior team sports. There had been some confusion following an announcement earlier this week that sports events would have to be played behind closed doors from 26 December. Workerscould face fines of Â£60if they are not working from home with good reason. ""They are designed to protect workers, not to punish them,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""When these same rules were there earlier in the pandemic, no fines were issued at all."" But Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said that was inaccurate. ""At the time all of Wales was under a stay at home mandate, while at the present time the guidance only applies to certain employers and employees,"" she said.

Couzens, Sophie Williams, Matt Murphy and Mary OâConnor. The live page was edited by Chris
Clayton and Owen Amos. As ever, you can follow any major developments on the news site

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus updates from the
UK and around the world: Austrian hospitality settings, including Christmas markets, re-opened just 10 days ago after a three week lockdown in November Austria has announced pans to re-introduce coronavirus restrictions after Christmas, including a 10pm closing time for hospitality venues, in a bid to slow the spread
of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health officials have announced. The new closing time will be imposed on the hospitality
sector from 27 December and will remain in place for New Year's Eve, Covid-19 policy co-ordinator Katharina
Reich said during a press conference. She urged the public to celebrate the holiday in
small groups and with vaccinated people only. Reich also announced the classification of the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Norway as risk areas, meaning arrivals from the countries must go into
quarantine if they have not received a booster vaccination. Austria only emerged from a three-week lockdown 10 days ago but fears have been raised in recent days over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the country. The wave of Omicron appears to be milder according to preliminary studies published in the UK and South Africa. Early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment - potentially about a two-thirds reduction - than with other variants. The researchers said their findings were a ""qualified good news story"". However, the concern remains that even if Omicron is milder, the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm hospitals. A study in Scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital. It said that if Omicron behaved the same as Delta then they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already. At the moment there are only 15. However, the study is based on very few cases and had few people over age 65, who are most at risk of severe disease. Read the full storyhere. Smitha MundasadNews reporter Health
and care staff who test positive for coronavirus in England can now return to
work up to three days before their 10-day isolation period is complete - 
but must do extra tests, according tonew
guidance,external. Englandâs
health chiefs will be keeping their fingers crossed that the tweaked guidelines
go some way to maintaining staffing levels during a difficult winter while
limiting the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. According
to the document, if health and care staff are well, and no longer have any
symptoms, they can take lateral flow tests on day six and seven. If
negative â unlike most other adults - they are asked to test again on day eight, nine and 10. They
can return to work on day eight provided they have a negative lateral flow. But if
any of their lateral flow tests return a positive result they need to isolate
once more. Some
staff, particularly those working with patients most vulnerable to Covid, could
be asked to work in less risky areas until the original 10-day isolation period
is complete. Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. Ex-prime minister Tony Blair has described eligible people who are not vaccinated against Covid and have no medical reason not to get the jab as idiots. The former Labour PM tells Times Radio those who choose not to have a vaccine should not be targeted in a heavy-handed way but persuaded to have a jab. He says: ""There may be all sorts of reasons, but honestly it is in their own interest, never mind the public interest, for them to get vaccinated."" He also says the decision to vaccinate people under the age of 12 should have been taken ""some time ago"", adding: ""I don't know what we're waiting for."" He says he backs the government in not imposing further further restrictions before Christmas but describes the decision as ""incredibly difficult"" and a ""gamble"". This video can not be played 'Where is the PM?' Javid is asked During his visit to a hospital in south London earlier the health secretary was asked by a reporter whether the prime minister was ""in hiding"". Boris Johnson's most recent address to the nation yesterday came via a video statement uploaded to Twitter, rather than the traditional press conference format where he is asked questions by journalists. In his recent appearances, the prime minister has faced questions over reported gatherings in Downing Street when the country was under Covid restrictions. But Sajid Javid says Johnson ""couldn't be working harder"" and tht he is having meetings with the prime minister ""two or three times a day"". Wales' health minister says she plans to begin offering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds in the ""at risk"" group, after thatlatest recommendation from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation(JCVI). Eluned Morgan says she has accepted the JCVI's advice, adding that NHS Wales will start identifying eligible children in the new year, and people under the age of 18 will get a booster jab appointment when they become eligible. Baroness Morgan pledges that the ""appropriate information"" on the ""potential benefits and risks"" of having the jab will be shared with children, young people and their parents or guardians so they can make an informed choice. The recommendations by the scientific experts have to be officially approved by ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but this is normally a formality. As we reported earlier, the government's vaccine advisers have recommended that a low-dose Covid vaccine should be given to vulnerable children aged 5 to 11. But who is currently eligible for the vaccine?  What about boosters? InEnglandboosters are available to over 18s - as long as it's three months since their second dose. Boostersare also available to people aged 16 or over,externalwith a health condition that puts them at high risk of serious illness from Covid or if they care or live with someone at high risk. Boosters can be booked,externaltwo months after a second dose. Somewalk-in appointments may be available,external- depending on where you live. Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. As in England, boosterscan be booked online,external. Walesalso hopes tohit the end of December target. People should wait to be invited for their booster, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised. Northern Ireland'sbooster plan is also being accelerated. People aged 18 to 29will be able to go to walk-in hubs from Mondayand make booster appointments from Wednesday, 22 December. You can read morehere. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 238,350 or 58.9% in the past seven days, compared
with the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 2.7% in the last seven days, compared
with the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. You can read our full report on the latest figureshere. There have been a further 106,122 cases of coronavirus

Nightclubs in Northern Ireland will have to close on 27 December as fresh restrictions are imposed to tackle the Omicron Covid variant, BBC News NI understands. Stormont ministershave been meeting to agree measuresto help manage rising Covid cases across Northern Ireland. It is understood they are also likely to agree tighter restrictions on hospitality including table service and limits on numbers at tables. Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected as â100% incorrectâ social media claims that its
director general thinks Covid vaccine boosters are being used to kill children. A brief clip from Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusâs press
briefing on Monday is being promoted by online anti-vaccine activists as
evidence that vaccinating children is deadly. Addressing the rollout of Covid vaccine boosters, he said
vaccinating old and vulnerable groups in developing nations was a higher
priority than offering booster shots to children in high income nations. âItâs better to focus on those groups who have the risk of
severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to
give boosters to children, which is not right,â Dr Tedros said. However, he stumbles on his words at the end, which makes it
appear as though he is suggesting booster jabs âkill childrenâ. A WHO spokesperson told the BBC that
Dr Ghebreyesus âgot stuck on the first syllable âchilâ and
it came out sounding like âcil/kil'. âHe repeated the same
syllable, with it coming out âcil-childrenâ. Any other interpretation of this
is 100% incorrect.â Nigeria has destroyed more than one million doses of coronavirus vaccines, saying  international donors delivered the vials just before their expiry date, sparing little time for distribution around the country. The AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Nigeria over the course of October, but expired the next month authorities said. At a dump site in Abuja, a bulldozer crushed the shots which were packed in cardboard boxes and plastic as
reporters and health officials watched. AstraZeneca doses can normally be stored safely for at least six months from the time of manufacture, under suitable conditions. But Nigeria's health minister Osagie Ehanire told the BBC earlier this month that the late delivery ""left us very short time, some just weeks, to use them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to users"". New coronavirus infections have increased by over 500% in the past two weeks in Africa's most populous nation, where just 4% of the 200 million strong population are fully vaccinated. An early assessment of the Omicron variant in South Africa suggests the risk of severe disease may be lower than with earlier strains of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was carried out by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and found that people diagnosed with Omicron in South Africa between 1 October and and 30 November were 80% less likely to be admitted to hospital than
those diagnosed with other variants over the same period. But the authors stressed that some of the findings may be attributed to higher levels of population immunity caused by vaccinations and past infections, and stressed that further research is needed. It is estimated that 60-70% of South Africans have had a prior coronavirus infection. ""Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive
story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other
variants,"" Professor Cheryl Cohen of the NICD said. ""What is unclear is whether the picture will be similar in
countries where there are high levels of vaccination but very
low levels of previous infection,"" she added. Results of a major study released by Imperial College London last week found that there are no indications that Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, although data on hospitalisations remains very limited and the study has not been peer reviewed. France has become the first country to announce publicly that it has cancelled its order for Merck & Co's Covid-19 antiviral drug following the publication of disappointing trial data. Merck released results from trials at the end of November which suggested the drug was markedly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalisations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by just 30%. French officials had placed an order for 50,000 doses of the drug molnupiravir. But Health Minister Olivier Veran told local media that the ""latest studies weren't good"" and added that the cancellation would not incur any cost. France will instead order an antiviral drug manufactured by the American pharmaceuticals manufacturer Pfizer, which studies suggest cuts the risk of severe illness and death by 90%. Several other European countries, including Germany and Italy, have also placed orders for Merck's pill and it remains unclear whether they will continue with the purchase. A record 968,665 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were reported in the UK on Tuesday, new figures show. The previous record was 940,606 doses on Saturday. More than 30.8 million booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 6.1 million in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK's four health agencies. We've just brought you news of the JCVI's recommendation that vulnerable primary school aged children should be offered low-dose Covid vaccines. We've got a bit more detail on what that might mean. A low-dose version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for five to 11-year-olds has just been approved for use in the UK after being deemed safe and effective. It contains one-third of the adult dose and should be given eight weeks apart. But despite the recommendation, a final decision on vaccinating this age group has not yet been made. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said: ""Parents and carers can be reassured that no new vaccine for children would have been approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met."" The JCVI also recommended booster doses be offered to: â¢	Children aged aged 16 and 17(the JCVI recommended they be allowed a second dose last month),external â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 if they are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 who have a severely weakened immune system should get four doses Â© 2025 BBC.

Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey axes ground rent risesThousands of leaseholders who bought its homes will no longer see ground rents double every 10 years.,"Jo Darbyshire has campaigned for change since buying a home from Taylor Wimpey Thousands of leaseholders who bought homes from housebuilder Taylor Wimpey will no longer be subjected to ground rents that double every 10 years. The change follows action by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The builder had voluntarily given formal commitments to remove the terms from leasehold contracts and exclude them from new contracts, the CMA said. The company said it had ""always sought to do the right thing"". ""We are pleased that today's voluntary undertakings will draw this issue to a full close, within our original financial provision,"" its chief executive Pete Redfern said. Campaigners described the decision as a ""massive win"" because the effect of these increases was that people often struggled to sell or obtain a mortgage on their home. MPs back setting ground rents at one peppercorn Leasehold campaigners welcome new changes Affected Taylor Wimpey leaseholders will now see their ground rents revert to the original amount - that is, when the property was first sold - and they will not increase over time. The company is also paying third party freeholders of leases that Taylor Wimpey originally, but no longer, owns to enable their leaseholders to do the same. Taylor Wimpey has also confirmed to the CMA that it has stopped selling leasehold properties with doubling ground rent clauses. Jo Darbyshire, a co-founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, is one of those celebrating after the move by Taylor Wimpey. She bought her house near Bolton in 2010 for Â£400,000, with ground rent of Â£295, doubling every 10 years. ""Throughout our years of campaigning against this leasehold scandal, Taylor Wimpey have repeatedly done the minimum they think they can get away with,"" she said. ""It's an early Christmas present for me to see that the CMA have finally forced them to do the right thing."" With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property, but they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold. However, leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. There were an estimated 4.6 million leasehold dwellings in England between 2019 and 2020, which equated to 19% of the English housing stock. More than two-thirds (3.2 million) of the leasehold dwellings were flats and 1.5 million were houses,official figures said.,external Taylor Wimpey had originally said it would replace the increasing ground rent contracts with rises pegged to the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation, but the CMA said that too was unfair and has now been stopped. The developer has also confirmed to the CMA that it has stopped selling leasehold properties with doubling ground rent clauses. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said Taylor Wimpey's action was ""a huge step forward"" for its leaseholders. He described the ground rent rises as ""totally unwarranted obligations that lead to people being trapped in their homes, struggling to sell or obtain a mortgage"". He added: ""Other developers and freehold investors should now do the right thing for homeowners and remove these problematic clauses from their contracts. ""If they refuse, we stand ready to step in and take further action - through the courts if necessary."" The CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. These were Countryside and Taylor Wimpey, for using ""possibly unfair contract terms"", and Barratt Developments and Persimmon Homes over the possible mis-selling of leasehold homes. Countryside and Persimmon have already agreed to make changes. The CMA's investigation into Barratt Developments is continuing. As part of its review of the leasehold sector, the CMA is also investigating two investment groups, Brigante Properties and Abacus Land and Adriatic Land. It wrote to the firms earlier this year setting out its concerns and requiring them to remove doubling ground rent terms from their contracts. Housing Secretary Michael Gove said: ""We continue our work to protect and support all leaseholders and our legislation to restrict ground rents in new leases to zero will put a stop to such unfair charges for future homeowners once and for all."" Labour says ministers need to go further and completely ban the selling of houses without a freehold.

Couzens, Sophie Williams, Matt Murphy and Mary OâConnor. The live page was edited by Chris
Clayton and Owen Amos. As ever, you can follow any major developments on the news site

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus updates from the
UK and around the world: Austrian hospitality settings, including Christmas markets, re-opened just 10 days ago after a three week lockdown in November Austria has announced pans to re-introduce coronavirus restrictions after Christmas, including a 10pm closing time for hospitality venues, in a bid to slow the spread
of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health officials have announced. The new closing time will be imposed on the hospitality
sector from 27 December and will remain in place for New Year's Eve, Covid-19 policy co-ordinator Katharina
Reich said during a press conference. She urged the public to celebrate the holiday in
small groups and with vaccinated people only. Reich also announced the classification of the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Norway as risk areas, meaning arrivals from the countries must go into
quarantine if they have not received a booster vaccination. Austria only emerged from a three-week lockdown 10 days ago but fears have been raised in recent days over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the country. The wave of Omicron appears to be milder according to preliminary studies published in the UK and South Africa. Early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment - potentially about a two-thirds reduction - than with other variants. The researchers said their findings were a ""qualified good news story"". However, the concern remains that even if Omicron is milder, the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm hospitals. A study in Scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital. It said that if Omicron behaved the same as Delta then they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already. At the moment there are only 15. However, the study is based on very few cases and had few people over age 65, who are most at risk of severe disease. Read the full storyhere. Smitha MundasadNews reporter Health
and care staff who test positive for coronavirus in England can now return to
work up to three days before their 10-day isolation period is complete - 
but must do extra tests, according tonew
guidance,external. Englandâs
health chiefs will be keeping their fingers crossed that the tweaked guidelines
go some way to maintaining staffing levels during a difficult winter while
limiting the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. According
to the document, if health and care staff are well, and no longer have any
symptoms, they can take lateral flow tests on day six and seven. If
negative â unlike most other adults - they are asked to test again on day eight, nine and 10. They
can return to work on day eight provided they have a negative lateral flow. But if
any of their lateral flow tests return a positive result they need to isolate
once more. Some
staff, particularly those working with patients most vulnerable to Covid, could
be asked to work in less risky areas until the original 10-day isolation period
is complete. Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. Ex-prime minister Tony Blair has described eligible people who are not vaccinated against Covid and have no medical reason not to get the jab as idiots. The former Labour PM tells Times Radio those who choose not to have a vaccine should not be targeted in a heavy-handed way but persuaded to have a jab. He says: ""There may be all sorts of reasons, but honestly it is in their own interest, never mind the public interest, for them to get vaccinated."" He also says the decision to vaccinate people under the age of 12 should have been taken ""some time ago"", adding: ""I don't know what we're waiting for."" He says he backs the government in not imposing further further restrictions before Christmas but describes the decision as ""incredibly difficult"" and a ""gamble"". This video can not be played 'Where is the PM?' Javid is asked During his visit to a hospital in south London earlier the health secretary was asked by a reporter whether the prime minister was ""in hiding"". Boris Johnson's most recent address to the nation yesterday came via a video statement uploaded to Twitter, rather than the traditional press conference format where he is asked questions by journalists. In his recent appearances, the prime minister has faced questions over reported gatherings in Downing Street when the country was under Covid restrictions. But Sajid Javid says Johnson ""couldn't be working harder"" and tht he is having meetings with the prime minister ""two or three times a day"". Wales' health minister says she plans to begin offering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds in the ""at risk"" group, after thatlatest recommendation from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation(JCVI). Eluned Morgan says she has accepted the JCVI's advice, adding that NHS Wales will start identifying eligible children in the new year, and people under the age of 18 will get a booster jab appointment when they become eligible. Baroness Morgan pledges that the ""appropriate information"" on the ""potential benefits and risks"" of having the jab will be shared with children, young people and their parents or guardians so they can make an informed choice. The recommendations by the scientific experts have to be officially approved by ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but this is normally a formality. As we reported earlier, the government's vaccine advisers have recommended that a low-dose Covid vaccine should be given to vulnerable children aged 5 to 11. But who is currently eligible for the vaccine?  What about boosters? InEnglandboosters are available to over 18s - as long as it's three months since their second dose. Boostersare also available to people aged 16 or over,externalwith a health condition that puts them at high risk of serious illness from Covid or if they care or live with someone at high risk. Boosters can be booked,externaltwo months after a second dose. Somewalk-in appointments may be available,external- depending on where you live. Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. As in England, boosterscan be booked online,external. Walesalso hopes tohit the end of December target. People should wait to be invited for their booster, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised. Northern Ireland'sbooster plan is also being accelerated. People aged 18 to 29will be able to go to walk-in hubs from Mondayand make booster appointments from Wednesday, 22 December. You can read morehere. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 238,350 or 58.9% in the past seven days, compared
with the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 2.7% in the last seven days, compared
with the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. You can read our full report on the latest figureshere. There have been a further 106,122 cases of coronavirus

"Maximum of six allowed to meet in Welsh pubsPremises will have to offer table service, face masks are to be worn and contact details collected.Wales","This video can not be played New restrictions for hospitality, retail and workplaces come into force on Boxing Day No more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales from 26 December. Two-metre social distancing rules will also return in public places. Licensed premises will have to offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected. Outdoor events will be limited to 50, with 30 indoors, but no restrictions were brought in for smaller meetings in private homes. First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to limit the amount of socialising they do and take a lateral flow tests before they go to meet other people. Wales' rules for fully-vaccinated people who are a contact of someone with coronavirus have been changed - with a switch to daily testing instead of self-isolation, including for the Omicron variant. Hospitality firms saidthe new hospitality rules could severely hit their businesses. Call to publish updated expert Covid advice Wales records highest number of daily cases Children at risk from Covid to get jab in Wales The changes come amid the spread of Omicron - 301 more cases have been found in Wales, bringing total to 941. But a senior Welsh Conservative warned some may struggle to understand the complexity of the new rules. Wales recorded its highest daily number of coronavirus caseson Wednesday, with 4,662 new cases and three deaths reported by Public Health Wales. Following the announcement, the Wales Millennium Centre and some other theatres announced they would close their doors from 26 December. Cardiff and Swansea's Winter Wonderlands both said they would close from from 20:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. Parkrun, which organises 5km runs every Saturday morning throughout the UK, has cancelled all of its events in Wales from 1 January onwards. However, as Welsh government rules on outdoor gatherings do not include children, junior Parkrun events will not be affected. Pubs face new restrictions - such as the rule of six - after Christmas Mr Drakeford announced the return to somealert level two restrictions,externalat a Welsh government press briefing. From 06:00: Social distancing rules apply in workplaces and public spaces, including cinemas, shops and theatres Restrictions apply in hospitality, including the rule of six for groups of customers, table service and mask wearing Large events will be restricted, with exceptions for smaller sports events where up to 50 spectators can gather, and exceptions for events involving children Nightclubs, originally planned to close on 27 December, will now shut a day earlier. But events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will not be subjected to the same limits. Mr Drakeford said the numbers that could attend sporting events would be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. There will be specific offence for having gatherings of more than 30 people in private homes. The first minister set no end date for the new restrictions but said he wanted them in place for the shortest possible time. New sports rules come into effect from Boxing Day Close contacts of people who have Covid will no longer have to self-isolate, provided they have been fully vaccinated, and will now have to take a lateral flow test instead. For most people, fully-vaccinated means they have had two jabs. Mr Drakeford has not gone as far as England,where people with Covid will now have to self-isolate for seven days instead of 10, providing they have a negative test result. Mr Drakeford said: ""A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious Omicron variant is headed our way. ""This new form of coronavirus could infect large numbers of people in Wales, disrupting daily lives and businesses and could cause an increase in the number of people who need hospital care in the coming weeks."" He said early action was needed to try and control the spread of Omicron, and it was a ""misunderstanding"" to think that if the variant was less severe ""that solves the problem"". ""If Omicron was even half as severe as Delta, because of the extra speed a which it's transmitted, that would buy you 48 hours before you see those numbers of people going in to hospital climb to the very steep numbers we have seen,"" he said. At a recalled Senedd meeting, he later added: ""We are quite definitely not on an unstoppable journey to lockdown."" Cardiff's Wales Millennium Centre said social distancing and restrictions on indoor events made it ""impossible for us to open the theatre in a way that provides a good audience experience and is economically viable"". It will cancel all showings from 26 December until 15 January. The city's New Theatre is also cancelling its pantomime from the same date. The Swansea Grand said its pantomime, Snow White, was cancelled from 26 December. Cinderella at Blackwood Miner's Institute will do the same. After several days of chopping and changing, ministers will hope today's announcement provides a sustainable way forward over the Christmas period. In imposing these restrictions, the first minister has gone further than the other home nations and he also has the cushion of Wales being behind both England and Scotland in the progress of the Omicron advance. What happens there over the next week will be instructive in terms of whether measures here can be tightened or relaxed going forward. Businesses want this to be as short lived as possible and it's possible that a sharp rise in cases could be followed by a sharp drop. The modelling has yet to be made public, but Mark Drakeford says it's the volume of potential that cases remains his major concern, both in terms of demand on the NHS and the impact on the workforce of our public services. Leader of the Tories in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, criticised the Welsh government's approach to announcing new restrictions over the past week. ""I would not have had the drip, drip, drip effect that has gone on over the last couple of days. ""People I speak to do want to adhere to the rules... but with the complexities that are coming out now it's going to be very difficult for people to understand exactly what their responsibility is going to be."" The rules may have to be ""firmed up"" again in the new year, said Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. He added: ""If nothing was done now, we'd be in real trouble in January. ""I am in no doubt that the seriousness of the threat we face means we have to take firm action."" The Senedd was recalled to hear from the first minister on the new measures on Wednesday, wherehe faced calls to publish the latest scientific advice. Wales now has some of the most stringent Covid restrictions in the UK. Measures are also being imposed inScotlandandNorthern Ireland. On different approaches by the nations, Mr Drakeford said UK ministers ""get all the advice that we get about the need to act and to act urgently in the light of the Omicron wave that is coming our way and is already there, in very, very significant numbers in London and in other parts of England. ""I think that the UK government is in a state of paralysis about all of this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has saidthere will be no new rules in Englandbefore Christmas, but ""can't rule out"" measures after then. No new Covid restrictions will be brought in for England before Christmas, the prime minister has said The Welsh government said a total of Â£120m will be made available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses. That includes Â£60m announced last week. But the first minister also repeated his calls for furlough arrangements to be put in place for the sectors most directly affected by restrictions. ""In order to go further, were that to become necessary, the Welsh government simply does not have the financial fire power or even the practical ways of getting help to people who might not be able to be in work - for that we need the help of the UK government,"" he added. The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out The Welsh government had already announced some restrictions it plans to impose after Christmas, with sports eventsgoing behind closed doors, including Cardiff v Scarlets on 26 December and the Welsh Grand National. But up to 50 people can still watch grassroots or junior team sports. There had been some confusion following an announcement earlier this week that sports events would have to be played behind closed doors from 26 December. Workerscould face fines of Â£60if they are not working from home with good reason. ""They are designed to protect workers, not to punish them,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""When these same rules were there earlier in the pandemic, no fines were issued at all."" But Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said that was inaccurate. ""At the time all of Wales was under a stay at home mandate, while at the present time the guidance only applies to certain employers and employees,"" she said.

Post-Christmas Covid rules in Wales to be laid out,"Sara Bailey said news of possible new restrictions was ""disheartening"" Plans for Covid rules after Christmas in Wales will be announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford on Wednesday. His government expects several thousand Omicron cases by 26 December, and says more restrictions are needed to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. Measures could include table service, social distancing and a rule of six in pubs and restaurants. Limits on indoor mixing, including a return to household bubbles, could also be on the cards. But it is not clear whether households will simply be advised to limit socialising, or told to through new laws. Omicron was described as ""truly awful"" by Public Health Wales' National Director of Health Protection and Screening Services Dr Fu-Meng Khaw. Which restrictions could Wales face? More Covid rules needed in Wales, minister says No new Covid rules for England before Christmas He believes hospital admissions will continue to rise ""over the coming days and weeks"", adding: ""People point towards London and what is happening there where they are a couple of weeks at least ahead of us here in Wales."" But Dr Khaw said the vaccination rate is lower in London and urged everyone to have a jab, saying: ""It's fair to say we cannot say with any certainty what might happen."" Sara Bailey who runs Hot Gossip Cafe in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf called it ""a bit disheartening"". ""I think the problem is the theory that when they introduce these restrictions, they seemed reluctant to lift again, regardless of any improvement in the situation,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Despite the uncertainty, Ms Bailey has not see a drop off in custom, adding: ""If there had been any sort of anxiety, it's more to do with how to abide by isolation rules over the Christmas weekend on missing out on family celebrations."" Pub manager Heidi Bakewell is awaiting news on how New Year's Eve will look like Heidi Bakewell, who manages Y Bryncynan in Pwllheli, Gwynedd, said the premises continued offering table service following previous restrictions because customers liked it. ""It would be a bit easier for us as pubs if that guidance and everything came out a bit sooner rather than later to prevent us over-ordering and being able to get all the material we need printed up with all the guidelines on,"" she added. While the pub has bookings for New Year's Eve, no money has been taken yet, with Ms Bakewell adding: ""Just because of all the hassle of ringing round everybody and refunding the money, and it makes everything so much harder order wise again."" Although the changes would be implemented after Christmas, it is not clear precisely when. But ministers are not expected to announce the kind of stay-at-home lockdown restrictions seen last Christmas. Mark Drakeford will hold a press conference around lunchtime The number of identified Omicron cases in Wales grew by 204 on Tuesday to 640. A press conference will be held early on Wednesday afternoon, followed by a statement by Mr Drakeford in the Senedd, which has been recalled from its Christmas recess. Meanwhile, people infected with Covid in Englandcan stop self-isolating up to three days earlyif they test negative twice, it has been announced. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We will consider the updated medical advice and whether this means our self-isolation requirements should be amended."" People in England will now be able to end quarantine after seven days instead of 10 by providing negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven The government has already announced some restrictions it plans to impose after Christmas. From 27 Decembernightclubs will shut, and workplaces and shops will be required to implement two metre social distancing. Workerscould face fines of Â£60if they are not working from home with good reason, and on 26 December spectators will be banned from attending sporting fixtures, In Scotland, limits on the size of events are being imposed from 26 December. Pubs could face new restrictions - such as the rule of six - after Christmas Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there will be no measures in Englandbefore Christmas, but has not ruled them out afterwards. Ministers have urged people in Wales toexercise cautionin the run-up to Christmas. It issued ""strong guidance"" for people to leave a day between social events and to meet outdoors over Christmas. Hospitality firms have been hit by loss of custom through cancellations and a drop in trade, and have been seeking more government support. David Chapman, Wales director of Hospitality UK, said clarity about restrictions and finance was needed. He hoped any new restrictions would still allow the industry to continue trading in some shape. ""It will make it much harder with measures in place, and even then, for many it will cause a loss in profit even though they can stay open."" On Tuesday Chancellor Rishi Sunak set out measures in England to help the hospitality sector, including cash grants of up to Â£6,000per premises for each eligible firm. Mr Chapman welcomed the move and said it would not save businesses but would keep the ""wolf from the door this winter"". He wants to see similar support in Wales. On Tuesday Welsh Conservative Senedd group leader Andrew RT Davies warned that the ""drip, drip effect of releasing restrictions by press release risks undermining public confidence at such an important time of the year for families and businesses"".

Which restrictions could Wales face next?,"We have now had weeks and weeks of dire warnings about the oncoming Omicron wave. First Minister Mark Drakeford has described it as both a ""tsunami"" and a ""storm"" heading our way. But given the tough words from ministers and officials, many expected them to go further at last week's review of coronavirus restrictions. Nightclubs were ordered to closeas of 27 December and social distancing restrictions reintroduced in workplaces - but no limits on social contact were introduced. Despite how limited it looks compared to the lockdowns of 2020 and early 2021, the Welsh government has taken the most severe action of any UK nation so far. And it is not the end of the story. On Tuesday, the Welsh governmentbanned spectators from sports events, starting on Boxing Day, and cabinet meetings continue to consider whether more rules are required. What could come next? We do not know for certain, but there is a big list of things ministers could choose from. No fans 'devastating' for Welsh sport Omicron 'storm' warning prompts nightclub closures Warning Wales could see 'tsunami' of Omicron cases It's a dilemma. There's a lack of information on Omicron, especially its severity. Politicians are aware that the public is weary of restrictions, particularly for a second Christmas of disruption, so it's difficult to intervene without hard data to support that decision. But SAGE advisers have repeatedly warned that it's better to ""go early"" in imposing restrictions if they are to have maximum impact. In areas where community transmission is high, it's estimated Omicron cases will be doubling as quickly as between 1.5 to three days. Even if only a small percentage of people eventually become seriously ill - if the numbers of cases are very large it could very quickly lead to big pressures on the NHS. Experts will be looking at the situation in London and Scotland as an indicator of what could soon come. But deciding on whether to bring in restrictions is always a balance between dealing with the current risk of the virus itself and other harms on things like the economy and people's mental health. Before last Friday it seemed likely ministers would reimpose restrictions on social contact as a way to tackle the new variant. Wales has not had legal restrictions on social mixing since the summer. After comments from Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, it seemed possible that household bubbles or the rule of six indoors may be back on the horizon. Neither emerged, but Mr Drakeford did not rule out their return. On Sunday, Mr Drakeford suggested that table service and compulsory contact tracing could return. They were measures used to try to make dining and drinking safer, but the prospects of restricted trading that requires extra staffing and potentially fewer takings will fill the industry with concern. The sector has already taken a hit from Omicron as punters stay away - they would want to see financial support if they are required to trade in tougher conditions. Sara Bailey, owner of the Hot Gossip coffee shop in Treorchy, says it was an ""anxious"" time. ""You try and keep a smile on your face because it is Christmas and everyone is happy that we are open but it's not clear how long that will last so there is just this big cloud hanging over and that is the same for everyone in hospitality."" Ms Bailey says any changes, particularly limits on the numbers of people who can meet, would have a big impact on businesses like hers with limited space. ""Social distancing is the enemy of hospitality and the entertainment industry. It's very difficult because people want to get together,"" she added. It is not know if cinemas will face new rules We don't know. It is not something that had to close under alert level two - which the Welsh government is thought to be looking at. So far, ministers have said nothing about whether they may force the sectors to shut shop. At this stage, it seems unlikely Welsh ministers will put the country into a stay-at-home lockdown right now. Wales has the lowest Omicron rates of any of the UK nation, although a peak is expected later in January. The conversation may change if the speculated circuit breaker, considered by the UK government for England, comes to fruition, and more support is offered to Wales. What Mark Drakeford does may be influenced by what Boris Johnson chooses to do While, in theory, Mr Drakeford can act independently, in practice he is restricted. That is because the money for big support for business would need to come from the UK government. There, the UK government is waiting to see if spikes in cases in London translated into big hospital numbers. Ministers there are reportedly split on the need for tougher restrictions, and are waiting for more data on severity. But if the UK government took as big a step as a circuit breaker, with the kind of support seen for businesses in previous lockdowns, that would give Mr Drakeford more room to move.

"Cancel culture could wipe out comedy, says LipmanThe actress says comedians fear being cancelled as a poll finds Britons often censor their opinions.","Dame Maureen Lipman: ""Sooner or later the cancellers will win"" Dame Maureen Lipman has said comedy is in danger of being ""wiped out"" due to fears over being cancelled. She told the BBC she believes comedians are now so worried about offending, ""a revolution"" is taking place. ""It's in the balance whether we will ever be funny again,"" she said. Her comments come as more than half of Britons say they have stopped themselves from expressing political and social views for fear of being judged. A YouGov poll seen exclusively by the BBC found 57% of those asked said they censor themselves on issues including immigration and trans rights, particularly if their views are deemed at the less politically correct end of the spectrum. YouGov questioned 1,677 people in mid November to find out their views on what's become known as ""cancel culture"". It is a term, first used in the US, to describe attempts to block or ""cancel"" people or groups with certain viewpoints. While only a third (35%) of those polled said they knew what cancel culture was, many more effectively said they felt cancelled from time to time. The less politically correct the views held, the more likely people were to say they feel shouted down. They are most likely to keep quiet about what they really think when they are with people they've just met (49%) or are at work (40%), according to the data. A third (31%) also self-censor with friends, a fifth (21%) with family. Russell Kane says it's ""complete nonsense"" that comedians are sacrificing being funny for fear of cancellation The cultural world often reflects what's happening in real life. I met Dame Maureen in Manchester, where she was filming Coronation Street. She told me: ""Cancel culture, this cancelling, this punishment, it's everywhere. Punishment. An eye for an eye. 'You said that, therefore you must never work again.' Sooner or later the cancellers will win."" She highlighted the world of comedy, which she claims is in danger of being ""wiped out"" because comedians fear audiences will take offence so they tone down their material. It's a dramatic prediction. ""Something has to be forbidden to make you laugh, really belly laugh. It's when you shouldn't be laughing,"" she said. ""All the things that have been cancelled out by being correct are, I'm afraid, all the things that make people laugh."" But is she right? Many comedians say their industry is in fine - and funny - form. Nobody is being censored, they claim. And in the end, it is audiences who decide what's funny and what's offensive. Take comedian Russell Kane, who knows a thing or two about cancellation. He presents Radio 4's Evil Genius, which each week takes a different figure from history and decides, based on their actions, whether they should be saved or cancelled. Services such as TweetDelete can reduce the chances of someone being cancelled for previously expressed opinions He told me it's ""complete nonsense"" that comedians are sacrificing being funny because they don't want to be cancelled. ""I don't think anyone is saying you can't be offended, nobody is saying that, what we're saying is you can't use hate speech that would prompt a gender-related crime, a sex-related crime or a race-related crime."" ""There's been a massive, much needed shift in the conversation around gender, around men's attitudes to women, around consent. Society has moved on."" However, he does think he and his fellow comedians worry about being cancelled for things they might have said in the past which have since become less acceptable. ""I signed up for a website called TweetDelete and all my posts that are older than six months have gone. It's a bit of self-protection."" The whole issue of ""cancel culture"" and whether it really exists is contentious. In one corner are those who claim that a new, judgmental world exists, particularly on social media, which leads to censorship and puts freedom of speech under attack. Recently, London's Old Vic theatreannounced it would not be staginga planned production of Sondheim's Into the Woods, co-directed by Terry Gilliam. The former Monty Python star claimed on social media that the Old Vic was ""intimidated"" into cancelling the show by what he called ""a small group of closed-minded, humour averse ideologues"" because, he said, he recommended his Facebook followers watch a show by the comedian Dave Chappelle. Dave Chappelle was criticised by some for his comments on trans issues Chappelle has been accused of making anti-transgender comments in a Netflix special. The Old Vic says the decision not to put on Into the Woods was ""mutually agreed"" and wished the show ""well for its future life"".  The musical will now open at the Theatre Royal in Bath instead. In the other corner of the debate are those who argue that calling people out for views that are deemed offensive is a form of social justice. They point out that the people who complain about being cancelled are very often celebrities with huge platforms to air their views and while they still have their voices listened to, it's the opposing arguments that have for too long gone unheard. They say this is about creating a kinder, more tolerant world. The Harry Potter author JK Rowling is the most high-profile celebrity to find her views under attack. She has beenaccused of transphobiaby those who say her views discriminate against trans people. She says she is ""speaking up for women's sex-based rights"". According to those polled by YouGov, nearly a third (29%) of people who hold gender critical views said they always or mostly don't say what they really think when they are talking about this controversial topic. Other difficult areas where the people polled said they don't speak freely are those who believe immigration has been a bad thing for the UK (one third - 33% - of people who held that view said they keep quiet about it). Author JK Rowling is one of the most high-profile people to have been caught in the so-called culture wars A fifth of people who believe women have things as good as men in the UK feel they can't say it. I asked Russell Kane specifically about the poll's findings. ""I don't believe freedom of speech is under threat,"" he said. ""Why would we want to use hateful language? Why should we tolerate it? I think there's a lot of people with much more extreme views, illegal views, hate crime provoking views, who are driving this narrative that those with moderate concerns about immigration, for example, can't say it."" He believes it's being driven by people on the right and left, who are ""trying to create culture wars at either end of the spectrum"". Simon Fanshawe co-founded Stonewall, though he has been publicly critical of the LGBTQ+ charity's current approach to campaigning. He has recently published a book, The Power of Difference, and believes we are facing a crisis of dialogue. He told the BBC: ""At Stonewall, we only ever talked to people we didn't agree with.  When somebody says something, you need to argue with it even if you think it's offensive or damaging or hurtful. That's the only way to get them to change their minds. ""What the poll is telling us is that the inability to discuss differences is seeping into every area of our lives. Even with friends, a third don't express their opinions. Divisions are being exacerbated. We need to try and bridge those divides."" The consequences for society are difficult to measure, especially when cancel culture and censorship have become political pawns in a polarised debate. Much of the argument is around whether freedom of speech is under attack from a new ""woke"" agenda. YouGov's poll suggests younger generations particularly prioritise preventing hateful offensive speech over being able to say what you want. These tensions get to the heart of the so-called culture wars. Some will argue people are being silenced, others that outdated views are simply being weeded out, in real life and in comedy too. Ricky Gervais has joked that the woke generation will eventually in turn be cancelled by the next generation Comedian Ricky Gervais recently said: ""I want to live long enough to see the younger generation not be woke enough for the next generation. It's going to happen. Don't they realise that, it's like, they're next. That's what's funny."" The YouGov poll shared with the BBC suggests younger people are more confident their views won't age than older respondents. While nearly half (47%) of the oldest Britons expect future generations to take a dim view of some of their views, only one in three (36%) 18-24 year olds feel the same way. Will they be proved right - or will Ricky Gervais have the last laugh?

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus updates from the
UK and around the world: Austrian hospitality settings, including Christmas markets, re-opened just 10 days ago after a three week lockdown in November Austria has announced pans to re-introduce coronavirus restrictions after Christmas, including a 10pm closing time for hospitality venues, in a bid to slow the spread
of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health officials have announced. The new closing time will be imposed on the hospitality
sector from 27 December and will remain in place for New Year's Eve, Covid-19 policy co-ordinator Katharina
Reich said during a press conference. She urged the public to celebrate the holiday in
small groups and with vaccinated people only. Reich also announced the classification of the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Norway as risk areas, meaning arrivals from the countries must go into
quarantine if they have not received a booster vaccination. Austria only emerged from a three-week lockdown 10 days ago but fears have been raised in recent days over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the country. The wave of Omicron appears to be milder according to preliminary studies published in the UK and South Africa. Early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment - potentially about a two-thirds reduction - than with other variants. The researchers said their findings were a ""qualified good news story"". However, the concern remains that even if Omicron is milder, the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm hospitals. A study in Scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital. It said that if Omicron behaved the same as Delta then they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already. At the moment there are only 15. However, the study is based on very few cases and had few people over age 65, who are most at risk of severe disease. Read the full storyhere. Smitha MundasadNews reporter Health
and care staff who test positive for coronavirus in England can now return to
work up to three days before their 10-day isolation period is complete - 
but must do extra tests, according tonew
guidance,external. Englandâs
health chiefs will be keeping their fingers crossed that the tweaked guidelines
go some way to maintaining staffing levels during a difficult winter while
limiting the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. According
to the document, if health and care staff are well, and no longer have any
symptoms, they can take lateral flow tests on day six and seven. If
negative â unlike most other adults - they are asked to test again on day eight, nine and 10. They
can return to work on day eight provided they have a negative lateral flow. But if
any of their lateral flow tests return a positive result they need to isolate
once more. Some
staff, particularly those working with patients most vulnerable to Covid, could
be asked to work in less risky areas until the original 10-day isolation period
is complete. Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. Ex-prime minister Tony Blair has described eligible people who are not vaccinated against Covid and have no medical reason not to get the jab as idiots. The former Labour PM tells Times Radio those who choose not to have a vaccine should not be targeted in a heavy-handed way but persuaded to have a jab. He says: ""There may be all sorts of reasons, but honestly it is in their own interest, never mind the public interest, for them to get vaccinated."" He also says the decision to vaccinate people under the age of 12 should have been taken ""some time ago"", adding: ""I don't know what we're waiting for."" He says he backs the government in not imposing further further restrictions before Christmas but describes the decision as ""incredibly difficult"" and a ""gamble"". This video can not be played 'Where is the PM?' Javid is asked During his visit to a hospital in south London earlier the health secretary was asked by a reporter whether the prime minister was ""in hiding"". Boris Johnson's most recent address to the nation yesterday came via a video statement uploaded to Twitter, rather than the traditional press conference format where he is asked questions by journalists. In his recent appearances, the prime minister has faced questions over reported gatherings in Downing Street when the country was under Covid restrictions. But Sajid Javid says Johnson ""couldn't be working harder"" and tht he is having meetings with the prime minister ""two or three times a day"". Wales' health minister says she plans to begin offering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds in the ""at risk"" group, after thatlatest recommendation from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation(JCVI). Eluned Morgan says she has accepted the JCVI's advice, adding that NHS Wales will start identifying eligible children in the new year, and people under the age of 18 will get a booster jab appointment when they become eligible. Baroness Morgan pledges that the ""appropriate information"" on the ""potential benefits and risks"" of having the jab will be shared with children, young people and their parents or guardians so they can make an informed choice. The recommendations by the scientific experts have to be officially approved by ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but this is normally a formality. As we reported earlier, the government's vaccine advisers have recommended that a low-dose Covid vaccine should be given to vulnerable children aged 5 to 11. But who is currently eligible for the vaccine?  What about boosters? InEnglandboosters are available to over 18s - as long as it's three months since their second dose. Boostersare also available to people aged 16 or over,externalwith a health condition that puts them at high risk of serious illness from Covid or if they care or live with someone at high risk. Boosters can be booked,externaltwo months after a second dose. Somewalk-in appointments may be available,external- depending on where you live. Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. As in England, boosterscan be booked online,external. Walesalso hopes tohit the end of December target. People should wait to be invited for their booster, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised. Northern Ireland'sbooster plan is also being accelerated. People aged 18 to 29will be able to go to walk-in hubs from Mondayand make booster appointments from Wednesday, 22 December. You can read morehere. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 238,350 or 58.9% in the past seven days, compared
with the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 2.7% in the last seven days, compared
with the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. You can read our full report on the latest figureshere. There have been a further 106,122 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government
figures,external. It is the first time more than 100,000 cases have been reported in a single day. And
there have been another 140 deaths, of people who had tested
positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. BBC Radio 5 Live Emma Downey is co-owner of Tides Kitchen and Wine Bar in Newport, Pembrokeshire. She tells5 Liveâs Naga Munchettytighter restrictions on hospitality in Wales mean she will have to close the restaurant side of her business. âWe knew it was coming,â she says. âWe knew something was going to changeâ¦ but the damage has already been done in the past week. âI feel completely despondent today, weâll honour our bookings for next week to include New Yearâs Eve, but after that weâll close the restaurant side of the business until we can open with some normality."" Nightclubs in Northern Ireland will have to close on 27 December as fresh restrictions are imposed to tackle the Omicron Covid variant, BBC News NI understands. Stormont ministershave been meeting to agree measuresto help manage rising Covid cases across Northern Ireland. It is understood they are also likely to agree tighter restrictions on hospitality including table service and limits on numbers at tables. Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected as â100% incorrectâ social media claims that its
director general thinks Covid vaccine boosters are being used to kill children. A brief clip from Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusâs press
briefing on Monday is being promoted by online anti-vaccine activists as
evidence that vaccinating children is deadly. Addressing the rollout of Covid vaccine boosters, he said
vaccinating old and vulnerable groups in developing nations was a higher
priority than offering booster shots to children in high income nations. âItâs better to focus on those groups who have the risk of
severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to
give boosters to children, which is not right,â Dr Tedros said. However, he stumbles on his words at the end, which makes it
appear as though he is suggesting booster jabs âkill childrenâ. A WHO spokesperson told the BBC that
Dr Ghebreyesus âgot stuck on the first syllable âchilâ and
it came out sounding like âcil/kil'. âHe repeated the same
syllable, with it coming out âcil-childrenâ. Any other interpretation of this
is 100% incorrect.â Nigeria has destroyed more than one million doses of coronavirus vaccines, saying  international donors delivered the vials just before their expiry date, sparing little time for distribution around the country. The AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Nigeria over the course of October, but expired the next month authorities said. At a dump site in Abuja, a bulldozer crushed the shots which were packed in cardboard boxes and plastic as
reporters and health officials watched. AstraZeneca doses can normally be stored safely for at least six months from the time of manufacture, under suitable conditions. But Nigeria's health minister Osagie Ehanire told the BBC earlier this month that the late delivery ""left us very short time, some just weeks, to use them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to users"". New coronavirus infections have increased by over 500% in the past two weeks in Africa's most populous nation, where just 4% of the 200 million strong population are fully vaccinated. An early assessment of the Omicron variant in South Africa suggests the risk of severe disease may be lower than with earlier strains of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was carried out by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and found that people diagnosed with Omicron in South Africa between 1 October and and 30 November were 80% less likely to be admitted to hospital than
those diagnosed with other variants over the same period. But the authors stressed that some of the findings may be attributed to higher levels of population immunity caused by vaccinations and past infections, and stressed that further research is needed. It is estimated that 60-70% of South Africans have had a prior coronavirus infection. ""Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive
story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other
variants,"" Professor Cheryl Cohen of the NICD said. ""What is unclear is whether the picture will be similar in
countries where there are high levels of vaccination but very
low levels of previous infection,"" she added. Results of a major study released by Imperial College London last week found that there are no indications that Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, although data on hospitalisations remains very limited and the study has not been peer reviewed. France has become the first country to announce publicly that it has cancelled its order for Merck & Co's Covid-19 antiviral drug following the publication of disappointing trial data. Merck released results from trials at the end of November which suggested the drug was markedly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalisations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by just 30%. French officials had placed an order for 50,000 doses of the drug molnupiravir. But Health Minister Olivier Veran told local media that the ""latest studies weren't good"" and added that the cancellation would not incur any cost. France will instead order an antiviral drug manufactured by the American pharmaceuticals manufacturer Pfizer, which studies suggest cuts the risk of severe illness and death by 90%. Several other European countries, including Germany and Italy, have also placed orders for Merck's pill and it remains unclear whether they will continue with the purchase. A record 968,665 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were reported in the UK on Tuesday, new figures show. The previous record was 940,606 doses on Saturday. More than 30.8 million booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 6.1 million in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK's four health agencies. We've just brought you news of the JCVI's recommendation that vulnerable primary school aged children should be offered low-dose Covid vaccines. We've got a bit more detail on what that might mean. A low-dose version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for five to 11-year-olds has just been approved for use in the UK after being deemed safe and effective. It contains one-third of the adult dose and should be given eight weeks apart. But despite the recommendation, a final decision on vaccinating this age group has not yet been made. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said: ""Parents and carers can be reassured that no new vaccine for children would have been approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met."" The JCVI also recommended booster doses be offered to: â¢	Children aged aged 16 and 17(the JCVI recommended they be allowed a second dose last month),external â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 if they are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 who have a severely weakened immune system should get four doses Â© 2025 BBC.

Post-Christmas restrictions amid Omicron spread,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been laying out changes to Covid rules to come in after Christmas Day He had already announced the closure of nightclubs and that social distancing requirements would return No fans are allowed to go to sporting events as of Boxing Day, 26 December A maximum of six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales from the same day Two-metre social distancing rules are to return in public places and places of work Licensed premises will have to offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected Outdoor events will be limited to 50, with 30 indoors, but weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will not be subject to the rules Close contacts of people who have Covid will no longer have to self-isolate provided they have been fully vaccinated The rules on mixing are guidance rather than law, first minister says The Welsh Conservatives criticise the Welsh government's ""drip, drip, drip"" approach, while Plaid supported the new restrictions Public Health Wales has reported 4,662 new cases of coronavirus - the highest recorded in a 24-hour period since the start of the pandemic Tyler Edwards and Caleb Spencer Thanks for being with us as we brought you the latest news as it happened from the Welsh government's Covid press briefing.

Liz Loughlin, from Mold, in Flintshire, said she would be happy to ask her guests to take lateral-flow tests (LFTs) before they come to her home. On the guidance, she said: âI will be following it. âPeople will do what they want to do anyway. Itâs just common sense really. You go with your own instinct.â Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""I am in no doubt that the seriousness of the threat we face means we have to take firm action. ""It's a balance between those very, very firm actions and the need to look after people's wellbeing and the wellbeing of the economy."" He said the rules may have to be ""firmed up"" again in the new year and stressed the need to remain cautious. ""If nothing was done now, we'd be in real trouble in January,"" he added. The Welsh government has outlined âfive simple measuresâ for people visiting other people's homes. They are: Leader of the Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, has criticised the Welsh government's approach to announcing restrictions in a ""drip, drip, drip"" effect over the past week. He said it makes it hard for people to ""understand exactly their responsibility"" when they ""do want to adhere to the rules"". ""I do take issue with the point the first minister addressed about the workplace fines where now you'll be able to go to the pub without a fine, but you'll get fined if you go into work,"" said Mr Davies. But Mr Davies accepted people taking personal responsibility was how the country will overcome the virus. There are 4,662 new cases of coronavirus today and three people have died, Public Health Wales (PHW) has reported. It brings the total number of cases in Wales to 566,995, and the number of deaths reported by PHW to 6,525. A PHW spokesman said today's case numbers were the
highest reported in a 24-hour period - but added that because of the way the figures
are collated, the data is provisional - and doesn't necessarily reflect the
number of new cases today. Read more about the Covid-19 situation in Wales by clickinghere. The first minister said he would see his children and their families on different days over Christmas because of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said they were following Welsh government advice to âspace outâ visits of friends and relatives. âMy own daughter will be coming with her family to see us and theyâll come on one day,"" he explained. âMy son and family will come, but theyâll come on a different day. âYou can have a good Christmas at the same time if you do things carefully.â Simon Buckley, owner of Plas Hafod in Gwernymynydd, Mold, said the business had already been badly affected by the uncertainty surrounding Omicron. His bookings for lunch today have dropped from 100 to 18, and suggested he may have to close in January after today's announcement. âWeâre still not getting cold hard advice about what if what to,"" said Mr Buckley. ""Theyâve put the rule of six in - thatâs going to affect us as we have families in and functions and birthday parties - it will hit our revenue."" He added: ""We normally do 20 big functions but weâve done three."" If new Covid rules reduce the number of cases, no new restrictions will be needed in the New Year, Mark Drakeford suggested. âThatâs why weâve moved early, earlier than other parts of the United Kingdom,â he said. âThatâs why these changes kick in straight after Christmas, and if they have the intended effect it will mitigate the risk that we will need to do more.â Allow Twitter content?

He said decisions take into account advice from the Welsh government's own expert Technical Advisory Group (TAG), a report from Walesâ Chief Medical Officer, as well as information from SAGE, the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group. ""What we are seeing is... the number of new cases is accelerating every day, where the doubling time means those cases will be in thousands within a short number of days and where the impact on people becoming so ill to be in hospital is very significant indeed.

Gareth Evans, manager at Baravin restaurant in Aberystwyth, said he was expecting some of the measures introduced today, but others would hit the business hard. A maximum of six people will be allowed to meet in pubs and restaurants from 26 December, and people will be required to observe social distancing. ""The 2m rule is the one that is going to be crippling to us,"" said Mr Evans. ""This Christmas hasnât been what it was meant to be with cancellations, and we are going to lose 24 seats with the 2m [rule] and these 24 seats are crucial for us as a business in quiet times.â Advice has been given to limit household mixing and use lateral flow tests beforehand, with a specific offence for having gatherings of more than 30 people. But a maximum of three households meeting at the same time would be a ""rule of thumb"" for people to follow, Mr Drakeford said. ""We will be relying on guidance for the way that people behave in their own private lives."" He said this was possible because of the booster and vaccination programme and the availability of lateral flow tests. The re-introduction of fines for unnecessarily going in to work is designed to protect workers rather than punish them, the first minister said. From Monday, workers could get a Â£60 fixed penalty notice and companies can be fined Â£1,000 every time they break the rules. Until now there has just been guidance encouraging home working. Mr Drakeford said: âThey are not some new set of rules. âThey are designed to protect workers, not to punish them. When these same rules were there earlier in the pandemic, no fines were issued at all.â The purpose of the rules are to give legal protection to workers who feel they are being unfairly forced to come in to work, he added. The first minister repeated his calls for furlough arrangements to be put in place for the sectors most directly affected by restrictions. He said the Welsh government ""simply does not have the financial fire power"" to help those who may not be able to work. It would need the help of the UK government, he said. âI joined my colleagues in Scotland and Northern Ireland in calling on the Treasury to put those furlough arrangements in place for the sectors that are most directly affected by the extra protections that will need to be there when they reopen after Christmas.â Mr Drakeford said Â£120m will be available for nightclubs, events, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses affected by the move to Alert Level Two. He said that is double the new funding of Â£60m announced last week. There would be a specific offence for large gatherings in private homes, the first minister said. Mark Drakeford said he wanted the measures announced today to be in place for the shortest possible time. He said they will be kept âvery regularlyâ under review. Welsh coronavirus rules are usually reviewed every three weeks, but that has since changed to weekly. Mark Drakeford said the cabinet had decided not to make new legal rules on indoor mixing, but said there would be updated guidance. âWe are doing this because we are in a different position this year than the position we faced the last time we saw coronavirus rise in this way,â he said, citing lateral-flow tests and vaccines. âWe have all learned a great deal about how we can best protect ourselves and others.""

Post-Christmas Covid rules in Wales to be laid outHospitality table service and indoor mixing limits could follow as ministers want more restrictions.Wales politicsComments,"Sara Bailey said news of possible new restrictions was ""disheartening"" Plans for Covid rules after Christmas in Wales will be announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford on Wednesday. His government expects several thousand Omicron cases by 26 December, and says more restrictions are needed to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. Measures could include table service, social distancing and a rule of six in pubs and restaurants. Limits on indoor mixing, including a return to household bubbles, could also be on the cards. But it is not clear whether households will simply be advised to limit socialising, or told to through new laws. Omicron was described as ""truly awful"" by Public Health Wales' National Director of Health Protection and Screening Services Dr Fu-Meng Khaw. Which restrictions could Wales face? More Covid rules needed in Wales, minister says No new Covid rules for England before Christmas He believes hospital admissions will continue to rise ""over the coming days and weeks"", adding: ""People point towards London and what is happening there where they are a couple of weeks at least ahead of us here in Wales."" But Dr Khaw said the vaccination rate is lower in London and urged everyone to have a jab, saying: ""It's fair to say we cannot say with any certainty what might happen."" Sara Bailey who runs Hot Gossip Cafe in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf called it ""a bit disheartening"". ""I think the problem is the theory that when they introduce these restrictions, they seemed reluctant to lift again, regardless of any improvement in the situation,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Despite the uncertainty, Ms Bailey has not see a drop off in custom, adding: ""If there had been any sort of anxiety, it's more to do with how to abide by isolation rules over the Christmas weekend on missing out on family celebrations."" Pub manager Heidi Bakewell is awaiting news on how New Year's Eve will look like Heidi Bakewell, who manages Y Bryncynan in Pwllheli, Gwynedd, said the premises continued offering table service following previous restrictions because customers liked it. ""It would be a bit easier for us as pubs if that guidance and everything came out a bit sooner rather than later to prevent us over-ordering and being able to get all the material we need printed up with all the guidelines on,"" she added. While the pub has bookings for New Year's Eve, no money has been taken yet, with Ms Bakewell adding: ""Just because of all the hassle of ringing round everybody and refunding the money, and it makes everything so much harder order wise again."" Although the changes would be implemented after Christmas, it is not clear precisely when. But ministers are not expected to announce the kind of stay-at-home lockdown restrictions seen last Christmas. Mark Drakeford will hold a press conference around lunchtime The number of identified Omicron cases in Wales grew by 204 on Tuesday to 640. A press conference will be held early on Wednesday afternoon, followed by a statement by Mr Drakeford in the Senedd, which has been recalled from its Christmas recess. Meanwhile, people infected with Covid in Englandcan stop self-isolating up to three days earlyif they test negative twice, it has been announced. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We will consider the updated medical advice and whether this means our self-isolation requirements should be amended."" People in England will now be able to end quarantine after seven days instead of 10 by providing negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven The government has already announced some restrictions it plans to impose after Christmas. From 27 Decembernightclubs will shut, and workplaces and shops will be required to implement two metre social distancing. Workerscould face fines of Â£60if they are not working from home with good reason, and on 26 December spectators will be banned from attending sporting fixtures, In Scotland, limits on the size of events are being imposed from 26 December. Pubs could face new restrictions - such as the rule of six - after Christmas Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there will be no measures in Englandbefore Christmas, but has not ruled them out afterwards. Ministers have urged people in Wales toexercise cautionin the run-up to Christmas. It issued ""strong guidance"" for people to leave a day between social events and to meet outdoors over Christmas. Hospitality firms have been hit by loss of custom through cancellations and a drop in trade, and have been seeking more government support. David Chapman, Wales director of Hospitality UK, said clarity about restrictions and finance was needed. He hoped any new restrictions would still allow the industry to continue trading in some shape. ""It will make it much harder with measures in place, and even then, for many it will cause a loss in profit even though they can stay open."" On Tuesday Chancellor Rishi Sunak set out measures in England to help the hospitality sector, including cash grants of up to Â£6,000per premises for each eligible firm. Mr Chapman welcomed the move and said it would not save businesses but would keep the ""wolf from the door this winter"". He wants to see similar support in Wales. On Tuesday Welsh Conservative Senedd group leader Andrew RT Davies warned that the ""drip, drip effect of releasing restrictions by press release risks undermining public confidence at such an important time of the year for families and businesses"".

Arsenal fan token posts broke advertising rules,"A web page and a Facebook post by Arsenal football club promoting crypto-based fan tokens broke advertising rules, a watchdog has ruled. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) argued the club had ""failed to illustrate the risk of the investment"". It ruled ""the ads must not appear again in the form complained about"". Arsenal said it would seek an independent review of the ruling, adding that the club had provided information on the financial risks. Several top-tier football clubs offer fan tokens. But critics, including some supporters' groups, suggest that clubs who promote crypto fan tokens are encouraging people to engage in the risky, and largely unregulated, world of cryptocurrency investment. The ASA ruled against two promotions of Arsenal's fan tokens ($AFC). The first breach, according to the watchdog, focused on contenton Arsenal's official website,external- in particular a page posted on 6 August 2021 with the title '$AFC Fan Token: Everything you need to know'. The second breach was a Facebook post on the club's official page, posted on 12 August 2021, which read: '$AFC is now live' and asked fans: ""What song do you want to hear when we win? Download the Socios app to get your token and vote"". Football fans spending millions on crypto-tokens NFT-based fantasy football cards raise $680m Watchdog bans seven ads in crypto 'red alert' In its ruling, the ASA investigated three issues concerning the post and website text, arguing they were: irresponsible - because they took advantage of consumers' inexperience or credulity and trivialised investment in crypto-assets. misleading - because they failed to illustrate the risk of the investment. In addition, it said the Facebook post ""did not make clear the 'token' was a crypto-asset, which could only be obtained by opening an account and exchanging with another cryptocurrency which had to be purchased"". The watchdog found that both the website and the Facebook post broke its rules: ""The ads must not appear again in the form complained about,"" it stated. In future, the club must make it clear that fan tokens are crypto-assets and ""that the value of investments in crypto-assets was variable and crypto-assets were unregulated"", the ruling continued. Arsenal football club told the BBC: ""We take our responsibilities with regard to marketing to our fans very seriously. ""We carefully considered the communications to fans regarding our promotions and provided information regarding financial risks."" The Club said it would be seeking ""an independent review of the ASA's ruling to seek greater clarity on the ASA's current position"". In defending its marketing to the ASA, Arsenal argued the website did include the warning that fans ""could lose some or all of their money invested"". It said the marketing material stated: ""We advise you to spend only what you can afford and seek independent financial advice if required."" The Club argued the fan tokens were not promoted as an investment and they did not encourage the trading of tokens. Arsenal is the first club whose fan token marketing is judged to have breached advertising standards by the watchdog. It is one of a number of clubs to have joined forces with a company called Socios, which offers fan tokens through its app. Socios told the BBC's Tech Tent podcast ithas sold $270m-300m worth of coins through its app, but declined to reveal how much money goes directly to clubs it works with. Responding to the recent ASA ruling, Socios said: ""We welcome Arsenal's call for an independent review. This is a fast-moving area and clarity is needed to ensure all companies can adhere to the latest guidelines."" Clubs say that by collecting fan tokens, supporters can influence the running of the club - suggesting the more tokens fans collect, the more say they might have. But with the exception of free non-tradeable fan tokens given to club members, fans have to use a crypto-currency called Chiliz ($CHZ) to buy and sell tokens. So far, across the five major European leagues, 24 clubs have launched or are considering launching fan tokens, including eight Premier League sides. Some clubs also sell digital collectibles, known as NFTs (non-fungible tokens). In September, French firm Sorare, which sells football trading cards in the form of NFTs, raised $680m (Â£498m) in funding. However, some supporters groups are wary. In August, theArsenal Supporters Trust,externalsaid the club should make it clear that crypto-currency is an ""unregulated activity"" and was risky. Tim Payton, a board member of the Trust told the BBC that ""clubs should not be allowed to use football's popularity to push an inherently high-risk product"". The Trust believes government and the football authorities should look into partnerships between clubs and crypto-currency companies. Mr Payton said if they are to continue, then a greater effort must be made to ensure that all marketing materials ""inform all fans of the downside involved in buying tokens"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says monitoring crypto-assets, like Bitcoin, is a ""red-alert priority"" and it is concerned that many ads fail to fully convey the risks of investing. Guy Parker, the authority's, chief executive told the BBC crypto-assets were ""poorly understood by the public"" and were mostly unregulated, and not backed by financial compensations schemes. His message to consumers was ""think very carefully before you buy. Do you understand crypto-assets well enough?  Can you afford to lose what you've spent?"" The watchdog says it plans to issue guidance on crypto-asset marketing in the new year, and will continue to publishing rulings on ads for NFTs, crypto-currencies and fan tokens in the interim.

Dozens missing in deadly Myanmar mine landslide,"This video can not be played Rescue teams search for survivors at a lake near th ejade mine As many as 100 people are feared missing after a landslide at a jade mine in Myanmar. Rescue teams are desperately searching for people in a nearby lake, with most victims believed to be illegal miners. One person is confirmed dead. The landslide occurred in the Hpakant area of northern Kachin state at 04:00 on Wednesday (21:30 GMT Tuesday). Myanmar, also known as Burma, is the world's biggest source of jade, but its mines have seen numerous accidents. The landslide is believed to have been caused by an overflow of rubble discarded from lorries to the open-pit mines. The rubble creates large slopes that can be dangerous in an area denuded of trees, forcing those looking for fragments of the semi-precious stone to labour in hazardous conditions. Rescue teams consisting of about 200 people from Hpakant and the nearby town of Lone Khin joined search and recovery efforts at the site. Boats were used to search for the missing in a nearby lake. ""We've sent 25 injured people to hospital while we've found one dead,"" a member of the rescue team, Ko Nyi, said, confirming up to 100 people may be missing. As many as 200 people were reported to have joined search and rescue efforts Jade mining is banned in Hpakant, but locals often defy regulations, driven by a lack of employment opportunities and impoverished conditions that have worsened from the Covid-19 pandemic. Operations have also flourished in the area since February's military coup and landmines at sites are not uncommon. Several days ago, at least 10 unskilled miners went missing in another landslide at a jade block in Hpakant. In 2020, more than 160 people - most of whom were migrants - diedin one of the worst disasters in Hpakant after mining waste collapsed into a lake. A new gemstone mining law was passed in 2018, but critics say the government has too few inspectors with only limited authority to stop illegal practices. Campaigners have accused the military, drug dealers, insurgent groups and Chinese business interests of controlling the jade trade and preventing a safer and more sustainable exploitation of the valuable gemstone. Myanmar's jade trade is reported to be worth more than $30bn (Â£24bn) a year, with Hpakant being the site of the world's biggest jade mine.

"NHS fraud doctor's Â£800,000 gambling 'shame'","Dr Aled Meirion Jones says gambling addicts should know there is hope and ""a way out"" A doctor who defrauded the NHS out of nearly Â£68,000 says his ""catastrophic"" gambling addiction saw him fritter away Â£800,000. Dr Aled Meirion Jones, from Cardiff,pleaded guilty in January to two counts of fraud and abuse of power. He had claimed for locum shifts he had not worked and stole cheques, while also borrowing from friends. Two-and-a-half years into recovery, he said he was ""enormously ashamed"" but wanted addicts to know there is hope. Dr Jones said he regrets the wasted time and lost relationships the most, over the hundreds of thousands of pounds lost. In March, he was given a 24-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also suspended from the medical register for at least 12 months. 'I stole Â£70,000 to feed my addiction' Group campaigns for gambling advert ban Poorer towns have the most betting shops, study finds Dr Jones said it was difficult to pin down exactly when his gambling became pathological, but recalls first betting as a student. ""It was at university when there was a promotion in the newspaper and my friends were all doing a bet where you put Â£10 down and whether you won or lost you got your Â£10 back,"" he said. ""That's when the seed of gambling was planted in my head."" Gambling ""doesn't let you think logically"", says Dr Aled Meirion Jones He said that later in life he returned to gambling as a release from dissatisfaction with work and suffering from mood problems. One night in 2009, Dr Jones lost Â£10,000 after betting on Roger Federer to win a record-equalling sixth consecutive title in the US Open, only to see him defeated by Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro. The night had started out with an initial sum of Â£500 slowly betted on likely sporting outcomes, but had escalated. ""Watching my money evaporate, I should have gone 'OK, well it's Â£500 to start with, gambling is a mug's game' and walked away,"" he said. ""But when you're an addict, and I certainly didn't know I was an addict at the time, your mind doesn't think like that. It doesn't let you think logically. ""So I was hooked, I was going to win this money back and I kept going in this cycle."" Wasted time and lost relationships are what Dr Aled Meirion Jones says he regrets the most from the addiction On a doctor's wage, Dr Jones said he could afford the habit to begin with, but then started to take out credit cards and loans. He was able to pay off the debts for a while by working extra shifts, but eventually the gambling addiction took over. ""I stopped going to social occasions because I wanted to gamble, and it took over my life and it changes you."" He said his greatest shame was how it changed his sense of morality and that relationships were lost. ""I started borrowing money from friends, obviously not telling them gambling was the reason, but I didn't see that as harmful,"" he said. ""I felt like I needed this money. I was going to win it back and pay them back, you know? And then eventually, I got so desperate and I was living in secrecy that I turned to crime. I committed fraud."" While employed at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales as a registrar in the nephrology and transplant unit, he stole 420 cheques from its bereavement services department over a two-year period. He also amended and filled in cheques and made them payable to himself. Dr Jones said it was only when he was caught did it make him address his addiction. Dr Aled Meirion Jones completed a cycle challenge from Cardiff to Cancun in Mexico ""I'm enormously ashamed and I always will be, but I can't change the past and all I can do is to recover and try to do good things,"" he said. ""Not to make amends but just to make the best out of the situation. ""When I try to explain this to people who may not have experienced addiction, I don't know how they can understand because I struggle with it myself."" Dr Jones said he would not have begun recovering from the addiction, without the support from the Living Room Cardiff, a community-based recovery centre. He has recently returned to Cardiff having completed a cycle challenge to Cancun, in Mexico. ""There was a time when I didn't have any hope and couldn't see any way out,"" he said. ""It's not easy, it doesn't happen overnight, but absolutely there is hope. ""But there is a way out, there are very successful treatment and counselling programmes that can turn people's lives around."" The Trade Union Congress in Wales estimates that 30,000 people experience problem gambling. Both the Welsh government and the chief medical officer for Wales said they have prioritised tackling the harm from gambling disorders. They said steps have been taken to minimise public health consequences through the provision of free online counselling for people with gambling problems.

Today's contributors were Jen Meierhans, Jo
Couzens, Sophie Williams, Matt Murphy and Mary OâConnor. The live page was edited by Chris
Clayton and Owen Amos. As ever, you can follow any major developments on the news site
- just go to thefront page. And for more in-depth coverage, you can go to our dedicated
coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus updates from the
UK and around the world: Austrian hospitality settings, including Christmas markets, re-opened just 10 days ago after a three week lockdown in November Austria has announced pans to re-introduce coronavirus restrictions after Christmas, including a 10pm closing time for hospitality venues, in a bid to slow the spread
of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health officials have announced. The new closing time will be imposed on the hospitality
sector from 27 December and will remain in place for New Year's Eve, Covid-19 policy co-ordinator Katharina
Reich said during a press conference. She urged the public to celebrate the holiday in
small groups and with vaccinated people only. Reich also announced the classification of the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Norway as risk areas, meaning arrivals from the countries must go into
quarantine if they have not received a booster vaccination. Austria only emerged from a three-week lockdown 10 days ago but fears have been raised in recent days over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the country. The wave of Omicron appears to be milder according to preliminary studies published in the UK and South Africa. Early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment - potentially about a two-thirds reduction - than with other variants. The researchers said their findings were a ""qualified good news story"". However, the concern remains that even if Omicron is milder, the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm hospitals. A study in Scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital. It said that if Omicron behaved the same as Delta then they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already. At the moment there are only 15. However, the study is based on very few cases and had few people over age 65, who are most at risk of severe disease. Read the full storyhere. Smitha MundasadNews reporter Health
and care staff who test positive for coronavirus in England can now return to
work up to three days before their 10-day isolation period is complete - 
but must do extra tests, according tonew
guidance,external. Englandâs
health chiefs will be keeping their fingers crossed that the tweaked guidelines
go some way to maintaining staffing levels during a difficult winter while
limiting the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. According
to the document, if health and care staff are well, and no longer have any
symptoms, they can take lateral flow tests on day six and seven. If
negative â unlike most other adults - they are asked to test again on day eight, nine and 10. They
can return to work on day eight provided they have a negative lateral flow. But if
any of their lateral flow tests return a positive result they need to isolate
once more. Some
staff, particularly those working with patients most vulnerable to Covid, could
be asked to work in less risky areas until the original 10-day isolation period
is complete. Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. Ex-prime minister Tony Blair has described eligible people who are not vaccinated against Covid and have no medical reason not to get the jab as idiots. The former Labour PM tells Times Radio those who choose not to have a vaccine should not be targeted in a heavy-handed way but persuaded to have a jab. He says: ""There may be all sorts of reasons, but honestly it is in their own interest, never mind the public interest, for them to get vaccinated."" He also says the decision to vaccinate people under the age of 12 should have been taken ""some time ago"", adding: ""I don't know what we're waiting for."" He says he backs the government in not imposing further further restrictions before Christmas but describes the decision as ""incredibly difficult"" and a ""gamble"". This video can not be played 'Where is the PM?' Javid is asked During his visit to a hospital in south London earlier the health secretary was asked by a reporter whether the prime minister was ""in hiding"". Boris Johnson's most recent address to the nation yesterday came via a video statement uploaded to Twitter, rather than the traditional press conference format where he is asked questions by journalists. In his recent appearances, the prime minister has faced questions over reported gatherings in Downing Street when the country was under Covid restrictions. But Sajid Javid says Johnson ""couldn't be working harder"" and tht he is having meetings with the prime minister ""two or three times a day"". Wales' health minister says she plans to begin offering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds in the ""at risk"" group, after thatlatest recommendation from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation(JCVI). Eluned Morgan says she has accepted the JCVI's advice, adding that NHS Wales will start identifying eligible children in the new year, and people under the age of 18 will get a booster jab appointment when they become eligible. Baroness Morgan pledges that the ""appropriate information"" on the ""potential benefits and risks"" of having the jab will be shared with children, young people and their parents or guardians so they can make an informed choice. The recommendations by the scientific experts have to be officially approved by ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but this is normally a formality. As we reported earlier, the government's vaccine advisers have recommended that a low-dose Covid vaccine should be given to vulnerable children aged 5 to 11. But who is currently eligible for the vaccine?  What about boosters? InEnglandboosters are available to over 18s - as long as it's three months since their second dose. Boostersare also available to people aged 16 or over,externalwith a health condition that puts them at high risk of serious illness from Covid or if they care or live with someone at high risk. Boosters can be booked,externaltwo months after a second dose. Somewalk-in appointments may be available,external- depending on where you live. Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. As in England, boosterscan be booked online,external. Walesalso hopes tohit the end of December target. People should wait to be invited for their booster, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised. Northern Ireland'sbooster plan is also being accelerated. People aged 18 to 29will be able to go to walk-in hubs from Mondayand make booster appointments from Wednesday, 22 December. You can read morehere. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 238,350 or 58.9% in the past seven days, compared
with the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 2.7% in the last seven days, compared
with the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. You can read our full report on the latest figureshere. There have been a further 106,122 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government
figures,external. It is the first time more than 100,000 cases have been reported in a single day. And
there have been another 140 deaths, of people who had tested
positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. BBC Radio 5 Live Emma Downey is co-owner of Tides Kitchen and Wine Bar in Newport, Pembrokeshire. She tells5 Liveâs Naga Munchettytighter restrictions on hospitality in Wales mean she will have to close the restaurant side of her business. âWe knew it was coming,â she says. âWe knew something was going to changeâ¦ but the damage has already been done in the past week. âI feel completely despondent today, weâll honour our bookings for next week to include New Yearâs Eve, but after that weâll close the restaurant side of the business until we can open with some normality."" Nightclubs in Northern Ireland will have to close on 27 December as fresh restrictions are imposed to tackle the Omicron Covid variant, BBC News NI understands. Stormont ministershave been meeting to agree measuresto help manage rising Covid cases across Northern Ireland. It is understood they are also likely to agree tighter restrictions on hospitality including table service and limits on numbers at tables. Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected as â100% incorrectâ social media claims that its
director general thinks Covid vaccine boosters are being used to kill children. A brief clip from Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusâs press
briefing on Monday is being promoted by online anti-vaccine activists as
evidence that vaccinating children is deadly. Addressing the rollout of Covid vaccine boosters, he said
vaccinating old and vulnerable groups in developing nations was a higher
priority than offering booster shots to children in high income nations. âItâs better to focus on those groups who have the risk of
severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to
give boosters to children, which is not right,â Dr Tedros said. However, he stumbles on his words at the end, which makes it
appear as though he is suggesting booster jabs âkill childrenâ. A WHO spokesperson told the BBC that
Dr Ghebreyesus âgot stuck on the first syllable âchilâ and
it came out sounding like âcil/kil'. âHe repeated the same
syllable, with it coming out âcil-childrenâ. Any other interpretation of this
is 100% incorrect.â Nigeria has destroyed more than one million doses of coronavirus vaccines, saying  international donors delivered the vials just before their expiry date, sparing little time for distribution around the country. The AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Nigeria over the course of October, but expired the next month authorities said. At a dump site in Abuja, a bulldozer crushed the shots which were packed in cardboard boxes and plastic as
reporters and health officials watched. AstraZeneca doses can normally be stored safely for at least six months from the time of manufacture, under suitable conditions. But Nigeria's health minister Osagie Ehanire told the BBC earlier this month that the late delivery ""left us very short time, some just weeks, to use them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to users"". New coronavirus infections have increased by over 500% in the past two weeks in Africa's most populous nation, where just 4% of the 200 million strong population are fully vaccinated. An early assessment of the Omicron variant in South Africa suggests the risk of severe disease may be lower than with earlier strains of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was carried out by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and found that people diagnosed with Omicron in South Africa between 1 October and and 30 November were 80% less likely to be admitted to hospital than
those diagnosed with other variants over the same period. But the authors stressed that some of the findings may be attributed to higher levels of population immunity caused by vaccinations and past infections, and stressed that further research is needed. It is estimated that 60-70% of South Africans have had a prior coronavirus infection. ""Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive
story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other
variants,"" Professor Cheryl Cohen of the NICD said. ""What is unclear is whether the picture will be similar in
countries where there are high levels of vaccination but very
low levels of previous infection,"" she added. Results of a major study released by Imperial College London last week found that there are no indications that Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, although data on hospitalisations remains very limited and the study has not been peer reviewed. France has become the first country to announce publicly that it has cancelled its order for Merck & Co's Covid-19 antiviral drug following the publication of disappointing trial data. Merck released results from trials at the end of November which suggested the drug was markedly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalisations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by just 30%. French officials had placed an order for 50,000 doses of the drug molnupiravir. But Health Minister Olivier Veran told local media that the ""latest studies weren't good"" and added that the cancellation would not incur any cost. France will instead order an antiviral drug manufactured by the American pharmaceuticals manufacturer Pfizer, which studies suggest cuts the risk of severe illness and death by 90%. Several other European countries, including Germany and Italy, have also placed orders for Merck's pill and it remains unclear whether they will continue with the purchase. A record 968,665 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were reported in the UK on Tuesday, new figures show. The previous record was 940,606 doses on Saturday. More than 30.8 million booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 6.1 million in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK's four health agencies. We've just brought you news of the JCVI's recommendation that vulnerable primary school aged children should be offered low-dose Covid vaccines. We've got a bit more detail on what that might mean. A low-dose version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for five to 11-year-olds has just been approved for use in the UK after being deemed safe and effective. It contains one-third of the adult dose and should be given eight weeks apart. But despite the recommendation, a final decision on vaccinating this age group has not yet been made. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said: ""Parents and carers can be reassured that no new vaccine for children would have been approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met."" The JCVI also recommended booster doses be offered to: â¢	Children aged aged 16 and 17(the JCVI recommended they be allowed a second dose last month),external â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 if they are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 who have a severely weakened immune system should get four doses Â© 2025 BBC.

Harvard professor guilty of lying about China tiesThe US scientist reportedly received $1.5m from a Chinese university on top of his monthly pay.US & Canada,"The 62-year-old was charged in 2020 as part of a US campaign to counter economic espionage from China A Harvard University professor has been convicted of hiding ties to a China-run recruitment programme. Charles Lieber was found guilty of making false statements to authorities, filing false tax returns and failing to report a Chinese bank account. His sentencing date is yet to be decided. The 62-year-old was charged in 2020 as part of a US campaign to counter economic espionage from China. However, some critics say this campaign harms academic research. Prosecutors in Boston said Lieber knowingly hid his involvement in China's ""Thousand Talents Plan"", which aims to attract foreign research specialists. It has been flagged by the US as a security concern in the past. Lieber, a former head of Harvard's department of chemistry and chemical biology, had in 2011 joined China's Wuhan University of Technology as a scientist. He was given a monthly salary of $50,000 (Â£37,000), in addition to living expenses of up to $158,000 for this role. The filings say he was also given more than $1.5m to establish a research lab at the university and, in return, was expected to work for the university, applying for patents and publishing articles in its name. Participation in the programme is not a crime. However prosecutors said Lieber had lied to authorities about his participation, his affiliation with the university in Wuhan, and failed to declare income earned in China. He had previously been awarded $15m in grants from the US National Institute of Health and the US Department of Defence. Recipients of these grants have to disclose any conflicts of interest, including financial support from foreign governments or organisations. Lieber's defence team said prosecutors lacked proof of the charges, saying they were unable to show that Lieber had acted knowingly, intentionally, or wilfully, or that he made any material false statement. Lieber, who has been diagnosed with cancer, had pleaded not guilty. According tothe Harvard Crimson,external, the maximum sentence for the conviction is 26 years in jail and $1.2m in fines. The case is among the highest profile to come from what the US Department of Justice's calls the ""China Initiative"". The programme, launched in 2018 during President Donald Trump's administration, aimed to curb theft of research and critical economic US intelligence by China. However. some have criticised the programme, saying it threatens academic research, disproportionately targets Chinese researchers and undermines the US' competitiveness in research and technology.

Europe spat will weaken research - science leaders,"Boris Johnson has said he wants a close research relationship with Europe, but the Northern Ireland dispute may mean the UK walks away Scientific leaders have urged the government not to abandon talks to enable the UK to participate in a â¬100bn European research programme. They have told BBC News that being cut out of EU research would ""greatly disadvantage"" British science. Agreement in principle was reached, but UK involvement is now a bargaining chip in talks over Northern Ireland. In response the Science Minister, George Freeman, has said the UK is ready to set up its own scheme. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, told BBC News that ''losing the agreement on UK participation in the world's biggest international science funding programme at this stage, when it has already been negotiated and is ready to sign, would be snatching defeat from the jaws of victory"". He added: ""While it's natural for the government to plan for the worst-case scenario, we have to realise that any UK-only scheme would greatly disadvantage our scientists compared to the international opportunities that Horizon Europe opens up, with both the EU and many other countries that take part in it, such as Israel or Norway."" The EU's Horizon Europe programme brings together researchers from industry and academia across the EU. The projects range from fundamental research to tackling societal issues, such as combating climate change and efforts to find treatments for debilitating diseases. The delay in joining the EU programme will mean UK researchers will not be included in EU research projects The UK's continued participation in the EU's Horizon programme was agreed in principle just before Christmas 2020 in the Brexit withdrawal agreement.But the signing off of a formal agreement on the UK's associate membership has dragged on for a year. The delay is creating problems, because funding cannot be released to UK collaborators until there is a formal agreement. If it becomes apparent that agreement will take many more months, EU researchers will not include UK scientists in their projects. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, told BBC News that exclusion from Horizon Europe would be a ""significant blow"" in efforts to combat cancer. ""It will also put at serious risk the UK's position of being at the forefront in the global effort in improving the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of cancer. ""The government must strike a deal urgently for continued membership of Horizon Europe or the UK will weaken its position to collaborate and use science to address the global challenges we face."" Uncertainties arising from Brexit have already led to the UK missing out on Â£1.5bn of research funding since 2016, according to some estimates. But Sir Jeremy said that ministers should resist the temptation to walk away from the talks with the EU. ""The delays are frustrating, but the UK needs to stay in the game, and resist the urge to shut the door on Horizon. It's the best option for supporting science and R&D in the UK."" Sir Jeremy is responding to an article written by the science minister, George Freeman, in the magazine Research Fortnight. Mr Freeman wrote that although it was his ""strong preference"" to join the EU's Horizon Europe programme, ""if the EU stands in our way"" the UK is ready to implement an alternative that is ""just as good or better"". Thatalternative was drawn up by Prof Sir Adrian Smith,external, in 2019, before the UK's withdrawal agreement as a contingency in case the EU refused the UK entry into Horizon Europe. Since then Prof Smith was elected President of the Royal Society, which represents the country's leading scientists.  He told BBC News that most scientists would much rather join the EU programme than a newly-started UK scheme. ""We have had four decades of planning collaborative research with colleagues across Europe. ""The vast majority of UK researchers would feel difficulty in starting a new programme from scratch and being in competition with the prestigious schemes in the Horizon Europe programme."" Dr Daniel Rathbone, the assistant director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case), said it would take too long for Britain to set up its own scheme. ""In the meantime, the UK will likely lose top researchers and research groups as they move abroad to seek funding and collaboration opportunities elsewhere,"" he said. A government source told BBC News: ""The EU is playing politics over Horizon and it risks damaging scientific research. Blocking the UK from joining is in no-one's interest - we can't participate and they lose out on our financial contribution. ""We're having to look at alternatives in case the EU does block our access, which would be a breach of what we agreed less than a year ago."" The option of starting a UK scheme was made possible by the chancellor in theAutumn budget when he allocated Â£2bn a year to pay for the UK's membership of Horizon Europe, but officials made clear that the scientific community could spend the money on whatever it liked. The Treasury itself is understood to feel that spending money on Horizon Europe is an inefficient use of funds, but left the decision to the scientific community. If the uncertainty drags on into the new year, scientific leaders may have no other option than to consider a UK scheme, according to Prof Smith. ""If the impasse in signing the deal continues for another month or so, there will have to be the opening up of a discussion because the hoped-for association with Horizon Europe would not have been realised,"" he said.

coronavirus section,here. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus updates from the
UK and around the world: Austrian hospitality settings, including Christmas markets, re-opened just 10 days ago after a three week lockdown in November Austria has announced pans to re-introduce coronavirus restrictions after Christmas, including a 10pm closing time for hospitality venues, in a bid to slow the spread
of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health officials have announced. The new closing time will be imposed on the hospitality
sector from 27 December and will remain in place for New Year's Eve, Covid-19 policy co-ordinator Katharina
Reich said during a press conference. She urged the public to celebrate the holiday in
small groups and with vaccinated people only. Reich also announced the classification of the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and
Norway as risk areas, meaning arrivals from the countries must go into
quarantine if they have not received a booster vaccination. Austria only emerged from a three-week lockdown 10 days ago but fears have been raised in recent days over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the country. The wave of Omicron appears to be milder according to preliminary studies published in the UK and South Africa. Early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment - potentially about a two-thirds reduction - than with other variants. The researchers said their findings were a ""qualified good news story"". However, the concern remains that even if Omicron is milder, the sheer number of cases could still overwhelm hospitals. A study in Scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital. It said that if Omicron behaved the same as Delta then they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already. At the moment there are only 15. However, the study is based on very few cases and had few people over age 65, who are most at risk of severe disease. Read the full storyhere. Smitha MundasadNews reporter Health
and care staff who test positive for coronavirus in England can now return to
work up to three days before their 10-day isolation period is complete - 
but must do extra tests, according tonew
guidance,external. Englandâs
health chiefs will be keeping their fingers crossed that the tweaked guidelines
go some way to maintaining staffing levels during a difficult winter while
limiting the spread of coronavirus to vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes. According
to the document, if health and care staff are well, and no longer have any
symptoms, they can take lateral flow tests on day six and seven. If
negative â unlike most other adults - they are asked to test again on day eight, nine and 10. They
can return to work on day eight provided they have a negative lateral flow. But if
any of their lateral flow tests return a positive result they need to isolate
once more. Some
staff, particularly those working with patients most vulnerable to Covid, could
be asked to work in less risky areas until the original 10-day isolation period
is complete. Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. Ex-prime minister Tony Blair has described eligible people who are not vaccinated against Covid and have no medical reason not to get the jab as idiots. The former Labour PM tells Times Radio those who choose not to have a vaccine should not be targeted in a heavy-handed way but persuaded to have a jab. He says: ""There may be all sorts of reasons, but honestly it is in their own interest, never mind the public interest, for them to get vaccinated."" He also says the decision to vaccinate people under the age of 12 should have been taken ""some time ago"", adding: ""I don't know what we're waiting for."" He says he backs the government in not imposing further further restrictions before Christmas but describes the decision as ""incredibly difficult"" and a ""gamble"". This video can not be played 'Where is the PM?' Javid is asked During his visit to a hospital in south London earlier the health secretary was asked by a reporter whether the prime minister was ""in hiding"". Boris Johnson's most recent address to the nation yesterday came via a video statement uploaded to Twitter, rather than the traditional press conference format where he is asked questions by journalists. In his recent appearances, the prime minister has faced questions over reported gatherings in Downing Street when the country was under Covid restrictions. But Sajid Javid says Johnson ""couldn't be working harder"" and tht he is having meetings with the prime minister ""two or three times a day"". Wales' health minister says she plans to begin offering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds in the ""at risk"" group, after thatlatest recommendation from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation(JCVI). Eluned Morgan says she has accepted the JCVI's advice, adding that NHS Wales will start identifying eligible children in the new year, and people under the age of 18 will get a booster jab appointment when they become eligible. Baroness Morgan pledges that the ""appropriate information"" on the ""potential benefits and risks"" of having the jab will be shared with children, young people and their parents or guardians so they can make an informed choice. The recommendations by the scientific experts have to be officially approved by ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but this is normally a formality. As we reported earlier, the government's vaccine advisers have recommended that a low-dose Covid vaccine should be given to vulnerable children aged 5 to 11. But who is currently eligible for the vaccine?  What about boosters? InEnglandboosters are available to over 18s - as long as it's three months since their second dose. Boostersare also available to people aged 16 or over,externalwith a health condition that puts them at high risk of serious illness from Covid or if they care or live with someone at high risk. Boosters can be booked,externaltwo months after a second dose. Somewalk-in appointments may be available,external- depending on where you live. Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. As in England, boosterscan be booked online,external. Walesalso hopes tohit the end of December target. People should wait to be invited for their booster, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised. Northern Ireland'sbooster plan is also being accelerated. People aged 18 to 29will be able to go to walk-in hubs from Mondayand make booster appointments from Wednesday, 22 December. You can read morehere. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has
increased by 238,350 or 58.9% in the past seven days, compared
with the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased
by 2.7% in the last seven days, compared
with the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for
hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to
rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were
identified in the UK. You can read our full report on the latest figureshere. There have been a further 106,122 cases of coronavirus
reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government
figures,external. It is the first time more than 100,000 cases have been reported in a single day. And
there have been another 140 deaths, of people who had tested
positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. BBC Radio 5 Live Emma Downey is co-owner of Tides Kitchen and Wine Bar in Newport, Pembrokeshire. She tells5 Liveâs Naga Munchettytighter restrictions on hospitality in Wales mean she will have to close the restaurant side of her business. âWe knew it was coming,â she says. âWe knew something was going to changeâ¦ but the damage has already been done in the past week. âI feel completely despondent today, weâll honour our bookings for next week to include New Yearâs Eve, but after that weâll close the restaurant side of the business until we can open with some normality."" Nightclubs in Northern Ireland will have to close on 27 December as fresh restrictions are imposed to tackle the Omicron Covid variant, BBC News NI understands. Stormont ministershave been meeting to agree measuresto help manage rising Covid cases across Northern Ireland. It is understood they are also likely to agree tighter restrictions on hospitality including table service and limits on numbers at tables. Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected as â100% incorrectâ social media claims that its
director general thinks Covid vaccine boosters are being used to kill children. A brief clip from Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusâs press
briefing on Monday is being promoted by online anti-vaccine activists as
evidence that vaccinating children is deadly. Addressing the rollout of Covid vaccine boosters, he said
vaccinating old and vulnerable groups in developing nations was a higher
priority than offering booster shots to children in high income nations. âItâs better to focus on those groups who have the risk of
severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to
give boosters to children, which is not right,â Dr Tedros said. However, he stumbles on his words at the end, which makes it
appear as though he is suggesting booster jabs âkill childrenâ. A WHO spokesperson told the BBC that
Dr Ghebreyesus âgot stuck on the first syllable âchilâ and
it came out sounding like âcil/kil'. âHe repeated the same
syllable, with it coming out âcil-childrenâ. Any other interpretation of this
is 100% incorrect.â Nigeria has destroyed more than one million doses of coronavirus vaccines, saying  international donors delivered the vials just before their expiry date, sparing little time for distribution around the country. The AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Nigeria over the course of October, but expired the next month authorities said. At a dump site in Abuja, a bulldozer crushed the shots which were packed in cardboard boxes and plastic as
reporters and health officials watched. AstraZeneca doses can normally be stored safely for at least six months from the time of manufacture, under suitable conditions. But Nigeria's health minister Osagie Ehanire told the BBC earlier this month that the late delivery ""left us very short time, some just weeks, to use them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to users"". New coronavirus infections have increased by over 500% in the past two weeks in Africa's most populous nation, where just 4% of the 200 million strong population are fully vaccinated. An early assessment of the Omicron variant in South Africa suggests the risk of severe disease may be lower than with earlier strains of the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was carried out by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and found that people diagnosed with Omicron in South Africa between 1 October and and 30 November were 80% less likely to be admitted to hospital than
those diagnosed with other variants over the same period. But the authors stressed that some of the findings may be attributed to higher levels of population immunity caused by vaccinations and past infections, and stressed that further research is needed. It is estimated that 60-70% of South Africans have had a prior coronavirus infection. ""Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive
story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other
variants,"" Professor Cheryl Cohen of the NICD said. ""What is unclear is whether the picture will be similar in
countries where there are high levels of vaccination but very
low levels of previous infection,"" she added. Results of a major study released by Imperial College London last week found that there are no indications that Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, although data on hospitalisations remains very limited and the study has not been peer reviewed. France has become the first country to announce publicly that it has cancelled its order for Merck & Co's Covid-19 antiviral drug following the publication of disappointing trial data. Merck released results from trials at the end of November which suggested the drug was markedly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalisations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by just 30%. French officials had placed an order for 50,000 doses of the drug molnupiravir. But Health Minister Olivier Veran told local media that the ""latest studies weren't good"" and added that the cancellation would not incur any cost. France will instead order an antiviral drug manufactured by the American pharmaceuticals manufacturer Pfizer, which studies suggest cuts the risk of severe illness and death by 90%. Several other European countries, including Germany and Italy, have also placed orders for Merck's pill and it remains unclear whether they will continue with the purchase. A record 968,665 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were reported in the UK on Tuesday, new figures show. The previous record was 940,606 doses on Saturday. More than 30.8 million booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 6.1 million in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK's four health agencies. We've just brought you news of the JCVI's recommendation that vulnerable primary school aged children should be offered low-dose Covid vaccines. We've got a bit more detail on what that might mean. A low-dose version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for five to 11-year-olds has just been approved for use in the UK after being deemed safe and effective. It contains one-third of the adult dose and should be given eight weeks apart. But despite the recommendation, a final decision on vaccinating this age group has not yet been made. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said: ""Parents and carers can be reassured that no new vaccine for children would have been approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met."" The JCVI also recommended booster doses be offered to: â¢	Children aged aged 16 and 17(the JCVI recommended they be allowed a second dose last month),external â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 if they are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed â¢	Children aged 12 to 15 who have a severely weakened immune system should get four doses Â© 2025 BBC.

Harvard professor guilty of lying about China ties,"The 62-year-old was charged in 2020 as part of a US campaign to counter economic espionage from China A Harvard University professor has been convicted of hiding ties to a China-run recruitment programme. Charles Lieber was found guilty of making false statements to authorities, filing false tax returns and failing to report a Chinese bank account. His sentencing date is yet to be decided. The 62-year-old was charged in 2020 as part of a US campaign to counter economic espionage from China. However, some critics say this campaign harms academic research. Prosecutors in Boston said Lieber knowingly hid his involvement in China's ""Thousand Talents Plan"", which aims to attract foreign research specialists. It has been flagged by the US as a security concern in the past. Lieber, a former head of Harvard's department of chemistry and chemical biology, had in 2011 joined China's Wuhan University of Technology as a scientist. He was given a monthly salary of $50,000 (Â£37,000), in addition to living expenses of up to $158,000 for this role. The filings say he was also given more than $1.5m to establish a research lab at the university and, in return, was expected to work for the university, applying for patents and publishing articles in its name. Participation in the programme is not a crime. However prosecutors said Lieber had lied to authorities about his participation, his affiliation with the university in Wuhan, and failed to declare income earned in China. He had previously been awarded $15m in grants from the US National Institute of Health and the US Department of Defence. Recipients of these grants have to disclose any conflicts of interest, including financial support from foreign governments or organisations. Lieber's defence team said prosecutors lacked proof of the charges, saying they were unable to show that Lieber had acted knowingly, intentionally, or wilfully, or that he made any material false statement. Lieber, who has been diagnosed with cancer, had pleaded not guilty. According tothe Harvard Crimson,external, the maximum sentence for the conviction is 26 years in jail and $1.2m in fines. The case is among the highest profile to come from what the US Department of Justice's calls the ""China Initiative"". The programme, launched in 2018 during President Donald Trump's administration, aimed to curb theft of research and critical economic US intelligence by China. However. some have criticised the programme, saying it threatens academic research, disproportionately targets Chinese researchers and undermines the US' competitiveness in research and technology.
