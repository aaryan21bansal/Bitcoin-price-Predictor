Cohen's opening statement,"Michael Cohen, the former attorney for President Donald Trump arrives to testify before the House Oversight Committee Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, appeared on Wednesday before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee in Washington, DC. In his prepared remarks, he let loose with explosive accusations directed toward Mr Trump that touched on a number of controversies related to his presidency. Here is Mr Cohen's opening statement in full. Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today. I have asked this Committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats, and that the Committee be sensitive to the questions pertaining to ongoing investigations. Thank you for your help and for your understanding. I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee's questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful. Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said ""yes"" to Mr Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way. I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York. I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty - of the things I did for Mr Trump in an effort to protect and promote him. I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr Trump's illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat. He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails. I will explain each in a few moments. I am providing the Committee today with several documents. These include: A copy of a check Mr Trump wrote from his personal bank account - after he became president - to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign; Copies of financial statements for 2011 - 2013 that he gave to such institutions as Deutsche Bank; A copy of an article with Mr Trump's handwriting on it that reported on the auction of a portrait of himself - he arranged for the bidder ahead of time and then reimbursed the bidder from the account of his non-profit charitable foundation, with the picture now hanging in one of his country clubs; and Copies of letters I wrote at Mr Trump's direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores. I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea, and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better. Before going further, I want to apologize to each of you and to Congress as a whole. The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr Trump. Today, I'm here to tell the truth about Mr Trump. I lied to Congress about when Mr Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false - our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign. Mr Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That's not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me ""How's it going in Russia?"" - referring to the Moscow Tower project. You need to know that Mr Trump's personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. To be clear: Mr Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too - because Mr Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress. Over the past two years, I have been smeared as ""a rat"" by the President of the United States. The truth is much different, and let me take a brief moment to introduce myself. My name is Michael Dean Cohen. I am a blessed husband of 24 years and a father to an incredible daughter and son. When I married my wife, I promised her that I would love her, cherish her, and protect her. As my father said countless times throughout my childhood, ""you my wife, and you my children, are the air that I breathe."" To my Laura, my Sami, and my Jake, there is nothing I wouldn't do to protect you. Latest developments from Cohen hearing Takeaways from Cohen testimony I have always tried to live a life of loyalty, friendship, generosity, and compassion - qualities my parents ingrained in my siblings and me since childhood. My father survived the Holocaust thanks to the compassion and selfless acts of others. He was helped by many who put themselves in harm's way to do what they knew was right. That is why my first instinct has always been to help those in need. Mom and Dadâ¦I am sorry that I let you down. As many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3:00 am if they needed help. I proudly remember being the emergency contact for many of my children's friends when they were growing up because their parents knew that I would drop everything and care for them as if they were my own. Yet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1. For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J Trump. It is painful to admit that I was motivated by ambition at times. It is even more painful to admit that many times I ignored my conscience and acted loyal to a man when I should not have. Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong. For that reason, I have come here to apologize to my family, to the government, and to the American people. Accordingly, let me now tell you about Mr Trump. I got to know him very well, working very closely with him for more than 10 years, as his Executive Vice President and Special Counsel and then personal attorney when he became President. When I first met Mr Trump, he was a successful entrepreneur, a real estate giant, and an icon. Being around Mr Trump was intoxicating. When you were in his presence, you felt like you were involved in something greater than yourself -- that you were somehow changing the world. I wound up touting the Trump narrative for over a decade. That was my job. Always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life. At first, I worked mostly on real estate developments and other business transactions. Shortly thereafter, Mr Trump brought me into his personal life and private dealings. Over time, I saw his true character revealed. Mr Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal. Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation - only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the ""greatest infomercial in political history."" He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign - for him - was always a marketing opportunity. I knew early on in my work for Mr Trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests. I am ashamed to say, that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector, I considered it trivial. As the President, I consider it significant and dangerous. But in the mix, lying for Mr Trump was normalized, and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either. A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes. As I earlier stated, Mr Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails. In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump's office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr Trump put Mr Stone on the speakerphone. Mr Stone told Mr Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr Assange told Mr Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. Mr Trump responded by stating to the effect of ""wouldn't that be great."" Mr Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries ""shitholes."" In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a ""shithole."" This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him. Mr Trump is a cheat. As previously stated, I'm giving the Committee today three years of President Trump's financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills and to Forbes. These are Exhibits 1a, 1b, and 1c to my testimony. It was my experience that Mr Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes. I am sharing with you two newspaper articles, side by side, that are examples of Mr Trump inflating and deflating his assets, as I said, to suit his financial interests. These are Exhibit 2 to my testimony. As I noted, I'm giving the Committee today an article he wrote on, and sent me, that reported on an auction of a portrait of Mr Trump. This is Exhibit 3A to my testimony. Mr Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons Event. The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon. The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000. Mr Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself. Please see Exhibit 3B to my testimony. And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I advised Mr Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it. And yet, I continued to work for him. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Trump is a conman. He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly - and she did not deserve that. I am giving the Committee today a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms Clifford's attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms Clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with Mr Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony. Mr Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too - without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public. I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later. As Exhibit 5 to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 - when he was President of the United States - pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me - the word used by Mr Trump's TV lawyer -- for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year - while he was President. The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. You can find the details of that scheme, directed by Mr Trump, in the pleadings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. So picture this scene - in February 2017, one month into his presidency, I'm visiting President Trump in the Oval Office for the first time. It's truly awe-inspiring, he's showing me around and pointing to different paintings, and he says to me something to the effect ofâ¦Don't worry, Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were Fed-Exed from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system. As he promised, I received the first check for the reimbursement of $70,000 not long thereafter. When I say conman, I'm talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores. As I mentioned, I'm giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr Trump's direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr Trump's grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without his permission. These are Exhibit 6. The irony wasn't lost on me at the time that Mr Trump in 2011 had strongly criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades. As you can see inExhibit 7, Mr Trump declared ""Let him show his records"" after calling President Obama ""a terrible student."" The sad fact is that I never heard Mr Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better. In fact, he did the opposite. When telling me in 2008 that he was cutting employees' salaries in half - including mine - he showed me what he claimed was a $10 million IRS tax refund, and he said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving ""someone like him"" that much money back. During the campaign, Mr Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, Senator John McCain to be ""a hero"" because he likes people who weren't captured. At the same time, Mr Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. ""You think I'm stupid, I wasn't going to Vietnam."" I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now. And yet, I continued to work for him. Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions. Sometime in the summer of 2017, I read all over the media that there had been a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 involving Don Jr and others from the campaign with Russians, including a representative of the Russian government, and an email setting up the meeting with the subject line, ""Dirt on Hillary Clinton."" Something clicked in my mind. I remember being in the room with Mr Trump, probably in early June 2016, when something peculiar happened. Don Jr came into the room and walked behind his father's desk - which in itself was unusual. People didn't just walk behind Mr Trump's desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: ""The meeting is all set."" I remember Mr. Trump saying, ""Ok goodâ¦let me know."" What struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr and his father was, first, that Mr Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr would never set up any meeting of any significance alone - and certainly not without checking with his father. I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr Trump's knowledge and approval. So, I concluded that Don Jr was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad's desk that day -- and that Mr Trump knew that was the meeting Don Jr was talking about when he said, ""That's goodâ¦let me know."" Over the past year or so, I have done some real soul searching. I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions I made. To you, Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, the other members of this Committee, and the other members of the House and Senate, I am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress. To our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr Trump when you needed it most. For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your ""fixer,"" Mr Trump. I am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that I tried so hard to provide for my family. My testimony certainly does not diminish the pain I caused my family and friends - nothing can do that. And I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump. And, by coming today, I have caused my family to be the target of personal, scurrilous attacks by the President and his lawyer - trying to intimidate me from appearing before this panel. Mr Trump called me a ""rat"" for choosing to tell the truth - much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government. As Exhibit 8 shows, I have provided the Committee with copies of Tweets that Mr Trump posted, attacking me and my family - only someone burying his head in the sand would not recognize them for what they are: encouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family. I never imagined that he would engage in vicious, false attacks on my family - and unleash his TV-lawyer to do the same. I hope this committee and all members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will make it clear: As a nation, we should not tolerate attempts to intimidate witnesses before congress and attacks on family are out of bounds and not acceptable. I wish to especially thank Speaker Pelosi for her statements in Exhibit 9 to protect this institution and me, and the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff and Chairman Cummings for likewise defending this institution and my family against the attacks by Mr Trump, and also the many Republicans who have admonished the President as well. I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today. Thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer the Committee's questions.

The exceptional 'semi-identical' twins,"The egg is thought to have been fertilised simultaneously by two sperm before it divided Doctors have documented what they say is only the world's second known case of ""semi-identical"" twins. The boy and the girl, now four, from Brisbane, in Australia, are identical on their mother's side. But they share only a proportion of their father's DNA - placing them, genetically, somewhere between fraternal and identical twins. Experts say the phenomenon is extremely rare - embryos such as these often do not survive. The twins who have different dads - BBC News Semi-identical twins discovered,external Prof Nicholas Fisk, who led the team that cared for the mother and twins at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in 2014, said the discovery was made through a routine pregnancy scan. It is the first time semi-identical twins have been identified during pregnancy. The first-time mother was 28 at the time and had conceived naturally, doctors said. The case is being reported on inThe New England Journal of Medicine,external. ""The mother's ultrasound at six weeks showed a single placenta and positioning of amniotic sacs that indicated she was expecting identical twins,"" Prof Fisk said. ""However, an ultrasound at 14 weeks showed the twins were male and female, which is not possible for identical twins."" Identical, or monozygotic, twins occur when a single egg, fertilised by a single sperm, divides and makes two babies. These twins will be the same sex and share the same genes and physical features. Non-identical, or dizygotic, twins occur when two separate eggs are fertilised, each by a different sperm, and develop in the womb at the same time. These twins can be the same or different sexes and are no more alike than any brother or sister, despite being born together. In this case of semi-identical, or sesquizygotic, twins, the egg is thought to have been fertilised simultaneously by two sperm before it divided. If one egg is fertilised by two sperm, it results in three sets of chromosomes, rather than the standard two - one from the mother and two from the father. And, according to researchers, three sets of chromosomes are ""typically incompatible with life and embryos do not usually survive"". The identity of the twins has not been revealed. Non-identical twins are more common than identical twins and are much more likely to run in families. Older mothers are also more likely to have non-identical twins because they are more likely to release more than one egg during ovulation. Infertility treatment - IVF - can increase the chance of twins, as more than one embryo may be put into the womb. According to the Twins and Multiple Births Association (Tamba), about 12,000 twin births occur each year in the UK. The first documented case of half-identical twins was in the US in 2007. Prof Fisk said an analysis of worldwide twin databases highlighted just how rare sesquizygotic twins were. He and his colleagues examined genetic data from 968 fraternal twins, as well as a number of large global studies, but found no other case of sesquizygotic twins. ""We know this is an exceptional case of semi-identical twins,"" Prof Fisk added. ""While doctors may keep this in mind in apparently identical twins, its rarity means there is no case for routine genetic testing.""

Earlier, Prince William and Catherine visited Windsor Park stadium where they showcased their football skills. They also met Northern Ireland football manager Michael O'Neill and former Northern Ireland, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Pat Jennings. The duke and duchess last visited Northern Ireland in 2016.

Prince William made a speech inside Belfast Empire Music Hall, accompanied by his wife Catherine ""From using sport to encourage people to talk openly about mental health, to delivering services to children and young people who are at risk of entering care,"" he said. ""The work you do transcends community and is helping deliver a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" The couple waved at crowds before entering the music hall Prince William also paid tribute to Dame Mary Peters, who he called ""one of the United Kingdom's sporting legends"". ""Mary has also inspired generation after generation to come together in times of trouble and work for the common good - a lesson I hope many of us can learn from,"" he added. His comments came as Dame Mary was appointed Lady Companion of the Most Noble of the Garter by The Queen. The Duchess chats to a young footballer Prior to the event, the pair joined in a kickabout with young children at the home of Northern Ireland and Linfield.

Selma Blair opens up about life with MS,"Selma Blair attended the post-Oscars Vanity Fair party on Sunday US actress Selma Blair has spoken about her life with multiple sclerosis, four months after she was diagnosed. ""I really feel like people with disabilities are invisible to a lot of people,"" she told Vanity Fair magazine. But the star, who appeared with a cane at an Oscars party on Sunday, added: ""There's no tragedy for me. I'm happy. ""I don't know if I believed in myself or had the ambition before my diagnosis. And oddly now I do, and I don't know if it's too late."" MS is an incurable condition affecting the brain or spinal cord, causing vision, balance and muscle problems. The actress is known for films including Cruel Intentions and Legally Blonde, and will star in Netflix's forthcoming sci-fi drama Another Life. She said: ""If I can help anyone be more comfortable in their skin, it's more than I've ever done before."" Blair is known for her stylish dress sense Blair revealed she had MS on Instagram last October. ""It wasn't about announcing a dramatic diagnosis,"" she told Vanity Fair. ""I had no idea, for some reason, that news outlets would pick it up or anything. When they did, I was kind of uncomfortable. ""Then I was worried, thinking, 'Will anyone hire me?' I reconnected with so many people who thought I might drop dead soon!"" Those who got in touch included Amy Schumer, whose father has MS. Blair's health has continued to deteriorate. ""I also never thought I'd get this bad, to tell you the truth,"" she said. She struggles with movement, memory, dressing and is struggling with her vision after a bad reaction to a high-dose glucocorticoid treatment. She says she now looks and sounds so different that it has changed her relationship with her seven-year-old son Arthur. ""He wants to be closer to my body more, and I can tell he wants to make sure I'm still here inside. I used to be so athletic with him. Now I fall in front of him. ""There's a humility and a joy I have now, albeit a fatigued joy."" She added: ""I'm pretty much a nobody in Hollywood. ""But when I read comments on Instagram from people who were suffering, whether it was from MS, or anything, I thought, there's a need for honesty about being disabled from someone recognisable.""

Climber missing on 'killer mountain',"Tom Ballard is an experienced climber who has set records for his mountaineering feats A British climber whose mother died on K2 has been reported missing on a peak in Pakistan. Tom Ballard and Italian climber Daniele Nardi are trying to reach the summit of Nanga Parbat - nicknamed ""Killer Mountain"". The last contact from the pair was on Sunday, from an altitude of about 6,300m (20,669 ft). A search operation has been delayed amidtensions between Pakistan and India. Mr Ballard, from Derbyshire, is an experienced climber and the first person to solo climb all six major north faces of the Alps in one winter. He is the son of Alison Hargreaves, who was the first woman toconquer Everest unaided,externalin 1995. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands She died the same year while descending from the summit of K2, the world's second highest mountain. Alison Hargreaves died while descending from the summit of K2, in 1995 Nanga Parbat is the world's ninth highest mountain and notoriously difficult to climb. A number of deaths have earned it the ""Killer Mountain"" label. It has been reported that weather was poor in the area at the time. Pakistani authorities hope to launch a helicopter search operation, but said it has been slowed by tensions with India. A search operation for Mr Ballard and Italian climber Daniele Nardi has been delayed amid tensions between Pakistan and India Mr Ballard, 30 has been living in Italy's Dolomites mountain range with his father for the last few years. Nicholas Hobley, from online magazine Planet Mountain, said Mr Ballard was ""regarded extremely highly in the climbing world"". ""He's an absolutely fantastic climber and someone you would want to have with you on an expedition."" Nanga Parbat has only been climbed in winter once before as it is ""extremely dangerous"", he said. He said Mr Nardi had been attempting to climb the mountain in winter every year since 2012 and knows the area well. A statement from Mr Nardi's team said the ""situation was worrying"" because bad weather is forecast for the next few days. They said they were ""waiting for news from base camp"" and experienced Pakistani mountaineer Ali Sadpara was on standby to fly to Nanga Parbat to scour the mountain when the airspace reopens. A Foreign Office spokesman said they were in contact with Pakistani authorities regarding Mr Ballard's disappearance.

Trump and Kim talks set for second day,"This video can not be played US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un are meeting for a second day of talks North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has told reporters that he would not be at a summit with US President Donald Trump if he were not ready to denuclearise. The leaders are in Vietnam for talks on nuclear disarmament. They are under pressure to reach concrete measures after making little progress following a historic first summit last year. But the summit has been cut short by two hours and it's not clear why. Mr Trump earlier said there was ""no rush"" to reach a deal. But when Mr Kim told reporters that if he was not ready to denuclearise he ""wouldn't be here"", the US leader responded: ""That might be the best answer you've ever heard."" Analysts say it remains unclear what exactly Mr Kim means by denuclearisation. The pair were holding a discussion at a conference table with aides and cameras present, after the first round of closed-door discussions in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. Mr Trump and Mr Kim are believed to be discussing a roadmap for removing nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula and could also announce a formal treaty ending the Korean War or even the establishment of liaison offices. The first summit last June in Singapore between two leaders who had previously only exchanged vitriol was certainly a historic moment. Now, they are both very conscious of the need to answer their critics with signs of concrete progress. Washington had previously said North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief, but that condition is known to be a sticking point for the North Koreans. Follow our live updates What Trump wants from Kim talks Speaking ahead of their talks, Mr Trump appeared to again address scepticism about the success and progress of their last summit, saying he wanted to get the ""right deal"". ""I've been saying very much from the beginning that speed is not that important to me. I very much appreciate no testing of nuclear rockets, missiles, any of it,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he had ""great respect"" for Mr Kim. Meanwhile, answering his first question from a foreign reporter, Mr Kim said: ""It's early to tell, but from my instincts, I do have a feeling that good results will emerge."" This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un answered a question from a foreign reporter. He said people seeing him alongside Mr Trump would think they were watching a ""fantasy movie"". At the end of 2017, when they were both threatening each other with war, Mr Trump called Mr Kim ""little rocket man"", and Mr Kim said Mr Trump was a ""mentally deranged dotard"". They emerged from their first session after about 30 minutes and took a brief stroll in the courtyard, joined by their chief advisers - Kim Yong-chol for Mr Kim and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - and interpreters. When asked by reporters afterwards if he would allow a US liaison office in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, Mr Kim said it was something he would ""welcome"". Mr Trump replied it was ""not a bad idea - both ways"". There is no direct channel between the US and North Korea at the moment and a liaison office would be the first step to normalise relations between the two countries. Mr Kim was also asked if they were discussing the issue of human rights in his country, a subject that was not raised in Singapore. Mr Trump - who separately warned reporters not to ""raise"" their voices with Mr Kim - stepped in and said they were ""discussing everything"". Mr Kim did not answer. The leaders are holding a series of meetings at the Metropole hotel in Hanoi. It is unclear if a ""joint agreement signing ceremony"" will still be held and Mr Trump has brought forward a news conference, which is now scheduled for 14:00 local time (07:00 GMT). Trump and Kim in Hanoi: Your need-to-know guide North Korea in nine charts It is also not clear what any joint agreement might include although there have been working level talks between North Korea and the US in recent weeks. The tone of the talks was set in a dinner on Wednesday when Mr Trump described Mr Kim as a ""great leader"" and said he looked forward to helping him achieve a ""tremendous"" economic future for North Korea. Mr Kim called the US president ""courageous"" in return and said he was confident there would be an ""excellent outcome that everyone welcomes"". Analysts have long warned that full denuclearisation is very unlikely but speculation on what we should look out for includes: Any concrete signs of progress on nuclear disarmament such as an agreement from North Korea to disclose details of its nuclear weapons programme Any agreement on dismantling elements of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor in the North - this could be in exchange for paving the way for the easing of sanctions The possibility of a peace declaration putting a symbolic end to the Korean War Further agreements on issues like the return of Korean war remains or liaison offices The leaders took a brief stroll in the courtyard during a break in talks North Korean state media have praised Mr Kim for making the 4,000km (2,500-mile) trip, with state paper Rodong Sinmun dedicating four out of its six pages to it. It said North Koreans had reacted to his visit with ""boundless excitement and emotion"", and urged people to work harder to ""give him reports of victory when he returns"". This video can not be played 'I really miss our leader' The paper also added that his overseas trip had caused some of its citizens sleepless nights, with one woman telling a state broadcaster that she ""really missed"" Mr Kim.

How damaging are Cohen allegations?Donald Trump's former Mr Fix-it makes explosive claims in Congress - will they damage the president?,"This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump Michael Cohen is unleashing a series of explosive accusations directed towards Donald Trump touching on multiple controversies that have bedevilled the president during his time in office. Here are five takeaways from his dramatic testimony to Congress. Mr Cohen suggests the president had advance knowledge of his son's June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians and that WikiLeaks was poised to release damaging information about Democrats. He says the president personally signed cheques reimbursing him for a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. He alleges that the president was fully aware of ongoing negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow well into the 2016 presidential campaign. All the latest from the hearing Many of these assertions rely almost exclusively on Cohen's word - the word of a man who has already admitted to lying to Congress and to the federal government on his taxes. What's more, while his allegations are certainly politically damaging, they aren't incontrovertible evidence of legal misconduct by the president. This video can not be played Michael Cohen: Trump told me 'Don Jr had worst judgement in world' If there is a case to be made against Mr Trump, it will have to rely on more than the word of his former lawyer and fixer. That's not to undersell the blockbuster nature of the day's proceedings, however. The public now has a chance to determine, under the glare of the spotlight, whether Cohen lied in the past to protect the president or is lying now to protect himself. Or, perhaps, a bit of both. Most of the early attention paid to Michael Cohen's testimony involved his connections to the assortment of controversies that have swirled around Mr Trump since he became president. It's one thing to read the advance text of a committee statement, however, and it's another to see it in the flesh. If there were any doubts about how effective Cohen would be as a witness, he quickly put them to rest. Cohen - in a dark suit, with his voice occasionally wavering - testified about what it was like to work with Mr Trump for more than a decade. What he learned, he said, made him ashamed. He called his former boss a racist, a cheat and a conman. He says he had both good and bad attributes, but that bad outweighed the good. ""Since taking office,"" Cohen said, ""he has become the worst version of himself."" Republicans were quick to pounce. Mark Meadows asked why, if Cohen was so ashamed, he stuck with Mr Trump for 10 full years. Wasn't it a possibility, he suggested, that Cohen was bitter that he didn't get a White House job and was taking it out on his former boss? ""I got exactly what I wanted,"" Cohen replied, noting that he preferred to spend his time in New York, with his teenage children. That may have been the case two years ago, but there's little chance Cohen wanted - or imagined - the situation he finds himself in now. Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee have repeatedly hit on what could be the most legally damaging part of Cohen's testimony on Wednesday. Mr Trump's former lawyer has presented new, documentary evidence of payments made to him by Mr Trump - including a cheque with the president's signature. He says this money was a reimbursement for his 2016 election eve hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels. The adult film star was poised to claim that she and Mr Trump had sexual relations in the 2006. US government prosecutors in New York have said that Mr Cohen's payment to Daniels constituted an undisclosed campaign contribution in violation of federal election law - a charge to which Cohen has pleaded guilty. If Cohen can help draw a connection between the Daniels payment and the president himself, it could implicate Mr Trump in a crime. The president's legal team has responded to similar allegations in the past by arguing that the payments to Cohen were part of a retainer fee and that Mr Trump had no knowledge of Cohen's illegal activities and was relying on his lawyer to know and abide by campaign finance law. The more evidence Cohen presents to back up his claim that Mr Trump was fully aware of the hush-money payments, the more difficult it becomes for him to maintain this position. The Republican strategy for responding to Cohen's testimony has been clear from the beginning. They want to paint the former lawyer as a convicted liar who can't be trusted on any count. They're less concerned about rebutting the individual allegations - about Trump Tower, Russia business dealings, hush-money payments or WikiLeaks revelations - than they are in dismissing Cohen's testimony as the work of an untruthful man being put forward by enemies of the president for political purposes. Congressman Paul Gosar went so far as to hold up a large sign with ""Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire!!"" emblazoned over a picture of the witness. Cohen has tried to parry these charges multiple ways. One is to claim that he has come to the realisation, after Mr Trump's performance as president, of how damaging his support of his former boss has been. He cited the Charlottesville violence, the Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin and the president's coarseness on Twitter as prime examples. That could be a tough sell, however, given the litany of allegations Cohen has levelled against Mr Trump that predate his time as president. A more effective counter has been when Cohen has tried to hold himself up as a cautionary tale - that he is making amends because his life has come crashing down and not the other way around. ""I protected Trump for 10 years,"" he told the committee. ""The more people that follow Mr Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering."" He called himself the ""picture perfect example of what not to do"". Cohen isn't going to convince many that he's a saint or a sympathetic figure. When he's been his most effective on Wednesday is when he hasn't tried to. Donald Trump wrapped up his day in Vietnam around the time Cohen began his congressional committee testimony. After a lavish dinner of chilled shrimp, grilled steaks and ""chocolate lava cake"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, he returned to his hotel room, where if past history is any guide, he probably reviewed the day's news coverage. What he saw couldn't have made him happy. US media - including his favourite, Fox News - are giving the Cohen hearings wall-to-wall coverage. The president's second summit with Mr Kim, being billed as ""historic"" by the White House, has been relegated to a secondary story. That might change on Thursday, when the two leaders hold a joint press event where they could announce the results of their negotiations. But for one day at least his former lawyer - who he once said was a ""fine man with a wonderful family"" and later called a ""rat"" - held the national stage. Cohen has given Democrats on the Oversight and Reform Committee a number of threads to pursue in further hearings and investigations. It isn't a stretch to imagine that portions of his testimony could someday be cited by Democrats as evidence for impeachment hearings. In addition Cohen hinted at other potential presidential wrongdoing and illegalities - including a conversation with the president in June 2018 - that he couldn't discuss because they are currently being investigated by US attorneys in New York. The president is half a world away, but the fallout from Cohen's day on Capitol Hill - a day when Cohen called the president a racist, a conman and a cheat, and Republicans called Cohen a liar - will be waiting for him when he gets home.

Airlines reroute to avoid Pakistan,"Airlines operating flights from East Asia to destinations in Europe are having to reroute their planes away from Pakistan and northern India. The airspace is closed because of escalating tension between the two countries, following the shooting down of two Indian military jets. Flights via Pakistan have been cancelled and other flights rerouted. Thai Airways has taken the more drastic step of suspending all its flights destined for Europe. With flight space south of Pakistan becoming crowded, the Bangkok-based airline has not been able to establish alternative routes for its flights. ""By closing the airspace, every flight from Thailand to Europe has been affected. For flights that are going to depart this evening, we will call an urgent meeting to consider the impact of such events,"" said Thai Airways president Sumeth Damrongchaitham. Singapore Airlines and British Airways are among the operators which have had to reroute flights. Singapore Airlines said longer flight routes would make refuelling necessary. Alex Seftel and travelling companion Hannah Kingsley are waiting for a new flight out of Bangkok Alex Seftel, who works as a journalist, was en route from Bangkok to London on Wednesday on a flight with Taiwanese operator Eva Air. The flight was turned back over Calcutta in northern India. ""We were on the flight, a couple of hours in, and I noticed on the flight route map that it was going in the opposite direction,"" he said. ""There was a lot of circling around and we had very little information until we got into the airport."" Back in Bangkok, passengers waited several hours for an explanation before being transferred to a hotel for the night, with a new flight provisionally scheduled for early Thursday. Some international flights have been rerouted through Mumbai on India's western coast. Mark Martin, founder and chief executive at Martin Consulting India, said about 800 flights a day used the India-Pakistan air corridor, making it ""very critical"". ""You can't overfly China, so you have to overfly Pakistan and India and go to South East Asia and Australia. Most of the traffic destined for Bangkok and Singapore will have to fly over Iran and then possibly take a detour,"" he said. The recent flare-up between Indian and Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir began when a suicide car bomb killed 40 Indian paramilitary police on 14 February. India retaliated with an airstrike on what it said was a militant training base on Tuesday. Indian domestic airlines, including IndiGo, Go Air, Jet Airways and Vistara, cancelled services in northern India because of airport closures, although Indian airports later resumed operations.

"Nine jailed for abusing care home girlsThe men used drink, drugs and violence to groom and sexually exploit two vulnerable young girls.Leeds & West Yorkshire","(From top left, clockwise) Basharat Khaliq, Saeed Akhtar, Naveed Akhtar, Parvaze Ahmed, Zeeshan Ali, Fahim Iqbal, Izar Hussain, Mohammed Usman and Kieran Harris were all jailed at Bradford Crown Court Nine men who raped and abused two teenage girls who were living in a children's home have been jailed. The girls were aged 14 when the men first began to use drink, drugs and violence to groom and sexually exploit them. Bradford Crown Court heard the abuse started after the girls moved into the home in 2008. The nine were convicted of 22 offences including rape and inciting child prostitution. A tenth defendant was cleared of rape. One of the women, Fiona Goddard, decided to waive her legal right to life-long anonymity to show other victims of abuse ""there is nothing to be ashamed of"". Fiona Goddard, 25, waived her legal right to life-long anonymity to discuss her experiences Sentencing the men to jail terms ranging from 20 years to 18 months, Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said: ""You appear not to have shown any respect for the minimum standards of decent behaviour."" During the trial, which lasted more than six weeks, prosecutor Karma Melly QC said the gang had taken advantage of the girls' age and situation. Read more Yorkshire stories She said: ""Some of the defendants were actually forceful, threatening and violent, others used alcohol and drugs, others created a manipulated relationship in order to facilitate their sexual exploitation."" Reading from an impact statement, Ms Goddard, 25, told the court: ""I can't change what's happened, but I can rebuild my life."" The jury heard it was Basharat Khaliq who first met the girls in 2008, when he was 27 and they were both 14, before taking them to a petrol station and buying them a bottle of vodka. Over the following years he groomed and repeatedly raped one of the girls and on one occasion abused Ms Goddard. The abuse began while the two victims were living in a children's home in Bradford At about the same time the girls also separately met brothers Saeed and Naveed Akthar, with much of the abuse taking place at Saeed's former address on Saffron Drive. Ms Melly said: ""Fiona was used for sex by the men that came to the property. ""She was used by Saeed to get drugs and bring them back, she was told to go and meet dealers and to ensure she came back with drugs though she was given no money for them. ""She was in effect used as a prostitute on his instruction."" The allegations came to light in 2014 when Ms Goddard saw a report on the grooming and sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls in Rotherham on BBC Look North. She asked her then partner to contact the BBC to say that similar abuse was happening elsewhere and the BBC ""quite properly"" notified police. I would like to take this opportunity to explain why I decided to waive my anonymity. It's because I wanted to show anyone who has gone through, or is going through, anything similar that there is nothing to be ashamed of. Crimes like these haven't always been dealt with appropriately in the past, but I am proud to say that the police and other services are working really hard to change this and the stigma surrounding it. I would like to assure people that if they did come forward, they would be believed and supported. Speaking outside court, Fiona Goddard told the BBC: ""These men have influenced every aspect of my life, for as long as I can remember. ""Today, I got to stand in front of them and take that control back and know that they are never going to impact my life again."" Judge Hall told the courtroom: ""Your primary victim sits in court and that lady has shown the utmost courage. ""No doubt for years she felt she had no voice and that she was powerless - well she's got a voice now."" He added: ""No major city in England and Wales seems to have been spared this problem of grooming by older men acting together or alone.""

Shooting range criticised for IS bride target,"Shamima Begum left the UK to join the Islamic State group aged 15 A shooting range in Merseyside has been criticised for using images of IS bride Shamima Begum as a target. Labour MP Angela Eagle said she was ""disapproving"" of the use of living people's faces by Ultimate Airsoft Range in Wallasey. Ms Begum left the UK at 15 to join the Islamic State group in 2015, andhas since had her UK citizenship revoked. The range said it had responded to requests from customers, with ""record numbers"" wanting Ms Begum as a target. Wallasey's Ultimate Airsoft Range told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the range was intended ""for people to learn the importance and safety of handling weapons, while having fun"". ""Our targets provide some fantastic reactions and conversations... bringing out the inner child in all,"" a spokesperson said. Images provided to the BBC show one target of Ms Begum with tens of holes from where shots had been fired into it. Guns and helmets used at Ultimate Airsoft Range The company, which says it provides ""family fun"" for adults and children aged six and over, announced the new targets containing Ms Begum's face in a tweet. The tweet read ""hot off the press"" and showed an image of Ms Begum overlaid with a target. It contained hashtags such as ""made your choice"" and ""no remorse"". The post has since been deleted. Angela Eagle, MP for Wallasey, said she was not in favour of having real people's faces on targets ""because it could be misinterpreted"". ""They shouldn't be using living people as targets - especially as six-year-olds might be playing,"" she added. Ultimate Airsoft Range said it provided targets of other public figures, citing Donald Trump, Adolf Hitler and Justin Bieber as examples. ""The targets we provide do not necessarily always reflect our personal opinions,"" a spokesperson said, adding that Ultimate Airsoft Range LTD does not condone terrorism or anyone involved in it. ""After watching footage of Shamima Begum being interviewed and the lack of remorse and empathy she shows, we chose to go ahead and run the targets."" Ms Begum was a 15-year-old schoolgirl when she left her home in east London in 2015 to join the Islamic State group. Earlier this month she was discovered living in a refugee camp in northern Syria where she recently gave birth to a baby son. In an interview with the BBC,she said she did not regret travelling to Syria, though she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She said while it was ""wrong"" innocent adults and children died in the 2017 Manchester Arena attack, it was ""kind of retaliation"" for attacks on IS. Her family have told Home Secretary Sajid Javid they intend to challenge his decision to revoke her UK citizenship.

India demands Pakistan release pilot,"This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet India has demanded the release of a fighter pilot shot down by Pakistan warplanes in a major escalation between the two nuclear powers over Kashmir. Video showing the pilot - blindfolded and with blood on his face - was shared by Pakistan's information ministry. India described the images as a ""vulgar display of an injured personnel"". Social media users in India have hailed the pilot as a hero. Others are urging both countries to show restraint, with the hashtag #SayNoToWar. The recent aerial attacks across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Indian and Pakistani territory in Kashmir are the first since a war in 1971. The incident, in which Pakistan said it had shot down two military jets, has escalated tensions between the two nations, both of whom claim all of Kashmir, but control only parts of it. Airlines reroute to avoid Pakistan India and Pakistan in uncharted waters Who is the Indian pilot captured by Pakistan? It came a day afterIndia struck what it said was a militant camp in Pakistanin retaliation for a suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian troops in Kashmir. A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. On Wednesday, the US urged India and Pakistan to avoid further military action and said it was focused on de-escalating the tension between the two sides. Pakistan says the Indian pilot, named as as Wing Commander Abhinandan, is being treated well The Indian Air Force pilot, identified as Wing Commander Abhinandan, had been reported ""missing in action"" by Indian officials. Images then circulated of his capture, which were both condemned for what appeared to be a physical attack at the hands of residents in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, and praised for the actions of the Pakistani soldiers who intervened to create a barrier. Pakistan's information ministry published - but subsequently deleted - a video purporting to show the blindfolded pilot, who could be heard requesting water, after he had been captured. Pakistan's information ministry tweeted a video purporting to show a captured Indian pilot In later footage, Wing Commander Abhinandan could be seen sipping tea from a cup without a blindfold and appeared to have been cleaned up. He answered a number of questions including his name, military position and that he was from ""down south"", before refusing to share any details when asked about his mission: ""I'm not supposed to tell you that."" Pakistan's military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said the pilot was being ""treated as per norms of military ethics"". Correspondents point out that this is the first major conflict between the two countries since social media became mainstream. And the social media reactions over the last few days have been a very good indicator of the changing mood in India ever since the Pulwama attack. Largely driven by angry television media coverage, the days after the bombing were full of calls for war and the desire to ""teach Pakistan a lesson"". On Tuesday, when India announced it had launched air strikes on militants inside Pakistani territory, the mood was jubilant. The hashtags ranged from #IndiaStrikesBack and #HowsTheJosh (which translates to 'how is the fighting spirit') - a line taken from the Bollywood film Uri which celebrated India's first ""surgical strike"" in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in 2016. But with Wing Commander Abhinandan's capture, the jubilation died down. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Maj Gen Ghafoor said that Pakistan fighter jets had carried out ""strikes"" - exactly what they did remains unclear - in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday. Two Indian air force jets then responded, crossing the de facto border that divides Kashmir. ""Our jets were ready and we shot both of them down,"" he said. Pakistani soldiers by what Pakistan says is wreckage from a downed Indian jet Pakistan's information ministry also tweeted what it said was footage of one of the downed Indian jets.

India's Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Raveesh Kumar acknowledged the loss of a MiG-21 fighter jet and its pilot. He also said that an Indian plane had shot down a Pakistani fighter jet, and Indian ground forces observed it falling on the Pakistani side of the LoC. Pakistan denied any of its jets had been hit. The sequence of events over the last few days have rapidly shifted from being seen as a boost for the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections, to a general feeling of disenchantment over the way things have turned out. On Wednesday evening, when news of the captured pilot dominated headlines, India's opposition parties issued a statement in which they attacked the ruling BJP of ""blatant politicisation of the armed forces' sacrifices"". In a series of tweets, India's finance minister Arun Jaitley hit back, saying the joint statement was ""being used by Pakistan to bolster its case"". Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not publicly commented on the situation since Tuesday when India announced its air strikes on militant bases inside Pakistan. There is mounting pressure on Mr Modi - who will face an election by the end of May - to say something about the current situation. Many have compared his silence to Prime Minister Imran Khan, who addressed the nation on Wednesday and called for dialogue with India. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a televised address that the two sides could not afford a miscalculation ""given the weapons we have"". ""We should sit down and talk,"" he said. As it happened: Fears rise amid India-Pakistan escalation Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir ""If we let it happen, it will remain neither in my nor Narendra Modi's control. ""Our action is just to let them know that just like they intruded into our territory, we are also capable of going into their territory,"" he added. Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj also said ""India does not wish to see further escalation of the situation,"" speaking from a meeting with Russian and Chinese foreign ministers in China.

Corbyn: We will support Brexit referendum,"Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will back another EU referendum after his alternative Brexit plan was again defeated in the Commons. But the Labour leader said he will also continue to push for ""other available options"" including a general election. John McDonnell said the party would table an amendment for a referendum when the ""meaningful vote"" on Theresa May's deal returns to Parliament. The shadow chancellor also told ITV's Peston show he would vote for remain. It came as MPs voted to endorse Theresa May's Brexit strategy - but only after she made a series of concessions. Brexit next steps: How did my MP vote? Kuenssberg: Numbers lesson for May and Corbyn Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Brexitcast - Boring people into submission The PM also faced a Brexiteer rebellion, after 20 Tory MPs voted against proposals, backed by the government, to delay the UK's 29 March departure date if there is a no-deal scenario. But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was not among the 20 Tory rebels, although he did abstain in the vote, offered an olive branch to Mrs May, as she continues to seek concessions from the EU on the controversial Irish backstop clause. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tories said he disagreed with those who were demanding changes to the legal text of the withdrawal agreement and would accept an appendix to it. Is Jacob Rees-Mogg softening his stance? Writing in The Daily Mail,external, he said: ""I really do not mind what form of words the Attorney General and the EU agree on regarding the backstop - as long as it expires before the next election and has the same legal status as the deal."" Other leading figures in the ERG, including deputy chairman Steve Baker, have previously dismissed the legal annex to Mrs May's agreement being negotiated by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. Labour's Brexit proposals - which would see the UK join an EU customs union - were defeated by 323 votes to 240, a bigger margin than the last time MPs voted on them. Mr Corbyn confirmed to MPs on Monday he wouldback another public vote if such a defeat took place- after resisting calls to do so from pro-EU Labour MPs. After Wednesday's vote, Mr Corbyn said: ""We will back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome. ""We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or a general election."" Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson have put forward a compromise plan to back Mrs May's deal with the condition that it is then put to a confirmatory public vote. Former shadow cabinet minister Owen Smith, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, said: ""Now that Labour's version of Brexit has been rejected by Parliament, I expect Jeremy Corbyn to throw his full weight behind campaigning for a public vote."" Labour MP David Lammy, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for another referendum, said: ""It's become clear today that there is no majority in the House for May's deal, but also that Labour's alternative plan cannot command a majority either. ""In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no-deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government's botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal."" But Labour former minister Caroline Flint said the party should not back a further referendum despite the defeat of Mr Corbyn's plan. She said: ""I think the British public want us to get on with this and sort out a deal that works."" She said Labour's leadership should ""engage in negotiation, to use the leverage you have got, to get a better deal"". MPs also rejected an SNP motion saying the UK should not leave the EU without a deal ""under any circumstances"" - by 324 votes to 288. Labour MP Yvette Cooper's amendment, which the government supported, was backed by 502 votes to 20, with a small group of Tory Brexiteers voting against it. The amendment contained Mrs May's commitment on giving MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if both her deal and no-deal are rejected by MPs. Mrs May announced this policy as she promised MPs a meaningful vote on her deal by 12 March - just 17 days before the UK is set to leave the EU. The move was designed to head off a possible defeat when MPs voted on Ms Cooper's amendment. This video can not be played Did Theresa May's latest statement rule out a no-deal Brexit, and what might happen next? Ms Cooper did not drop her amendment, because she wanted to hold the prime minister to her word - although the government has said it accepted the proposal. Conservative MP Alberto Costa's amendment, which seeks to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU and vice versa, even if there is a no-deal Brexit, was nodded through by MPs, after the government said they supported it. Mr Costa said he was still forced to resign as an aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell because of a convention that members of the government cannot table amendments to government motions. Conservative MP Caroline Spelman opted not to put her amendment - calling for the PM's promise to give MPs a vote on delaying Brexit to be made legally binding - to the vote, after reassurances by the government. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis accused Jeremy Corbyn of being ""happy to ignore the biggest democratic vote in our nation's history"" by saying he would back another referendum.

Mary Creagh said the suspension was ""not a moment too soon"", and Stephen Kinnock tweeted: ""About time."" Analysis by Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent The suspension of Chris Williamson was relatively swift, but not swift enough to suggest there has been a sea-change in dealing with the problems of anti-Semitism in the party. The initial briefing from sources close to the Labour leadership was that Chris Williamson needed to apologise, withdraw his comments and be subject to an investigation into ""his pattern of behaviour"". If he had also been suspended at this stage, it would have been a clearer signal that the leadership were imposing their avowed policy of ""zero tolerance"" on the issue. But it wasn't until Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, its reviewer of anti-Semitism cases Lord Falconer, and some of the party's prominent Jewish MPs intervened that the suspension took place. There seemed to be a greater willingness to do this in some parts of the party machine than others. But with disagreements behind the scenes over the precise sanctions to deploy, Labour allowed their political opponents to steal a march at Prime Minister's Questions - and gave more publicity to The Independent Group, which has alleged the party is ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Labour has struggled to contain a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism - hostility or prejudice directed against Jewish people - within its ranks.Nine MPs quit the party last week,criticising the leadership's handling of the issue. But at a recent Momentum meeting in Sheffield, Mr Williamson said ""I have got to say I think our party's response has been partly responsible for that because in my opinionâ¦ we have backed off far too much, we have given too much ground, we have been too apologetic."" Amid applause from the audience, he went on to say: ""We've done more to address the scourge of anti-Semitism than any political party."" Chris Williamson said Labour had done more to address anti-Semitism than any other party The 62-year old is one of the most outspoken MPs on the left of the party A former bricklayer and social worker, he was a councillor before entering Parliament Led Derby Council twice in the 2000s, where he formed a coalition with the Tories Elected as MP for Derby North in 2010 Lost the seat in 2015 but won it back two years later Has called on critics of Jeremy Corbyn to be de-selected On Tuesday, Labour officials criticised Mr Williamson for booking a room in Parliament for a screening of a film about anti-Semitism and the activist Jackie Walker. Ms Walker was suspended by Labourover allegedly anti-Semitic comments in 2016, and the documentary, Witch Hunt, looks at those and other allegations within the party. Earlier this month, the Labour Party's general secretary, Jennie Formby,said the party had received 673 complaintsin 10 months alleging acts of anti-Semitism by its members.

But senior figures called for Labour to go further and take disciplinary action, with ex-leader Ed Miliband describing the row as ""a test"" for the party. Labour MP suspended in anti-Semitism row May calls on Corbyn to sack Williamson A guide to the anti-Semitism row Sajid Javid vows to tackle anti-Semitism A number of Labour MPs have taken to Twitter to welcome the decision by the party. But Margaret Hodge questioned why it had taken so long to suspend Mr Williamson. ""He has form,"" she told the BBC. ""He has done this before, he has apologised before and then he has done the same thing again. ""In the current climate not to show strong, immediate, determined action to stand out anti-Semitism was a mistake. The fact it has finally happened is a relief."" This video can not be played Hodge: 'Relief' over Chris Williamson suspension Wes Streeting also welcomed the suspension, adding: ""We got there eventually and I hope that this sends a message to other people in the Labour Party that dismissing or delegitimising concerns about anti-Semitism isn't acceptable.""

Mary Creagh said the suspension was ""not a moment too soon"", and Stephen Kinnock tweeted: ""About time."" Analysis by Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent The suspension of Chris Williamson was relatively swift, but not swift enough to suggest there has been a sea-change in dealing with the problems of anti-Semitism in the party. The initial briefing from sources close to the Labour leadership was that Chris Williamson needed to apologise, withdraw his comments and be subject to an investigation into ""his pattern of behaviour"". If he had also been suspended at this stage, it would have been a clearer signal that the leadership were imposing their avowed policy of ""zero tolerance"" on the issue. But it wasn't until Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, its reviewer of anti-Semitism cases Lord Falconer, and some of the party's prominent Jewish MPs intervened that the suspension took place. There seemed to be a greater willingness to do this in some parts of the party machine than others. But with disagreements behind the scenes over the precise sanctions to deploy, Labour allowed their political opponents to steal a march at Prime Minister's Questions - and gave more publicity to The Independent Group, which has alleged the party is ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Labour has struggled to contain a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism - hostility or prejudice directed against Jewish people - within its ranks.Nine MPs quit the party last week,criticising the leadership's handling of the issue. But at a recent Momentum meeting in Sheffield, Mr Williamson said ""I have got to say I think our party's response has been partly responsible for that because in my opinionâ¦ we have backed off far too much, we have given too much ground, we have been too apologetic."" Amid applause from the audience, he went on to say: ""We've done more to address the scourge of anti-Semitism than any political party."" Chris Williamson said Labour had done more to address anti-Semitism than any other party The 62-year old is one of the most outspoken MPs on the left of the party A former bricklayer and social worker, he was a councillor before entering Parliament Led Derby Council twice in the 2000s, where he formed a coalition with the Tories Elected as MP for Derby North in 2010 Lost the seat in 2015 but won it back two years later Has called on critics of Jeremy Corbyn to be de-selected On Tuesday, Labour officials criticised Mr Williamson for booking a room in Parliament for a screening of a film about anti-Semitism and the activist Jackie Walker. Ms Walker was suspended by Labourover allegedly anti-Semitic comments in 2016, and the documentary, Witch Hunt, looks at those and other allegations within the party. Earlier this month, the Labour Party's general secretary, Jennie Formby,said the party had received 673 complaintsin 10 months alleging acts of anti-Semitism by its members.

Airlines reroute to avoid PakistanThe closure of Pakistan's airspace has prompted several airlines to reroute or suspend services.Business,"Airlines operating flights from East Asia to destinations in Europe are having to reroute their planes away from Pakistan and northern India. The airspace is closed because of escalating tension between the two countries, following the shooting down of two Indian military jets. Flights via Pakistan have been cancelled and other flights rerouted. Thai Airways has taken the more drastic step of suspending all its flights destined for Europe. With flight space south of Pakistan becoming crowded, the Bangkok-based airline has not been able to establish alternative routes for its flights. ""By closing the airspace, every flight from Thailand to Europe has been affected. For flights that are going to depart this evening, we will call an urgent meeting to consider the impact of such events,"" said Thai Airways president Sumeth Damrongchaitham. Singapore Airlines and British Airways are among the operators which have had to reroute flights. Singapore Airlines said longer flight routes would make refuelling necessary. Alex Seftel and travelling companion Hannah Kingsley are waiting for a new flight out of Bangkok Alex Seftel, who works as a journalist, was en route from Bangkok to London on Wednesday on a flight with Taiwanese operator Eva Air. The flight was turned back over Calcutta in northern India. ""We were on the flight, a couple of hours in, and I noticed on the flight route map that it was going in the opposite direction,"" he said. ""There was a lot of circling around and we had very little information until we got into the airport."" Back in Bangkok, passengers waited several hours for an explanation before being transferred to a hotel for the night, with a new flight provisionally scheduled for early Thursday. Some international flights have been rerouted through Mumbai on India's western coast. Mark Martin, founder and chief executive at Martin Consulting India, said about 800 flights a day used the India-Pakistan air corridor, making it ""very critical"". ""You can't overfly China, so you have to overfly Pakistan and India and go to South East Asia and Australia. Most of the traffic destined for Bangkok and Singapore will have to fly over Iran and then possibly take a detour,"" he said. The recent flare-up between Indian and Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir began when a suicide car bomb killed 40 Indian paramilitary police on 14 February. India retaliated with an airstrike on what it said was a militant training base on Tuesday. Indian domestic airlines, including IndiGo, Go Air, Jet Airways and Vistara, cancelled services in northern India because of airport closures, although Indian airports later resumed operations.

"MPs endorse May's Brexit strategyLabour's Brexit plans are defeated, with Jeremy Corbyn expected to face calls to get behind a further EU referendum.","Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will back another EU referendum after his alternative Brexit plan was again defeated in the Commons. But the Labour leader said he will also continue to push for ""other available options"" including a general election. John McDonnell said the party would table an amendment for a referendum when the ""meaningful vote"" on Theresa May's deal returns to Parliament. The shadow chancellor also told ITV's Peston show he would vote for remain. It came as MPs voted to endorse Theresa May's Brexit strategy - but only after she made a series of concessions. Brexit next steps: How did my MP vote? Kuenssberg: Numbers lesson for May and Corbyn Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Brexitcast - Boring people into submission The PM also faced a Brexiteer rebellion, after 20 Tory MPs voted against proposals, backed by the government, to delay the UK's 29 March departure date if there is a no-deal scenario. But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was not among the 20 Tory rebels, although he did abstain in the vote, offered an olive branch to Mrs May, as she continues to seek concessions from the EU on the controversial Irish backstop clause. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tories said he disagreed with those who were demanding changes to the legal text of the withdrawal agreement and would accept an appendix to it. Is Jacob Rees-Mogg softening his stance? Writing in The Daily Mail,external, he said: ""I really do not mind what form of words the Attorney General and the EU agree on regarding the backstop - as long as it expires before the next election and has the same legal status as the deal."" Other leading figures in the ERG, including deputy chairman Steve Baker, have previously dismissed the legal annex to Mrs May's agreement being negotiated by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. Labour's Brexit proposals - which would see the UK join an EU customs union - were defeated by 323 votes to 240, a bigger margin than the last time MPs voted on them. Mr Corbyn confirmed to MPs on Monday he wouldback another public vote if such a defeat took place- after resisting calls to do so from pro-EU Labour MPs. After Wednesday's vote, Mr Corbyn said: ""We will back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome. ""We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or a general election."" Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson have put forward a compromise plan to back Mrs May's deal with the condition that it is then put to a confirmatory public vote. Former shadow cabinet minister Owen Smith, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, said: ""Now that Labour's version of Brexit has been rejected by Parliament, I expect Jeremy Corbyn to throw his full weight behind campaigning for a public vote."" Labour MP David Lammy, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for another referendum, said: ""It's become clear today that there is no majority in the House for May's deal, but also that Labour's alternative plan cannot command a majority either. ""In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no-deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government's botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal."" But Labour former minister Caroline Flint said the party should not back a further referendum despite the defeat of Mr Corbyn's plan. She said: ""I think the British public want us to get on with this and sort out a deal that works."" She said Labour's leadership should ""engage in negotiation, to use the leverage you have got, to get a better deal"". MPs also rejected an SNP motion saying the UK should not leave the EU without a deal ""under any circumstances"" - by 324 votes to 288. Labour MP Yvette Cooper's amendment, which the government supported, was backed by 502 votes to 20, with a small group of Tory Brexiteers voting against it. The amendment contained Mrs May's commitment on giving MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if both her deal and no-deal are rejected by MPs. Mrs May announced this policy as she promised MPs a meaningful vote on her deal by 12 March - just 17 days before the UK is set to leave the EU. The move was designed to head off a possible defeat when MPs voted on Ms Cooper's amendment. This video can not be played Did Theresa May's latest statement rule out a no-deal Brexit, and what might happen next? Ms Cooper did not drop her amendment, because she wanted to hold the prime minister to her word - although the government has said it accepted the proposal. Conservative MP Alberto Costa's amendment, which seeks to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU and vice versa, even if there is a no-deal Brexit, was nodded through by MPs, after the government said they supported it. Mr Costa said he was still forced to resign as an aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell because of a convention that members of the government cannot table amendments to government motions. Conservative MP Caroline Spelman opted not to put her amendment - calling for the PM's promise to give MPs a vote on delaying Brexit to be made legally binding - to the vote, after reassurances by the government. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis accused Jeremy Corbyn of being ""happy to ignore the biggest democratic vote in our nation's history"" by saying he would back another referendum.

Nine jailed for abusing care home girls,"(From top left, clockwise) Basharat Khaliq, Saeed Akhtar, Naveed Akhtar, Parvaze Ahmed, Zeeshan Ali, Fahim Iqbal, Izar Hussain, Mohammed Usman and Kieran Harris were all jailed at Bradford Crown Court Nine men who raped and abused two teenage girls who were living in a children's home have been jailed. The girls were aged 14 when the men first began to use drink, drugs and violence to groom and sexually exploit them. Bradford Crown Court heard the abuse started after the girls moved into the home in 2008. The nine were convicted of 22 offences including rape and inciting child prostitution. A tenth defendant was cleared of rape. One of the women, Fiona Goddard, decided to waive her legal right to life-long anonymity to show other victims of abuse ""there is nothing to be ashamed of"". Fiona Goddard, 25, waived her legal right to life-long anonymity to discuss her experiences Sentencing the men to jail terms ranging from 20 years to 18 months, Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said: ""You appear not to have shown any respect for the minimum standards of decent behaviour."" During the trial, which lasted more than six weeks, prosecutor Karma Melly QC said the gang had taken advantage of the girls' age and situation. Read more Yorkshire stories She said: ""Some of the defendants were actually forceful, threatening and violent, others used alcohol and drugs, others created a manipulated relationship in order to facilitate their sexual exploitation."" Reading from an impact statement, Ms Goddard, 25, told the court: ""I can't change what's happened, but I can rebuild my life."" The jury heard it was Basharat Khaliq who first met the girls in 2008, when he was 27 and they were both 14, before taking them to a petrol station and buying them a bottle of vodka. Over the following years he groomed and repeatedly raped one of the girls and on one occasion abused Ms Goddard. The abuse began while the two victims were living in a children's home in Bradford At about the same time the girls also separately met brothers Saeed and Naveed Akthar, with much of the abuse taking place at Saeed's former address on Saffron Drive. Ms Melly said: ""Fiona was used for sex by the men that came to the property. ""She was used by Saeed to get drugs and bring them back, she was told to go and meet dealers and to ensure she came back with drugs though she was given no money for them. ""She was in effect used as a prostitute on his instruction."" The allegations came to light in 2014 when Ms Goddard saw a report on the grooming and sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls in Rotherham on BBC Look North. She asked her then partner to contact the BBC to say that similar abuse was happening elsewhere and the BBC ""quite properly"" notified police. I would like to take this opportunity to explain why I decided to waive my anonymity. It's because I wanted to show anyone who has gone through, or is going through, anything similar that there is nothing to be ashamed of. Crimes like these haven't always been dealt with appropriately in the past, but I am proud to say that the police and other services are working really hard to change this and the stigma surrounding it. I would like to assure people that if they did come forward, they would be believed and supported. Speaking outside court, Fiona Goddard told the BBC: ""These men have influenced every aspect of my life, for as long as I can remember. ""Today, I got to stand in front of them and take that control back and know that they are never going to impact my life again."" Judge Hall told the courtroom: ""Your primary victim sits in court and that lady has shown the utmost courage. ""No doubt for years she felt she had no voice and that she was powerless - well she's got a voice now."" He added: ""No major city in England and Wales seems to have been spared this problem of grooming by older men acting together or alone."" Basharat Khaliq, 38, of Deanwood Crescent, Bradford, was found guilty of five counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration and jailed for 20 years Saeed Akhtar, 55, of Back Girlington Road, Bradford, was convicted of two counts of inciting child prostitution and one count of rape and jailed for 20 years Naveed Akhtar, 43, of Newport Place, Bradford, was found guilty of two counts of rape and cleared of one count of rape. He was jailed for 17 years Parvaze Ahmed 36, of Farcliffe Road, Bradford, was convicted of three counts of rape and jailed for 17 years Izar Hussain, 32, of St Leonard's Road, Bradford, was found guilty of one count of rape, one count of attempted rape and cleared of two counts of rape. He was jailed for 16 years Zeeshan Ali, 32, of Durham Terrace, Bradford, was convicted of one count of sexual assault and jailed for 18 months Kieran Harris, 28, of Fir Parade, Dewsbury, was found guilty of two counts of rape and jailed for 17 years Faheem Iqbal, 27, of no fixed abode, was convicted of one count of aiding and abetting rape and jailed for seven years Mohammed Usman, 31, of Quaker Street, Bradford, was found guilty of two counts of rape and jailed for 17 years Yasar Majid, 37, of Milton Keynes, was cleared of rape Nazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor in north-west England, said: ""Everybody responsible for the safeguarding of these young girls and every other victim has failed them. ""The police don't have the resources, the prosecutors don't have the resources and most importantly the community groups don't have the resources and I think we will be in this position and I will be having this conversation for years to come.""

'Tiniest baby boy' leaves Tokyo hospital,"The baby at the age of five days... A baby boy who weighed just 268g (9.45oz) at birth has been released from hospital in Japan, and is believed to be the smallest boy in the world to have been successfully treated. The baby was born by emergency C-section in August, and was so small he could fit into a pair of cupped hands. The infant was nurtured in intensive care until he was released last week, two months after his due date. He had grown to a weight of 3.2kg, and is now feeding normally. Born at 24 weeks, the tiny boy spent five months in hospital. ""I can only say I'm happy that he has grown this big because honestly, I wasn't sure he could survive,"" the boy's mother said, according to Tokyo's Keio University Hospital. Doctor Takeshi Arimitsu, who treated the extraordinary baby, told the BBC he was the smallest infant born (on record) to be discharged from a hospital,according to a database of the world's littlest babies held by the University of Iowa,external. He said he wanted to show that ""there is a possibility that babies will be able to leave the hospital in good health, even though they are born small"". ... and weighing a healthy 3.2kg - twelve times his birth weight - just before he left hospital The previous record-holder was a boy born in Germany, weighing 274g. The smallest surviving baby girl in that same database was also born in Germany, in 2015, and reportedly weighed 252g. 'I didn't think she would see Christmas' Parents' care 'can help' premature babies Keio University Hospital said the survival rate of babies born weighing less than a kilogram is about 90% in Japan. But for those born under 300g, that falls to around 50%. Among the very smallest babies, the survival rate is much lower for boys than girls. Medical experts are unsure why, though some believe it could be linked to the slower development of male babies' lungs.

India demands Pakistan release pilotTensions rise over a fighter pilot being held following an exchange of fire over disputed Kashmir.,"This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet India has demanded the release of a fighter pilot shot down by Pakistan warplanes in a major escalation between the two nuclear powers over Kashmir. Video showing the pilot - blindfolded and with blood on his face - was shared by Pakistan's information ministry. India described the images as a ""vulgar display of an injured personnel"". Social media users in India have hailed the pilot as a hero. Others are urging both countries to show restraint, with the hashtag #SayNoToWar. The recent aerial attacks across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Indian and Pakistani territory in Kashmir are the first since a war in 1971. The incident, in which Pakistan said it had shot down two military jets, has escalated tensions between the two nations, both of whom claim all of Kashmir, but control only parts of it. Airlines reroute to avoid Pakistan India and Pakistan in uncharted waters Who is the Indian pilot captured by Pakistan? It came a day afterIndia struck what it said was a militant camp in Pakistanin retaliation for a suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian troops in Kashmir. A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. On Wednesday, the US urged India and Pakistan to avoid further military action and said it was focused on de-escalating the tension between the two sides. Pakistan says the Indian pilot, named as as Wing Commander Abhinandan, is being treated well The Indian Air Force pilot, identified as Wing Commander Abhinandan, had been reported ""missing in action"" by Indian officials. Images then circulated of his capture, which were both condemned for what appeared to be a physical attack at the hands of residents in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, and praised for the actions of the Pakistani soldiers who intervened to create a barrier. Pakistan's information ministry published - but subsequently deleted - a video purporting to show the blindfolded pilot, who could be heard requesting water, after he had been captured. Pakistan's information ministry tweeted a video purporting to show a captured Indian pilot In later footage, Wing Commander Abhinandan could be seen sipping tea from a cup without a blindfold and appeared to have been cleaned up. He answered a number of questions including his name, military position and that he was from ""down south"", before refusing to share any details when asked about his mission: ""I'm not supposed to tell you that."" Pakistan's military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said the pilot was being ""treated as per norms of military ethics"". Correspondents point out that this is the first major conflict between the two countries since social media became mainstream. And the social media reactions over the last few days have been a very good indicator of the changing mood in India ever since the Pulwama attack. Largely driven by angry television media coverage, the days after the bombing were full of calls for war and the desire to ""teach Pakistan a lesson"". On Tuesday, when India announced it had launched air strikes on militants inside Pakistani territory, the mood was jubilant. The hashtags ranged from #IndiaStrikesBack and #HowsTheJosh (which translates to 'how is the fighting spirit') - a line taken from the Bollywood film Uri which celebrated India's first ""surgical strike"" in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in 2016. But with Wing Commander Abhinandan's capture, the jubilation died down. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Maj Gen Ghafoor said that Pakistan fighter jets had carried out ""strikes"" - exactly what they did remains unclear - in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday. Two Indian air force jets then responded, crossing the de facto border that divides Kashmir. ""Our jets were ready and we shot both of them down,"" he said. Pakistani soldiers by what Pakistan says is wreckage from a downed Indian jet Pakistan's information ministry also tweeted what it said was footage of one of the downed Indian jets.

India's Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Raveesh Kumar acknowledged the loss of a MiG-21 fighter jet and its pilot. He also said that an Indian plane had shot down a Pakistani fighter jet, and Indian ground forces observed it falling on the Pakistani side of the LoC. Pakistan denied any of its jets had been hit. The sequence of events over the last few days have rapidly shifted from being seen as a boost for the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections, to a general feeling of disenchantment over the way things have turned out. On Wednesday evening, when news of the captured pilot dominated headlines, India's opposition parties issued a statement in which they attacked the ruling BJP of ""blatant politicisation of the armed forces' sacrifices"". In a series of tweets, India's finance minister Arun Jaitley hit back, saying the joint statement was ""being used by Pakistan to bolster its case"". Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not publicly commented on the situation since Tuesday when India announced its air strikes on militant bases inside Pakistan. There is mounting pressure on Mr Modi - who will face an election by the end of May - to say something about the current situation. Many have compared his silence to Prime Minister Imran Khan, who addressed the nation on Wednesday and called for dialogue with India. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a televised address that the two sides could not afford a miscalculation ""given the weapons we have"". ""We should sit down and talk,"" he said. As it happened: Fears rise amid India-Pakistan escalation Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir ""If we let it happen, it will remain neither in my nor Narendra Modi's control. ""Our action is just to let them know that just like they intruded into our territory, we are also capable of going into their territory,"" he added. Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj also said ""India does not wish to see further escalation of the situation,"" speaking from a meeting with Russian and Chinese foreign ministers in China.

My officers have been given extensive powers to search people without the need to suspect they are carrying weapons. ""I recognise this will upset some innocent young people, but I fear the carriage of weapons in the current environment is growing, often through fear, and we can take no chances. ""For our young people, their families and communities we need to stop this emergency quickly. Without specific areas or people to target that means blunt action to prevent violence.""

Glastonbury bans plastic bottle sales,"More than a million plastic bottles were sold at Glastonbury 2017, organisers said Single-use plastic bottles are to be banned from sale at Glastonbury. An announcement on the festival's website said the containers would not be supplied backstage, nor to catering or production staff. Festivalgoers have also been urged to carry ""as little single-use plastic as possible"". Organiser Emily Eavis encouraged ticket-holders to bring reusable bottles and said ""hundreds of free water taps"" would be available. A Glastonbury spokesman said more than one million plastic bottles were sold at 2017's event. Ms Eavis said it was ""paramount for our planet"" to reduce plastic consumption. ""I'm thrilled that, together, we'll be able to prevent over a million single-use plastic bottles from being used at this year's festival."" Acts confirmed for this year's event include Janelle Monae, Stormzy and Kylie Minogue.

Jet downing raises India-Pakistan tension,"This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet Pakistan says it has shot down two Indian military jets and captured a pilot in a major escalation between the nuclear powers over Kashmir. India said it had lost one MiG-21 fighter and demanded the immediate and safe return of its pilot. Pakistani PM Imran Khan said the two sides could not afford a miscalculation with the weapons they had. India and Pakistan - both nuclear-armed states - claim all of Kashmir, but control only parts of it. They have fought three wars since independence from Britain and partition in 1947. All but one were over Kashmir. As it happened: Fears rise amid India-Pakistan escalation India and Pakistan in uncharted waters The aerial attacks across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Indian and Pakistani territory are the first since a war in 1971. They follow a militant attack in Kashmir which killed at least 40 Indian troops - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack. The BBC's Soutik Biswas, in Delhi, says the challenge for India and Pakistan now is to contain the latest escalation before things get completely out of control. Pakistan's military spokesman said that Pakistan fighter jets had carried out ""strikes"" - exactly what they did remains unclear - in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday. Two Indian air force jets then responded, crossing the de facto border that divides Kashmir. ""Our jets were ready and we shot both of them down,"" Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said. He said that one Indian pilot was in the custody of the Pakistani army. Officials had previously said two pilots had been captured and one had been taken to hospital. No explanation has been given as to why the numbers have changed. Maj Gen Ghafoor said the captured Indian pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan, was being ""treated as per norms of military ethics"". Earlier Pakistan's information ministry published but subsequently deleted a video showing the pilot - blindfolded and with blood on his face - identifying himself to soldiers. Pakistan's information ministry tweeted a video purporting to show a captured Indian pilot Another video circulating on social media appeared to show the pilot being beaten by residents in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir before the arrival of Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan's information ministry also tweeted what it said was footage of one of the downed Indian jets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

India's foreign ministry later issued a statement demanding the release of its fighter pilot and condemning the images shared by Pakistan of Wing Commander Abhinandan, describing them as a ""vulgar display of an injured personnel"". In a televised address, Prime Minister Khan offered India talks over terrorism and warned against further escalation. ""If we let it happen, it will remain neither in my nor Narendra Modi's control,"" he said. ""Our action is just to let them know that just like they intruded into our territory, we are also capable of going into their territory,"" he added. Mr Modi has yet to comment but was meeting top security and intelligence officials to discuss the situation, reports in India said. Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said her country would act ""with responsibility and restraint"". ""India does not wish to see further escalation of the situation,"" she said, speaking from a meeting with Russian and Chinese foreign ministers in China. Pakistan's assertion that it had shot down two Indian aircraft came shortly after Islamabad said its warplanes had struck targets in Indian territory. Indian authorities said the Pakistani jets had been forced to withdraw. Viewpoint: India strikes in Pakistan a major escalation What is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad?

India said Tuesday's air strikes on Balakot in north-western Pakistan killed a large number of militants, but Pakistan said there had been no casualties. The US, EU and China have all called for restraint. By Soutik Biswas, BBC News, Delhi The challenge for India and Pakistan now is to contain the escalation before things get completely out of control. It is almost unprecedented for two nuclear-armed countries to carry out air strikes into each other's territories. ""We are in uncharted waters,"" Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to the US and adviser to three Pakistani prime ministers, told me late on Tuesday. An Indian defence analyst believes Indian security forces will now have to be prepared for a ""full spectrum of conflict"". However Daniel Markey from Johns Hopkins University in the US says we are ""several steps away"" from nuclear escalation. A further escalation, he believes, will happen if Pakistan's ""next step were to raise the stakes by hitting Indian civilian targets"". That is highly unlikely.

Later on WednesdayThai Airways, which said it was directly affected by the closure of airspace, cancelled all Europe-bound flightsand said it had requested permission to use other routes. Other airlines such as British Airways, Air India, Jet Airways, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines re-routed flights. Both Indian and Pakistani troops have been shelling across the LoC. Four Pakistani civilians were killed and 10 others were injured in cross-border shelling on Tuesday. On the Indian side, five soldiers were also injured in the firing, officials told the BBC. Schools in at least two districts along the LoC - Rajouri and Poonch - have been closed. People living along the de facto border have been asked to leave their homes. In a separate incident on Wednesday morning, six members of the Indian Air Force were killed when their helicopter crashed in Indian-administered Kashmir.

"Labour MP suspended in anti-Semitism rowChris Williamson had apologised for saying the party had ""given too much ground"" over the issue.","This video can not be played Chris Williamson: ""I'm absolutely determined to clear my name"" Labour has suspended MP Chris Williamson over remarks about the party's handling of anti-Semitism. The Derby North MP said Labour had ""given too much ground"" in the face of criticism over the issue, but later said he ""deeply regrets"" the remarks. A number of Labour MPs had called for his suspension and the parliamentary party said he was no longer welcome at their meetings. A Labour spokesman confirmed he has now been suspended ""pending investigation"". Mr Williamson told the BBC that he was ""absolutely determined"" to clear his name, and that he did not want anyone to think he was ""minimising the cancer of anti-Semitism"". The row erupted afterfootage was published by the Yorkshire Post,,externalshowing Mr Williamson, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, telling activists Labour had been ""too apologetic"" over anti-Semitism and was being ""demonised as a racist, bigoted party"". It also came just a week after nine Labour MPs quit the party, citing anti-Semitism as one of the main reasons for the move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At a meeting earlier on Wednesday, at which Mr Corbyn and the party's general secretary Jennie Formby were not present, the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) agreed the Mr Williamson should be suspended immediately. Labour had put the MP under ""formal notice of investigation"" over a ""pattern of behaviour"" relating to the long-running row over anti-Semitism, but a decision was later taken by Ms Formby to suspend him. Mr Williamson is reported to have held a meeting with aides of Mr Corbyn's shortly before Prime Minister's Questions began at midday. Minutes later,he issued a statement on Twitter,externalapologising, saying he never meant to downplay the ""pernicious and cancerous"" nature of anti-Semitism. But senior figures called for Labour to go further and take disciplinary action, with ex-leader Ed Miliband describing the row as ""a test"" for the party.

But Margaret Hodge questioned why it had taken so long to suspend Mr Williamson. ""He has form,"" she told the BBC. ""He has done this before, he has apologised before and then he has done the same thing again.

Mary Creagh said the suspension was ""not a moment too soon"", and Stephen Kinnock tweeted: ""About time."" Analysis by Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent The suspension of Chris Williamson was relatively swift, but not swift enough to suggest there has been a sea-change in dealing with the problems of anti-Semitism in the party. The initial briefing from sources close to the Labour leadership was that Chris Williamson needed to apologise, withdraw his comments and be subject to an investigation into ""his pattern of behaviour"". If he had also been suspended at this stage, it would have been a clearer signal that the leadership were imposing their avowed policy of ""zero tolerance"" on the issue. But it wasn't until Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, its reviewer of anti-Semitism cases Lord Falconer, and some of the party's prominent Jewish MPs intervened that the suspension took place. There seemed to be a greater willingness to do this in some parts of the party machine than others. But with disagreements behind the scenes over the precise sanctions to deploy, Labour allowed their political opponents to steal a march at Prime Minister's Questions - and gave more publicity to The Independent Group, which has alleged the party is ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Labour has struggled to contain a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism - hostility or prejudice directed against Jewish people - within its ranks.Nine MPs quit the party last week,criticising the leadership's handling of the issue. But at a recent Momentum meeting in Sheffield, Mr Williamson said ""I have got to say I think our party's response has been partly responsible for that because in my opinionâ¦ we have backed off far too much, we have given too much ground, we have been too apologetic."" Amid applause from the audience, he went on to say: ""We've done more to address the scourge of anti-Semitism than any political party."" Chris Williamson said Labour had done more to address anti-Semitism than any other party The 62-year old is one of the most outspoken MPs on the left of the party A former bricklayer and social worker, he was a councillor before entering Parliament Led Derby Council twice in the 2000s, where he formed a coalition with the Tories Elected as MP for Derby North in 2010 Lost the seat in 2015 but won it back two years later Has called on critics of Jeremy Corbyn to be de-selected On Tuesday, Labour officials criticised Mr Williamson for booking a room in Parliament for a screening of a film about anti-Semitism and the activist Jackie Walker. Ms Walker was suspended by Labourover allegedly anti-Semitic comments in 2016, and the documentary, Witch Hunt, looks at those and other allegations within the party. Earlier this month, the Labour Party's general secretary, Jennie Formby,said the party had received 673 complaintsin 10 months alleging acts of anti-Semitism by its members.

Commons debating next steps for Brexit,"MPs will have their say on the next steps for Brexit later after European leaders indicated they would consider delaying the UK's departure if a deal is not agreed by 29 March. Germany's Angela Merkel said if the UK needed more time to get Parliament's approval, she would ""not oppose"" it. Theresa May has said MPs will get a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal and a no-deal outcome are both rejected. MPs will vote on amendments to a government motion in the Commons later. Wednesday's votes are not on Mrs May's Brexit deal itself - she says that will happen before 12 March. Instead, MPs are seeking assurances and to hold the PM to her commitment, made on Tuesday, to allow MPs a vote on extending 29 March's Brexit deadline to avoid Britain leaving without a deal. The prime minister's critics have accused her of ""kicking the can down the road"" with her pledge to hold more votes before 12 March - just 17 days before Brexit. But she insisted her efforts to persuade the EU to make concessions had ""already begun to bear fruit"". Live updates: MPs debate Brexit options Which Brexit amendments have been selected? Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? How could Brexit be delayed? The government has accepted an amendment by Conservative MP Alberto Costa, which seeks to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU, and vice versa, regardless of the outcome of UK-EU negotiations. The amendment - which calls on the UK to secure agreement on this at ""the earliest opportunity"" - had gained significant cross-party backing from 141 MPs - including Labour and the Democratic Unionists. Despite this, Mr Costa has resigned his job as aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell, because, he told MPs, of a convention that members of the government should not amend government motions. He said he ""welcomed"" the government's support for his amendment but it did not go far enough. He said he wanted ministers to spell out ""exactly what measures"" Theresa May will now take to guarantee citizens rights and urged her to write to European Council President Donald Tusk. He said the rights of the estimated million UK citizens living in the EU, and the three million EU citizens in the UK, ""should never have been used as a bargaining chip"" in the government's Brexit negotiations. Green MP Caroline Lucas praised Mr Costa's stand and called for him to be reinstated in the government. Analysis by Nick Eardley, BBC Political Correspondent It looks a bit strange, doesn't it? The government accepts an amendment from a member of the government - but then essentially sacks that member of the government for tabling it in the first place. I'm told by several people that Alberto Costa was left with no decision but to resign. He met with the prime minister this morning made it clear he wasn't backing down which sealed his fate. That's left some Tories furious. They point out he has a personal interest in the EU citizens' rights issue given his Italian parentage and say he was simply trying to get assurances he had been offered by Theresa May backed by the Commons. One member of the government said the treatment of Mr Costa had been appalling. But a senior ally of the PM says Mrs May was left with no choice. It is, they point out, against the rules for members of the government to table amendments to government motions. This is a clear black and white example of breaking, they conclude, unlike some recent comments from cabinet ministers which could be open to interpretation (again their argument, not mine). Another junior member of the government says that if Mr Costa had moved his amendment as a member of the government tonight - and it had been passed - it would have set a terrible precedent and led to many more similar situations. Five amendments - out of 12 originally tabled - were selected for debate by Speaker John Bercow. The Labour leadership's amendment calls on MPs to support its alternative Brexit plan, which would include a ""comprehensivecustoms union"" and close alignment with the EU in the future. If that proposal is voted down, Jeremy Corbyn has said the party would move to formally back another EU referendum ""in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit"" or no-deal outcome. Mrs May has accused Labour of ""playing political games"" and argued the best way for the country to move forward is for MPs to approve the revised deal she hopes to bring back. The SNP amendment insists the UK should not leave the EU in any circumstances without a deal ""regardless of any exit date"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""What do you mean now? When was the government not supporting it? When did you hear that?"" On Tuesday, Theresa May promised MPs a vote on delaying Brexit for a short period if MPs reject her deal and leaving without a deal. This was designed to head off a potential defeat on a cross-party amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which calls for the same thing. Ms Cooper has not withdrawn her amendment, because she wants to hold the prime minister to her commitment. She said: ""We will keep up the pressure working cross-party to ensure the commitments are implemented... to avoid any backsliding and to make sure we do not end up with a chaotic no deal."" An amendment by Conservative MP Dame Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey amendment - calling for Parliamentary time to make the PM's no-deal vote commitment legally binding - will not be put to the vote, following government assurances. ""The government has just confirmed acceptance of all the proposals in our amendments. There will not now be a no-deal Brexit In 30 days' time because there is not a majority in the House for crashing out without a deal,"" the MPs said in a joint statement. The process starts with the government putting down a motion. It is a plain piece of text, asking the House to note the prime minister's most recent Brexit statement - made on Tuesday - and that discussions between the UK and the EU are ongoing. This then allows MPs to table amendments - alternative options - to that motion, setting out their proposals on what they think should happen next.

Extending Article 50 would require the unanimous backing of the other 27 EU member states - something they have indicated they would be happy to do. Speaking on Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would ""not oppose"" a request from the UK for more time although French President Emmanuel Macron struck a more sceptical note, saying there had to be a ""clear objective"" behind any extension. ""As our negotiator Michel Barnier has said, we don't need more time but decisions,"" he said during a meeting in Paris. ""The time has come therefore for the British to make choices.""

My officers have been given extensive powers to search people without the need to suspect they are carrying weapons. ""I recognise this will upset some innocent young people, but I fear the carriage of weapons in the current environment is growing, often through fear, and we can take no chances.

"Vacuum gangs suck cash from parking metersA council in west London says ÃÂ£120,000 has been stolen from its machines in the past 12 months.London","Gangs are drilling holes into parking meters in order to use vacuum cleaners to suck cash out Motorists have been urged not to use cash to pay for parking - because gangs are using vacuum cleaners to suck coins out of meters. Criminals have been targeting machines in affluent Kensington and Chelsea, bagging tens of thousands of pounds in loose change. Councillors in the west London borough said Â£120,000 has been stolen in the past year. They urged drivers to pay via app or by phone. Will Pascall, of Kensington and Chelsea Council said: ""We have gangs stalking the streets and smashing their way into machines to suck the cash out. ""We also now know from local police that this is funding further criminality in London, from drugs and trafficking to possibly violent crime. ""It is a trend we need to stop and motorists going cashless is one way we can help tackle this."" Criminals are also driving into the meters or using sledgehammers to smash them open, the council said. Criminals are also driving into the meters to break them open More than 70 parking machines are currently in use across the borough. How much violent crime is due to gangs?

Selfridges bans sale of exotic skins,"Selfridges has said it will ban the sale of exotic animal skins such as alligator, crocodile and python. From February 2020, the luxury London department store will only sell leather from agricultural livestock. The Humane Society International said the move was the ""natural next step for a responsible retailer"" and would save ""countless"" crocodiles and snakes. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has urged rival stores, such as Harvey Nichols, to follow suit. Yvonne Taylor, director of corporate projects at Peta, told BBC News: ""Hats off to Selfridges - which had already banned fur, angora, and foie gras after persuasive talks with Peta - for now ending the sale of wild animals' 'exotic' skins."" The industry is not only ""heartless"", but ""extremely wasteful"", Peta claims, saying it can take the skins of four crocodiles to make a single bag. The BBC understands that the ban will mainly affect sales of very high end, expensive accessories, particularly shoes and handbags. Victoria Beckham ditched the use of exotic skins earlier this month at London Fashion Week The move follows an announcement from designer Victoria Beckham that she would stop using exotic skins in her designs from her autumn/winter 2019 collection onwards. Beckham joins Vivienne Westwood, Diane von Furstenberg and Chanel in the ban - alongside high street brands such as Topshop, H&M and Adidas. In December,Chanel became the first luxury fashion housein the world to stop using exotic animal skins. The company's head of fashion, Bruno Pavlovksy, said it had become harder to source such skins ethically. Meanwhile, British designer Stella McCartney's ""vegetarian brand"" has never used leather, skin, fur or feathers. The brand uses leather alternatives such as recycled polyester instead of Brazilian calf leather - which it claims has a high environmental impact. Selfridges, which banned the sale of fur in 2005, said banning exotic skins was part of a ""long-standing commitment to place ethics and sustainability at the heart of commercial decisions"". Selfridges' buying director Sebastian Manes said the brand was fixed on being at ""the very forefront of future thinking retail"". He added: ""For us, that's a future where luxury is defined by craftsmanship and material innovation."" In 2015, the store removed single-use plastic water bottles from sale and made its signature yellow paper bags from recycled coffee cups. Since the beginning of this year, all clothes bags have been made with used plastic bottles. The British Heart Foundation will not accept donations of fur or ivory items In the charity sector, the British Heart Foundation will not accept real fur or fur-trimmed items, or anything made from ivory. Oxfam told the BBC it does not sell products made from crocodile or alligator skin, angora wool or fur. It also checks legal regulations for items made of snakeskin, tortoiseshell and coral, and will only sell ivory if it can be proven that the product was made before 1947. Peta's Ms Tayor said conscientious and informed consumers ""absolutely reject the exotic skins trade, which invariably torments and kills crocodiles, snakes, lizards, and other sentient, beautiful animals in appalling ways for fashion"". She added: ""Peta urges other department stores, like Harvey Nichols, and brands such as Louis Vuitton to follow Selfridges' business-savvy example."" A spokesperson for Harvey Nichols told the BBC: ""Harvey Nichols requires any brand that uses fur or exotic skins to adhere to the Animal Sourcing Principles as set out by the Responsible Luxury Initiative (ReLi)"". The ReLi claims to have set ""high level principles,external"" for the sourcing of leather, fur and exotic skins, but Peta maintains that there are ""few laws"" to protect reptiles from abuse. According to Peta the illegal trade in exotic skins is ""rampant"" - with an estimated US $1bn worth of python skins imported into Europe illegally each year. The group also claims that many of the millions of reptiles whose skins are exported from Southeast Asia each year belong to endangered species, whose numbers in the wild are ""drastically dwindling"". Department store John Lewis told the BBC that it does not sell any products with exotic animal skins. .

'Everything awesome' at Lego as sales rise,"Harry Potter was among Lego's best sellers in 2018 Just like the Lego film, everything appears to be ""awesome"" at the plastic brick maker as it returned to growth again last year. Profits increased by 4% to 10.8bn Danish kroner (Â£1.2bn) and sales were up 4% to 36.4bn Danish kroner. That was a rebound from 2017, when Lego reported its first fall in sales and profits for 13 years. It blamed too much stock in stores and warehouses. Star Wars, Harry Potter, Ninjago and Jurassic World were its best sellers. ""We set out with one aim in 2018, to stabilise the business,"" said chief executive Niels Christiansen. ""Our underlying mission - what the family [which owns the business] wants - is to get Lego out to as many kids as possible,"" he said. Its growth in market share in all major markets comes at time when toy retailers have been struggling, illustratedby the collapse of Toys R US. This reduces outlets for sales of Lego, which is the world's biggest toymaker when measured by sales. Mr Christiansen, chief executive of the Danish brick-maker for 18 months, said he would not be seeking ""supra-natural"" growth rates of the past. Lego intends to open 80 new stores in China this year, where a flagship store opened in Beijing earlier this month The company is still owned by the family of Kirk Kristiansen, who founded Lego in 1932. It takes its name from an abbreviation of the two Danish words ""leg godt"", meaning ""play well"". It had achieved double-digit growth for five years until 2017,when the company said it needed a ""reset""and cut 1,400 jobs worldwide. Sales in 2017 had been hit because it had ""too much"" stock in warehouses and shops. Lego admits it made too many bricks Children 'need to play more to gain work skills' Mr Christiansen said Lego was combining physical and digital play. ""Kids can jump between playing physically and digitally,"" he told the BBC. The company is expanding in China, adding 80 stores this year to the existing 60. A new flagship store was opened in Beijing earlier this month and China, with 270 million children, was an ideal place to expand, he said. ""A lot of the focus in China is education,"" Mr Christiansen said, and families willing to spend on toys like Lego which ""build skills like collaboration"". In 2018, sales in the US and Western Europe grew in low-single digits, while in China they showed double-digit growth. Mr Christiansen said there was still scope for growth in developed markets, as there were ""lots of kids who haven't played with Lego"". The company has pledgedto use sustainable materials in its products and packaging by 2030and Mr Christiansen said the company's issue was not about plastic disposal. ""No one throws their bricks in the ocean,"" he said. The bricks - it sells 75 billion annually in over 140 countries - and kits are manufactured in five countries - Mexico, China, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Denmark. Mr Christiansen said the company was ""taking some precautions"" against the impact on its UK business from Brexit, but declined to elaborate. Lego admits it made too many bricks Age: 43.

Search finds 'no sign' of Sala plane pilot,"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson A crowd funded search has found ""no trace"" of the pilot of the plane which crashed with Cardiff City striker Emiliano Sala on board. David Ibbotson was flying the footballer to the UK when their Piper Malibu aircraft crashed near Guernsey on 21 January. A helicopter was used to search remote coastal areas and two divers went down to the aircraft wreckage. Organiser David Mearns said that the ""active search"" had ended. The shipwreck hunter, who led the successful search for Sala's body, said the divers had searched ""every nook and cranny"" of the plane ""Sadly there was absolutely no trace of David, no trace of any clothing, no trace of any of his personal items,"" said Mr Mearns. He added: ""In terms of the active search, it ended today. But that doesn't mean there isn't a chance that that David's body will still wash ashore."" The hunt for Mr Ibbotson, of Crowle, North Lincolnshire, is being fundedvia an online campaign launched by his family. The wreckage of the Piper Malibu found in 63m (205ft) of water north-west of Guernsey The appeal launched by Mr Ibbotson's family has raised nearly Â£250,000. It wasboosted with contributions from French footballer Kylian Mbappe, who donated Â£27,000, and former England captain Gary Lineker who gave Â£1,000. On the page, his sister Danielle Ibbotson wrote: ""We can not bear the thought of him being alone, we need him home so that we are able to lay him to rest to be able to say goodbye.""

"Man jailed for spitting on Catholic priestBradley Wallace, 24, assaulted Canon Thomas White outside his Glasgow church during an Orange walk.Glasgow & West Scotland","Bradley Wallace, 24, from Uddingston, assaulted Canon Thomas White in Glasgow last July. A man who spat on a priest as an Orange walk marched past a Glasgow church has been jailed for 10 months. Bradley Wallace, 24, assaulted Canon Thomas White when he was unable to get back inside St Alphonsus Church on London Road. His DNA was later found to match saliva on the back of the vestment worn by Canon White on 7 July last year. Wallace, from Uddingston, South Lanarkshire,admitted the assault last month. The court was told Wallace had accepted his crime wasmotivated by anti-Catholicism,external. Canon Thomas White was spat on and abused as as he spoke to parishioners following mass Sheriff Andrew Cubie said: ""This is about the courts reflecting disapproval of the depressingly still deep seated and widespread social issue of sectarianism, which generates at the very least tension and at worst both hatred and conflict and which disfigures civilised society. ""The courts in Scotland still deal all too frequently with cases of sectarian abuse which serve to harden and perpetuate divisions in society."" The sheriff said Wallace was old enough to be aware of increasing efforts to tackle the problem. He said: ""How could any 24-year-old from Scotland not know that it is wrong to peddle sectarianism? ""It is no doubt partly because of the 'echo chamber' effect of much social media, where your loyalties are displayed and perhaps your motivation identified."" The sheriff told Wallace he had taken part a ""grotesque spectacle"" which forced the priest to seek sanctuary in his church after mass to avoid a hostile crowd. He added: ""You could have acted with restraint but rather, no doubt emboldened by, and thinking that you were under the cover of this aggressive and threatening crowd, you took the decision to spit on the priest, an act which is disgusting, cowardly and provocative, which demonstrates contempt and hostility and is designed to humiliate and demean. ""The whole situation must have been, as you recognise, very frightening for the complainer and those around him."" Sheriff Cubie said the sentence should serve as a warning to others. He told the court: ""Those tempted to act in a sectarian way must understand society's repugnance of and weariness of that kind of behaviour and must expect to be dealt with accordingly."" Procurator fiscal depute Chris Farrell said the annual Boyne Parade in Glasgow had attracted 4,000 participants and an equal number of spectators. St Alphonsus Church is close to the Barras market in the east end At about 17:00 the parade was on its return route having ""splintered off into different factions"" which took different routes through the city. Mr Farrell said: ""At this time one of the factions was walking along London Road towards its junction with Kent Street. ""They were flanked by a number of police officers who took position outside of St Alphonsus Chrch, due to it being a Catholic congregation."" The court was told Canon White had finished his Sunday mass and was at the front entrance to say goodbye to his parishioners. When he saw the parade coming towards the church he tried to get back inside but was unable to due to a bottleneck created by the worshippers. A large scale disturbance then broke out at the junction between the two streets, which took police away from the church. As a result members of the public who had been associating themselves with the parade became more volatile towards the congregation. It was heard that ""a number of this group began to spit towards them"" and Wallace, who was amongst the group, spat on Canon White's back. Defence lawyer John Coogan told the court that Wallace had asked for a meeting to apologise to Canon White, but had been prevented from doing so by his bail conditions.

MP to be investigated in anti-Semitism row,"This video can not be played Theresa May said Jeremy Corbyn should suspend Chris Williamson A Labour MP is to be investigated for remarks about the party's handling of anti-Semitism but will not be suspended amid a deepening row within the party. Chris Williamson claimed Labour had ""given too much ground"" in the face of criticism over the issue, remarks which he now says he ""deeply regrets"". Deputy leader Tom Watson criticised the ""heavily caveated"" apology and said stronger action was required. The MP remains a member of the party in Parliament during the investigation. Labour has put the MP under ""formal notice of investigation"" over a ""pattern of behaviour"" relating to the long-running row over anti-Semitism. The BBC's Vicki Young said the MP faced possible expulsion as the ultimate sanction but would remain a member of Labour's parliamentary party while the probe took place - a decision likely to anger many within the party. In footage published by the Yorkshire Post,,externalMr Williamson, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, told activists Labour had been ""too apologetic"" over anti-Semitism and was being ""demonised as a racist, bigoted party"".

Mr Williamson is reported to have held a meeting with aides of Jeremy Corbyn's shortly before Prime Minister's Questions began at midday. Minutes later,he issued a statement on Twitter,externalapologising, saying he never meant to downplay the ""pernicious and cancerous"" nature of anti-Semitism. Resigning MP attacks Labour 'extremism' Jewish group backs Corbyn A guide to the anti-Semitism row ""I deeply regret and apologise for my recent choice of words,"" he wrote. ""I was trying to suggest how much the party has done to tackle anti-Semitism. ""Our movement can never be too apologetic about racism in our ranks. While it is true there have been very few cases of anti-Semitism in Labour, something I believe is often forgotten when discussing this issue, it is also true that those few are too many."" Mr Williamson said he would be more ""considered"" in his language in future and said he wanted to be ""an ally"" in the fight against anti-Semitism. Labour had urged the MP to say sorry for the ""deeply offensive and inappropriate"" remarks made clear that ""downplaying the problem of anti-Semitism makes it harder for us to tackle it"". But senior figures say Labour must go further and take disciplinary action, ex-leader Ed Miliband describing the row as ""a test"" for the party. Mr Watson said the MP's statement was ""not good enough and if it was in my gift I would have removed the whip from him already"". Urging Labour to suspend the MP, Theresa May said the fact Jewish MPs like Luciana Berger felt they had no choice but to quit Labour while Mr Williamson stayed put ""summed up"" the state of the opposition. ""It tells you all you need to know about the Labour leadership,"" she said at Prime Minister's Questions. ""Present but not involved."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the Emma Barnett show on BBC Radio 5 Live that Labour needed to get its house in order through ""swift, robust action"" against offenders. Allow Twitter content?

Board of Deputies of British Jews president Marie van der Zyl has also called for the removal of the whip from Mr Williamson. She said the board rejected his ""half-hearted apology"" and had submitted a formal complaint to the Labour Party. ""Jeremy Corbyn must remove the whip at once if he wants to retain the faintest image of himself as an anti-racist,"" she said. Labour has struggled to contain a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism - hostility or prejudice directed against Jewish people - within its ranks.Nine MPs quit the party last week,criticising the leadership's handling of the issue. But at a recent Momentum meeting in Sheffield, Mr Williamson said ""I have got to say I think our party's response has been partly responsible for that because in my opinionâ¦ we have backed off far too much, we have given too much ground, we have been too apologetic.""

MPs debate Brexit alternatives,"MPs will have their say on the next steps for Brexit later after European leaders indicated they would consider delaying the UK's departure if a deal is not agreed by 29 March. Germany's Angela Merkel said if the UK needed more time to get Parliament's approval, she would ""not oppose"" it. Theresa May has said MPs will get a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal and a no-deal outcome are both rejected. MPs will vote on amendments to a government motion in the Commons later. Wednesday's votes are not on Mrs May's Brexit deal itself - she says that will happen before 12 March. Instead, MPs are seeking assurances and to hold the PM to her commitment, made on Tuesday, to allow MPs a vote on extending 29 March's Brexit deadline to avoid Britain leaving without a deal. The prime minister's critics have accused her of ""kicking the can down the road"" with her pledge to hold more votes before 12 March - just 17 days before Brexit. But she insisted her efforts to persuade the EU to make concessions had ""already begun to bear fruit"". Live updates: MPs debate Brexit options Which Brexit amendments have been selected? Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? How could Brexit be delayed? The government has accepted an amendment by Conservative MP Alberto Costa, which seeks to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU, and vice versa, regardless of the outcome of UK-EU negotiations. The amendment - which calls on the UK to secure agreement on this at ""the earliest opportunity"" - had gained significant cross-party backing from 141 MPs - including Labour and the Democratic Unionists. Despite this, Mr Costa has resigned his job as aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell, because, he told MPs, of a convention that members of the government should not amend government motions. He said he ""welcomed"" the government's support for his amendment but it did not go far enough. He said he wanted ministers to spell out ""exactly what measures"" Theresa May will now take to guarantee citizens rights and urged her to write to European Council President Donald Tusk. He said the rights of the estimated million UK citizens living in the EU, and the three million EU citizens in the UK, ""should never have been used as a bargaining chip"" in the government's Brexit negotiations. Green MP Caroline Lucas praised Mr Costa's stand and called for him to be reinstated in the government. Analysis by Nick Eardley, BBC Political Correspondent It looks a bit strange, doesn't it? The government accepts an amendment from a member of the government - but then essentially sacks that member of the government for tabling it in the first place. I'm told by several people that Alberto Costa was left with no decision but to resign. He met with the prime minister this morning made it clear he wasn't backing down which sealed his fate. That's left some Tories furious. They point out he has a personal interest in the EU citizens' rights issue given his Italian parentage and say he was simply trying to get assurances he had been offered by Theresa May backed by the Commons. One member of the government said the treatment of Mr Costa had been appalling. But a senior ally of the PM says Mrs May was left with no choice. It is, they point out, against the rules for members of the government to table amendments to government motions. This is a clear black and white example of breaking, they conclude, unlike some recent comments from cabinet ministers which could be open to interpretation (again their argument, not mine). Another junior member of the government says that if Mr Costa had moved his amendment as a member of the government tonight - and it had been passed - it would have set a terrible precedent and led to many more similar situations. Five amendments - out of 12 originally tabled - were selected for debate by Speaker John Bercow. The Labour leadership's amendment calls on MPs to support its alternative Brexit plan, which would include a ""comprehensivecustoms union"" and close alignment with the EU in the future. If that proposal is voted down, Jeremy Corbyn has said the party would move to formally back another EU referendum ""in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit"" or no-deal outcome. Mrs May has accused Labour of ""playing political games"" and argued the best way for the country to move forward is for MPs to approve the revised deal she hopes to bring back. The SNP amendment insists the UK should not leave the EU in any circumstances without a deal ""regardless of any exit date"". This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""What do you mean now? When was the government not supporting it? When did you hear that?"" On Tuesday, Theresa May promised MPs a vote on delaying Brexit for a short period if MPs reject her deal and leaving without a deal. This was designed to head off a potential defeat on a cross-party amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which calls for the same thing. Ms Cooper has not withdrawn her amendment, because she wants to hold the prime minister to her commitment. She said: ""We will keep up the pressure working cross-party to ensure the commitments are implemented... to avoid any backsliding and to make sure we do not end up with a chaotic no deal."" An amendment by Conservative MP Dame Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey amendment - calling for Parliamentary time to make the PM's no-deal vote commitment legally binding - will not be put to the vote, following government assurances. ""The government has just confirmed acceptance of all the proposals in our amendments. There will not now be a no-deal Brexit In 30 days' time because there is not a majority in the House for crashing out without a deal,"" the MPs said in a joint statement. The process starts with the government putting down a motion. It is a plain piece of text, asking the House to note the prime minister's most recent Brexit statement - made on Tuesday - and that discussions between the UK and the EU are ongoing. This then allows MPs to table amendments - alternative options - to that motion, setting out their proposals on what they think should happen next. Please upgrade your browser Mrs May said any delay to the UK's departure should not go beyond the end of June and ""would almost certainly have to be a one-off"". Extending Article 50 would require the unanimous backing of the other 27 EU member states - something they have indicated they would be happy to do. Speaking on Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would ""not oppose"" a request from the UK for more time although French President Emmanuel Macron struck a more sceptical note, saying there had to be a ""clear objective"" behind any extension. ""As our negotiator Michel Barnier has said, we don't need more time but decisions,"" he said during a meeting in Paris. ""The time has come therefore for the British to make choices.""

Trump and Kim meet in Vietnam,"This video can not be played Donald Trump and  Kim Jong-un shook hands as they met in Hanoi US President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un have begun their high-profile second summit in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. They shook hands for the media before holding talks and having dinner at the five-star Metropole hotel. They are expected to discuss a roadmap for ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons in two days of talks. There has been little progress on that and other issues since the first Trump-Kim summit in Singapore last year. Mr Trump said he thought this latest meeting would be ""very successful"". He denied he was ""walking back"" on denuclearisation. Asked whether a formal end to the Korean War might be declared, he said: ""We'll see."" He said he looked forward to helping Mr Kim achieve a ""tremendous"" economic future for his country. Mr Kim, whom the US president described as a ""great leader"", said he was confident there would be an ""excellent outcome that everyone welcomes"". ""I'll do my best to make it happen,"" he told reporters, before the men sat down to eat. All smiles for dinner... before the main summit meetings on Thursday According to the Washington Post, four journalists were banned from attending the dinner - they reported for Bloomberg News, the LA Times, and the Associated Press and Reuters news agencies. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the number of journalists had been limited ""due to the sensitive nature of the meetings"". Earlier, Mr Trump tweeted in praise of the host country, writing: ""Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize."" ""The potential is AWESOME,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US leader and Vietnamese President Nguyen Phu Trong signed trade deals worth around $20bn (Â£15bn). The deals secured contracts for Vietnamese airline firms to purchase US made planes and technology. Wednesday's meetings were limited to brief questions from reporters, one-on-one talks and dinner with aides. It's expected that any major events - the signing of agreements or significant press conferences - will take place on Thursday. The two leaders will attend a series of meetings together, but their exact agenda is unclear. What Trump wants from Kim talks Trump and Kim in Hanoi: Your need-to-know guide North Korean state media praised Mr Kim for making the 4,000km (2,485-mile) trip, with state paper Rodong Sinmun dedicating four out of its six pages to it. It said North Koreans had reacted to his visit with ""boundless excitement and emotion"", and urged people to work harder to ""give him reports of victory when he returns"". This video can not be played 'I really miss our leader' The paper also added that his overseas trip had caused some of its citizens sleepless nights, with one woman telling a state broadcaster saying that she ""really missed"" Mr Kim. North Korea has been ruled since its creation in 1948 by three generations of the Kim family. The country has a woeful human rights record, and the UN says its people live under ""systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations"". North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Sexual abuse of women 'common' in N Korea Kim Jong-un carried out a brutal purge after taking charge of the country in 2011, ordering the death of his own uncle to secure his position. About 140 senior military officers and government officials were executed between 2012 and 2016, according to South Korea's Institute for National Security Strategy. Most children receive basic education, though some are forced to drop out of school early The economy is tightly controlled by the government, with widespread shortages of food, fuel and other basic necessities as the state funnels funds into the military and its nuclear weapons programme. Reporters Without Borders ranks North Korea last in its World Press Freedom Index,external, with all news and information coming from state media. The Hanoi meeting is expected to build on the groundwork of what was achieved at the Singapore summit last June. That meeting produced a vaguely worded agreement, with both leaders agreeing to ""work towards denuclearisation"" - though it was never made clear what this would entail. Little diplomatic progress was made following the summit. This time round, both leaders will be very conscious of the need to answer their critics with signs of concrete progress. Nothing concrete was produced as a result of the first historic summit However, Mr Trump appeared to be managing expectations ahead of the summit, saying he was in ""no rush"" to press for North Korea's denuclearisation. ""I don't want to rush anybody. I just don't want testing. As long as there's no testing, we're happy,"" he said. Washington had previously said that North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief. It's an ideal location for many reasons. It has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea, despite once having been enemies with the US - and could be used by the US as an example of two countries working together and setting aside their past grievances. Why Kim will be looking closely at Vietnam What North Korea can learn from Vietnam's women Ideologically, both Vietnam and North Korea are communist countries, though Vietnam has over the last few decades opened up to foreign investment and emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in Asia.

BBC and ITV set to launch Netflix rival,"The BBC, home to crime dramas Luther and Line of Duty, and ITV, maker of dramas such as Vanity Fair, are in the ""concluding phase of talks"" to create a rival to Netflix. BBC director general Tony Hall said the aim was to launch ""BritBox"" in the UK in the second half of 2019. The price was not announced but Lord Hall said it would be ""competitive"". ITV's chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said it would be home for the ""best of British creativity"". There are reports it could cost Â£5 a month. Will BritBox be a hit or a flop? Why are the BBC and ITV creating BritBox? The two organisations already have a BritBox streaming service in North America, which Lord Hall said was performing ""ahead of expectations"". It has 500,000 subscribers. ""Research with the British public shows that there is a real appetite for a new British streaming service - in addition to their current subscriptions,"" he said. Dame Carolyn told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that 43% of all homes which use the Internet are interested in a subscription to BritBox. For homes which already subscribe to Netflix, she said that increased to half of all homes. ""There is a window of opportunity here,"" she said. ITV will spend Â£25m on the venture this year and Â£40m in 2020. The BBC did not disclose how much it was spending but Dani Warner, TV expert at uSwitch, said it ""could be a good way for the BBC especially to recoup losses from Brits abandoning the licence fee for subscription models"". It is understood licence fee money will not be used to pay for the service. The new venture is not intended to replace the BBC's iPlayer or the ITV Hub - the on-demand services where programmes are available for a restricted period of time. It is expected to have box sets from the BBC and  ITV archives. There will also be some programmes commissioned only for BritBox. Shows would appear on the relevant channels, then on the on-demand services before going on to BritBox. It would be ""one permanent, comprehensive home where anyone in Britain can get all of our library content - both the ITV and BBC library - in one place and they can watch it anytime, anywhere,"" Dame Carolyn told Today. The details have not been announced but BBC shows which are no longer aired regularly - such as Absolutely Fabulous - may be available. ITV dramas such as Vera and Endeavour - and its predecessor Morse - are also likely contenders. Dame Carolyn said that existing licensing agreements with Netflix will be honoured. For instance,last year, Netflix acquired the rights to the BBC show Bodyguard- from ITV Studios which owns the production company which made the drama. Two inescapable trends are driving the TV business around the world today - one in consumer behaviour, the other in business strategy. The first is exponential growth in streaming, with an accompanied decline in scheduled TV. The second is consolidation among content providers who are desperately seeking scale. Britbox is a marriage of the two. For the BBC, the iPlayer is still a small part of overall viewing, but the key growth area, especially among the younger audiences who much prefer other digital platforms, particularly YouTube. ITV faces a hugely different set of challenges. It is a mostly ad-funded, linear channel - the opposite of Netflix, a subscriber-driven, streaming service. Clubbing together to offer the maximum amount of content allows the BBC and ITV to provide a better service than they could alone, at a time when other media giants, such as Disney, are pulling out of Netflix to launch their own direct-to-consumer offering. Read more from Amol Rajan An idea for streaming service - known as Project Kangaroo - was blocked by the competition authorities nine years ago. Dame Carolyn told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the industry had changed since then. Both the Competition and Markets Authority and media regulator Ofcom are being consulted on this latest venture. Regulator Ofcom said it was looking forward to discussing the plan with ITV and the BBC. ""We want to see broadcasters collaborating to keep pace with global players, by offering quality UK content that's available to viewers whenever and however they want to watch it."" ITV said talks with Channel 4 and Channel 5 to join the venture were ongoing.

Will Pascall, of Kensington and Chelsea Council said: ""We have gangs stalking the streets and smashing their way into machines to suck the cash out. ""We also now know from local police that this is funding further criminality in London, from drugs and trafficking to possibly violent crime. ""It is a trend we need to stop and motorists going cashless is one way we can help tackle this.""

"Trump knew about email hack, Cohen to say","This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has claimed Mr Trump wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign. During Wednesday's testimony, Cohen said Mr Trump directed covert plans for a Trump hotel, even while he denied having any business in Russia. He also said Mr Trump knew about a leak of hacked Democratic emails, and called him a ""racist"", ""conman"" and ""cheat"". Mr Trump accused Cohen of ""lying in order to reduce his prison time"". Takeaways from Cohen testimony Cohen's opening statement in full And speaking after Thursday's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam, the US president reiterated that Cohen ""lied a lot"" during his congressional testimony. This video can not be played Trump criticises former lawyer Michael Cohen's testimony But Mr Trump said his former lawyer provided no evidence about alleged collusion between the Trump campaign with Russia during the 2016 US presidential elections. ""He didn't lie about one thing. He said, no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I said, I wonder why he didn't lie about that, too, like everything else,"" Mr Trump said. Cohen, 52, will start a three-year prison term in May for the campaign finance violation of paying hush money to one of Mr Trump's alleged mistresses, tax evasion and lying to Congress. In his public testimony to the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday, he said Mr Trump ""knew of and directed"" plans for a Trump Tower Moscow, while stating publicly that he had no dealings in Russia. ""At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him,"" Cohen testified, ""he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie."" ""He wanted me to lie,"" the witness added. However, Cohen has been convicted of lying to Congress when he testified in 2017 that attempts to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow had stopped by January 2016. Reaction to the hearing Trump's tower in Moscow that never was He has since acknowledged negotiations actually continued until June 2016 in the midst of the election campaign, though the real estate project ultimately did not go ahead. Cohen apologised on Wednesday for his earlier false statements to Congress, which he claimed were ""reviewed and edited"" by Mr Trump's lawyers. Jay Sekulow, counsel to President Trump, said in a statement after the hearing: ""Today's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false."" Cohen also suggested federal prosecutors in New York are investigating some unspecified crime involving Trump. This video can not be played Michael Cohen: Trump told me 'Don Jr had worst judgement in world' Cohen said he was in Mr Trump's office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser, called the then-Republican presidential candidate. The witness said Mr Stone rang Mr Trump to let him know he had been speaking to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who told him there would be a ""massive dump"" of emails within a couple of days that would politically embarrass Hillary Clinton's White House campaign. Cohen said Mr Trump responded along the lines of ""wouldn't that be great"". Mr Trump has denied having prior knowledge about Wikileaks' disclosure of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails during the election. The messages - which US authorities say were hacked by Russian intelligence - caused a damaging rift among Democrats by exposing how party officials preferred Mrs Clinton over her challenger for the presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders. Mr Stone, a self-proclaimed political dirty trickster, is currently facing charges of lying to Congress about his communications with Wikileaks and witness tampering. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer ByPaul Wood,World Affairs Correspondent, BBC News Anyone who's met Michael Cohen recently will tell you that he's burning with anger at having to take the blame for crimes he says were instigated by Trump. It seems he's spent weeks being intensively prepped by his lawyers for this moment and intends to do the President fatal damage. The White House talking points - farmed out to surrogates such as Donald Trump Jr - are that he's a ""disgraced liar"" and ""convicted perjurer"". Cohen certainly knows he has - as he says in his testimony - a credibility problem. That's why he's attempting to wield a stiletto, not swing an axe, each charge backed up by what he calls ""documents that are irrefutable"" - hence the dramatic production of a cheque apparently signed by Trump (the alleged refund for paying off Stormy Daniels). He didn't talk much about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. In fact, he said he had no direct knowledge of collusion. He did, though, say he witnessed Trump in a telephone conversation during the campaign that showed he knew in advance Wikileaks was about to publish emails hacked - by Russia - from the Democratic Party. That would be hugely significant, if true. Trump has always denied it. Cohen testified that, contrary to Mr Trump's repeated claims, he seemed to have advance knowledge of a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between his campaign aides and a Russian lawyer promising ""dirt"" on Mrs Clinton. The June 2016 meeting has been investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is winding up a 21-month justice department inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with an alleged Kremlin plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Cohen spoke about an incident when Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, walked behind his father's desk and told him in a low voice: ""The meeting is all set."" Mr Trump, Cohen told the hearing, replied: ""OK good, let me know."" Importantly, Cohen also said under oath that he has no direct evidence that Mr Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. ""I do not,"" he said. ""I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions."" What might 'Mueller report' look like? Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Cohen told lawmakers Mr Trump is a racist. He said: ""He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a 'shithole.' ""This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. ""While we were once driving through a struggling neighbourhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. ""And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him."" Cohen provided what he said was evidence of reimbursements he received from the president for hush money the lawyer has admitted paying to a porn star who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. He submitted to the committee a copy of his $130,000 (Â£97,000) wire transfer to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet - a payment which led to Cohen's conviction for campaign finance violations. Cohen also gave the panel a copy of a $35,000 cheque dated August 2017 - one of a series he said Mr Trump signed to pay him back in instalments. Trump says hush money payments were legal ""Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets,"" Cohen said. ""She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly - and she did not deserve that."" During the hearing, the president's fellow Republicans pilloried committee Democrats for inviting a man convicted of lying to Congress. Jim Jordan of Ohio called Cohen - who lost his law licence on Tuesday - a ""fraudster"" and ""cheat"". But committee chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, defended the decision to give Cohen a public platform, saying it was the panel's job to search out the truth. After the hearing, when asked whether the president committed a crime while in office, Chairman Cummings said: ""It appears that he did"". He did not offer any further detail on what crime he thought Mr Trump committed.

Viewpoint: A major escalation,"The February 14 Pulwama attack was the deadliest targeting Indian forces in Kashmir for decades After India launched air strikes in Pakistani territory, tensions have escalated between the neighbours. Indian defence analyst Ajai Shukla explains the significance of the attack and what could happen next. The ball is in Pakistan's court after Indian Air Force (IAF) Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft crossed deep into Pakistan on Tuesday morning. India says that the air strikes targeted a militant camp near Balakot in the  province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, Pakistan has disputed this claim, saying the strikes hit an empty area. The air strikes were provoked by the killing of at least 40 paramilitaries in Indian-administered Kashmir on 14 February, in a suicide attack which has been claimed by Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad. Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had vowed revenge. Tuesday's air strikes are the first launched across the LoC (line of control) - the de facto border that divides Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971. Not even during the 1999 Kargil war did Indian aircraft cross the LoC. Balakot: India 'strikes Kashmir militants in Pakistani territory' Both militaries have scrupulously observed a confidence-building measure that prohibits fixed-wing aircraft from flying within 10km (6.21 miles) of the LoC and helicopters from coming closer than 5km without informing the other side beforehand. For the first time, India has deliberately breached this contract. Indians celebrated on hearing news of the strikes In the unwritten set of rules that govern action and reaction between the two militaries on the LoC, air strikes constitute a major escalation, which is significantly higher than punishing Pakistani posts by cross-border firing, or even sending ground troops across. These air strikes have gone several steps ahead of the ""surgical strikes"" of 2016, when India attacked militant camps across the LoC after Indian soldiers were killed in an attack by Pakistan-backed militants. The apparent ease with which Indian air force fighters flew 80km into Pakistan-administered territory, undetected by a military that should have been on high alert after open Indian threats of attack, again exposes the rudimentary capability of Pakistani air defences. This should reinforce the concern that arose in 2011, when American helicopters flew undetected into Pakistan, carrying naval commandos who killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad and flew out with his body. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir After India's air strikes, escalation is possible - but not certain. Pakistan has warned of retaliation and threatened to take the issue to the United Nations. Residents near Balakot reported hearing explosions But like after the ""surgical strikes"", Pakistan has again downplayed the attack. It first stated that this was a limited incursion by a few Indian air force fighters, which fled when the Pakistani air force scrambled its jets. The Pakistani army's public relations chief then switched tack and claimed that the bombs did no damage before adding that the place that was struck, Balakot, was just 5-6km across the LoC. This obfuscation is made possible by the fact that there are two towns by the name of Balakot - one just across the LoC from the Indian town of Poonch, and the other deep inside Pakistan in its Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The BBC reports that the strikes were in the latter, where local villagers say they heard explosions. What is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad? Pulwama attack: What are Modi's options? Having denied a deep incursion by the Indian air force, Pakistan has reduced its burden of retaliation. It remains to be seen whether more compelling evidence eventually embarrasses Pakistan's military into having to respond. For now, India has indicated that it has achieved its aims. Pakistan is unlikely to raise the ante beyond a point, given that escalating tension is a game with uncertain outcomes. Meanwhile, the Indian military has been placed on alert, with leave of personnel restricted. The air force is patrolling airspace, while the Indian Navy, which had been involved in a major exercise, has shifted to combat mode. Additionally, security forces in Kashmir have been boosted significantly, with the Indian government readying for the possibility of increased militant activity backed by Pakistan.

Takeaways from Cohen testimony,"This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump Michael Cohen is unleashing a series of explosive accusations directed towards Donald Trump touching on multiple controversies that have bedevilled the president during his time in office. Here are five takeaways from his dramatic testimony to Congress. Mr Cohen suggests the president had advance knowledge of his son's June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians and that WikiLeaks was poised to release damaging information about Democrats. He says the president personally signed cheques reimbursing him for a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. He alleges that the president was fully aware of ongoing negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow well into the 2016 presidential campaign. All the latest from the hearing Many of these assertions rely almost exclusively on Cohen's word - the word of a man who has already admitted to lying to Congress and to the federal government on his taxes. What's more, while his allegations are certainly politically damaging, they aren't incontrovertible evidence of legal misconduct by the president. This video can not be played Michael Cohen: Trump told me 'Don Jr had worst judgement in world' If there is a case to be made against Mr Trump, it will have to rely on more than the word of his former lawyer and fixer. That's not to undersell the blockbuster nature of the day's proceedings, however. The public now has a chance to determine, under the glare of the spotlight, whether Cohen lied in the past to protect the president or is lying now to protect himself. Or, perhaps, a bit of both. Most of the early attention paid to Michael Cohen's testimony involved his connections to the assortment of controversies that have swirled around Mr Trump since he became president. It's one thing to read the advance text of a committee statement, however, and it's another to see it in the flesh. If there were any doubts about how effective Cohen would be as a witness, he quickly put them to rest. Cohen - in a dark suit, with his voice occasionally wavering - testified about what it was like to work with Mr Trump for more than a decade. What he learned, he said, made him ashamed. He called his former boss a racist, a cheat and a conman. He says he had both good and bad attributes, but that bad outweighed the good. ""Since taking office,"" Cohen said, ""he has become the worst version of himself."" Republicans were quick to pounce. Mark Meadows asked why, if Cohen was so ashamed, he stuck with Mr Trump for 10 full years. Wasn't it a possibility, he suggested, that Cohen was bitter that he didn't get a White House job and was taking it out on his former boss? ""I got exactly what I wanted,"" Cohen replied, noting that he preferred to spend his time in New York, with his teenage children. That may have been the case two years ago, but there's little chance Cohen wanted - or imagined - the situation he finds himself in now. Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee have repeatedly hit on what could be the most legally damaging part of Cohen's testimony on Wednesday. Mr Trump's former lawyer has presented new, documentary evidence of payments made to him by Mr Trump - including a cheque with the president's signature. He says this money was a reimbursement for his 2016 election eve hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels. The adult film star was poised to claim that she and Mr Trump had sexual relations in the 2006. US government prosecutors in New York have said that Mr Cohen's payment to Daniels constituted an undisclosed campaign contribution in violation of federal election law - a charge to which Cohen has pleaded guilty. If Cohen can help draw a connection between the Daniels payment and the president himself, it could implicate Mr Trump in a crime. The president's legal team has responded to similar allegations in the past by arguing that the payments to Cohen were part of a retainer fee and that Mr Trump had no knowledge of Cohen's illegal activities and was relying on his lawyer to know and abide by campaign finance law. The more evidence Cohen presents to back up his claim that Mr Trump was fully aware of the hush-money payments, the more difficult it becomes for him to maintain this position. The Republican strategy for responding to Cohen's testimony has been clear from the beginning. They want to paint the former lawyer as a convicted liar who can't be trusted on any count. They're less concerned about rebutting the individual allegations - about Trump Tower, Russia business dealings, hush-money payments or WikiLeaks revelations - than they are in dismissing Cohen's testimony as the work of an untruthful man being put forward by enemies of the president for political purposes. Congressman Paul Gosar went so far as to hold up a large sign with ""Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire!!"" emblazoned over a picture of the witness. Cohen has tried to parry these charges multiple ways. One is to claim that he has come to the realisation, after Mr Trump's performance as president, of how damaging his support of his former boss has been. He cited the Charlottesville violence, the Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin and the president's coarseness on Twitter as prime examples. That could be a tough sell, however, given the litany of allegations Cohen has levelled against Mr Trump that predate his time as president. A more effective counter has been when Cohen has tried to hold himself up as a cautionary tale - that he is making amends because his life has come crashing down and not the other way around. ""I protected Trump for 10 years,"" he told the committee. ""The more people that follow Mr Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering."" He called himself the ""picture perfect example of what not to do"". Cohen isn't going to convince many that he's a saint or a sympathetic figure. When he's been his most effective on Wednesday is when he hasn't tried to. Donald Trump wrapped up his day in Vietnam around the time Cohen began his congressional committee testimony. After a lavish dinner of chilled shrimp, grilled steaks and ""chocolate lava cake"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, he returned to his hotel room, where if past history is any guide, he probably reviewed the day's news coverage. What he saw couldn't have made him happy. US media - including his favourite, Fox News - are giving the Cohen hearings wall-to-wall coverage. The president's second summit with Mr Kim, being billed as ""historic"" by the White House, has been relegated to a secondary story. That might change on Thursday, when the two leaders hold a joint press event where they could announce the results of their negotiations. But for one day at least his former lawyer - who he once said was a ""fine man with a wonderful family"" and later called a ""rat"" - held the national stage. Cohen has given Democrats on the Oversight and Reform Committee a number of threads to pursue in further hearings and investigations. It isn't a stretch to imagine that portions of his testimony could someday be cited by Democrats as evidence for impeachment hearings. In addition Cohen hinted at other potential presidential wrongdoing and illegalities - including a conversation with the president in June 2018 - that he couldn't discuss because they are currently being investigated by US attorneys in New York. The president is half a world away, but the fallout from Cohen's day on Capitol Hill - a day when Cohen called the president a racist, a conman and a cheat, and Republicans called Cohen a liar - will be waiting for him when he gets home.

Why is Kashmir disputed?,"Kashmir has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan for more than 70 years Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start? Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region, covering around 86,000 sq miles ( 222,738 sq km), and famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains. Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested. Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan. The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan. Kashmir profile - Timeline A war erupted and India approached the United Nations asking it to intervene. The United Nations recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held. In July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided. Kashmir is known by some as India's Switzerland, due to its verdant fields and sweeping mountainscapes A second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces. By that time, India and Pakistan had both declared themselves to be nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it - territories recognised internationally as ""Indian-administered Kashmir"" and ""Pakistan-administered Kashmir"". An armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region for three decades, claiming tens of thousands of lives. India blames Pakistan for stirring the unrest by backing separatist militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies. Now a sudden change to Kashmir's status on the Indian side has created further apprehension. Indian-administered Kashmir has held a special position within the country historically, thanks to Article 370 - a clause in the constitution which gave it significant autonomy, including its own constitution, a separate flag, and independence over all matters except foreign affairs, defence and communications. Why a special law on Kashmir is controversial What happened in Kashmir and why it matters On 5 August, India revoked that seven-decade-long privileged status- as the governing party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had promised in its 2019 election manifesto. The Hindu nationalist BJP has long opposed Article 370 and had repeatedly called for its abolishment. Telephone networks and the internet were cut off in the region in the days before the presidential order was announced. Public gatherings were banned, and tens of thousands of troops were sent in. Tourists were told to leave Kashmir under warnings of a terror threat. This video can not be played Baramulla resident: 'Our livelihood is affected, nobody is at peace' Two former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir - the Indian state which encompasses the disputed territory - were placed under house arrest. One of them, Mehbooba Mufti, said the move would ""make India an occupational force in Jammu and Kashmir,""and that ""today marks the darkest day in Indian democracy"". Allow Twitter content?

Pakistan fiercely condemned the development, branding it ""illegal""and vowing to ""exercise all possible options"" against it. It downgraded diplomatic ties with India and suspended all trade. India responded by saying they ""regretted"" Pakistan's statement and reiterating that Article 370 was an internal matter as it did not interfere with the boundaries of the territory. Within Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, preferring either independence or union with Pakistan instead. Religion is one factor: Jammu and Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only state within India where Muslims are in the majority. Critics of the BJP fear this move is designed to change the state's demographic make-up of - by giving people from the rest of the country to right to acquire property and settle there permanently. Ms Mufti told the BBC: ""They just want to occupy our land and want to make this Muslim-majority state like any other state and reduce us to a minority and disempower us totally."" Feelings of disenfranchisement have been aggravated in Indian-administered Kashmir by high unemployment, and complaints of human rights abuses by security forces battling street protesters and fighting insurgents. Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has accused India of betraying Kashmir Anti-India sentiment in the state has ebbed and flowed since 1989, but the region witnessed a fresh wave of violenceafter the death of 22-year-old militant leader Burhan Wani in July 2016. He died in a battle with security forces, sparking massive protests across the valley. Wani - whose social media videos were popular among young people - is largely credited with reviving and legitimising the image of militancy in the region.

Following the funeral, people clashed with troops and it set off a deadly cycle of violence that lasted for days. More than 30 civilians died, and others were injured in the clashes. Since then, violence has been on the rise in the state. More than 500 people were killed in 2018 - including civilians, security forces and militants - the highest toll in a decade. India and Pakistan did indeed agree a ceasefire in 2003 after years of bloodshed along the de facto border (also known as the Line of Control). Pakistan later promised to stop funding insurgents in the territory, while India offered them an amnesty if they renounced militancy. In 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks. Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan,attended Mr Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi. Pakistan and India's prime ministers promised peace in 2014 But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab.Mr Modi also cancelled a scheduled visit to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, for a regional summit in 2017. Since then, there hasn't been any progress in talks between the neighbours. The bloody summer of street protests in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016 had already dimmed hopes for a lasting peace in the region. Then, in June 2018, the state government there was upended when Mr Modi's BJP pulled out of a coalition government run by Ms Mufti's People's Democratic Party. Jammu and Kashmir was since under direct rule from Delhi, which fuelled further anger. The deaths of more than 40 Indian soldiers in a suicide attack on 14 February, 2019 have ended any hope of a thaw in the immediate future. India blamed Pakistan-based militant groups for the violence - the deadliest targeting Indian soldiers in Kashmir since the insurgency began three decades ago. Following the bombing,India said it would take ""all possible diplomatic steps"" to isolate Pakistanfrom the international community. On 26 February, it launched air strikes in Pakistani territory which it said targeted militant bases. Pakistan shows off disputed air strike site Pakistan's dilemma over anti-India militants Pakistan denied the raids had caused major damage or casualties but promised to respond, fuelling fears of confrontation. A day later it said it had shot down two Indian Air Force jets in its airspace, and captured a fighter pilot - who was later returned unharmed to India. This video can not be played Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over to Indian officials near a border crossing with Pakistan Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world. India's parliament has now passed a bill splitting Indian-administered Kashmir into two territories governed directly by Delhi: Jammu and Kashmir, and remote, mountainous Ladakh. China, which shares a disputed border with India in Ladakh, has objected to the reorganisation and accused Delhi of undermining its territorial sovereignty. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed to challenge India's actions at the UN security council, and take the matter to the International Criminal Court. In an ominous warning, he said: ""If the world does not act today... (if) the developed world does not uphold its own laws, then things will go to a place that we will not be responsible for."" But Delhi insists that there is no ""external implication"" to its decision to reorganise the state as it has not changed the Line of Control or boundaries of the region. US President Donald Trump has offered to mediate in the crisis - an overture that Delhi has rejected.

"Trump knew about email hack, Cohen to sayAccording to prepared testimony, the ex-fixer will brand Mr Trump a ""racist"", ""conman"" and ""cheat"".","This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has claimed Mr Trump wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign. During Wednesday's testimony, Cohen said Mr Trump directed covert plans for a Trump hotel, even while he denied having any business in Russia. He also said Mr Trump knew about a leak of hacked Democratic emails, and called him a ""racist"", ""conman"" and ""cheat"". Mr Trump accused Cohen of ""lying in order to reduce his prison time"". Takeaways from Cohen testimony Cohen's opening statement in full And speaking after Thursday's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam, the US president reiterated that Cohen ""lied a lot"" during his congressional testimony. This video can not be played Trump criticises former lawyer Michael Cohen's testimony But Mr Trump said his former lawyer provided no evidence about alleged collusion between the Trump campaign with Russia during the 2016 US presidential elections. ""He didn't lie about one thing. He said, no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I said, I wonder why he didn't lie about that, too, like everything else,"" Mr Trump said. Cohen, 52, will start a three-year prison term in May for the campaign finance violation of paying hush money to one of Mr Trump's alleged mistresses, tax evasion and lying to Congress. In his public testimony to the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday, he said Mr Trump ""knew of and directed"" plans for a Trump Tower Moscow, while stating publicly that he had no dealings in Russia. ""At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him,"" Cohen testified, ""he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie."" ""He wanted me to lie,"" the witness added. However, Cohen has been convicted of lying to Congress when he testified in 2017 that attempts to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow had stopped by January 2016. Reaction to the hearing Trump's tower in Moscow that never was He has since acknowledged negotiations actually continued until June 2016 in the midst of the election campaign, though the real estate project ultimately did not go ahead. Cohen apologised on Wednesday for his earlier false statements to Congress, which he claimed were ""reviewed and edited"" by Mr Trump's lawyers. Jay Sekulow, counsel to President Trump, said in a statement after the hearing: ""Today's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false."" Cohen also suggested federal prosecutors in New York are investigating some unspecified crime involving Trump. This video can not be played Michael Cohen: Trump told me 'Don Jr had worst judgement in world' Cohen said he was in Mr Trump's office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser, called the then-Republican presidential candidate. The witness said Mr Stone rang Mr Trump to let him know he had been speaking to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who told him there would be a ""massive dump"" of emails within a couple of days that would politically embarrass Hillary Clinton's White House campaign. Cohen said Mr Trump responded along the lines of ""wouldn't that be great"". Mr Trump has denied having prior knowledge about Wikileaks' disclosure of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails during the election. The messages - which US authorities say were hacked by Russian intelligence - caused a damaging rift among Democrats by exposing how party officials preferred Mrs Clinton over her challenger for the presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders. Mr Stone, a self-proclaimed political dirty trickster, is currently facing charges of lying to Congress about his communications with Wikileaks and witness tampering. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer ByPaul Wood,World Affairs Correspondent, BBC News Anyone who's met Michael Cohen recently will tell you that he's burning with anger at having to take the blame for crimes he says were instigated by Trump. It seems he's spent weeks being intensively prepped by his lawyers for this moment and intends to do the President fatal damage. The White House talking points - farmed out to surrogates such as Donald Trump Jr - are that he's a ""disgraced liar"" and ""convicted perjurer"". Cohen certainly knows he has - as he says in his testimony - a credibility problem. That's why he's attempting to wield a stiletto, not swing an axe, each charge backed up by what he calls ""documents that are irrefutable"" - hence the dramatic production of a cheque apparently signed by Trump (the alleged refund for paying off Stormy Daniels). He didn't talk much about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. In fact, he said he had no direct knowledge of collusion. He did, though, say he witnessed Trump in a telephone conversation during the campaign that showed he knew in advance Wikileaks was about to publish emails hacked - by Russia - from the Democratic Party. That would be hugely significant, if true. Trump has always denied it. Cohen testified that, contrary to Mr Trump's repeated claims, he seemed to have advance knowledge of a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between his campaign aides and a Russian lawyer promising ""dirt"" on Mrs Clinton. The June 2016 meeting has been investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is winding up a 21-month justice department inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with an alleged Kremlin plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Cohen spoke about an incident when Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, walked behind his father's desk and told him in a low voice: ""The meeting is all set."" Mr Trump, Cohen told the hearing, replied: ""OK good, let me know."" Importantly, Cohen also said under oath that he has no direct evidence that Mr Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. ""I do not,"" he said. ""I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions."" What might 'Mueller report' look like? Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Cohen told lawmakers Mr Trump is a racist. He said: ""He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a 'shithole.' ""This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. ""While we were once driving through a struggling neighbourhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. ""And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him."" Cohen provided what he said was evidence of reimbursements he received from the president for hush money the lawyer has admitted paying to a porn star who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. He submitted to the committee a copy of his $130,000 (Â£97,000) wire transfer to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet - a payment which led to Cohen's conviction for campaign finance violations. Cohen also gave the panel a copy of a $35,000 cheque dated August 2017 - one of a series he said Mr Trump signed to pay him back in instalments. Trump says hush money payments were legal ""Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets,"" Cohen said. ""She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly - and she did not deserve that."" During the hearing, the president's fellow Republicans pilloried committee Democrats for inviting a man convicted of lying to Congress. Jim Jordan of Ohio called Cohen - who lost his law licence on Tuesday - a ""fraudster"" and ""cheat"". But committee chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, defended the decision to give Cohen a public platform, saying it was the panel's job to search out the truth. After the hearing, when asked whether the president committed a crime while in office, Chairman Cummings said: ""It appears that he did"". He did not offer any further detail on what crime he thought Mr Trump committed.

"BBC and ITV set to launch Netflix rivalThe broadcasters aim to launch their ""BritBox"" service in the UK later this year.BusinessComments","The BBC, home to crime dramas Luther and Line of Duty, and ITV, maker of dramas such as Vanity Fair, are in the ""concluding phase of talks"" to create a rival to Netflix. BBC director general Tony Hall said the aim was to launch ""BritBox"" in the UK in the second half of 2019. The price was not announced but Lord Hall said it would be ""competitive"". ITV's chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said it would be home for the ""best of British creativity"". There are reports it could cost Â£5 a month. Will BritBox be a hit or a flop? Why are the BBC and ITV creating BritBox? The two organisations already have a BritBox streaming service in North America, which Lord Hall said was performing ""ahead of expectations"". It has 500,000 subscribers. ""Research with the British public shows that there is a real appetite for a new British streaming service - in addition to their current subscriptions,"" he said. Dame Carolyn told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that 43% of all homes which use the Internet are interested in a subscription to BritBox. For homes which already subscribe to Netflix, she said that increased to half of all homes. ""There is a window of opportunity here,"" she said. ITV will spend Â£25m on the venture this year and Â£40m in 2020. The BBC did not disclose how much it was spending but Dani Warner, TV expert at uSwitch, said it ""could be a good way for the BBC especially to recoup losses from Brits abandoning the licence fee for subscription models"". It is understood licence fee money will not be used to pay for the service. The new venture is not intended to replace the BBC's iPlayer or the ITV Hub - the on-demand services where programmes are available for a restricted period of time. It is expected to have box sets from the BBC and  ITV archives. There will also be some programmes commissioned only for BritBox. Shows would appear on the relevant channels, then on the on-demand services before going on to BritBox. It would be ""one permanent, comprehensive home where anyone in Britain can get all of our library content - both the ITV and BBC library - in one place and they can watch it anytime, anywhere,"" Dame Carolyn told Today. The details have not been announced but BBC shows which are no longer aired regularly - such as Absolutely Fabulous - may be available. ITV dramas such as Vera and Endeavour - and its predecessor Morse - are also likely contenders. Dame Carolyn said that existing licensing agreements with Netflix will be honoured. For instance,last year, Netflix acquired the rights to the BBC show Bodyguard- from ITV Studios which owns the production company which made the drama. Two inescapable trends are driving the TV business around the world today - one in consumer behaviour, the other in business strategy. The first is exponential growth in streaming, with an accompanied decline in scheduled TV. The second is consolidation among content providers who are desperately seeking scale. Britbox is a marriage of the two. For the BBC, the iPlayer is still a small part of overall viewing, but the key growth area, especially among the younger audiences who much prefer other digital platforms, particularly YouTube. ITV faces a hugely different set of challenges. It is a mostly ad-funded, linear channel - the opposite of Netflix, a subscriber-driven, streaming service. Clubbing together to offer the maximum amount of content allows the BBC and ITV to provide a better service than they could alone, at a time when other media giants, such as Disney, are pulling out of Netflix to launch their own direct-to-consumer offering. Read more from Amol Rajan An idea for streaming service - known as Project Kangaroo - was blocked by the competition authorities nine years ago. Dame Carolyn told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the industry had changed since then. Both the Competition and Markets Authority and media regulator Ofcom are being consulted on this latest venture. Regulator Ofcom said it was looking forward to discussing the plan with ITV and the BBC. ""We want to see broadcasters collaborating to keep pace with global players, by offering quality UK content that's available to viewers whenever and however they want to watch it."" ITV said talks with Channel 4 and Channel 5 to join the venture were ongoing. The announcement came as ITV reported 2018 profits of Â£567m, up 13% in what Dame Carolyn said was an ""uncertain economic and political environment"". ITV's shares were down more than 2.5% in early trading as it admitted that advertising in the first four months of the year was forecast to be down 3% to 4%. ""It is an uncertain economic world at the moment for the UK...  our customers [advertisers] are more cautious because they are contingency planning and we expected it to be to be slow,"" she told Today. The comparison with last year will also be lower because of the football World Cup in June which boosted advertising. Will BritBox be a hit or a flop? Why are the BBC and ITV creating BritBox?

Cohen 'to accuse Trump of racism and lies',"Cohen has been testifying before the Senate on Tuesday President Donald Trump's convicted former lawyer Michael Cohen is expected to accuse him of criminal conduct during a hearing on Capitol Hill. Speaking on Wednesday to a House of Representatives panel, Cohen will allege possible tax fraud and racist language by Mr Trump, say US media. The White House has questioned why lawmakers invited someone who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. Cohen was sentenced to three years and will begin his custodial term in May. On Tuesday, he was officially disbarred from practising law by the New York State Supreme Court, New York media reported. The penalty came as he began three consecutive days of testimony in a closed-doors hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. His Wednesday testimony to the House Oversight Committee will be public. US media have published a copy of his opening statement online,external. The 52-year-old was convicted last year by New York federal prosecutors of campaign finance violations and tax evasion and by special counsel Robert Mueller oflying to Congress about Trump Organization plans in Moscow.

His DNA was later found to match saliva on the back of the vestment worn by Canon White on 7 July last year. Wallace, from Uddingston, South Lanarkshire,admitted the assault last month. The court was told Wallace had accepted his crime wasmotivated by anti-Catholicism,external. Canon Thomas White was spat on and abused as as he spoke to parishioners following mass Sheriff Andrew Cubie said: ""This is about the courts reflecting disapproval of the depressingly still deep seated and widespread social issue of sectarianism, which generates at the very least tension and at worst both hatred and conflict and which disfigures civilised society. ""The courts in Scotland still deal all too frequently with cases of sectarian abuse which serve to harden and perpetuate divisions in society."" The sheriff said Wallace was old enough to be aware of increasing efforts to tackle the problem. He said: ""How could any 24-year-old from Scotland not know that it is wrong to peddle sectarianism? ""It is no doubt partly because of the 'echo chamber' effect of much social media, where your loyalties are displayed and perhaps your motivation identified."" The sheriff told Wallace he had taken part a ""grotesque spectacle"" which forced the priest to seek sanctuary in his church after mass to avoid a hostile crowd. He added: ""You could have acted with restraint but rather, no doubt emboldened by, and thinking that you were under the cover of this aggressive and threatening crowd, you took the decision to spit on the priest, an act which is disgusting, cowardly and provocative, which demonstrates contempt and hostility and is designed to humiliate and demean. ""The whole situation must have been, as you recognise, very frightening for the complainer and those around him."" Sheriff Cubie said the sentence should serve as a warning to others. He told the court: ""Those tempted to act in a sectarian way must understand society's repugnance of and weariness of that kind of behaviour and must expect to be dealt with accordingly."" Procurator fiscal depute Chris Farrell said the annual Boyne Parade in Glasgow had attracted 4,000 participants and an equal number of spectators. St Alphonsus Church is close to the Barras market in the east end At about 17:00 the parade was on its return route having ""splintered off into different factions"" which took different routes through the city. Mr Farrell said: ""At this time one of the factions was walking along London Road towards its junction with Kent Street. ""They were flanked by a number of police officers who took position outside of St Alphonsus Chrch, due to it being a Catholic congregation."" The court was told Canon White had finished his Sunday mass and was at the front entrance to say goodbye to his parishioners. When he saw the parade coming towards the church he tried to get back inside but was unable to due to a bottleneck created by the worshippers. A large scale disturbance then broke out at the junction between the two streets, which took police away from the church. As a result members of the public who had been associating themselves with the parade became more volatile towards the congregation. It was heard that ""a number of this group began to spit towards them"" and Wallace, who was amongst the group, spat on Canon White's back. Defence lawyer John Coogan told the court that Wallace had asked for a meeting to apologise to Canon White, but had been prevented from doing so by his bail conditions.

Surrey earthquake 'shakes houses',"The earthquake was recorded at a magnitude of 3.0, the British Geological Survey said One of the largest earthquakes since a ""swarm"" of tremors began in the area last year has been felt in Surrey and parts of Sussex. The quake occurred about 2km below the surface near Newdigate, the British Geological Survey (BGS) said. The tremor was felt at 03:42 GMT and measured 3.1, making it the biggest earthquake of the current ""swarm"". One resident of Redhill said his house was shaking for between four and five seconds. Gatwick Airport confirmed tremors had been felt overnight in the terminals, but a spokesman said operations had not been affected. Allow Twitter content?

The quake is the fourth to have been felt in the area in the last two weeks, with a smaller tremor felt on Valentine's Day and two more on 19 February. New stations to record earthquakes Seventh tremor in Surrey 'quake swarm' Second earthquake in a week near airport Many have questioned whether the spate of tremors had been caused by recent drilling for oil in the area. In August, retrospective planning permission was granted for asecondary oil wellbore at Brockham. Dr Hicks said: ""There's nothing in the data to show that there was any plausible explanation why these earthquakes could have been induced or caused by drilling activities. ""We're keeping an open mind, based on what new data becomes available."" He said: ""It is most likely that these earthquakes are natural - due to small tectonic stresses occurring on old geological faults caused by stresses from our nearest plate boundaries in the Mid-Atlantic and Mediterranean."" Surrey's earthquake swarm Three tremors were felt on 1 April 2018. The first had a magnitude of 2.7, a second within minutes came in at 1.8 and the third, an hour later, measured 1.7 The fourth quake on 28 April measured 1.5 The fifth on 27 June measured 2.6 A sixth tremor on 29 June registered 2.4 The previous biggest quake, on 5 July, measured 3.0 A 1.7 tremor near Russ Hill was also described as a ""weak thud"" The earth moved again on Valentine's Day when a tremor was measured at 2.4 Two more earthquakes were recorded on 19 February.

Deadly fire at Cairo's main rail station,"This video can not be played A train collided with a buffer stop and burst into flames next to a busy platform At least 20 people have been killed and 40 injured after a train crash sparked a large fire at Cairo's main railway station, Egyptian officials say. The train hit a buffer stop near the end of a busy platform at Ramses Station, which is in the city centre. The collision caused the train's fuel tank to explode, setting the platform and nearby buildings alight. The cause of the crash is not yet clear, but only hours later Transport Minister Hisham Arafat resigned. Witnesses described seeing several severely burned bodies in the latest disaster to hit Egypt's rundown railways. Egypt country profile State-run media earlier reported a higher death toll of at least 25 and as many as 50 injured. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi extended his condolences to the families of the victims During a visit to the scene, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli vowed to severely punish anyone who was found to have been negligent. ""We will identify who is responsible for the accident and they will be held accountable,"" he said. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi extended his condolences to the families of those who died and pledged to ensure that the injured received the support they needed. A platform kiosk was engulfed by fire Local media published what they said wasCCTV footage showing people on the busy platform as the train hits the buffer at high speed and explodes,external. Another video, taken from a CCTV camera above a nearby subway staircase, appears to showpeople fleeing as a fireball engulfs the platform,external. ""I saw a man pointing from the locomotive as it entered the platform, and screaming 'There are no brakes! There are no brakes!', before he jumped out of the locomotive,"" witness Ibrahim Hussein told Reuters news agency. ""I don't know what happened to him."" The train's fuel tank exploded after the crash ""I removed nearly 20 bodies, and carried them to the ambulance, all of them completely burned,"" Ahmed Mahmoud told news agency AFP. ""[The train] should have slowed down as it was about to enter the station, but it came in too fast."" The privately owned news website al-Shorouk cited a source as saying the train had been undergoing maintenance when it started moving at speed towards the station's main building without a conductor. The source added that this was not the first incident of its kind, explaining that there had been two other cases of a train moving without a conductor that had not resulted in any deaths or injuries. People gathered outside Ramses Station after the crash Egypt's railway system has a poor safety record, which many observers blame on a lack of investment by successive governments and poor management. In August 2017, 43 people were killed and more than 100 injured whentwo passenger trains collided outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.

Shot NI solicitor investigation 'ineffective',"Pat Finucane, a 39-year-old Belfast solicitor, was shot dead in front of his wife and children The Supreme Court has ruled that investigations into the murder of the Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane have not been effective. Mr Finucane was shot by loyalist paramilitaries in front of his young family at their home in February 1989. His widow Geraldine Finucane challenged ex-prime minister David Cameron over hisrefusal to hold a public inquiry. The court said she had not shown that decision ""was made in bad faith"" and did not recommend a public inquiry. However it added that none of the previous inquiries into his death have been capable of establishing the full facts surrounding the killing. Read the Supreme Court's full judgement,external Supreme Court urged to quash inquiry decision 'Shocking state collusion' says PM The Finucane family gathered outside the Supreme Court, describing the ruling as a ""win"" The court ruled that there has not been an ""Article 2 compliant inquiry"" into the death. Article 2 refers to an individual's right to life under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Supreme Court justice Lord Kerr said: ""There has not been an Article 2 compliant inquiry into the death of Patrick Finucane. This video can not be played Pat Finucane: Widow says family 'vindicated' by Supreme Court ""It does not follow that a public inquiry of the type which the appellant seeks must be ordered."" ""It is for the state to decide, in light of the incapacity of Sir Desmond de Silva's review and the inquiries which preceded it to meet the procedural requirement of Article 2, what form of investigation, if indeed any is now feasible, is required in order to meet that requirement."" The Finucane family said the court had ""vindicated"" Mrs Finucane in her ""relentless campaign for justice"". Following the Supreme Court ruling, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said that a public inquiry must be established. TheIrish government has consistently called for a public inquiry into Mr Finucane's murder. Judges also said a previous undertaking given to Mrs Finucane for an inquiry was ""clear and unambiguous"". She had a ""legitimate expectation"" a public inquiry would be held into his death, they said. Geraldine Finucane has been involved in a long-running legal battle Mr Finucane was shot by loyalist paramilitaries in front of his young family at their home in Belfast in February 1989. He was a high-profile solicitor who lived and worked in Belfast and convicted members of the IRA were among his clients. The judges said that none of the inquiries into Mr Finucane's death, including the review carried out by Sir Desmond de Silva, had the capability ""of establishing all the salient facts"" about his killing or the liability of those who were responsible for his death. What is a public inquiry and why are they held? Public inquiries are set up to uncover the truth following scandals or perceived injustices. The test that must be satisfied in order to hold an inquiry is that it is of""public concern"".,external While often chaired by a judge, a public inquiry is not a court of law and cannot determine liability. The aim is that public inquiries are independent. The government decides whether to hold an inquiry in the first place, appoints its head, and has to agree what it is going to cover. Inquiries can then make recommendations about how things should change but governments do not have to accept them. An example of a public inquiry is the inquiry into the GP and serial killer Harold Shipman,chaired by Dame Janet Smith - a High Court judge. The judges added that Mrs Finucane had not shown that the government's decision against holding a public inquiry ""was made in bad faith or that it was not based on genuine policy grounds"". In 2011, the family met with then prime minister David Cameron. Mr Cameron failed to order a public inquiry but instead proposed a review conducted by a leading QC. In his 2012 review, Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Mr Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught. However, his report concludedthere had been ""no overarching state conspiracy"". Mr Finucane's family argued that the report left many questions unanswered. Reacting to Wednesday's judgement, the family thanked the Supreme Court justices for their ""careful and respectful"" consideration of the case. Giving a statement outside the Supreme Court in London after the ruling, Geraldine Finucane said it was a ""historic moment"". She added: ""The British government now knows that it cannot conceal the truth any longer. They have now been told this by the highest court in the land. ""It is time for the murder of Pat Finucane to be properly and publicly investigated in a public inquiry. Nothing less will suffice."" Allow Twitter content?

Peter Madden, of Madden & Finucane said that ""only a judicial public inquiry can deliver the objective, which is to uncover the truth of what actually happened"". They claim that an inquiry is the only way to establish the truth about what happened and to hold those responsible to account. Last June,Barry MacDonald QC told the five Supreme Court judgesthat the government had reneged on a promise to the Fincuane family to hold an inquiry. He told the judges the case was about the responsibility of the judiciary in the face of what he called a direct attack on the legal system. In February 2017, the Court of Appeal in Belfast dismissed an appeal against the decision not to hold a public inquiry, ruling that the government had acted lawfully.

Shooting range criticised for IS bride targetThe family-friendly range in Wallasey provided images of Shamima Begum for target practice.UK,"Shamima Begum left the UK to join the Islamic State group aged 15 A shooting range in Merseyside has been criticised for using images of IS bride Shamima Begum as a target. Labour MP Angela Eagle said she was ""disapproving"" of the use of living people's faces by Ultimate Airsoft Range in Wallasey. Ms Begum left the UK at 15 to join the Islamic State group in 2015, andhas since had her UK citizenship revoked. The range said it had responded to requests from customers, with ""record numbers"" wanting Ms Begum as a target. Wallasey's Ultimate Airsoft Range told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the range was intended ""for people to learn the importance and safety of handling weapons, while having fun"". ""Our targets provide some fantastic reactions and conversations... bringing out the inner child in all,"" a spokesperson said. Images provided to the BBC show one target of Ms Begum with tens of holes from where shots had been fired into it. Guns and helmets used at Ultimate Airsoft Range The company, which says it provides ""family fun"" for adults and children aged six and over, announced the new targets containing Ms Begum's face in a tweet. The tweet read ""hot off the press"" and showed an image of Ms Begum overlaid with a target. It contained hashtags such as ""made your choice"" and ""no remorse"". The post has since been deleted. Angela Eagle, MP for Wallasey, said she was not in favour of having real people's faces on targets ""because it could be misinterpreted"". ""They shouldn't be using living people as targets - especially as six-year-olds might be playing,"" she added. Ultimate Airsoft Range said it provided targets of other public figures, citing Donald Trump, Adolf Hitler and Justin Bieber as examples. ""The targets we provide do not necessarily always reflect our personal opinions,"" a spokesperson said, adding that Ultimate Airsoft Range LTD does not condone terrorism or anyone involved in it. ""After watching footage of Shamima Begum being interviewed and the lack of remorse and empathy she shows, we chose to go ahead and run the targets."" Ms Begum was a 15-year-old schoolgirl when she left her home in east London in 2015 to join the Islamic State group. Earlier this month she was discovered living in a refugee camp in northern Syria where she recently gave birth to a baby son. In an interview with the BBC,she said she did not regret travelling to Syria, though she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She said while it was ""wrong"" innocent adults and children died in the 2017 Manchester Arena attack, it was ""kind of retaliation"" for attacks on IS. Her family have told Home Secretary Sajid Javid they intend to challenge his decision to revoke her UK citizenship.

School language learning at 18-year lowTeachers say the perception of languages as difficult subjects is the main reason behind the drop.Family & Education,"Foreign language learning is at its lowest level in UK secondary schools since the turn of the millennium, with German and French falling the most. BBC analysis shows drops of between 30% and 50% since 2013 in the numbers taking GCSE language courses in the worst affected areas in England. A separate survey of secondaries suggests a third have dropped at least one language from their GCSE options. In England, ministers say they are taking steps to reverse the decline. The BBC attempted to contact every one of the almost 4,000 mainstream secondary schools in the UK, and more than half - 2,048 - responded. Of the schools which replied, most said the perception of languages as a difficult subject was the main reason behind a drop in the number of pupils studying for exams. Figures for Wales showed that GCSE language entries fell by 29%over five years, and 35% of schools have dropped at least one language from their options at GCSE. In Wales, it is compulsory for pupils to study Welsh until the age of 16 either as a first (for those already fluent) or second language. And under the new curriculum, Welsh,  English and international languages will be brought together in one area of learning. In Northern Ireland, the numbers taking modern languages at GCSE have fallen by 40%since 2003, with 45% of schools saying they have cut the numbers of specialist language teachers in the past five years. Pupils in Scotland do not sit GCSEs or A-levels, but entries for the comparable exams - National 4 and 5 and Highers - are included in the analysis. This video can not be played 'Why I travel miles to study German' These show that there has been a 19% decline in language entries there at National 4 and 5 level since 2014. In the BBC Survey, 41% of schools in Scotland who responded said they had stopped offering at least one foreign language course to 16-year-olds. There were also five council education departments in Scotland where no National 4 or 5 exams in German were recorded in 2017/18. At Carmel College in St Helens, Merseyside, sixth formers can still study A-level French, but German is no longer on offer. Students come to the college from 120 secondary schools and only a handful of those still offer German at GCSE, so there were not enough students to make an A-level course viable. The principal, Mike Hill, says the college has seen the numbers of students wanting to study modern foreign languages decline sharply in recent years. ""If we have classes of 25 in other subjects, it's really hard to justify small classes in other subjects, even though we are a big college."" This also means cultural links are being lost, as they have had to drop a long-standing student exchange with the German city of Stuttgart. Mr Hill believes that languages are now seen as a high-risk choice by schools and pupils, as many believe it is harder to get a high grade in exams. While German and French - the languages of two of the UK's closest trading partners - have really dropped away at GCSE level, there has been a noticeable surge in some others, such as Spanish and Mandarin. In 2001, only 2,500 students were taking a language other than French, German, Spanish or Welsh. By 2017, that had reached 9,400. Business organisations have expressed concern at the lack of language skills in the UK. Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director for business group the CBI, said: ""Employer demand for French, German and Spanish skills have significantly increased over the last few years. ""The decline in language learning in schools must be reversed, or else the UK will be less competitive globally and young people less prepared for the modern world. ""As well as speaking a foreign language, increasing young people's cultural awareness and their ability to work with people from around the world is just as important."" The national figures for language exam entries fail to show the full, complex picture. It is only by analysing the data at local authority level that it becomes clear just how quickly some languages have been abandoned at GCSE. This is a decline that the introduction in England of the English Baccalaureate - a group of core academic subjects at GCSE including a language - was meant to prevent. In 2017, there were 37 local authorities in England where the total number of GCSE or equivalent exam entries was less than the number at one public school - Eton. In three local authorities in England in the same year, there were no GCSE German entries from state schools at all. Grammar schools accounted for 8% of state school GCSE entries in 2017, despite there only being 163 grammars in England. Education is devolved to the Northern Irish and Welsh assemblies, and the Scottish Parliament. Nick Gibb, the minister with responsibility for school standards at Westminster, says the overall picture in England is improving. ""Since 2010, the proportion of children taking a language at GCSE has risen from 40% to 46% in 2018 - and we are determined to see this rise further. ""We are taking a range of measures to do this, such as creating a new network of schools that excel in the teaching of languages to share their expertise and best practice with others and setting up a new mentoring project to encourage pupils' interest in languages."" The government in England is also investing in supporting Mandarin teaching, with a target of 5,000 pupils being ""on track to fluency"" by 2020. The Welsh government accepted that there are some very real challenges to tackle, adding that all pupils will start experiencing international languages from a much earlier age. A spokesman said it had a Â£2.5m plan which aims to increase the take-up of modern foreign languages at GCSE and, in turn A-level, through new centres of excellence. The Department of Education in Northern Ireland said it funded a range of programmes to enhance and support language learning in schools. It is currently engaging with officials and academics from across the UK to ensure that the benefits of language learning and the value of languages for a wide range of careers are promoted to young people. The Scottish Government said: ""We are investing in modern language learning to equip young people with skills for an increasingly complex and globalised world. We have made an additional Â£27.2 million available to assist local authorities with implementation of the 1+2 language policy since 2013."" Data journalism by Clara Guibourg.

"Do your duty on Brexit, May tells MPsThe PM appeals for help to end the impasse as MPs prepare to vote on what they want to happen next.UK PoliticsComments","MPs will have their say on the next steps for Brexit later after European leaders indicated they would consider delaying the UK's departure if a deal is not agreed by 29 March. Germany's Angela Merkel said if the UK needed more time to get Parliament's approval, she would ""not oppose"" it. Theresa May has said MPs will get a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal and a no-deal outcome are both rejected. MPs will vote on amendments to a government motion in the Commons later. Wednesday's votes are not on Mrs May's Brexit deal itself - she says that will happen before 12 March. Instead, MPs are seeking assurances and to hold the PM to her commitment, made on Tuesday, to allow MPs a vote on extending 29 March's Brexit deadline to avoid Britain leaving without a deal. The prime minister's critics have accused her of ""kicking the can down the road"" with her pledge to hold more votes before 12 March - just 17 days before Brexit. But she insisted her efforts to persuade the EU to make concessions had ""already begun to bear fruit"". Live updates: MPs debate Brexit options Which Brexit amendments have been selected? Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? How could Brexit be delayed? The government has accepted an amendment by Conservative MP Alberto Costa, which seeks to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU, and vice versa, regardless of the outcome of UK-EU negotiations. The amendment - which calls on the UK to secure agreement on this at ""the earliest opportunity"" - had gained significant cross-party backing from 141 MPs - including Labour and the Democratic Unionists. Despite this, Mr Costa has resigned his job as aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell, because, he told MPs, of a convention that members of the government should not amend government motions. He said he ""welcomed"" the government's support for his amendment but it did not go far enough. He said he wanted ministers to spell out ""exactly what measures"" Theresa May will now take to guarantee citizens rights and urged her to write to European Council President Donald Tusk. He said the rights of the estimated million UK citizens living in the EU, and the three million EU citizens in the UK, ""should never have been used as a bargaining chip"" in the government's Brexit negotiations. Green MP Caroline Lucas praised Mr Costa's stand and called for him to be reinstated in the government. Analysis by Nick Eardley, BBC Political Correspondent It looks a bit strange, doesn't it? The government accepts an amendment from a member of the government - but then essentially sacks that member of the government for tabling it in the first place. I'm told by several people that Alberto Costa was left with no decision but to resign. He met with the prime minister this morning made it clear he wasn't backing down which sealed his fate. That's left some Tories furious. They point out he has a personal interest in the EU citizens' rights issue given his Italian parentage and say he was simply trying to get assurances he had been offered by Theresa May backed by the Commons.

M&S to start home delivery next year,"Marks & Spencer and Ocado have confirmed a deal which will give the High Street retailer a home delivery service for the first time. M&S will buy a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for Â£750m. The joint venture will be called Ocado and will deliver M&S grocery products from September 2020 at the latest, when Ocado's deal with Waitrose expires. Under the deal Ocado will also continue to supply its own-label products and big name branded goods. Ocado's deal to deliver about 4,500 Waitrose goods is due to end in September 2020. Shoppers will then be able to order more than 4,500 M&S products alongside Ocado own-label goods and big name branded items. Existing Waitrose customers - who have products delivered by Ocado - will have two choices: They could choose to stay with Ocado and switch to buying M&S goods They could switch to Waitrose.com which operates its own online delivery service Waitrose managing director Rob Collins said the supermarket chain had strengthened its own online business ""significantly"" and that it planned to double its sales within five years. M&S chief executive Steve Rowe claimed that current Ocado customers would benefit from the deal as Marks and Spencer products were on average cheaper than comparable Waitrose products. The deal could also see some of Ocado's own brand products being stocked in M&S stores. Ocado also has a deal to supply Morrisons with the technology to run its online business. This arrangement is separate and will not be affected by the new tie-up. Visitors to the Ocado site will still not be able to order Morrisons. M&S is to buy a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for Â£750m. The retailer will fund the deal by selling Â£600m of shares and by cutting its dividend payout to shareholders by 40%. ""We think we've paid a fair price,"" said Steve Rowe, M&S chief executive. ""It's the only way we could have gone online within an immediately scalable, profitable and sustainable business,"" he said. M&S shareholders were sceptical, its shares fell 10% following the announcement, while Ocado's shares rose by almost 4%. M&S has struggled in recent times. Clothing, home and food sales have all fallen, amid ""challenging"" trading conditions on the High Street. It has been hampered by not having an online delivery service. However, Mr Rowe said in the future one third of M&S business would be online. The deal was the ""only way we could have gone online within an immediately scalable, profitable and sustainable business"", he said. But Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, questioned whether the value of a shop with M&S was big enough for online shopping. ""Basket sizes at M&S are extremely small relative to other larger supermarkets and significantly below the current Ocado minimum for delivery. At the moment M&S shoppers spend an average of Â£13 on each shop, while Ocado averages just over Â£100 per shop. M&S said that part of the reason it has such a relatively low average spend was that customers could not access a wider range of products. The company said the Ocado deal would offer their customers the ability to do a full shop online. The company will split into two parts. The new joint venture will be called Ocado.com and will deliver M&S, Ocado and big name branded products. It will have access to M&S's database of 12 million food shoppers. Its Ocado Solutions division will continue to develop new robotic warehouse technology and supply companies likeUS retail giant Krogerand France's Groupe Casino,  helped by the injection of money it gets from the new deal. However, according to Market.com's Mr Wilson, there is a risk that shoppers will defect to Waitrose when the current arrangement with Ocado comes to an end. ""I would also query whether M&S can retain the current Ocado customer base who are used to getting Waitrose products. There is a high risk of customer leakage as consumers rotate to Waitrose's in-house delivery service,"" he said. However, Ocado founder and chief executive Tim Steiner brushed off that suggestion. ""Our customers have told us that they are looking forward to getting their M&S Percy Pig sweets"", he said. The ending of the deal with Waitrose means that Ocado will no longer have to pay sourcing fees to Waitrose, which came to more than Â£15m in 2018. Sainsbury's-Asda merger in jeopardy What went wrong on the High Street in 2018? The two companies' share price reactions give a succinct verdict. M&S was down nearly 8% in early trading; Ocado up 4%. Retail experts - and professional investors - think there is a lot more in this for Ocado than for M&S. The latter is paying Â£750m for a half share in a division of Ocado that last year made just over Â£80m of trading profit. Shareholders will have to find Â£600m of the purchase price from their own pockets, and - possibly worse news for the many investors who have bought M&S shares for the income they provide - stomach a hefty cut to the dividend. The high price explains some of investor misgivings, but there are bigger questions about the fit between the two. M&S is a (relatively) upmarket convenience store, where the average basket price is just Â£13. Ocado, thanks to its tie-up with Waitrose and its wide-range of own-label products, is a full-service grocery store where most customers are doing their weekly shop, not topping up. Will M&S be able to push enough of its products through Ocado to justify the price, and how will Ocado customers react when its relationship with Waitrose comes to an end next year? Archie Norman, M&S's wily chairman and chief strategist, might judge these criticisms short-sighted, and typical of the City's lack of long-term vision. Having lagged behind on online shopping for years, M&S has been catapulted into the front ranks at a stroke. The cost of the deal, Norman might argue, should be judged against the cost of the alternatives, and the cost of doing nothing.

School language learning at 18-year low,"Foreign language learning is at its lowest level in UK secondary schools since the turn of the millennium, with German and French falling the most. BBC analysis shows drops of between 30% and 50% since 2013 in the numbers taking GCSE language courses in the worst affected areas in England. A separate survey of secondaries suggests a third have dropped at least one language from their GCSE options. In England, ministers say they are taking steps to reverse the decline. The BBC attempted to contact every one of the almost 4,000 mainstream secondary schools in the UK, and more than half - 2,048 - responded. Of the schools which replied, most said the perception of languages as a difficult subject was the main reason behind a drop in the number of pupils studying for exams. Figures for Wales showed that GCSE language entries fell by 29%over five years, and 35% of schools have dropped at least one language from their options at GCSE. In Wales, it is compulsory for pupils to study Welsh until the age of 16 either as a first (for those already fluent) or second language. And under the new curriculum, Welsh,  English and international languages will be brought together in one area of learning. In Northern Ireland, the numbers taking modern languages at GCSE have fallen by 40%since 2003, with 45% of schools saying they have cut the numbers of specialist language teachers in the past five years. Pupils in Scotland do not sit GCSEs or A-levels, but entries for the comparable exams - National 4 and 5 and Highers - are included in the analysis. This video can not be played 'Why I travel miles to study German' These show that there has been a 19% decline in language entries there at National 4 and 5 level since 2014. In the BBC Survey, 41% of schools in Scotland who responded said they had stopped offering at least one foreign language course to 16-year-olds. There were also five council education departments in Scotland where no National 4 or 5 exams in German were recorded in 2017/18. At Carmel College in St Helens, Merseyside, sixth formers can still study A-level French, but German is no longer on offer. Students come to the college from 120 secondary schools and only a handful of those still offer German at GCSE, so there were not enough students to make an A-level course viable. The principal, Mike Hill, says the college has seen the numbers of students wanting to study modern foreign languages decline sharply in recent years. ""If we have classes of 25 in other subjects, it's really hard to justify small classes in other subjects, even though we are a big college."" This also means cultural links are being lost, as they have had to drop a long-standing student exchange with the German city of Stuttgart. Mr Hill believes that languages are now seen as a high-risk choice by schools and pupils, as many believe it is harder to get a high grade in exams. While German and French - the languages of two of the UK's closest trading partners - have really dropped away at GCSE level, there has been a noticeable surge in some others, such as Spanish and Mandarin. In 2001, only 2,500 students were taking a language other than French, German, Spanish or Welsh. By 2017, that had reached 9,400. Business organisations have expressed concern at the lack of language skills in the UK. Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director for business group the CBI, said: ""Employer demand for French, German and Spanish skills have significantly increased over the last few years. ""The decline in language learning in schools must be reversed, or else the UK will be less competitive globally and young people less prepared for the modern world. ""As well as speaking a foreign language, increasing young people's cultural awareness and their ability to work with people from around the world is just as important."" The national figures for language exam entries fail to show the full, complex picture. It is only by analysing the data at local authority level that it becomes clear just how quickly some languages have been abandoned at GCSE. This is a decline that the introduction in England of the English Baccalaureate - a group of core academic subjects at GCSE including a language - was meant to prevent. In 2017, there were 37 local authorities in England where the total number of GCSE or equivalent exam entries was less than the number at one public school - Eton. In three local authorities in England in the same year, there were no GCSE German entries from state schools at all. Grammar schools accounted for 8% of state school GCSE entries in 2017, despite there only being 163 grammars in England. Education is devolved to the Northern Irish and Welsh assemblies, and the Scottish Parliament. Nick Gibb, the minister with responsibility for school standards at Westminster, says the overall picture in England is improving. ""Since 2010, the proportion of children taking a language at GCSE has risen from 40% to 46% in 2018 - and we are determined to see this rise further. ""We are taking a range of measures to do this, such as creating a new network of schools that excel in the teaching of languages to share their expertise and best practice with others and setting up a new mentoring project to encourage pupils' interest in languages."" The government in England is also investing in supporting Mandarin teaching, with a target of 5,000 pupils being ""on track to fluency"" by 2020. The Welsh government accepted that there are some very real challenges to tackle, adding that all pupils will start experiencing international languages from a much earlier age. A spokesman said it had a Â£2.5m plan which aims to increase the take-up of modern foreign languages at GCSE and, in turn A-level, through new centres of excellence. The Department of Education in Northern Ireland said it funded a range of programmes to enhance and support language learning in schools. It is currently engaging with officials and academics from across the UK to ensure that the benefits of language learning and the value of languages for a wide range of careers are promoted to young people. The Scottish Government said: ""We are investing in modern language learning to equip young people with skills for an increasingly complex and globalised world. We have made an additional Â£27.2 million available to assist local authorities with implementation of the 1+2 language policy since 2013."" Data journalism by Clara Guibourg.

"'Tiniest baby boy' leaves Tokyo hospitalDoctors said the baby, born weighing just 268g, is the tiniest newborn ever to be sent home.Asia","The baby at the age of five days... A baby boy who weighed just 268g (9.45oz) at birth has been released from hospital in Japan, and is believed to be the smallest boy in the world to have been successfully treated. The baby was born by emergency C-section in August, and was so small he could fit into a pair of cupped hands. The infant was nurtured in intensive care until he was released last week, two months after his due date. He had grown to a weight of 3.2kg, and is now feeding normally. Born at 24 weeks, the tiny boy spent five months in hospital. ""I can only say I'm happy that he has grown this big because honestly, I wasn't sure he could survive,"" the boy's mother said, according to Tokyo's Keio University Hospital. Doctor Takeshi Arimitsu, who treated the extraordinary baby, told the BBC he was the smallest infant born (on record) to be discharged from a hospital,according to a database of the world's littlest babies held by the University of Iowa,external. He said he wanted to show that ""there is a possibility that babies will be able to leave the hospital in good health, even though they are born small"". ... and weighing a healthy 3.2kg - twelve times his birth weight - just before he left hospital The previous record-holder was a boy born in Germany, weighing 274g. The smallest surviving baby girl in that same database was also born in Germany, in 2015, and reportedly weighed 252g. 'I didn't think she would see Christmas' Parents' care 'can help' premature babies Keio University Hospital said the survival rate of babies born weighing less than a kilogram is about 90% in Japan. But for those born under 300g, that falls to around 50%. Among the very smallest babies, the survival rate is much lower for boys than girls. Medical experts are unsure why, though some believe it could be linked to the slower development of male babies' lungs.

"'Apocalyptic' moorland blaze put outFirefighters say the huge blaze was one of the biggest they have ""ever had to deal with"".Leeds & West Yorkshire","This video can not be played The fire could be seen for miles around Fire crews have extinguished a huge blaze on moorland in West Yorkshire. The fire, described by one witness as ""apocalyptic"", started at about 19:30 GMT on Tuesday and covered about 1.5 sq km of land near Marsden. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it was ""one of the biggest moorland fires we've ever had to deal with"". It came as the UK broke the record for the warmest winter day for a second time and on the same day as a gorse fire on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. Following a night spent tackling the blaze, near Saddleworth Moor between Huddersfield and Manchester, a fire service spokesperson said: ""The fire now looks to be out."" However, they said crews and specialist moorland firefighting units ""will remain at the scene for much of the day to tackle any further hot spots"". At its height, more than 35 firefighters were in attendance at the National Trust property and the A62 between Colne Valley and Diggle was closed as a precaution. Station manager Adam Greenwood said when crews arrived about 4 sq km of moorland was ablaze. ""It was one of the highest flame fronts we have seen, with flames of up to two metres high, and it was moving fast across the moorland,"" he said. ""The fire looks to be out however moorland fires can easily reignite so it's important that we monitor it closely. ""We expect to be at the moors for much of the day."" There have been no reports of any injuries. People living near to the scene have been advised to stay indoors and keep their doors and windows closed. But the fire service said ""risks to health are low"". BBC Yorkshire climate correspondent Paul Hudson said that, like much of the UK, the region had faced unseasonal winter temperatures. He said: ""These kind of temperatures, 18C or 19C, are what you would normally see in early June. ""There's been a prolonged abnormally warm spell and we've also had an exceptionally dry start to 2019. ""The temperature on Wednesday is also set to be pretty similar."" Pictures capture dramatic moorland fire Latest updates on moorland fire Why are there UK wildfires in February? Station commander Tony Pearson said moor fires in February were ""very unusual but not unheard of"". He said: ""We've had a few dry days and it's dried the land out a little bit."" He described the location as ""horrendous"" as it took firefighters an hour to get there due to the terrain. Mr Pearson said: ""It was really uneven ground, really difficult working conditions on there. Mike Elliot, from the National Trust, said the heather on the moorland had only just re-established itself after a blaze about three years ago. He said: ""It's gradually got back to its normal self, but unfortunately it's going to have to start again. ""What we're doing here is trying to stabilise the moorland with all the heather as that keeps all the peat out of the watercourse."" The Edinburgh gorse fire broke out at a similar time on Tuesday, andtwo large fires started within an hour of each otherin the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex earlier. In June and July last year, firefighters from 20 different brigades were drafted in to help tackle two huge moorland fires which burnt for several weeks. Firefighters spent more than a month battling a huge fire covering 18 sq km (6.9 sq miles) at Winter Hill, near Bolton. The Army was drafted in to help Greater Manchester crews deal with a blaze on Saddleworth Moor in Tameside. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Was Shauna the victim of rush to develop stem cell technology?,"British teenager Shauna Davison was given an experimental transplant in 2012, in the hope of prolonging her life. Her mother says she was told in advance about two patients who had survived a similar operation - but not about others who had died. The BBC's Deborah Cohen asks whether Shauna, who died after two weeks, was a casualty of the rush to develop stem cell technology? Shauna Davison was born with one lung, a cleft palate and a major heart defect. But despite spending her life in and out of hospital she remained a happy child. ""Her illness never got her down and she always had a smile on her face,"" says Shauna's mother, Karen Davison. ""Everyone was so nice to her. They looked beyond her problems."" When she was 12 weeks old, doctors found problems with her trachea - or windpipe. It was very narrow and when it became obstructed, she couldn't breathe. She was given 48 hours to live. Karen Davison: ""She was a cheeky child but loved by everybody"" A surgeon in Leeds came to the rescue. David Crabbe warned that it might not work, but he managed to rebuild Shauna's windpipe out of her ribs. Shauna had to stay in hospital for six months and had ring-shaped stents put in her windpipe to keep it open. Mr Crabbe was really caring, Karen Davison says. ""The hospital was outstanding."" Over the years, Shauna's stents needed dilating as she grew bigger. She had a tracheostomy  - an opening in the front of her neck - to help her breathe. ""There were times we didn't think she'd make it because she kept collapsing,"" Karen Davison says. This story takes about 15 minutes to read You can also watch Deborah Cohen'sreport for Newsnight here,external At home in Middlesbrough, she learned how to change Shauna's tracheostomy tube, use a ventilator, do physiotherapy to help her clear her airway, suction her airway, do CPR, and give her intravenous antibiotics. ""I did everything for her,"" she says. ""Shauna coped marvellously. But she didn't know any different."" An avid Middlesbrough Football Club fan, Shauna loved wearing a football kit. She went to a mainstream school, with the support of a carer, where she could mix with other children. ""She was a cheeky child, but loved by everybody,"" her mother says. ""She brightened everyone's day."" Shauna had many operations but she'd always come through. At times, she didn't go near a hospital for ages, Karen says. A time came, however, when David Crabbe told her that his technique for treating Shauna was no longer going to be sufficient. Her airway was too small and they would have to look for other options. ""Mr Crabbe showed me pictures of a normal airway and her airway. It was tiny,"" Karen Davison says. Shauna started to go to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London for tests and to have her stent changed. In 2011, doctors there told her the airway wouldn't last much longer. At 15, Shauna suffered a respiratory arrest - a serious incident in which she became unable to breathe - and the family was told about pioneering surgery by Prof Martin Elliott, a cardiothoracic surgeon and former medical director of Great Ormond Street Hospital. ""They said there'd been some research into tracheal transplants and there'd been two other cases where it'd been done, but they couldn't discuss them with me because of patient confidentiality,"" Karen Davison says. One of them was a 10-year-old boy, she adds. ""It would be the only chance she'd have."" Shauna's transplant wasn't a conventional one. She would receive a donor windpipe, but it would be laced with her own stem cells, making it almost like her own. She wouldn't need drugs to stop her body rejecting it. It was at the forefront of the new stem cell technology - and still very experimental. Doctors can use experimental treatments if someone is terminally ill and there is no alternative treatment. It's called ""compassionate use"". Karen says she was told Shauna wouldn't need a tracheostomy or a ventilator and she'd lead a normal life. But she was told about risks too, she adds - Shauna might still reject the transplant, and having a general anaesthetic is never risk-free. Martin Elliott had previously worked closely with the internationally renowned Martin Birchall, professor of ENT at University College London (UCL), on implanting a stem-cell-laced donor trachea in another child. They would work together again in Shauna's case. Shauna was being treated at Great Ormond Street at the time of a BBC documentary about the hospital in 2012. She was assessed by different specialists and asked what her hopes for the future were. Shauna told respiratory consultant Dr Martin Wallis she wanted to be able to go swimming. It was not an easy decision to have the operation. In Martin Wallis's words, it was not a situation where there was nothing to lose. ""They've got quite a bit to lose. And this is going to make for a difficult decision,"" he said. ""She's got a reasonable quality of life, she's got her good friend, she clearly has a sense of humour and is enjoying herself - it makes it harder."" ""I wanted her to have it done while she was well rather than wait until she was unwell and it might not happen,"" Karen Davison says. But because it was such an experimental procedure, her medical team discussed it with the Great Ormond Street Hospital ethics committee. ""I don't think she will die if we do the procedure. We're trying to do the procedure so that she doesn't. Or at least we prolong her life and her quality of life for as long as possible,"" the surgeon, Martin Elliott, tells the committee on camera. ""They couldn't give me a time when she'd die but they said she will die eventually. Because her airway would just give up. So there was this procedure they said they were willing to do,"" Karen Davison says. ""Like any other parent, if you thought this was going to help your child live, I agreed to it."" So in February 2012, Shauna was given a transplant of a donor trachea newly populated with her own stem cells. Shauna's transplant operation was filmed by the BBC Initially, everything seemed to go well. ""For the first couple of days she was marvellous,"" her mother recalls. ""I couldn't believe how well she recovered after it."" Two weeks after her operation Shauna was moved from Great Ormond Street by ambulance to a hospital in Leeds. But during the transfer Shauna started to cough a lot and was in need of suction to clear her throat. ""We thought that was strange, but thought it might have been due to the journey,"" Karen Davison says. ""I just thought, 'Another couple of weeks and we'll be home.'"" But the next morning, Shauna took a turn for the worse. ""Her chest was pulling in,"" Karen says. She remembers Shauna saying, ""Help me, help me."" ""It was the worst day of my life because I couldn't help her."" Shauna's new trachea had collapsed. ""They said she'd struggled that much to breathe, her heart had given up,"" Karen Davison says. ""She was a wonderful child. I miss her so much."" When the first transplant using a donated windpipe coated with the patient's own stem cells was carried out in 2008 it made global headlines. It was thought that stripping the donor's cells from the surface of the trachea and seeding it with the patient's own stem cells created a new organ that would be like the patient's own tissue. No anti-rejection drugs would be needed for the ""tissue-engineered"" trachea. The operation was carried out by Italian surgeon Paolo Macchiarini with the help of Martin Birchall, then a surgeon at Bristol University. The recipient was 30-year-old Claudia Castillo, who had tuberculosis in part of her windpipe that leads to the lungs - the bronchus. Her case was written up in The Lancet. Five months after she'd had her operation, she was reported to be in perfect health. Martin Birchall, who had helped to prepare the donor trachea, said at the time that it would ""represent a huge step change in surgery,external. Surgeons can now start to see and understand the potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients with serious diseases."" Many around the world agreed. It was a ""milestone in medicine,external"", ""unadulterated good news"" and ""a textbook example of international collaboration,external"". ""It was seen as revolutionary, as highly innovativeâ¦ opening the door for new and exciting tech using a marriage between stem cells and artificial scaffolds that could bring forth this entirely new field of regenerative medicine,"" recalls Prof John Rasko, of the University of Sydney Faculty of Health Sciences. It had ""the whiff of a Nobel Prize about it,"" he says. Indeed, soon the university that hands out the Nobel Prize for medicine, Stockholm's prestigious Karolinska Institute, offered Macchiarini a post. Birchall, for his part, moved to University College London (UCL), where Macchiarini was also made an honorary professor. Claudia Castillo's operation served as a template and soon others had similar procedures. In 2010, Professor Birchall told a conference ""we have done a further five adults"". Apart from Shauna, UK patients given a tissue-engineered trachea include 19-year-old Keziah Shorten and 10-year-old Ciaran Finn-Lynch. Shauna's surgeon, Martin Elliott, led the transplant team that performed Ciaran's operation, with the help of Macchiarini and Birchall. Like Claudia Castillo, his procedure was published in a medical journal and it garnered global headlines. Martin Birchall told journalists: ""He is left with a healthy organ there, made from his own stem cells, and that in a way is a kind of miracle."" But soon questions started to be asked about the stem-cell-laced tracheas. For Macchiarini, this meant his meteoric rise was mirrored by a rapid fall from grace. He had switched from using donated tracheas to plastic ones, also laced with stem cells. The results were disastrous - his patients died. Macchiarini was investigated several times by Karolinska before he was fired. Allegations made against him were initially dismissed but the institute has since found himguilty of scientific misconduct,externaland many of his scientific papers have been retracted. Swedish prosecutorsreopened a criminal negligence investigation,externalagainst him in December last year. He has previously denied any negligence. The director of the Swedish Public Prosecution, Mikael Bjork, announces the reopening of a criminal negligence investigation into Paolo Macchiarini in December 2018 Bo Risberg, professor emeritus of surgery at the University of Gothenberg and a former chairman of the Swedish Ethics Council has said the events amount to the biggest research scandal Sweden has experienced in modern times. ""Everything was swept under the carpet,"" he said. Macchiarini's failure to do pre-clinical tests on animals using the plastic tracheas was ""the worst crime you can commit"", he added. One of Macchiarini's early critics was Pierre Delaere, professor of ENT at University Hospital Leuven in Belgium, who has argued that it is ""impossible from a theoretical point of view"" to establish a new blood supply to a tissue-engineered trachea, whether plastic or donated. In 2015, he wrote to UCL casting doubt on the idea of ""tracheal regeneration"", calling it ""the biggest lie in medical history"". By this time Macchiarini had left UCL. Paolo Macchiarini operating In its subsequent unpublished report into Delaere's claims, seen by the BBC, UCL cast doubt on the suggestion that stem cells ""played any therapeutic role"" in Ciaran's operation. But, it said, there was no ""deliberate fraud"" or ""intent to mislead"" on Martin Birchall's part. Because of the ""lack of intent to deceive"" the university recommended education and training rather than other formal procedures. Meanwhile, the university was gearing up to conduct clinical trials into stem-cell-regenerated tracheas and larynxes - called Inspire and RegenVox respectively. Martin Birchall was principal investigator with responsibility for leading the trials. He and his team would bring in millions of pounds of research funding to the university. It wasn't the only time UCL produced a report into regenerative medicine at the university. In 2017, it published the findings of a special inquiry, set up after the Macchiarini revelations. This found no fault with Martin Birchall and cleared the way for future clinical trials to proceed. It said that, when asked, Shauna's family ""were grateful for the opportunity that her daughter received and held no rancour with the tracheal team at GOSH"". UCL told the BBC this was ""reported to the inquiry by the clinicians involved in the care of Shauna Davison"". But Shauna's mother, Karen Davison, says no-one connected to the inquiry had ever asked for her views. The more I have looked into Shauna Davison's story the more I have discovered that Karen Davison did not know. The two patients Karen and Shauna heard about were the 10-year-old boy, Ciaran Finn-Lynch, and Claudia Castillo, both of whom are still alive. But they weren't told that Claudia Castillo's windpipe transplant collapsed just over three weeks after she'd had it and she needed stents to keep it open. (She's since had to have a lung removed.) Nor did Karen and Shauna hear about most of the other cases Martin Birchall talked about in 2010. One of these operations was on Kent teenager Keziah Shorten, who about two years previously had been given a tissue-engineered donor trachea by Macchiarini in Florence, after she had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. But around a year after the operation, her transplant failed. Martin Birchall told a Swedish documentary in 2016 that her tissue-engineered windpipe had broken down. When she was subsequently operated on at University College London Hospital they replaced it with a plastic one. She died a month before Shauna's operation. According to John Rasko there is a ""strong obligation to give a full and frank account of all the information that's available. Exceptionalism and excluding bad cases is really something that is not acceptable."" A spokesperson for GOSH said: ""As a patient, Keziah's condition and her graft were very different to Shauna, so it was not clinically relevant to discuss her case."" The hospital added that the other patients were not discussed ""because the team did not know of other relevant cases from overseas at this time"". There was more that Karen and Shauna did not know. They did hear about Ciaran Finn-Lynch. But there were key differences between Shauna's operation and his. Ciaran had received a stent - but Shauna didn't. According to the 2017 UCL inquiry report, Martin Elliott said that he had wanted to use a stent but was advised not to. Ciaran had also received a fresh donor trachea. Shauna's wasn't fresh. It had been frozen and then thawed. It was a treatment that hadn't been used before - after the trachea had been thawed, the donor's cells had been removed using a special vacuum technique exclusive to members of Shauna's medical team. Martin Birchall is cited as saying that Shauna's initial surgery was successful, in a letter to the European Medicines Agency Trish Murray, professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at Liverpool University, has a number of criticisms. ""The reality is that if you don't have a stent, the trachea will collapse, that's been the unanimous experience of all patients who've experienced trachea transplantation,"" she says. ""So although it's well-known that stents cause problems, if you don't have a stent, then the trachea will collapse and the patient will suffocate."" Another issue was the frozen trachea. For the team it made perfect sense to freeze a trachea, as the trachea could be stored up in advance and thawed when needed. But Trish Murray is critical of this decision too. ""Ciaran's trachea was not frozen beforehand whereas Shauna's was freeze-thawed and we know from papers that the group themselves have published that that would weaken the trachea... and that would make it more likely to collapse after it had been implanted,"" she says. However, UCL questions the relevance of these studies. It has told the BBC that they do not refer to the technique used on Shauna. Trish Murray says other worrying studies should have rung alarm bells. She points to an unpublished study looking at the vacuum technique, which shows that one pig that received a transplant died spontaneously and another developed ""respiratory compromise"" and had to be put down. The study was stopped on humane grounds. ""We know from information that's been obtained from FOI requests that the team in UCL have tried the technique on two pigs and both pigs died quite quickly. We also know that they've tried it on rabbits and there was 100% mortality in the rabbits as well,"" she says. The BBC asked UCL and Great Ormond Street whether the animal studies were done before or after Shauna's operation, but received no reply to this question. And like Belgian ENT professor Pierre Delaere, Trish Murray questions the role the stem cells played. ""There's actually no evidence that any of those cells survive, in fact quite a lot of evidence that they don't survive,"" she says. But how were doctors and scientists involved in the care of seriously ill patients able to use these tracheas when there was little evidence that they worked? Usually, researchers have to test their innovation in the lab and then on animals in preclinical research. Only then - with formal approval from a research ethics committee and the regulators - does it move into humans. Martin Birchall, however, wrote in the Lancet that ""compassionate studies"", the procedure for using new treatments on very ill patients, were ""powerful ways to inform robustly designed formal trials"" and would ""expedite the testing of novel therapies"". ""The surgeons involved have used this apparent loophole of compassionate use to actually experiment on patients and then they've used the data that they've obtained to go to the regulatory authorities to get permission for the trials,"" Trish Murray says. John Rasko agrees with Trish Murray that this is not how the system should work. ""Exercising the option of compassionate use brings with it great responsibility. It shouldn't be used as a way that doctors can fly under the radar of properly undertaken regulated medical practice,"" he says. And Great Ormond Street agrees too. ""We do not see compassionate use as a way of testing novel treatments,"" a spokesperson said. But Shauna's transplant, and those of other patients, were used to obtain funding and approval for clinical trials, as well as being written about in medical journals and an application to the European Medicines Agency. The BBC has found that at least seven of these documents and publications misrepresent Shauna's treatment or death in some way. For example, in one 2016 application to the European Medicines Agency, Martin Birchall is cited as saying Shauna's initial surgery was successful but she suffered a ""fatal cardiovascular event six weeks following surgery"" - whereas in fact she died after two weeks, because her trachea had collapsed. By the time the clinical trial to test the tissue-engineered trachea transplants was approved and funded by public bodies, a change had been made to the procedure. Having learned from what happened to Shauna, the team would make sure patients in the trial had a stent. And even then, the approved patient information sheets accompanying one of the trials contained erroneous information about Shauna and indeed about Claudia Castillo. Only they and Ciaran Finn-Lynch were included in the information sheet - despite the team knowing about at least 10 cases worldwide. As early as 2014, Martin Elliott had told a conference 10 patients had received a tissue-engineered trachea, all of whom had died apart from Claudia and Ciaran. Last year, the clinical trials were suspended. UCL says no-one had been recruited to participate. Much of what the BBC has uncovered about what happened to Shauna does not appear in UCL's special inquiry report. Leonid Schneider is a molecular-cell-biologist-turned-journalist who has been covering regenerative medicine since 2016. He was called to give evidence at UCL's inquiry and is damning in his appraisal of their report. ""Why didn't Shauna's mother have the full information? And whose idea it was not to give her a stent?"" he asks. ""Finally, how could UCL investigators recommend the donor trachea clinical trials to resume, after Prof Delaere and myself told them how many people have died of it?"" he adds. UCL says that clinical care was ""beyond the scope of the inquiry"". It adds: ""Any research undertaken at UCL is required to conform to the highest legal, ethical and regulatory standards, and we will not hesitate to take the necessary action, if and when this falls short."" After receiving ethical advice, I told Karen what the BBC had found out about tissue-engineered transplants. She was upset. She said this might have changed her decision about allowing Shauna's operation to go ahead. This video can not be played 'I hope nobody else has to go through what Iâve gone through' ""I hope that nobody else has to go through what I've gone through, I really do. They should be stopped. That is such a shock. People ask me, 'How did Shauna die?' And I always say, heart attack. I've never once blamed those surgeons for her death. They have a lot to account for."" GOSH said: ""Before Shauna's operation was carried out a comprehensive review was conducted of all the relevant published scientific and medical evidence."" They also said: ""We are sorry the treatment did not work for Shauna and the family feel they did not receive all relevant information. We are contacting Shauna's family to offer to meet them to talk through any concerns."" ""It's taken them all this time, but you'd think they would have phoned me and said something to me,"" says Karen Davison. ""I know I wouldn't have had her forever, but at least I might have had her for a bit longer.""

Judges do not recommend Finucane inquiry,"Pat Finucane, a 39-year-old Belfast solicitor, was shot dead in front of his wife and children The Supreme Court has ruled that investigations into the murder of the Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane have not been effective. Mr Finucane was shot by loyalist paramilitaries in front of his young family at their home in February 1989. His widow Geraldine Finucane challenged ex-prime minister David Cameron over hisrefusal to hold a public inquiry. The court said she had not shown that decision ""was made in bad faith"" and did not recommend a public inquiry. However it added that none of the previous inquiries into his death have been capable of establishing the full facts surrounding the killing. Read the Supreme Court's full judgement,external Supreme Court urged to quash inquiry decision 'Shocking state collusion' says PM The Finucane family gathered outside the Supreme Court, describing the ruling as a ""win"" The court ruled that there has not been an ""Article 2 compliant inquiry"" into the death. Article 2 refers to an individual's right to life under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Supreme Court justice Lord Kerr said: ""There has not been an Article 2 compliant inquiry into the death of Patrick Finucane. This video can not be played Pat Finucane: Widow says family 'vindicated' by Supreme Court ""It does not follow that a public inquiry of the type which the appellant seeks must be ordered."" ""It is for the state to decide, in light of the incapacity of Sir Desmond de Silva's review and the inquiries which preceded it to meet the procedural requirement of Article 2, what form of investigation, if indeed any is now feasible, is required in order to meet that requirement."" The Finucane family said the court had ""vindicated"" Mrs Finucane in her ""relentless campaign for justice"". Following the Supreme Court ruling, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said that a public inquiry must be established. TheIrish government has consistently called for a public inquiry into Mr Finucane's murder. Judges also said a previous undertaking given to Mrs Finucane for an inquiry was ""clear and unambiguous"". She had a ""legitimate expectation"" a public inquiry would be held into his death, they said. Geraldine Finucane has been involved in a long-running legal battle Mr Finucane was shot by loyalist paramilitaries in front of his young family at their home in Belfast in February 1989. He was a high-profile solicitor who lived and worked in Belfast and convicted members of the IRA were among his clients. The judges said that none of the inquiries into Mr Finucane's death, including the review carried out by Sir Desmond de Silva, had the capability ""of establishing all the salient facts"" about his killing or the liability of those who were responsible for his death. What is a public inquiry and why are they held? Public inquiries are set up to uncover the truth following scandals or perceived injustices. The test that must be satisfied in order to hold an inquiry is that it is of""public concern"".,external While often chaired by a judge, a public inquiry is not a court of law and cannot determine liability. The aim is that public inquiries are independent. The government decides whether to hold an inquiry in the first place, appoints its head, and has to agree what it is going to cover. Inquiries can then make recommendations about how things should change but governments do not have to accept them. An example of a public inquiry is the inquiry into the GP and serial killer Harold Shipman,chaired by Dame Janet Smith - a High Court judge. The judges added that Mrs Finucane had not shown that the government's decision against holding a public inquiry ""was made in bad faith or that it was not based on genuine policy grounds"". In 2011, the family met with then prime minister David Cameron. Mr Cameron failed to order a public inquiry but instead proposed a review conducted by a leading QC. In his 2012 review, Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Mr Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught. However, his report concludedthere had been ""no overarching state conspiracy"". Mr Finucane's family argued that the report left many questions unanswered. Reacting to Wednesday's judgement, the family thanked the Supreme Court justices for their ""careful and respectful"" consideration of the case. Giving a statement outside the Supreme Court in London after the ruling, Geraldine Finucane said it was a ""historic moment"". She added: ""The British government now knows that it cannot conceal the truth any longer. They have now been told this by the highest court in the land. ""It is time for the murder of Pat Finucane to be properly and publicly investigated in a public inquiry. Nothing less will suffice."" Allow Twitter content?

Peter Madden, of Madden & Finucane said that ""only a judicial public inquiry can deliver the objective, which is to uncover the truth of what actually happened"". They claim that an inquiry is the only way to establish the truth about what happened and to hold those responsible to account. Last June,Barry MacDonald QC told the five Supreme Court judgesthat the government had reneged on a promise to the Fincuane family to hold an inquiry. He told the judges the case was about the responsibility of the judiciary in the face of what he called a direct attack on the legal system. In February 2017, the Court of Appeal in Belfast dismissed an appeal against the decision not to hold a public inquiry, ruling that the government had acted lawfully.

'Apocalyptic' moorland blaze put out,"This video can not be played The fire could be seen for miles around Fire crews have extinguished a huge blaze on moorland in West Yorkshire. The fire, described by one witness as ""apocalyptic"", started at about 19:30 GMT on Tuesday and covered about 1.5 sq km of land near Marsden. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it was ""one of the biggest moorland fires we've ever had to deal with"". It came as the UK broke the record for the warmest winter day for a second time and on the same day as a gorse fire on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. Following a night spent tackling the blaze, near Saddleworth Moor between Huddersfield and Manchester, a fire service spokesperson said: ""The fire now looks to be out."" However, they said crews and specialist moorland firefighting units ""will remain at the scene for much of the day to tackle any further hot spots"". At its height, more than 35 firefighters were in attendance at the National Trust property and the A62 between Colne Valley and Diggle was closed as a precaution. Station manager Adam Greenwood said when crews arrived about 4 sq km of moorland was ablaze. ""It was one of the highest flame fronts we have seen, with flames of up to two metres high, and it was moving fast across the moorland,"" he said. ""The fire looks to be out however moorland fires can easily reignite so it's important that we monitor it closely. ""We expect to be at the moors for much of the day."" There have been no reports of any injuries. People living near to the scene have been advised to stay indoors and keep their doors and windows closed. But the fire service said ""risks to health are low"". BBC Yorkshire climate correspondent Paul Hudson said that, like much of the UK, the region had faced unseasonal winter temperatures. He said: ""These kind of temperatures, 18C or 19C, are what you would normally see in early June. ""There's been a prolonged abnormally warm spell and we've also had an exceptionally dry start to 2019. ""The temperature on Wednesday is also set to be pretty similar."" Pictures capture dramatic moorland fire Latest updates on moorland fire Why are there UK wildfires in February? Station commander Tony Pearson said moor fires in February were ""very unusual but not unheard of"". He said: ""We've had a few dry days and it's dried the land out a little bit."" He described the location as ""horrendous"" as it took firefighters an hour to get there due to the terrain. Mr Pearson said: ""It was really uneven ground, really difficult working conditions on there. Mike Elliot, from the National Trust, said the heather on the moorland had only just re-established itself after a blaze about three years ago. He said: ""It's gradually got back to its normal self, but unfortunately it's going to have to start again. ""What we're doing here is trying to stabilise the moorland with all the heather as that keeps all the peat out of the watercourse."" The Edinburgh gorse fire broke out at a similar time on Tuesday, andtwo large fires started within an hour of each otherin the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex earlier. In June and July last year, firefighters from 20 different brigades were drafted in to help tackle two huge moorland fires which burnt for several weeks. Firefighters spent more than a month battling a huge fire covering 18 sq km (6.9 sq miles) at Winter Hill, near Bolton. The Army was drafted in to help Greater Manchester crews deal with a blaze on Saddleworth Moor in Tameside. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Calls to suspend MP in anti-Semitism row,"This video can not be played Theresa May said Jeremy Corbyn should suspend Chris Williamson A Labour MP is to be investigated for remarks about the party's handling of anti-Semitism but will not be suspended amid a deepening row within the party.

""I was trying to suggest how much the party has done to tackle anti-Semitism. ""Our movement can never be too apologetic about racism in our ranks.

Deadly fire erupts at Cairo's main station,"This video can not be played A train collided with a buffer stop and burst into flames next to a busy platform At least 20 people have been killed and 40 injured after a train crash sparked a large fire at Cairo's main railway station, Egyptian officials say. The train hit a buffer stop near the end of a busy platform at Ramses Station, which is in the city centre. The collision caused the train's fuel tank to explode, setting the platform and nearby buildings alight. The cause of the crash is not yet clear, but only hours later Transport Minister Hisham Arafat resigned. Witnesses described seeing several severely burned bodies in the latest disaster to hit Egypt's rundown railways. Egypt country profile State-run media earlier reported a higher death toll of at least 25 and as many as 50 injured. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi extended his condolences to the families of the victims During a visit to the scene, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli vowed to severely punish anyone who was found to have been negligent. ""We will identify who is responsible for the accident and they will be held accountable,"" he said. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi extended his condolences to the families of those who died and pledged to ensure that the injured received the support they needed. A platform kiosk was engulfed by fire Local media published what they said wasCCTV footage showing people on the busy platform as the train hits the buffer at high speed and explodes,external. Another video, taken from a CCTV camera above a nearby subway staircase, appears to showpeople fleeing as a fireball engulfs the platform,external. ""I saw a man pointing from the locomotive as it entered the platform, and screaming 'There are no brakes! There are no brakes!', before he jumped out of the locomotive,"" witness Ibrahim Hussein told Reuters news agency. ""I don't know what happened to him."" The train's fuel tank exploded after the crash ""I removed nearly 20 bodies, and carried them to the ambulance, all of them completely burned,"" Ahmed Mahmoud told news agency AFP. ""[The train] should have slowed down as it was about to enter the station, but it came in too fast."" The privately owned news website al-Shorouk cited a source as saying the train had been undergoing maintenance when it started moving at speed towards the station's main building without a conductor. The source added that this was not the first incident of its kind, explaining that there had been two other cases of a train moving without a conductor that had not resulted in any deaths or injuries. People gathered outside Ramses Station after the crash Egypt's railway system has a poor safety record, which many observers blame on a lack of investment by successive governments and poor management. In August 2017, 43 people were killed and more than 100 injured whentwo passenger trains collided outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. The country's deadliest rail accident occurred south of Cairo in 2002, whena fire ripped through an overcrowded passenger train,external, killing more than 370 people.

'Unchartered waters',"Indians celebrated on hearing news of the strikes ""We are in uncharted waters,"" says Husain Haqqani, alluding to the latest round of heightened hostilities between India and Pakistan. The former Pakistani ambassador to the US served as an adviser to three Pakistani prime ministers. He is the author, most recently, of Reimagining Pakistan: Transforming a Dysfunctional Nuclear State. After Tuesday's air strikes by India targeting militants in Pakistani territory, Pakistan promised to respond ""at the time and place of its choosing"". Viewpoint: Balakot air strikes raise stakes in stand-off Less than 24 hours later, Pakistan said it had launched air strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Pakistan and Indian-controlled Kashmir. It also claimed to have shot down two Indian Air Force jets in its airspace in Kashmir and arrested two pilots on the ground. India has shut down parts of its airspace in the north of the country. Many believe that the Pakistani strike could be seen as a tit-for-tat - it, like India, feels the need to placate its domestic constituency. But the challenge now is to contain the escalation of hostilities before things get completely out of control. For one, Tuesday's air strikes by India were completely unexpected. They are the first launched across the LoC  - the de facto border that divides Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971. ""Pakistani military establishment had banked on India's reluctance to escalate in using asymmetrical warfare (terrorism) under the nuclear umbrella,"" Professor Haqqani told me. Indian warplanes crossed the Line of Control and struck targets in Pakistan on Tuesday ""India feels it has found a soft spot where it can strike - whether on ground using special forces as in 2016 or using air strikes as they have done now - without crossing that threshold."" Professor Haqqani says Pakistan ""does not want war with India but its military faces a credibility challenge"". ""It does not want to shut all jihadi groups. But the jihadis' presence is a constant source of problems. In 2011 the Americans entered Pakistani air space to get Osama Bin Laden. Now the Indians entered Pakistani air space, dropped bombs and returned home without resistance. ""How will the Pakistani military explain itself to a public that accepts a huge military budget on the grounds of its military's ability to defend Pakistani sovereignty?"" Why is Twitter's Jack Dorsey wanted in India? How India's single time zone is hurting its people Indian election 2019: Are fears of a mass hack credible? The Indian journalist jailed for a year for Facebook posts Daniel Markey, a senior professor at Johns Hopkins University in the US, says the problem is that ""most military solutions to the Pakistan problem at India's disposal are far, far more costly to India than they are likely to bring about the desired end state"". ""Everyone in Delhi knows this. The goal now is to introduce a higher level of punishment for each instance of Pakistani aggression. It's not a bad strategy, as long as each move is calculated carefully and there aren't too many mistakes. ""For instance, in this episode, some reports suggest that Indian aircraft had intended to fire from the Indian side of the LoC, but wind forced them into Pakistani territory. If true, that's the sort of unintended element of escalation that introduces new risk at each step."" Daniel Markey believes the escalation is more serious than one anticipated - ""moving the conflict into Pakistan 'proper' was intended to be a muscular and different move, one that most recent Indian prime ministers would have been reluctant to take"". So is there a real threat of a nuclear conflict? ""Sadly, there is always a real threat of nuclear escalation between India and Pakistan, but we are several steps from that at this moment. Aside from accidental or unauthorised use (both unlikely), we would need to see a significant conventional escalation in this conflict before nuclear use looks likely,"" says Dr Markey. ""But these escalations are possible, especially if Pakistan's next step were to raise the stakes by hitting Indian civilian targets."" That is highly unlikely - but the question for the countries now is can they find a way of stepping back from their most dangerous flashpoint in decades?

Wonga causing damage 'from beyond the grave',"Wonga sponsored Newcastle United during more successful times for the lender The finances of 10,500 borrowers are being ""damaged from beyond the grave"" by collapsed payday lender Wonga, according to a committee of MPs. Wonga fell into administration in August last year, with these customers awaiting ombudsman rulings on whether they were mis-sold loans. Many have given up hope of redress, and the Treasury Committee said their cases had been ""cast aside"". Wonga blamed a surge in compensation claims, in part, for its collapse. Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone? Wonga collapses into administration These 10,500 Wonga borrowers had lodged complaints about previous payday loans being mis-sold due, in many cases, to their vulnerability and inability to repay. They included Ashley, from Bristol, who used Wonga and other payday lenders to fund a gambling addiction - and to pay bills after his income had been frittered away - when he was younger. Ashley, who is now debt-free, started borrowing about Â£100 a month, before the debt grew to Â£400 to Â£800 each month The Financial Ombudsman upheld his complaint and deemed more than 40 of the loans to be irresponsible, but the ruling came at the time of Wonga's collapse. ""I received a standard email from the administrators, saying the likelihood would be not receiving the full amount [of compensation]. I've actually given up on it,"" he said. ""It is a moral thing that they should pay."" Compensation for mis-sold loans should cover refunds, including interest and charges. However, when Wonga collapsed, the Financial Ombudsman stopped investigating these cases, owing to the distant prospect of recovering any compensation. Unlike savings, which are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) when a provider goes bust, there is no such safety net if short-term credit firms fail while owing money such as compensation. Those with genuine claims, such as Ashley, join the queue of creditors who may receive a fraction of the value of any company assets that can be sold by the administrators. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee, said: ""It cannot be right that over 10,000 people who may have been mis-sold loans are just cast aside, especially as many will be vulnerable consumers. ""These people have been left to fend for themselves by Wonga, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Financial Ombudsman Service. They have been allowed to fall through the cracks with nobody taking responsibility for their mistreatment. ""If Wonga continues to damage people's finances from beyond the grave, it may be time for the government to intervene."" Andrew Bailey, head of the regulator - the FCA - said in a letter to Ms Morgan that, unlike savings providers, these short-term lenders did not hold clients' money or assets so it would not be ""proportionate"" or affordable for the FSCS safety net to cover the collapse of such lenders as well. Former borrower Ashley disagrees, arguing that there should be some kind of stronger back-up in place. Wonga's demise in the UK followed a surge in compensation claims from claims management companies acting on behalf of people who felt they should never have been given these loans. The Treasury Committee is now asking Wonga's administrators for more detail on how outstanding complaints against the payday lender could be progressed. An answer has been requested by early March. Wonga prepares for 'orderly wind down' Wonga: Will my debt be written off? Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone?

'Apocalyptic' moorland blaze extinguished,"This video can not be played The fire could be seen for miles around Fire crews have extinguished a huge blaze on moorland in West Yorkshire. The fire, described by one witness as ""apocalyptic"", started at about 19:30 GMT on Tuesday and covered about 1.5 sq km of land near Marsden. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it was ""one of the biggest moorland fires we've ever had to deal with"". It came as the UK broke the record for the warmest winter day for a second time and on the same day as a gorse fire on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. Following a night spent tackling the blaze, near Saddleworth Moor between Huddersfield and Manchester, a fire service spokesperson said: ""The fire now looks to be out."" However, they said crews and specialist moorland firefighting units ""will remain at the scene for much of the day to tackle any further hot spots"". At its height, more than 35 firefighters were in attendance at the National Trust property and the A62 between Colne Valley and Diggle was closed as a precaution. Station manager Adam Greenwood said when crews arrived about 4 sq km of moorland was ablaze. ""It was one of the highest flame fronts we have seen, with flames of up to two metres high, and it was moving fast across the moorland,"" he said. ""The fire looks to be out however moorland fires can easily reignite so it's important that we monitor it closely. ""We expect to be at the moors for much of the day."" There have been no reports of any injuries. People living near to the scene have been advised to stay indoors and keep their doors and windows closed. But the fire service said ""risks to health are low"". BBC Yorkshire climate correspondent Paul Hudson said that, like much of the UK, the region had faced unseasonal winter temperatures. He said: ""These kind of temperatures, 18C or 19C, are what you would normally see in early June. ""There's been a prolonged abnormally warm spell and we've also had an exceptionally dry start to 2019. ""The temperature on Wednesday is also set to be pretty similar."" Pictures capture dramatic moorland fire Latest updates on moorland fire Why are there UK wildfires in February? Station commander Tony Pearson said moor fires in February were ""very unusual but not unheard of"". He said: ""We've had a few dry days and it's dried the land out a little bit."" He described the location as ""horrendous"" as it took firefighters an hour to get there due to the terrain. Mr Pearson said: ""It was really uneven ground, really difficult working conditions on there. Mike Elliot, from the National Trust, said the heather on the moorland had only just re-established itself after a blaze about three years ago. He said: ""It's gradually got back to its normal self, but unfortunately it's going to have to start again. ""What we're doing here is trying to stabilise the moorland with all the heather as that keeps all the peat out of the watercourse."" The Edinburgh gorse fire broke out at a similar time on Tuesday, andtwo large fires started within an hour of each otherin the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex earlier. In June and July last year, firefighters from 20 different brigades were drafted in to help tackle two huge moorland fires which burnt for several weeks. Firefighters spent more than a month battling a huge fire covering 18 sq km (6.9 sq miles) at Winter Hill, near Bolton. The Army was drafted in to help Greater Manchester crews deal with a blaze on Saddleworth Moor in Tameside. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Was Shauna the victim of rush to develop stem cell technology?British teenager Shauna Davison died two weeks after an experimental transplant.,"British teenager Shauna Davison was given an experimental transplant in 2012, in the hope of prolonging her life. Her mother says she was told in advance about two patients who had survived a similar operation - but not about others who had died. The BBC's Deborah Cohen asks whether Shauna, who died after two weeks, was a casualty of the rush to develop stem cell technology? Shauna Davison was born with one lung, a cleft palate and a major heart defect. But despite spending her life in and out of hospital she remained a happy child. ""Her illness never got her down and she always had a smile on her face,"" says Shauna's mother, Karen Davison. ""Everyone was so nice to her. They looked beyond her problems."" When she was 12 weeks old, doctors found problems with her trachea - or windpipe. It was very narrow and when it became obstructed, she couldn't breathe. She was given 48 hours to live. Karen Davison: ""She was a cheeky child but loved by everybody"" A surgeon in Leeds came to the rescue. David Crabbe warned that it might not work, but he managed to rebuild Shauna's windpipe out of her ribs. Shauna had to stay in hospital for six months and had ring-shaped stents put in her windpipe to keep it open. Mr Crabbe was really caring, Karen Davison says. ""The hospital was outstanding."" Over the years, Shauna's stents needed dilating as she grew bigger. She had a tracheostomy  - an opening in the front of her neck - to help her breathe. ""There were times we didn't think she'd make it because she kept collapsing,"" Karen Davison says. This story takes about 15 minutes to read You can also watch Deborah Cohen'sreport for Newsnight here,external At home in Middlesbrough, she learned how to change Shauna's tracheostomy tube, use a ventilator, do physiotherapy to help her clear her airway, suction her airway, do CPR, and give her intravenous antibiotics. ""I did everything for her,"" she says. ""Shauna coped marvellously. But she didn't know any different."" An avid Middlesbrough Football Club fan, Shauna loved wearing a football kit. She went to a mainstream school, with the support of a carer, where she could mix with other children. ""She was a cheeky child, but loved by everybody,"" her mother says. ""She brightened everyone's day."" Shauna had many operations but she'd always come through. At times, she didn't go near a hospital for ages, Karen says. A time came, however, when David Crabbe told her that his technique for treating Shauna was no longer going to be sufficient. Her airway was too small and they would have to look for other options. ""Mr Crabbe showed me pictures of a normal airway and her airway. It was tiny,"" Karen Davison says. Shauna started to go to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London for tests and to have her stent changed. In 2011, doctors there told her the airway wouldn't last much longer. At 15, Shauna suffered a respiratory arrest - a serious incident in which she became unable to breathe - and the family was told about pioneering surgery by Prof Martin Elliott, a cardiothoracic surgeon and former medical director of Great Ormond Street Hospital. ""They said there'd been some research into tracheal transplants and there'd been two other cases where it'd been done, but they couldn't discuss them with me because of patient confidentiality,"" Karen Davison says. One of them was a 10-year-old boy, she adds. ""It would be the only chance she'd have."" Shauna's transplant wasn't a conventional one. She would receive a donor windpipe, but it would be laced with her own stem cells, making it almost like her own. She wouldn't need drugs to stop her body rejecting it. It was at the forefront of the new stem cell technology - and still very experimental. Doctors can use experimental treatments if someone is terminally ill and there is no alternative treatment. It's called ""compassionate use"". Karen says she was told Shauna wouldn't need a tracheostomy or a ventilator and she'd lead a normal life. But she was told about risks too, she adds - Shauna might still reject the transplant, and having a general anaesthetic is never risk-free. Martin Elliott had previously worked closely with the internationally renowned Martin Birchall, professor of ENT at University College London (UCL), on implanting a stem-cell-laced donor trachea in another child. They would work together again in Shauna's case. Shauna was being treated at Great Ormond Street at the time of a BBC documentary about the hospital in 2012. She was assessed by different specialists and asked what her hopes for the future were. Shauna told respiratory consultant Dr Martin Wallis she wanted to be able to go swimming. It was not an easy decision to have the operation. In Martin Wallis's words, it was not a situation where there was nothing to lose. ""They've got quite a bit to lose. And this is going to make for a difficult decision,"" he said. ""She's got a reasonable quality of life, she's got her good friend, she clearly has a sense of humour and is enjoying herself - it makes it harder."" ""I wanted her to have it done while she was well rather than wait until she was unwell and it might not happen,"" Karen Davison says. But because it was such an experimental procedure, her medical team discussed it with the Great Ormond Street Hospital ethics committee. ""I don't think she will die if we do the procedure. We're trying to do the procedure so that she doesn't. Or at least we prolong her life and her quality of life for as long as possible,"" the surgeon, Martin Elliott, tells the committee on camera. ""They couldn't give me a time when she'd die but they said she will die eventually. Because her airway would just give up. So there was this procedure they said they were willing to do,"" Karen Davison says. ""Like any other parent, if you thought this was going to help your child live, I agreed to it."" So in February 2012, Shauna was given a transplant of a donor trachea newly populated with her own stem cells. Shauna's transplant operation was filmed by the BBC Initially, everything seemed to go well. ""For the first couple of days she was marvellous,"" her mother recalls. ""I couldn't believe how well she recovered after it."" Two weeks after her operation Shauna was moved from Great Ormond Street by ambulance to a hospital in Leeds. But during the transfer Shauna started to cough a lot and was in need of suction to clear her throat. ""We thought that was strange, but thought it might have been due to the journey,"" Karen Davison says. ""I just thought, 'Another couple of weeks and we'll be home.'"" But the next morning, Shauna took a turn for the worse. ""Her chest was pulling in,"" Karen says. She remembers Shauna saying, ""Help me, help me."" ""It was the worst day of my life because I couldn't help her."" Shauna's new trachea had collapsed. ""They said she'd struggled that much to breathe, her heart had given up,"" Karen Davison says. ""She was a wonderful child. I miss her so much."" When the first transplant using a donated windpipe coated with the patient's own stem cells was carried out in 2008 it made global headlines. It was thought that stripping the donor's cells from the surface of the trachea and seeding it with the patient's own stem cells created a new organ that would be like the patient's own tissue. No anti-rejection drugs would be needed for the ""tissue-engineered"" trachea. The operation was carried out by Italian surgeon Paolo Macchiarini with the help of Martin Birchall, then a surgeon at Bristol University. The recipient was 30-year-old Claudia Castillo, who had tuberculosis in part of her windpipe that leads to the lungs - the bronchus. Her case was written up in The Lancet. Five months after she'd had her operation, she was reported to be in perfect health. Martin Birchall, who had helped to prepare the donor trachea, said at the time that it would ""represent a huge step change in surgery,external. Surgeons can now start to see and understand the potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients with serious diseases."" Many around the world agreed. It was a ""milestone in medicine,external"", ""unadulterated good news"" and ""a textbook example of international collaboration,external"". ""It was seen as revolutionary, as highly innovativeâ¦ opening the door for new and exciting tech using a marriage between stem cells and artificial scaffolds that could bring forth this entirely new field of regenerative medicine,"" recalls Prof John Rasko, of the University of Sydney Faculty of Health Sciences. It had ""the whiff of a Nobel Prize about it,"" he says. Indeed, soon the university that hands out the Nobel Prize for medicine, Stockholm's prestigious Karolinska Institute, offered Macchiarini a post. Birchall, for his part, moved to University College London (UCL), where Macchiarini was also made an honorary professor. Claudia Castillo's operation served as a template and soon others had similar procedures. In 2010, Professor Birchall told a conference ""we have done a further five adults"". Apart from Shauna, UK patients given a tissue-engineered trachea include 19-year-old Keziah Shorten and 10-year-old Ciaran Finn-Lynch. Shauna's surgeon, Martin Elliott, led the transplant team that performed Ciaran's operation, with the help of Macchiarini and Birchall. Like Claudia Castillo, his procedure was published in a medical journal and it garnered global headlines. Martin Birchall told journalists: ""He is left with a healthy organ there, made from his own stem cells, and that in a way is a kind of miracle."" But soon questions started to be asked about the stem-cell-laced tracheas. For Macchiarini, this meant his meteoric rise was mirrored by a rapid fall from grace. He had switched from using donated tracheas to plastic ones, also laced with stem cells. The results were disastrous - his patients died. Macchiarini was investigated several times by Karolinska before he was fired. Allegations made against him were initially dismissed but the institute has since found himguilty of scientific misconduct,externaland many of his scientific papers have been retracted. Swedish prosecutorsreopened a criminal negligence investigation,externalagainst him in December last year. He has previously denied any negligence. The director of the Swedish Public Prosecution, Mikael Bjork, announces the reopening of a criminal negligence investigation into Paolo Macchiarini in December 2018 Bo Risberg, professor emeritus of surgery at the University of Gothenberg and a former chairman of the Swedish Ethics Council has said the events amount to the biggest research scandal Sweden has experienced in modern times. ""Everything was swept under the carpet,"" he said. Macchiarini's failure to do pre-clinical tests on animals using the plastic tracheas was ""the worst crime you can commit"", he added. One of Macchiarini's early critics was Pierre Delaere, professor of ENT at University Hospital Leuven in Belgium, who has argued that it is ""impossible from a theoretical point of view"" to establish a new blood supply to a tissue-engineered trachea, whether plastic or donated. In 2015, he wrote to UCL casting doubt on the idea of ""tracheal regeneration"", calling it ""the biggest lie in medical history"". By this time Macchiarini had left UCL. Paolo Macchiarini operating In its subsequent unpublished report into Delaere's claims, seen by the BBC, UCL cast doubt on the suggestion that stem cells ""played any therapeutic role"" in Ciaran's operation. But, it said, there was no ""deliberate fraud"" or ""intent to mislead"" on Martin Birchall's part. Because of the ""lack of intent to deceive"" the university recommended education and training rather than other formal procedures. Meanwhile, the university was gearing up to conduct clinical trials into stem-cell-regenerated tracheas and larynxes - called Inspire and RegenVox respectively. Martin Birchall was principal investigator with responsibility for leading the trials. He and his team would bring in millions of pounds of research funding to the university. It wasn't the only time UCL produced a report into regenerative medicine at the university. In 2017, it published the findings of a special inquiry, set up after the Macchiarini revelations. This found no fault with Martin Birchall and cleared the way for future clinical trials to proceed. It said that, when asked, Shauna's family ""were grateful for the opportunity that her daughter received and held no rancour with the tracheal team at GOSH"". UCL told the BBC this was ""reported to the inquiry by the clinicians involved in the care of Shauna Davison"". But Shauna's mother, Karen Davison, says no-one connected to the inquiry had ever asked for her views. The more I have looked into Shauna Davison's story the more I have discovered that Karen Davison did not know. The two patients Karen and Shauna heard about were the 10-year-old boy, Ciaran Finn-Lynch, and Claudia Castillo, both of whom are still alive. But they weren't told that Claudia Castillo's windpipe transplant collapsed just over three weeks after she'd had it and she needed stents to keep it open. (She's since had to have a lung removed.) Nor did Karen and Shauna hear about most of the other cases Martin Birchall talked about in 2010. One of these operations was on Kent teenager Keziah Shorten, who about two years previously had been given a tissue-engineered donor trachea by Macchiarini in Florence, after she had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. But around a year after the operation, her transplant failed. Martin Birchall told a Swedish documentary in 2016 that her tissue-engineered windpipe had broken down. When she was subsequently operated on at University College London Hospital they replaced it with a plastic one. She died a month before Shauna's operation. According to John Rasko there is a ""strong obligation to give a full and frank account of all the information that's available. Exceptionalism and excluding bad cases is really something that is not acceptable."" A spokesperson for GOSH said: ""As a patient, Keziah's condition and her graft were very different to Shauna, so it was not clinically relevant to discuss her case."" The hospital added that the other patients were not discussed ""because the team did not know of other relevant cases from overseas at this time"". There was more that Karen and Shauna did not know. They did hear about Ciaran Finn-Lynch. But there were key differences between Shauna's operation and his. Ciaran had received a stent - but Shauna didn't. According to the 2017 UCL inquiry report, Martin Elliott said that he had wanted to use a stent but was advised not to. Ciaran had also received a fresh donor trachea. Shauna's wasn't fresh. It had been frozen and then thawed. It was a treatment that hadn't been used before - after the trachea had been thawed, the donor's cells had been removed using a special vacuum technique exclusive to members of Shauna's medical team. Martin Birchall is cited as saying that Shauna's initial surgery was successful, in a letter to the European Medicines Agency Trish Murray, professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at Liverpool University, has a number of criticisms. ""The reality is that if you don't have a stent, the trachea will collapse, that's been the unanimous experience of all patients who've experienced trachea transplantation,"" she says. ""So although it's well-known that stents cause problems, if you don't have a stent, then the trachea will collapse and the patient will suffocate."" Another issue was the frozen trachea. For the team it made perfect sense to freeze a trachea, as the trachea could be stored up in advance and thawed when needed. But Trish Murray is critical of this decision too. ""Ciaran's trachea was not frozen beforehand whereas Shauna's was freeze-thawed and we know from papers that the group themselves have published that that would weaken the trachea... and that would make it more likely to collapse after it had been implanted,"" she says. However, UCL questions the relevance of these studies. It has told the BBC that they do not refer to the technique used on Shauna. Trish Murray says other worrying studies should have rung alarm bells. She points to an unpublished study looking at the vacuum technique, which shows that one pig that received a transplant died spontaneously and another developed ""respiratory compromise"" and had to be put down. The study was stopped on humane grounds. ""We know from information that's been obtained from FOI requests that the team in UCL have tried the technique on two pigs and both pigs died quite quickly. We also know that they've tried it on rabbits and there was 100% mortality in the rabbits as well,"" she says. The BBC asked UCL and Great Ormond Street whether the animal studies were done before or after Shauna's operation, but received no reply to this question. And like Belgian ENT professor Pierre Delaere, Trish Murray questions the role the stem cells played. ""There's actually no evidence that any of those cells survive, in fact quite a lot of evidence that they don't survive,"" she says. But how were doctors and scientists involved in the care of seriously ill patients able to use these tracheas when there was little evidence that they worked? Usually, researchers have to test their innovation in the lab and then on animals in preclinical research. Only then - with formal approval from a research ethics committee and the regulators - does it move into humans. Martin Birchall, however, wrote in the Lancet that ""compassionate studies"", the procedure for using new treatments on very ill patients, were ""powerful ways to inform robustly designed formal trials"" and would ""expedite the testing of novel therapies"". ""The surgeons involved have used this apparent loophole of compassionate use to actually experiment on patients and then they've used the data that they've obtained to go to the regulatory authorities to get permission for the trials,"" Trish Murray says. John Rasko agrees with Trish Murray that this is not how the system should work. ""Exercising the option of compassionate use brings with it great responsibility. It shouldn't be used as a way that doctors can fly under the radar of properly undertaken regulated medical practice,"" he says. And Great Ormond Street agrees too. ""We do not see compassionate use as a way of testing novel treatments,"" a spokesperson said. But Shauna's transplant, and those of other patients, were used to obtain funding and approval for clinical trials, as well as being written about in medical journals and an application to the European Medicines Agency. The BBC has found that at least seven of these documents and publications misrepresent Shauna's treatment or death in some way. For example, in one 2016 application to the European Medicines Agency, Martin Birchall is cited as saying Shauna's initial surgery was successful but she suffered a ""fatal cardiovascular event six weeks following surgery"" - whereas in fact she died after two weeks, because her trachea had collapsed. By the time the clinical trial to test the tissue-engineered trachea transplants was approved and funded by public bodies, a change had been made to the procedure. Having learned from what happened to Shauna, the team would make sure patients in the trial had a stent. And even then, the approved patient information sheets accompanying one of the trials contained erroneous information about Shauna and indeed about Claudia Castillo. Only they and Ciaran Finn-Lynch were included in the information sheet - despite the team knowing about at least 10 cases worldwide. As early as 2014, Martin Elliott had told a conference 10 patients had received a tissue-engineered trachea, all of whom had died apart from Claudia and Ciaran. Last year, the clinical trials were suspended. UCL says no-one had been recruited to participate. Much of what the BBC has uncovered about what happened to Shauna does not appear in UCL's special inquiry report. Leonid Schneider is a molecular-cell-biologist-turned-journalist who has been covering regenerative medicine since 2016. He was called to give evidence at UCL's inquiry and is damning in his appraisal of their report. ""Why didn't Shauna's mother have the full information? And whose idea it was not to give her a stent?"" he asks. ""Finally, how could UCL investigators recommend the donor trachea clinical trials to resume, after Prof Delaere and myself told them how many people have died of it?"" he adds. UCL says that clinical care was ""beyond the scope of the inquiry"". It adds: ""Any research undertaken at UCL is required to conform to the highest legal, ethical and regulatory standards, and we will not hesitate to take the necessary action, if and when this falls short."" After receiving ethical advice, I told Karen what the BBC had found out about tissue-engineered transplants. She was upset. She said this might have changed her decision about allowing Shauna's operation to go ahead. This video can not be played 'I hope nobody else has to go through what Iâve gone through' ""I hope that nobody else has to go through what I've gone through, I really do. They should be stopped. That is such a shock. People ask me, 'How did Shauna die?' And I always say, heart attack. I've never once blamed those surgeons for her death. They have a lot to account for."" GOSH said: ""Before Shauna's operation was carried out a comprehensive review was conducted of all the relevant published scientific and medical evidence."" They also said: ""We are sorry the treatment did not work for Shauna and the family feel they did not receive all relevant information. We are contacting Shauna's family to offer to meet them to talk through any concerns."" ""It's taken them all this time, but you'd think they would have phoned me and said something to me,"" says Karen Davison. ""I know I wouldn't have had her forever, but at least I might have had her for a bit longer.""

You can still get all the latest updates on this developing story on theBBC News website. More analysis and background can be found here: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spoken separately with foreign ministers of India and Pakistan, urging them to
avoid ""further military activity"". ""I expressed to both ministers that we encourage India and
Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any
cost,"" Mr Pompeo said. Russia has expressed ""serious concern"" over the escalation of tensions. Moscow called on both sides to exercise ""restraint"", adding that existing problems should be solved by ""political and diplomatic means"". China and the European Union have also made similar comments. It's been very difficult today for everyone, journalists included, to separate fact from fiction. This hasn't been helped by a whirlpool of misinformation on social media. Pakistan's government earlier released footage of the captured Indian fighter pilot on Twitter, with the video being shared far and wide. But several
accounts claimed there was also video of a second Indian pilot being captured. A
Facebook page circulated this supposed video and it has been shared more than 29,000
times. It has also been retweeted hundreds of times on Twitter. The footage is
fake.The original footage of an injured airman was filmed last week when two Indian Air Force (IAF) planes collided
in mid-air during a rehearsal for an air show in Bangalore. The footage of an injured Indian airman is actually from last week Various Twitter accounts and some Pakistani news sites have also used an image of a crashed IAF jet for their coverage, suggesting the picture was taken on Wednesday in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. But the original picture was actually taken in 2016 when a fighter plane crashed into a building in the Indian city of Jodhpur.  This MiG-27 crashed in 2016 In the hours immediately after news of the air clashes broke, other media
outlets published old images from a plane crash in India's Orissa state in 2015. They claimed the
pictures showed an Indian fighter jet shot down by Pakistani forces. Wreckage of an Indian Air Force jet. Photo: June 2015 In a separate incident unconnected to
the India-Pakistan clashes, India's defence ministry has confirmed that a Mi-17 V5 helicopter belonging to the Indian
Air Force crashed near Budgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday morning. All six personnel on board were killed. Local media also report that a civilian was killed. India says it has launched an investigation. Images of the helicopter wreckage have been circulating on social media and Pakistan's military earlier said it had nothing to do with it. With tensions high, Indians and Pakistanis have taken to social media, urging their governments to resist military conflict. The hashtag #SayNoToWar is trending worldwide and has been used by citizens on both sides of the border, and by politicians, celebrities and human rights groups.  Allow Twitter content?

India has demanded the immediate release of its fighter pilot, wing commander Abhinandan, from Pakistani custody. It condemned what it said had been the ""vulgar display of an injured personnel of the Indian Air Force"" and suggested Pakistan had violated international humanitarian law. The foreign ministry issued a statement shortly after it summoned Pakistan's Deputy High Commissioner Syed Haider Shah, the country's top diplomat in Delhi. It warned Pakistan that it would be ""well advised"" to ensure that no harm came to the pilot. Both India and Pakistan recalled their ambassadors after the militant attack on 14 February that sparked this crisis. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pakistan's military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor has said that only one Indian pilot is in army ""custody"". His statement comes hours after a press conference when he talked about two Indian pilots being arrested - with one sent to hospital for treatment. No explanation has been given as to why the numbers have changed. India had earlier also said only one of its pilots was ""missing"", adding that Delhi was investigating Pakistan's claims that he was being held there. Several videos have emerged appearing to show the pilot, including one in which he said he was being looked after ""very well"" after being rescued from a ""mob"". Earlier pictures released by Pakistan's government - and then deleted - showed him blindfolded and with a bloodied face. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap on this fast-moving story: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is now holding a key meeting with security and intelligence chiefs to discuss the crisis. India has admitted that one of its fighter jets went down and that a pilot is missing - but we don't know how it will respond. Pakistan has said it is ready to sit down and talk. As we've reported, Pakistani airspace is currently closed to commercial flights. That's having an impact on airlines - which are having to avoid flying over the country. The picture below - from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 - shows what's happening. (Only one civilian airport - Karachi, in the south - is receiving incoming international flights that have been diverted). Dubai Airports has confirmed that flights are being affected. The United Arab Emirates is home to more than a million Pakistanis.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not publicly commented on the situation since Tuesday. All we've had officially from India since the Pakistani incursion and subsequent dogfight on Wednesday morning was a very short foreign ministry press statement. Pakistan has held a longer military press briefing and PM Imran Khan has addressed the nation (see posts below). But on Tuesday, the Indian PM - who will face an election by the end of May - assured Indians that he would ""protect the motherland from all humiliation and threats"". Mr Khan has repeatedly suggested that India's response to the incident that sparked tensions in the first place - a militant attack on Indian forces on 14 February - has been guided by concerns about the election. India has, of course, rejected that and says its neighbour provides safe haven to militants. Pakistani President Arif Alvi has described Prime Minister Imran Khan's statement (see posts below) as a ""very appropriate, precise and compassionate message"". Mr Alvi says that ""Pakistan wants peace"" and that ""sanity should prevail"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Indian bombs fell on Pakistani territory on Tuesday morning, officials in
Pakistan went to great lengths to show that the arsenal was released from
outside Pakistani airspace. Wednesday's Pakistani strikes into Indian Kashmir show the military was under too much
pressure and had to show an equivalent  response. The dogfight this morning has sparked fears that India will now be under similar pressure to retaliate. Anti-India protest in Lahore on Wednesday Reports of a meeting of the National Command Authority that controls Pakistanâs nuclear arsenal have added to these fears. All civilian airports have been closed for traffic, except Karachi which is only receiving incoming international flights headed for other Pakistani cities. The situation in Pakistan-administered Kashmir is worse, with artillery shelling reported across the Line of Control (LoC). The authorities on the Pakistan side of Kashmir have declared a state of emergency in the region; educational institutions have been ordered to close, district authorities have set up emergency centres in their offices, and populations living close to the LoC have been asked to move to safer areas. Prime Minister Imran Khan has just called on India for talks and de-escalation, but a lot will depend on how India responds to this morning's developments. Analysts are asking what role outside powers, especially the United States, can play in defusing this crisis. Right now President Donald Trump is in Vietnam, where he will later meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to discuss denuclearisation. You can read about that here. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spoken with both Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers.

In his statement, Mr Khan also stressed that both Pakistan and India, each nuclear-armed, should be responsible. ""What
I want to say to India is this: it is of utmost importance that we use sense
and wisdom. ""All big wars are the result of miscalculations. Hitler never
thought the war would go on for so many years. Americans never imagined that
wars in Vietnam or Afghanistan would extend into decades. ""My
question is, with the kind of weapons that we both have, can we afford a
miscalculation? If we let it happen, it will remain neither in my control nor [Indian PM] Narendra Modiâs.""  Imran Khan is defending Pakistan's retaliation following Tuesday's air strikes by India in Pakistani territory. He says that he offered to help India investigate the 14 February militant attack that saw dozens of Indian security personnel killed in Kashmir and triggered tensions.""We had told India that if you take unilateral action, we'll be forced to respond if you do anything. But India became judge, jury and executioner.""   The Pakistani leader says that two Indian MiG fighter jets were shot down. India earlier said it had only lost one plane. âWe shot two of their MiGs. The pilots are with us,"" Mr Khan said. ""But where do we go from here? Iâm asking India. We must be responsible."" Prime Minister Khan says in a televised address that Pakistan's morning strikes were not meant to cause casualties or damage. He said they were only meant to show Pakistan's ""capability"".  Imran Khan has just started speaking about today's dramatic events. Rehman Malik, Pakistan's outspoken former interior minister, has also weighed into the debate to take a jibe at India's PM Narendra Modi and laud Pakistan's military. Allow Twitter content?

Cardinal Pell's bail revoked by judgeThe ex-Vatican treasurer has been ordered into custody after being convicted of child sexual abuse.Australia,"Cardinal George Pell arrives at a Melbourne court on Wednesday Cardinal George Pell has been remanded in custody after being found guilty of sexual offences against children in Australia. The ex-Vatican treasurer abused two boys in 1996, a jury found in December. Pell's bail was revoked on Wednesday, placing him in custody for the first time. He will be sentenced on 13 March. The cardinal is the most senior Catholic figure ever convicted of sexual abuse. He maintains he is innocent and has lodged an appeal. A jury unanimously convicted Pell of one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16, and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16. The verdict and details of the case had been kept secret until Tuesday due to legal reasons. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail, a court heard on Wednesday. Pell guilty of child sexual abuse Poisoned power at the top Why his conviction was kept a secret Pell's conviction has rocked the Catholic Church. He was considered one of the Pope's closest advisers and spent five years overseeing the Vatican's finances. On Tuesday, the Vatican confirmed that Pell was prohibited from public ministry, and banned from having contact with minors. He has to abide by these rules until any appeal is over. Pell was archbishop of Melbourne when he abused two 13-year-old boys in a cathedral following a mass, the County Court of Victoria heard last year. After telling them they were in trouble for drinking communion wine, Pell forced each boy into indecent acts, prosecutors said. He abused one of the boys again in 1997. Pell has been swarmed by media and onlookers before his court appearances The court heard testimony from one of the victims. The other died of a drug overdose in 2014. In a preliminary sentencing hearing, Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter QC, described it as ""no more than a plain, vanilla sexual penetration case"". He submitted 10 character references for the cardinal, including from former Australian Prime Minister John Howard. However, prosecutors argued that Pell's ""serious offending"" warranted significant jail time. Judge Peter Kidd said the abuse was ""callous"" and ""brazen"", adding: ""It did involve a breach of trust and a degree of impunity. How else did he think he was going to get away with it?"" He revoked Pell's bail following a lengthy hearing. Hywel Griffith, BBC News Australia correspondent George Pell bowed towards the judge and leaned on his walking stick, before officers took him down from the courtroom and into custody. Earlier, he'd arrived to face a crowd of angry campaigners waving placards - many had come to see the moment he lost his liberty. Though an appeal looms, Pell will return to court in two weeks to learn his sentence. Inside a strictly controlled trial The Australian cleric rose in prominence as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views and advocating for priestly celibacy. He was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances, and was often described as the Church's third-ranked official. Pell (r) was one of the Pope's closest advisers at the Vatican But his career has been dogged first by claims that he covered up child sexual abuse by priests, and then later that he was himself an abuser. Pell was demoted from the Pope's inner circle in December. His term as Vatican treasurer expired on Sunday. Profile: The cardinal convicted of abuse The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the decades since, evidence of widespread abuse has emerged globally. In Australia,an inquiry heard that 7% of the nation's Catholic priests had abused children. Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Abuse and the Church: What you need to know Pope Francis has established a committee to tackle sexual abuses. In recent days, he has promised concrete action, calling clergy guilty of abuse ""tools of Satan"". But critics say he could do more to combat paedophiles and those who conceal abuse.

BBC and ITV in talks over Netflix rival,"The BBC, home to crime dramas Luther and Line of Duty, and ITV, maker of dramas such as Vanity Fair, are in the ""concluding phase of talks"" to create a rival to Netflix. BBC director general Tony Hall said the aim was to launch ""BritBox"" in the UK in the second half of 2019. The price was not announced but Lord Hall said it would be ""competitive"". ITV's chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said it would be home for the ""best of British creativity"". There are reports it could cost Â£5 a month. Will BritBox be a hit or a flop? Why are the BBC and ITV creating BritBox? The two organisations already have a BritBox streaming service in North America, which Lord Hall said was performing ""ahead of expectations"". It has 500,000 subscribers. ""Research with the British public shows that there is a real appetite for a new British streaming service - in addition to their current subscriptions,"" he said. Dame Carolyn told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that 43% of all homes which use the Internet are interested in a subscription to BritBox. For homes which already subscribe to Netflix, she said that increased to half of all homes. ""There is a window of opportunity here,"" she said. ITV will spend Â£25m on the venture this year and Â£40m in 2020. The BBC did not disclose how much it was spending but Dani Warner, TV expert at uSwitch, said it ""could be a good way for the BBC especially to recoup losses from Brits abandoning the licence fee for subscription models"". It is understood licence fee money will not be used to pay for the service. The new venture is not intended to replace the BBC's iPlayer or the ITV Hub - the on-demand services where programmes are available for a restricted period of time. It is expected to have box sets from the BBC and  ITV archives. There will also be some programmes commissioned only for BritBox. Shows would appear on the relevant channels, then on the on-demand services before going on to BritBox. It would be ""one permanent, comprehensive home where anyone in Britain can get all of our library content - both the ITV and BBC library - in one place and they can watch it anytime, anywhere,"" Dame Carolyn told Today. The details have not been announced but BBC shows which are no longer aired regularly - such as Absolutely Fabulous - may be available. ITV dramas such as Vera and Endeavour - and its predecessor Morse - are also likely contenders. Dame Carolyn said that existing licensing agreements with Netflix will be honoured. For instance,last year, Netflix acquired the rights to the BBC show Bodyguard- from ITV Studios which owns the production company which made the drama. Two inescapable trends are driving the TV business around the world today - one in consumer behaviour, the other in business strategy. The first is exponential growth in streaming, with an accompanied decline in scheduled TV. The second is consolidation among content providers who are desperately seeking scale. Britbox is a marriage of the two. For the BBC, the iPlayer is still a small part of overall viewing, but the key growth area, especially among the younger audiences who much prefer other digital platforms, particularly YouTube. ITV faces a hugely different set of challenges. It is a mostly ad-funded, linear channel - the opposite of Netflix, a subscriber-driven, streaming service. Clubbing together to offer the maximum amount of content allows the BBC and ITV to provide a better service than they could alone, at a time when other media giants, such as Disney, are pulling out of Netflix to launch their own direct-to-consumer offering. Read more from Amol Rajan An idea for streaming service - known as Project Kangaroo - was blocked by the competition authorities nine years ago. Dame Carolyn told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the industry had changed since then. Both the Competition and Markets Authority and media regulator Ofcom are being consulted on this latest venture. Regulator Ofcom said it was looking forward to discussing the plan with ITV and the BBC. ""We want to see broadcasters collaborating to keep pace with global players, by offering quality UK content that's available to viewers whenever and however they want to watch it."" ITV said talks with Channel 4 and Channel 5 to join the venture were ongoing. The announcement came as ITV reported 2018 profits of Â£567m, up 13% in what Dame Carolyn said was an ""uncertain economic and political environment"". ITV's shares were down more than 2.5% in early trading as it admitted that advertising in the first four months of the year was forecast to be down 3% to 4%. ""It is an uncertain economic world at the moment for the UK...  our customers [advertisers] are more cautious because they are contingency planning and we expected it to be to be slow,"" she told Today. The comparison with last year will also be lower because of the football World Cup in June which boosted advertising. Will BritBox be a hit or a flop? Why are the BBC and ITV creating BritBox?

UK's richest man in ÃÂ£1bn investmentIneos boss Jim Ratcliffe says the company will upgrade North Sea pipelines and build new plants in Grangemouth and Hull.Business,"Jim Ratcliffe is the founder and chairman of Ineos Britain's richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, has announced Â£1bn worth of investments in the UK oil and chemical industries. Mr Ratcliffe's company, Ineos, will spend Â£500m on overhauling the Forties pipeline system, which transports 40% of the UK's North Sea oil and gas. It will also build a Â£350m energy plant at Scotland's Grangemouth oil refinery site, which it already owns, as well as a Â£150m chemicals plant in Hull. Media reports have said Mr Ratcliffe plans to become a tax exile in Monaco. Earlier this month, the Sunday Times claimed Mr Ratcliffe, an outspoken supporter of Brexit, and two of his key executives could save up to Â£4bn in tax by leaving the UK. Ineos moved its headquarters to the Swiss city of Lausanne in 2010 to cut its corporation tax bill, but returned to the UK in 2016. Rich List 2018: Jim Ratcliffe is UK's richest man Jim Ratcliffe: Turning cast-offs into gold Mr Ratcliffe said the investment programme would ""ensure that our UK assets continue to be world-class for many years to come"". He added: ""At an uncertain moment for the country, Ineos has confidence in its businesses and is committed to continue investing in manufacturing and high-skilled jobs in the UK."" The Forties pipeline project would ""extend the life of the pipeline by at least 20 years, into the 2040s"", the firm said. Ineos said it would overhaul the reliability of the pipelines, including modernising the environmental systems. At Grangemouth, it will develop a new steam and power plant, improving energy efficiency and long-term reliability, it said. The Hull plant will manufacture vinyl acetate monomer, a chemical compound used in making various industrial and consumer products including safety glass and laminated windscreens. Mr Ratcliffe, whose Â£21bn fortune makes him the UK's richest manaccording to the Sunday Times rich list,external, has traditionally invested in speciality chemicals businesses, but began acquiring North Sea assets in 2015.

M&S and Ocado in Â£750m home delivery dealThe deal will give M&S a home delivery food service for the first time.Business,"Marks & Spencer and Ocado have confirmed a deal which will give the High Street retailer a home delivery service for the first time. M&S will buy a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for Â£750m. The joint venture will be called Ocado and will deliver M&S grocery products from September 2020 at the latest, when Ocado's deal with Waitrose expires. Under the deal Ocado will also continue to supply its own-label products and big name branded goods. Ocado's deal to deliver about 4,500 Waitrose goods is due to end in September 2020. Shoppers will then be able to order more than 4,500 M&S products alongside Ocado own-label goods and big name branded items. Existing Waitrose customers - who have products delivered by Ocado - will have two choices: They could choose to stay with Ocado and switch to buying M&S goods They could switch to Waitrose.com which operates its own online delivery service Waitrose managing director Rob Collins said the supermarket chain had strengthened its own online business ""significantly"" and that it planned to double its sales within five years. M&S chief executive Steve Rowe claimed that current Ocado customers would benefit from the deal as Marks and Spencer products were on average cheaper than comparable Waitrose products. The deal could also see some of Ocado's own brand products being stocked in M&S stores. Ocado also has a deal to supply Morrisons with the technology to run its online business. This arrangement is separate and will not be affected by the new tie-up. Visitors to the Ocado site will still not be able to order Morrisons. M&S is to buy a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for Â£750m. The retailer will fund the deal by selling Â£600m of shares and by cutting its dividend payout to shareholders by 40%. ""We think we've paid a fair price,"" said Steve Rowe, M&S chief executive. ""It's the only way we could have gone online within an immediately scalable, profitable and sustainable business,"" he said. M&S shareholders were sceptical, its shares fell 10% following the announcement, while Ocado's shares rose by almost 4%. M&S has struggled in recent times. Clothing, home and food sales have all fallen, amid ""challenging"" trading conditions on the High Street. It has been hampered by not having an online delivery service. However, Mr Rowe said in the future one third of M&S business would be online. The deal was the ""only way we could have gone online within an immediately scalable, profitable and sustainable business"", he said. But Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, questioned whether the value of a shop with M&S was big enough for online shopping. ""Basket sizes at M&S are extremely small relative to other larger supermarkets and significantly below the current Ocado minimum for delivery. At the moment M&S shoppers spend an average of Â£13 on each shop, while Ocado averages just over Â£100 per shop. M&S said that part of the reason it has such a relatively low average spend was that customers could not access a wider range of products. The company said the Ocado deal would offer their customers the ability to do a full shop online. The company will split into two parts. The new joint venture will be called Ocado.com and will deliver M&S, Ocado and big name branded products. It will have access to M&S's database of 12 million food shoppers. Its Ocado Solutions division will continue to develop new robotic warehouse technology and supply companies likeUS retail giant Krogerand France's Groupe Casino,  helped by the injection of money it gets from the new deal. However, according to Market.com's Mr Wilson, there is a risk that shoppers will defect to Waitrose when the current arrangement with Ocado comes to an end. ""I would also query whether M&S can retain the current Ocado customer base who are used to getting Waitrose products. There is a high risk of customer leakage as consumers rotate to Waitrose's in-house delivery service,"" he said. However, Ocado founder and chief executive Tim Steiner brushed off that suggestion. ""Our customers have told us that they are looking forward to getting their M&S Percy Pig sweets"", he said. The ending of the deal with Waitrose means that Ocado will no longer have to pay sourcing fees to Waitrose, which came to more than Â£15m in 2018. Sainsbury's-Asda merger in jeopardy What went wrong on the High Street in 2018? The two companies' share price reactions give a succinct verdict. M&S was down nearly 8% in early trading; Ocado up 4%. Retail experts - and professional investors - think there is a lot more in this for Ocado than for M&S. The latter is paying Â£750m for a half share in a division of Ocado that last year made just over Â£80m of trading profit. Shareholders will have to find Â£600m of the purchase price from their own pockets, and - possibly worse news for the many investors who have bought M&S shares for the income they provide - stomach a hefty cut to the dividend. The high price explains some of investor misgivings, but there are bigger questions about the fit between the two. M&S is a (relatively) upmarket convenience store, where the average basket price is just Â£13. Ocado, thanks to its tie-up with Waitrose and its wide-range of own-label products, is a full-service grocery store where most customers are doing their weekly shop, not topping up. Will M&S be able to push enough of its products through Ocado to justify the price, and how will Ocado customers react when its relationship with Waitrose comes to an end next year? Archie Norman, M&S's wily chairman and chief strategist, might judge these criticisms short-sighted, and typical of the City's lack of long-term vision. Having lagged behind on online shopping for years, M&S has been catapulted into the front ranks at a stroke. The cost of the deal, Norman might argue, should be judged against the cost of the alternatives, and the cost of doing nothing.

French retailer cancels sports hijab saleDecathlon changes its mind about selling a sportswear hijab in France after it sparks an outcry.Europe,"The French-owned firm claims to be the world's largest sporting goods retailer French sportswear retailer Decathlon has scrapped plans to sell a hijab for women runners in France following a public outcry. The firm said it had decided to suspend the product following ""a wave of insults"" and ""unprecedented threats"". French politicians said the ""running hijab"" contradicted the country's secular values, and some lawmakers suggested a boycott of the brand. Decathlon initially stood by the hijab, which is already for sale in Morocco. The issues of how Muslim women dress in public has often stoked controversy in France. The Islamic veil across Europe Why some Muslim women wear the veil What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? ""We are making the decision... to not market this product in France at this time,"" Decathlon spokesman Xavier Rivoire told RTL radio on Tuesday. He had earlier told AFP news agency that the initial decision was to ""make sport accessible for all women in the world"". Demand for the product began in Morocco, where it is well received The plain, lightweight headscarf, which covers the hair and not the face, was to go on sale in 49 countries from March. Sports equipment manufacturer Nike has marketed a sports hijab in France since 2017. The French-owned company said it had received 500 calls and emails to complain about its ""running hijab"", with some of its staff in stores being insulted, and even physically threatened. Health Minister AgnÃ¨s Buzyn told RTL that although such a product is not prohibited in France, ""it's a vision of women that I don't share. I would prefer if a French brand did not promote the headscarf"". The spokeswoman for President Emmanuel Macron's La RÃ©publique en Marche partyAurore BergÃ© also weighed in on the issue on Twitter,external, suggesting a boycott. ""My choice as a woman and citizen will be to no longer put my trust in a brand that breaks away from our values,"" she said. Replying to Ms BergÃ© on Twitter,external, Decathlon said: ""Our goal is simple: to offer [women who run with an often unsuitable hijab] an adapted sport product, without judgement."" Later, the sporting goods giant said it wanted to restore peace after the ""violent"" reaction ""went beyond our desire to meet the needs of our customers"". France argues any outward religious symbol, such as the veil, does not maintain the appearance of neutrality required of students and public sector workers under the country's strict laws for secularism. The Muslim headscarf is allowed in public spaces in France, but has been banned in state schools and some public buildings since 2004. Part bikini, part burqa, the burqini swimsuit sparked huge controversy in France In 2016, multiple French regions banned the burkini - a full-body swimsuit - from its beaches.The bans were later ruled illegal by France's highest court. Burkini ban boosts online sales 'by 200%' EU ruling could force hijabis out of work Muslim women respond to 'burkini' ban These bans led rights groups of accusing France of Islamophobia and stigmatising Muslim women, after already banning full-face coverings in 2010.

Firefighters tackle huge moorland blaze,"This video can not be played The fire could be seen for miles around Fire crews have extinguished a huge blaze on moorland in West Yorkshire. The fire, described by one witness as ""apocalyptic"", started at about 19:30 GMT on Tuesday and covered about 1.5 sq km of land near Marsden. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it was ""one of the biggest moorland fires we've ever had to deal with"". It came as the UK broke the record for the warmest winter day for a second time and on the same day as a gorse fire on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. Following a night spent tackling the blaze, near Saddleworth Moor between Huddersfield and Manchester, a fire service spokesperson said: ""The fire now looks to be out."" However, they said crews and specialist moorland firefighting units ""will remain at the scene for much of the day to tackle any further hot spots"". At its height, more than 35 firefighters were in attendance at the National Trust property and the A62 between Colne Valley and Diggle was closed as a precaution. Station manager Adam Greenwood said when crews arrived about 4 sq km of moorland was ablaze. ""It was one of the highest flame fronts we have seen, with flames of up to two metres high, and it was moving fast across the moorland,"" he said. ""The fire looks to be out however moorland fires can easily reignite so it's important that we monitor it closely. ""We expect to be at the moors for much of the day."" There have been no reports of any injuries. People living near to the scene have been advised to stay indoors and keep their doors and windows closed. But the fire service said ""risks to health are low"". BBC Yorkshire climate correspondent Paul Hudson said that, like much of the UK, the region had faced unseasonal winter temperatures. He said: ""These kind of temperatures, 18C or 19C, are what you would normally see in early June. ""There's been a prolonged abnormally warm spell and we've also had an exceptionally dry start to 2019. ""The temperature on Wednesday is also set to be pretty similar."" Pictures capture dramatic moorland fire Latest updates on moorland fire Why are there UK wildfires in February? Station commander Tony Pearson said moor fires in February were ""very unusual but not unheard of"". He said: ""We've had a few dry days and it's dried the land out a little bit."" He described the location as ""horrendous"" as it took firefighters an hour to get there due to the terrain. Mr Pearson said: ""It was really uneven ground, really difficult working conditions on there. Mike Elliot, from the National Trust, said the heather on the moorland had only just re-established itself after a blaze about three years ago. He said: ""It's gradually got back to its normal self, but unfortunately it's going to have to start again. ""What we're doing here is trying to stabilise the moorland with all the heather as that keeps all the peat out of the watercourse."" The Edinburgh gorse fire broke out at a similar time on Tuesday, andtwo large fires started within an hour of each otherin the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex earlier. In June and July last year, firefighters from 20 different brigades were drafted in to help tackle two huge moorland fires which burnt for several weeks. Firefighters spent more than a month battling a huge fire covering 18 sq km (6.9 sq miles) at Winter Hill, near Bolton. The Army was drafted in to help Greater Manchester crews deal with a blaze on Saddleworth Moor in Tameside. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Breaking|Breaking newsPakistan 'shoots down two Indian jets'Pakistan says the Indian planes were inside its airspace in Kashmir and one pilot has been arrested.Asia,"This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet Pakistan says it has shot down two Indian military jets and captured a pilot in a major escalation between the nuclear powers over Kashmir. India said it had lost one MiG-21 fighter and demanded the immediate and safe return of its pilot. Pakistani PM Imran Khan said the two sides could not afford a miscalculation with the weapons they had. India and Pakistan - both nuclear-armed states - claim all of Kashmir, but control only parts of it. They have fought three wars since independence from Britain and partition in 1947. All but one were over Kashmir. As it happened: Fears rise amid India-Pakistan escalation India and Pakistan in uncharted waters The aerial attacks across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Indian and Pakistani territory are the first since a war in 1971. They follow a militant attack in Kashmir which killed at least 40 Indian troops - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack. The BBC's Soutik Biswas, in Delhi, says the challenge for India and Pakistan now is to contain the latest escalation before things get completely out of control. Pakistan's military spokesman said that Pakistan fighter jets had carried out ""strikes"" - exactly what they did remains unclear - in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday. Two Indian air force jets then responded, crossing the de facto border that divides Kashmir. ""Our jets were ready and we shot both of them down,"" Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said. He said that one Indian pilot was in the custody of the Pakistani army. Officials had previously said two pilots had been captured and one had been taken to hospital. No explanation has been given as to why the numbers have changed. Maj Gen Ghafoor said the captured Indian pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan, was being ""treated as per norms of military ethics"". Earlier Pakistan's information ministry published but subsequently deleted a video showing the pilot - blindfolded and with blood on his face - identifying himself to soldiers. Pakistan's information ministry tweeted a video purporting to show a captured Indian pilot Another video circulating on social media appeared to show the pilot being beaten by residents in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir before the arrival of Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan's information ministry also tweeted what it said was footage of one of the downed Indian jets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In India, Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Raveesh Kumar acknowledged the loss of a jet and its pilot. He also said that an Indian plane had shot down a Pakistani fighter jet, and Indian ground forces observed it falling on the Pakistani side of the LoC. Pakistan denied any of its jets had been hit. India's foreign ministry later issued a statement demanding the release of its fighter pilot and condemning the images shared by Pakistan of Wing Commander Abhinandan, describing them as a ""vulgar display of an injured personnel"". In a televised address, Prime Minister Khan offered India talks over terrorism and warned against further escalation. ""If we let it happen, it will remain neither in my nor Narendra Modi's control,"" he said. ""Our action is just to let them know that just like they intruded into our territory, we are also capable of going into their territory,"" he added. Mr Modi has yet to comment but was meeting top security and intelligence officials to discuss the situation, reports in India said. Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said her country would act ""with responsibility and restraint"". ""India does not wish to see further escalation of the situation,"" she said, speaking from a meeting with Russian and Chinese foreign ministers in China. Pakistan's assertion that it had shot down two Indian aircraft came shortly after Islamabad said its warplanes had struck targets in Indian territory. Indian authorities said the Pakistani jets had been forced to withdraw. Viewpoint: India strikes in Pakistan a major escalation What is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad? Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Pakistan's military spokesman Maj Gen Ghafoor said jets had ""engaged"" six targets in Indian territory but then carried out air strikes on ""open ground"". ""We don't want to go on the path of war,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

India said Tuesday's air strikes on Balakot in north-western Pakistan killed a large number of militants, but Pakistan said there had been no casualties. The US, EU and China have all called for restraint. By Soutik Biswas, BBC News, Delhi The challenge for India and Pakistan now is to contain the escalation before things get completely out of control. It is almost unprecedented for two nuclear-armed countries to carry out air strikes into each other's territories. ""We are in uncharted waters,"" Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to the US and adviser to three Pakistani prime ministers, told me late on Tuesday. An Indian defence analyst believes Indian security forces will now have to be prepared for a ""full spectrum of conflict"". However Daniel Markey from Johns Hopkins University in the US says we are ""several steps away"" from nuclear escalation. A further escalation, he believes, will happen if Pakistan's ""next step were to raise the stakes by hitting Indian civilian targets"". That is highly unlikely. Read more from Soutik on this story Pakistan has closed its entire airspace, its civil aviation authority said.

Dozens buried in Indonesia mine collapse,"This video can not be played Rescuers are hampered by the steep terrain and muddy, unstable ground Rescuers are working frantically to find dozens of people thought to be buried at an illegal Indonesian gold mine after a landslide on Tuesday. They are searching for survivors at the site, in the Bolaang Mongondow area, on the island of Sulawesi. Seven people have died and at least 19 have been rescued, officials say. Rescuers are hampered by the steep terrain and muddy, unstable ground,  which means heavy lifting machinery cannot be used. They are having to use their bare hands, as well as spades and ropes, to get people out. The survivors are being carried away in makeshift stretchers. One local official said cracks had appeared at the mine, which collapsed on Tuesday and triggered a landslide, raising fears of a further collapse. Rescue teams from Indonesia's disaster agency, the BNPB, worked through the night to carry survivors off a mud-covered hillside Dozens of people were mining for gold when support beams gave way at the mine due to shifting soil land and numerous mining shafts, officials said. The collapse then triggered a landslide. Indonesia country profile A local official said it was difficult to say exactly how many were trapped underground: ""We think there are still many people inside the mine, because it is an illegal mine, so we cannot predict,"" said Yasti Soepredjo, head of the Bolaang Mongondow region. ""Based on statements from people who survived, the numbers are inconsistent. Some say there were more than 100 in the mine, some said about 80. We are still in the dark when it comes to the actual number."" Small-scale gold mining is banned in Indonesia but remains widespread in rural areas. Lack of regulation and the poor construction of makeshift mines means accidents are relatively frequent. Campaigners have long argued that a lack of local employment opportunities mean people feel forced to rely on illegal mining.

UK's richest man in Â£1bn investment,"Jim Ratcliffe is the founder and chairman of Ineos Britain's richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, has announced Â£1bn worth of investments in the UK oil and chemical industries. Mr Ratcliffe's company, Ineos, will spend Â£500m on overhauling the Forties pipeline system, which transports 40% of the UK's North Sea oil and gas. It will also build a Â£350m energy plant at Scotland's Grangemouth oil refinery site, which it already owns, as well as a Â£150m chemicals plant in Hull. Media reports have said Mr Ratcliffe plans to become a tax exile in Monaco. Earlier this month, the Sunday Times claimed Mr Ratcliffe, an outspoken supporter of Brexit, and two of his key executives could save up to Â£4bn in tax by leaving the UK. Ineos moved its headquarters to the Swiss city of Lausanne in 2010 to cut its corporation tax bill, but returned to the UK in 2016. Rich List 2018: Jim Ratcliffe is UK's richest man Jim Ratcliffe: Turning cast-offs into gold Mr Ratcliffe said the investment programme would ""ensure that our UK assets continue to be world-class for many years to come"". He added: ""At an uncertain moment for the country, Ineos has confidence in its businesses and is committed to continue investing in manufacturing and high-skilled jobs in the UK."" The Forties pipeline project would ""extend the life of the pipeline by at least 20 years, into the 2040s"", the firm said. Ineos said it would overhaul the reliability of the pipelines, including modernising the environmental systems. At Grangemouth, it will develop a new steam and power plant, improving energy efficiency and long-term reliability, it said. The Hull plant will manufacture vinyl acetate monomer, a chemical compound used in making various industrial and consumer products including safety glass and laminated windscreens. Mr Ratcliffe, whose Â£21bn fortune makes him the UK's richest manaccording to the Sunday Times rich list,external, has traditionally invested in speciality chemicals businesses, but began acquiring North Sea assets in 2015.

"Autism-anorexia link 'must be acted on'One in five women presenting to UK clinics with anorexia may also have autism, research suggests.Health","Sophie, who has autism, became ""obsessed"" with counting calories The NHS must change the way it assesses eating disorders to take account of a link with autism, a research charity has said. Autistica said findings suggested one in five women presenting to UK clinics with anorexia may also have autism and tailored therapy was vital. One woman said her autism had made her ""obsessed"" with counting calories, even though she did not want to lose weight. Health watchdog NICE said more research was required. Sophie McInnes, 24, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme her anorexia had developed not from issues surrounding body image or weight but because she had developed a set of rules for herself about how many calories she could eat. She said she had wanted to put on weight but her autism - at that stage undiagnosed - had meant she would not let herself. ""It was all about the calories, all about the numbers,"" she said, having begun to write down what she was eating aged 19. ""I actually admitted myself into the eating disorder unit because I had started exercising a lot and I wasn't eating anything. ""They put me in a wheelchair and said my weight was so low that if I didn't eat, I would need to be sectioned."" Sophie developed anorexia aged 19 Eventually, Sophie left the unit but she continued to struggle to gain weight. It was only several years later, in 2018, that she was diagnosed with autism. Had the link been spotted sooner, she said, it would have helped her recovery. ""It's just taken away a big chunk of my life so far, and I want to move on,"" she said. Autistica's director of science, Dr James Cusack, is calling for new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to reflect this. He pointed to three separate studies carried out in 2015 and 2017 that suggested 15% of women with anorexia also have autism. The South London and Maudsley NHS Trust's Eating Disorder Service, a leading UK clinic, said almost 35% of its patients have autism. Currently, the NICE guidelines on eating disorders do not contain any mention of the condition. ""We also need more NHS services involved in research,"" Dr Cusack said, ""both informing studies and carrying out trials in eating-disorder care settings."" His proposal has the backing of former Health Minister Norman Lamb. The Lib Dem MP told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it was ""vital"" that practice caught up with research. ""We may well be applying inappropriate care to women with both conditions,"" he added. NICE said in a statement that it recognised factors such as autism needed to be taken into account with regards to eating disorders, but there was currently ""very little"" evidence on whether the intervention of health professionals needed to be modified in such cases. NHS England has been approached for comment. Will Mandy says it is key for healthcare professionals to understand the autism-anxiety link Will Mandy, a leading autism researcher, from University College London, said part of the issue was that women and girls were much less likely than men to be recognised as having autism in the first place. And he believes that the ""high levels of stress and anxiety"" caused by the condition going undiagnosed in childhood and adolescence can contribute to people experiencing severe mental health conditions, such as eating disorders. Recognition among health professionals of the autism-anxiety link was key, he said. ""If you don't know somebody is autistic, it becomes quite hard to help them and to adapt treatment to being autistic,"" Mr Mandy said. A tailored approach can include simple changes, such as making communication easier and the environment friendlier. Caroline Norton says she and colleagues tailor their approach to patients Caroline Norton, from South London and Maudsley NHS Trust's Eating Disorder Service, said its autistic patients might have one-to-one sessions - to remove the noise of others in the same space - where they learned to make food with a dietician. Healthcare professionals can also try to make patients more comfortable. One of the service's former patients, Ms Norton said, would hardly communicate with the therapist face-to-face but would instead send a long response via email shortly after the session - so they learned from this. ""It's about meeting the individual at the level that they need,"" she added. Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

May offers MPs Brexit delay vote,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""An extension cannot take no deal off the table."" Theresa May has promised MPs a vote on delaying the UK's departure from the EU or ruling out a no-deal Brexit, if they reject her deal next month. Mrs May made a statement to MPs about Brexit on Tuesday, amid the threat of a revolt by Remain-supporting ministers. The PM has promised MPs a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by 12 March. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of another ""grotesquely reckless"" Brexit delay. LIVE: Reaction to May's Brexit update Kuenssberg: Not quite 'simples' Reality check: How could Brexit be delayed? Pound rises amid Brexit delay speculation Brexit: All you need to know The prime minister said she will put her withdrawal agreement  - including any changes she has agreed with the EU - to a meaningful vote by 12 March. If that fails, MPs will be offered two separate votes: One, on the following day, on whether MPs support a no-deal Brexit - so the UK would ""only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in the House for that outcome"" If that fails, then MPs will get a vote by 14 March on requesting an extension to the two-year Article 50 negotiation process to delay EU withdrawal beyond 29 March ""Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article 50 extended,"" she told MPs. ""Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March."" Any extension should not go beyond the end of June and ""would almost certainly have to be a one-off"", she added. Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Mrs May said an extension ""cannot take no deal off the table"", adding:  ""The only way to do that is to revoke Article 50, which I shall not do, or agree a deal."" Extending Article 50 would require the unanimous backing of the other 27 EU member states and, she said, she had not had conversations about it with them. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May repeatedly declined to say whether she would vote against a no-deal Brexit, and whether Tory MPs would be whipped to vote for or against it. By the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar Theresa May's big concession - and it was a significant tactical retreat - was about buying herself more time. So now, under the threat of maybe 15 to 20 ministers rebelling, the prime minister's promised MPs an opportunity next month to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and force a ""limited"" delay in leaving the EU. Without that promise, there's every chance those unhappy ministers would have joined other MPs in voting to rule out no-deal and delay Brexit anyway. She did not offer ministers freedom to vote as they choose. So now the (potential) rebels must decide whether to hold fire for a fortnight, while she tries to get terms in Brussels she can sell to the Commons - hoping Brexiteers ultimately back her deal as the best Brexit available. Call it ""running down the clock"", or ""kicking the can down the road"", if you like. But kicking and running has been Mrs May's best hope for months. Several Remain-backing ministers were threatening to resign, so that they could vote for a cross-party amendment aimed at ruling out a no-deal Brexit, when MPs vote on a government motion on Wednesday. Conservative Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey said they ""welcomed"" the PM's statement but they would still table amendments paving the way for a bill to extend Article 50. They will then ""seek assurances from ministers during [the] debate to secure confirmation of the prime minister's commitments, which we hope will mean we will not push our amendments to a vote"", the pair said in a joint statement. Another of the MPs behind the amendment, Conservative Sir Oliver Letwin, had earlier said there was no need for it now, because the prime minister's statement ""does what is needed to prevent a no-deal exit on 29 March"". But opponents of Mrs May who support another EU referendum said she had still not ruled out a no-deal Brexit. The Independent Group's Anna Soubry, who quit the Conservatives in protest at their Brexit policy, said it was a ""shameful moment"" and ""nothing has changed"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry asks Theresa May if ""nothing has changed, and no deal remains firmly on the table."" Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group of Leave-backing Conservative MPs, said: ""My suspicion is that any delay to Brexit is a plot to stop Brexit. ""This would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit."" Speaking after a meeting with Theresa May, DUP Leader Arlene Foster said the PM had to deliver on her commitment to get legally-binding changes to her EU withdrawal agreement. ""Experience in Northern Ireland has shown that extending deadlines does nothing to encourage a deal,"" she said. The EU had it ""in their hands"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit, she added, and come up with a deal which MPs can support. ""It's time for Dublin and Brussels to be in a deal-making mode,"" she said. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM's handling of Brexit negotiations ""grotesquely reckless"" Jeremy Corbyn said he had ""lost count"" of the prime minister's explanations for her ""grotesquely reckless"" Brexit delays. ""The prime minister continues to say it is her deal or no deal, but this House has decisively rejected her deal and has clearly rejected no deal,"" he told MPs. ""It is the prime minister's obstinacy that is blocking a resolution."" Mr Corbyn says Labour will get behind another EU referendum if the party can't get its own Brexit proposals through Parliament on Wednesday. If Mrs May's Brexit deal gets through Parliament next month, Labour wants it to be put to a public vote - with remaining in the EU as the other option. Put May's deal to public vote - Labour The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mrs May ""could not be trusted"" not to ""dodge"" another meaningful vote. He said: ""It's the height of irresponsibility for any government to threaten its citizens with these consequences. ""Rule out no deal, extend Article 50, but do it today - this should not be left until the middle of March."" But Mrs May surprised the House by quoting a TV advert in her response: ""If he wants to end the uncertainty and deal with the issues he raised...then he should vote for a deal. Simples.""

Cardinal Pell's bail revoked by judge,"Cardinal George Pell arrives at a Melbourne court on Wednesday Cardinal George Pell has been remanded in custody after being found guilty of sexual offences against children in Australia. The ex-Vatican treasurer abused two boys in 1996, a jury found in December. Pell's bail was revoked on Wednesday, placing him in custody for the first time. He will be sentenced on 13 March. The cardinal is the most senior Catholic figure ever convicted of sexual abuse. He maintains he is innocent and has lodged an appeal. A jury unanimously convicted Pell of one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16, and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16. The verdict and details of the case had been kept secret until Tuesday due to legal reasons. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail, a court heard on Wednesday. Pell guilty of child sexual abuse Poisoned power at the top Why his conviction was kept a secret Pell's conviction has rocked the Catholic Church. He was considered one of the Pope's closest advisers and spent five years overseeing the Vatican's finances. On Tuesday, the Vatican confirmed that Pell was prohibited from public ministry, and banned from having contact with minors. He has to abide by these rules until any appeal is over. Pell was archbishop of Melbourne when he abused two 13-year-old boys in a cathedral following a mass, the County Court of Victoria heard last year. After telling them they were in trouble for drinking communion wine, Pell forced each boy into indecent acts, prosecutors said. He abused one of the boys again in 1997. Pell has been swarmed by media and onlookers before his court appearances The court heard testimony from one of the victims. The other died of a drug overdose in 2014. In a preliminary sentencing hearing, Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter QC, described it as ""no more than a plain, vanilla sexual penetration case"". He submitted 10 character references for the cardinal, including from former Australian Prime Minister John Howard. However, prosecutors argued that Pell's ""serious offending"" warranted significant jail time. Judge Peter Kidd said the abuse was ""callous"" and ""brazen"", adding: ""It did involve a breach of trust and a degree of impunity. How else did he think he was going to get away with it?"" He revoked Pell's bail following a lengthy hearing. Hywel Griffith, BBC News Australia correspondent George Pell bowed towards the judge and leaned on his walking stick, before officers took him down from the courtroom and into custody. Earlier, he'd arrived to face a crowd of angry campaigners waving placards - many had come to see the moment he lost his liberty. Though an appeal looms, Pell will return to court in two weeks to learn his sentence. Inside a strictly controlled trial The Australian cleric rose in prominence as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views and advocating for priestly celibacy. He was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances, and was often described as the Church's third-ranked official. Pell (r) was one of the Pope's closest advisers at the Vatican But his career has been dogged first by claims that he covered up child sexual abuse by priests, and then later that he was himself an abuser. Pell was demoted from the Pope's inner circle in December. His term as Vatican treasurer expired on Sunday. Profile: The cardinal convicted of abuse The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the decades since, evidence of widespread abuse has emerged globally. In Australia,an inquiry heard that 7% of the nation's Catholic priests had abused children. Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Abuse and the Church: What you need to know Pope Francis has established a committee to tackle sexual abuses. In recent days, he has promised concrete action, calling clergy guilty of abuse ""tools of Satan"". But critics say he could do more to combat paedophiles and those who conceal abuse.

House votes to block Trump border emergency,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the resolution a matter of patriotism, not partisanship The US House of Representatives has voted to revoke President Donald Trump's emergency declaration over building a US-Mexico border wall. The bid to overturn the declaration now goes to the Republican-majority Senate, where some conservatives have said they will vote with Democrats. Mr Trump, who declared the emergency after Congress refused funding for the wall, has said he will veto the bill. The resolution passed the Democrat-led House by a margin of 245-182. Thirteen Republicans sided with Democrats in rejecting Mr Trump's national emergency, which suggests Congress would not have the two-thirds majority of both chambers needed to override a veto from the president. Lawmakers are using a provision from the National Emergencies Act to overrule the president, but it requires both chambers to vote for it and to complete voting within 18 days. Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan Reaction to Trump's national emergency A major land grab by Trump The president has called the situation at the southern border a ""crisis"" and on 15 February, issued a declaration of emergency in order to bypass Congress and build a wall with military funding. Democrats say the declaration is unconstitutional and that Mr Trump has manufactured the border emergency. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Monday: ""This isn't about the border. This is about the constitution of the United States. This is not about politics. It's not about partisanship. It's about patriotism."" What a difference a few years - and a new presidential administration - make. In 2014, when Barack Obama used his executive authority to defer deportation of certain classes of undocumented migrants, Democrats defended him, while Republicans howled about an abuse of presidential authority. Now it is Republicans attempting to explain President Donald Trump's use of an emergency declaration to redirect funds toward his border wall, while Democrats issue dire warnings of White House overreach. Such is the ease with which the playing field flips in American politics. The Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, joined by a handful of Republicans, have rebuked Mr Trump for this wall declaration. That sets up a showdown in the Senate, where some conservatives - particularly those up for re-election in 2020 battleground states - are uneasy about going along with what they see as a dangerous precedent. They could hand their president an embarrassing setback, forcing him to use his first veto of his administration. Then - because a congressional veto override seems unlikely - the legal battle will shift to the courts. The battle for public opinion will stay firmly in the realm of the politicians, of course. While many Republicans were critical of using an emergency declaration for a wall prior to Mr Trump's decree, some are now arguing the president is using the authority given to him by the constitution. Republican leader Mitch McConnell says the emergency is an ""understandable consequence"" of Democrats refusing to negotiate with Mr Trump House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said Republicans would uphold Mr Trump's decision and accused Democrats of ignoring the emergency at the border. Ohio Representative Warren Davidson said: ""I think he didn't necessarily have to do the emergency declaration, but he did, and it's legal,""the Washington Post reported,external. But others maintained Mr Trump's response to a lack of congressional funding was inappropriate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the Senate, more Republicans have expressed concerns about setting a dangerous precedent, and Vice-President Mike Pence met members during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday to discuss the issue. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has maintained the emergency declaration is ""the predictable and understandable consequences of Democrats' decision to put partisan obstruction ahead of the national interest"". Mr Trump's emergency declaration would open up almost $8bn (Â£6bn) for the wall, which is still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of the barrier along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border, but far more than the $1.375bn allotted by Congress for barriers.

Autism-anorexia link 'must be acted on',"Sophie, who has autism, became ""obsessed"" with counting calories The NHS must change the way it assesses eating disorders to take account of a link with autism, a research charity has said. Autistica said findings suggested one in five women presenting to UK clinics with anorexia may also have autism and tailored therapy was vital. One woman said her autism had made her ""obsessed"" with counting calories, even though she did not want to lose weight. Health watchdog NICE said more research was required. Sophie McInnes, 24, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme her anorexia had developed not from issues surrounding body image or weight but because she had developed a set of rules for herself about how many calories she could eat. She said she had wanted to put on weight but her autism - at that stage undiagnosed - had meant she would not let herself. ""It was all about the calories, all about the numbers,"" she said, having begun to write down what she was eating aged 19. ""I actually admitted myself into the eating disorder unit because I had started exercising a lot and I wasn't eating anything. ""They put me in a wheelchair and said my weight was so low that if I didn't eat, I would need to be sectioned."" Sophie developed anorexia aged 19 Eventually, Sophie left the unit but she continued to struggle to gain weight. It was only several years later, in 2018, that she was diagnosed with autism. Had the link been spotted sooner, she said, it would have helped her recovery. ""It's just taken away a big chunk of my life so far, and I want to move on,"" she said. Autistica's director of science, Dr James Cusack, is calling for new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to reflect this. He pointed to three separate studies carried out in 2015 and 2017 that suggested 15% of women with anorexia also have autism. The South London and Maudsley NHS Trust's Eating Disorder Service, a leading UK clinic, said almost 35% of its patients have autism. Currently, the NICE guidelines on eating disorders do not contain any mention of the condition. ""We also need more NHS services involved in research,"" Dr Cusack said, ""both informing studies and carrying out trials in eating-disorder care settings."" His proposal has the backing of former Health Minister Norman Lamb. The Lib Dem MP told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it was ""vital"" that practice caught up with research. ""We may well be applying inappropriate care to women with both conditions,"" he added. NICE said in a statement that it recognised factors such as autism needed to be taken into account with regards to eating disorders, but there was currently ""very little"" evidence on whether the intervention of health professionals needed to be modified in such cases. NHS England has been approached for comment. Will Mandy says it is key for healthcare professionals to understand the autism-anxiety link Will Mandy, a leading autism researcher, from University College London, said part of the issue was that women and girls were much less likely than men to be recognised as having autism in the first place. And he believes that the ""high levels of stress and anxiety"" caused by the condition going undiagnosed in childhood and adolescence can contribute to people experiencing severe mental health conditions, such as eating disorders. Recognition among health professionals of the autism-anxiety link was key, he said. ""If you don't know somebody is autistic, it becomes quite hard to help them and to adapt treatment to being autistic,"" Mr Mandy said. A tailored approach can include simple changes, such as making communication easier and the environment friendlier. Caroline Norton says she and colleagues tailor their approach to patients Caroline Norton, from South London and Maudsley NHS Trust's Eating Disorder Service, said its autistic patients might have one-to-one sessions - to remove the noise of others in the same space - where they learned to make food with a dietician. Healthcare professionals can also try to make patients more comfortable. One of the service's former patients, Ms Norton said, would hardly communicate with the therapist face-to-face but would instead send a long response via email shortly after the session - so they learned from this. ""It's about meeting the individual at the level that they need,"" she added. Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

House votes to block Trump border emergencyThe bill to terminate the president's declaration now moves to the Republican-led Senate.US & Canada,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the resolution a matter of patriotism, not partisanship The US House of Representatives has voted to revoke President Donald Trump's emergency declaration over building a US-Mexico border wall. The bid to overturn the declaration now goes to the Republican-majority Senate, where some conservatives have said they will vote with Democrats. Mr Trump, who declared the emergency after Congress refused funding for the wall, has said he will veto the bill. The resolution passed the Democrat-led House by a margin of 245-182. Thirteen Republicans sided with Democrats in rejecting Mr Trump's national emergency, which suggests Congress would not have the two-thirds majority of both chambers needed to override a veto from the president. Lawmakers are using a provision from the National Emergencies Act to overrule the president, but it requires both chambers to vote for it and to complete voting within 18 days. Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan Reaction to Trump's national emergency A major land grab by Trump The president has called the situation at the southern border a ""crisis"" and on 15 February, issued a declaration of emergency in order to bypass Congress and build a wall with military funding. Democrats say the declaration is unconstitutional and that Mr Trump has manufactured the border emergency. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Monday: ""This isn't about the border. This is about the constitution of the United States. This is not about politics. It's not about partisanship. It's about patriotism."" What a difference a few years - and a new presidential administration - make. In 2014, when Barack Obama used his executive authority to defer deportation of certain classes of undocumented migrants, Democrats defended him, while Republicans howled about an abuse of presidential authority. Now it is Republicans attempting to explain President Donald Trump's use of an emergency declaration to redirect funds toward his border wall, while Democrats issue dire warnings of White House overreach. Such is the ease with which the playing field flips in American politics. The Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, joined by a handful of Republicans, have rebuked Mr Trump for this wall declaration. That sets up a showdown in the Senate, where some conservatives - particularly those up for re-election in 2020 battleground states - are uneasy about going along with what they see as a dangerous precedent. They could hand their president an embarrassing setback, forcing him to use his first veto of his administration. Then - because a congressional veto override seems unlikely - the legal battle will shift to the courts. The battle for public opinion will stay firmly in the realm of the politicians, of course. While many Republicans were critical of using an emergency declaration for a wall prior to Mr Trump's decree, some are now arguing the president is using the authority given to him by the constitution. Republican leader Mitch McConnell says the emergency is an ""understandable consequence"" of Democrats refusing to negotiate with Mr Trump House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said Republicans would uphold Mr Trump's decision and accused Democrats of ignoring the emergency at the border. Ohio Representative Warren Davidson said: ""I think he didn't necessarily have to do the emergency declaration, but he did, and it's legal,""the Washington Post reported,external. But others maintained Mr Trump's response to a lack of congressional funding was inappropriate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour row erupts over Hezbollah banBackbench MPs criticised the leadership for not taking a stronger stance against the Lebanese group.UK Politics,"Hezbollah supporters fly the group's flag in Lebanon Labour MPs have criticised their own front bench during a debate in the Commons over the proscribing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. Parts of the Lebanese group have been proscribed since 2001, with its military wing banned since 2008. The government has said it can no longer distinguish between the group's military and political wings, and will ban it in its entirety. But earlier, a Labour spokesman questioned the government's evidence. Shadow home office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour would not be opposing the motion on Tuesday night and it passed without a vote. If the decision is approved by the House of Lords, supporting Hezbollah will become an offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Mr Thomas-Symonds was criticised by Labour colleagues for not taking a stronger stance, and he declined to respond to Home Secretary Sajid Javid when asked to be clear if he supported the ban. UK to ban Hezbollah as terrorist organisation Hezbollah - translated as the Party of God - is a Shia Muslim political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It was formed as a resistance movement during the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon in the early 1980s. The militant group's capture of two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border attack led to a month-long war with Israel in 2006. But last month, its political wing was awarded three cabinet posts in the newly formed Lebanese cabinet after it made gains, alongside its allies, in the 2018 parliamentary elections. The group, which is backed by Iran, has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to support forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in battles against predominantly Sunni Muslim rebel forces and the jihadist Islamic State group. When Home Secretary Sajid Javidannounced the ban,external, he said Hezbollah was ""continuing in its attempts to destabilise the fragile situation in the Middle East"" and that he would ban ""any terrorist organisation which threatens our safety and security, whatever their motivations or ideology"". He said the group was ""committed to armed resistance to the state of Israel"" and ""continues to amass weapons in direct contravention of UN Security Council Resolutions, putting the security of the region at risk"". Before the debate, a Labour spokesman said: ""The Home Office has previously ruled that there was not sufficient evidence that the political wing of Hezbollah fell foul of proscription criteria, a position confirmed by ministers in the House of Commons last year. ""Ministers have not yet provided any clear evidence to suggest this has changed."" The spokesman also said that because the political arm was part of a democratically elected government, such a ban would interfere with diplomatic relations. Mr Thomas-Symonds said it was his job to ""provide scrutiny"" of the home secretary. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott watched on as Nick Thomas-Symonds presented Labour's position in the Commons But Labour MP Wes Streeting hit back at the comments during the debate, saying: ""There is a long and proud tradition, a strong and proud social democratic tradition, in the Labour Party of confronting and facing down murderous, hateful ideology."" Referring to Mr Thomas-Symonds, he said: ""I deeply regret that that proud tradition has not found expression at the frontbench despatch box this evening, but it will find expression on the backbenches."" And he added: ""I would just say plainly, simply and unequivocally, it is not good enough to say we won't be opposing - we should be making clear that we would troop through the lobby and vote for it if there's a division. That's what people across the country want to hear."" His colleague Louise Ellman also criticised the shadow home office minister for being ""unable to give proper, full support to the banning of this terrorist organisation Hezbollah in its entirety."" She added: ""Hezbollah are not our friends and today would have been a very good opportunity to say so."" Presenting the new measure in the Commons, Mr Javid said: ""There have long been calls to ban the whole group with the distinction between the two factions derided as smoke and mirrors. ""Hezbollah themselves have laughed off the suggestion there is a difference. ""I've carefully considered the evidence and I'm satisfied they are one and the same with the entire organisation linked to terrorism."" In addition to Hezbollah, the draft order also proscribed Ansaroul Islam and Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Muslimin (JNIM) as terrorist organisations. Ansaroul Islam and JNIM are militant Islamist groups active in West Africa - both have claimed responsibility for attacks in the region.

"Firefighters tackle huge moorland blazeOne witness describes the scene of the fire on Saddleworth Moor as ""apocalyptic"".Leeds & West Yorkshire","This video can not be played The fire could be seen for miles around Fire crews have extinguished a huge blaze on moorland in West Yorkshire. The fire, described by one witness as ""apocalyptic"", started at about 19:30 GMT on Tuesday and covered about 1.5 sq km of land near Marsden. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it was ""one of the biggest moorland fires we've ever had to deal with"". It came as the UK broke the record for the warmest winter day for a second time and on the same day as a gorse fire on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. Following a night spent tackling the blaze, near Saddleworth Moor between Huddersfield and Manchester, a fire service spokesperson said: ""The fire now looks to be out."" However, they said crews and specialist moorland firefighting units ""will remain at the scene for much of the day to tackle any further hot spots"". At its height, more than 35 firefighters were in attendance at the National Trust property and the A62 between Colne Valley and Diggle was closed as a precaution. Station manager Adam Greenwood said when crews arrived about 4 sq km of moorland was ablaze. ""It was one of the highest flame fronts we have seen, with flames of up to two metres high, and it was moving fast across the moorland,"" he said. ""The fire looks to be out however moorland fires can easily reignite so it's important that we monitor it closely. ""We expect to be at the moors for much of the day."" There have been no reports of any injuries. People living near to the scene have been advised to stay indoors and keep their doors and windows closed. But the fire service said ""risks to health are low"". BBC Yorkshire climate correspondent Paul Hudson said that, like much of the UK, the region had faced unseasonal winter temperatures. He said: ""These kind of temperatures, 18C or 19C, are what you would normally see in early June. ""There's been a prolonged abnormally warm spell and we've also had an exceptionally dry start to 2019. ""The temperature on Wednesday is also set to be pretty similar."" Pictures capture dramatic moorland fire Latest updates on moorland fire Why are there UK wildfires in February? Station commander Tony Pearson said moor fires in February were ""very unusual but not unheard of"". He said: ""We've had a few dry days and it's dried the land out a little bit."" He described the location as ""horrendous"" as it took firefighters an hour to get there due to the terrain. Mr Pearson said: ""It was really uneven ground, really difficult working conditions on there. Mike Elliot, from the National Trust, said the heather on the moorland had only just re-established itself after a blaze about three years ago. He said: ""It's gradually got back to its normal self, but unfortunately it's going to have to start again. ""What we're doing here is trying to stabilise the moorland with all the heather as that keeps all the peat out of the watercourse."" The Edinburgh gorse fire broke out at a similar time on Tuesday, andtwo large fires started within an hour of each otherin the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex earlier. In June and July last year, firefighters from 20 different brigades were drafted in to help tackle two huge moorland fires which burnt for several weeks. Firefighters spent more than a month battling a huge fire covering 18 sq km (6.9 sq miles) at Winter Hill, near Bolton. The Army was drafted in to help Greater Manchester crews deal with a blaze on Saddleworth Moor in Tameside. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"May offers MPs Brexit delay voteIf Theresa May can't get her deal through Parliament, MPs will vote on ruling out no-deal or delaying Brexit.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Theresa May: ""An extension cannot take no deal off the table."" Theresa May has promised MPs a vote on delaying the UK's departure from the EU or ruling out a no-deal Brexit, if they reject her deal next month. Mrs May made a statement to MPs about Brexit on Tuesday, amid the threat of a revolt by Remain-supporting ministers. The PM has promised MPs a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by 12 March. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of another ""grotesquely reckless"" Brexit delay. LIVE: Reaction to May's Brexit update Kuenssberg: Not quite 'simples' Reality check: How could Brexit be delayed? Pound rises amid Brexit delay speculation Brexit: All you need to know The prime minister said she will put her withdrawal agreement  - including any changes she has agreed with the EU - to a meaningful vote by 12 March. If that fails, MPs will be offered two separate votes: One, on the following day, on whether MPs support a no-deal Brexit - so the UK would ""only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in the House for that outcome"" If that fails, then MPs will get a vote by 14 March on requesting an extension to the two-year Article 50 negotiation process to delay EU withdrawal beyond 29 March ""Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article 50 extended,"" she told MPs. ""Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March."" Any extension should not go beyond the end of June and ""would almost certainly have to be a one-off"", she added. Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Mrs May said an extension ""cannot take no deal off the table"", adding:  ""The only way to do that is to revoke Article 50, which I shall not do, or agree a deal."" Extending Article 50 would require the unanimous backing of the other 27 EU member states and, she said, she had not had conversations about it with them. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May repeatedly declined to say whether she would vote against a no-deal Brexit, and whether Tory MPs would be whipped to vote for or against it. By the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar Theresa May's big concession - and it was a significant tactical retreat - was about buying herself more time. So now, under the threat of maybe 15 to 20 ministers rebelling, the prime minister's promised MPs an opportunity next month to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and force a ""limited"" delay in leaving the EU. Without that promise, there's every chance those unhappy ministers would have joined other MPs in voting to rule out no-deal and delay Brexit anyway. She did not offer ministers freedom to vote as they choose. So now the (potential) rebels must decide whether to hold fire for a fortnight, while she tries to get terms in Brussels she can sell to the Commons - hoping Brexiteers ultimately back her deal as the best Brexit available. Call it ""running down the clock"", or ""kicking the can down the road"", if you like. But kicking and running has been Mrs May's best hope for months. Several Remain-backing ministers were threatening to resign, so that they could vote for a cross-party amendment aimed at ruling out a no-deal Brexit, when MPs vote on a government motion on Wednesday. Conservative Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey said they ""welcomed"" the PM's statement but they would still table amendments paving the way for a bill to extend Article 50. They will then ""seek assurances from ministers during [the] debate to secure confirmation of the prime minister's commitments, which we hope will mean we will not push our amendments to a vote"", the pair said in a joint statement. Another of the MPs behind the amendment, Conservative Sir Oliver Letwin, had earlier said there was no need for it now, because the prime minister's statement ""does what is needed to prevent a no-deal exit on 29 March"". But opponents of Mrs May who support another EU referendum said she had still not ruled out a no-deal Brexit. The Independent Group's Anna Soubry, who quit the Conservatives in protest at their Brexit policy, said it was a ""shameful moment"" and ""nothing has changed"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry asks Theresa May if ""nothing has changed, and no deal remains firmly on the table."" Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group of Leave-backing Conservative MPs, said: ""My suspicion is that any delay to Brexit is a plot to stop Brexit. ""This would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit."" Speaking after a meeting with Theresa May, DUP Leader Arlene Foster said the PM had to deliver on her commitment to get legally-binding changes to her EU withdrawal agreement. ""Experience in Northern Ireland has shown that extending deadlines does nothing to encourage a deal,"" she said. The EU had it ""in their hands"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit, she added, and come up with a deal which MPs can support. ""It's time for Dublin and Brussels to be in a deal-making mode,"" she said. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM's handling of Brexit negotiations ""grotesquely reckless"" Jeremy Corbyn said he had ""lost count"" of the prime minister's explanations for her ""grotesquely reckless"" Brexit delays. ""The prime minister continues to say it is her deal or no deal, but this House has decisively rejected her deal and has clearly rejected no deal,"" he told MPs. ""It is the prime minister's obstinacy that is blocking a resolution."" Mr Corbyn says Labour will get behind another EU referendum if the party can't get its own Brexit proposals through Parliament on Wednesday. If Mrs May's Brexit deal gets through Parliament next month, Labour wants it to be put to a public vote - with remaining in the EU as the other option. Put May's deal to public vote - Labour The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mrs May ""could not be trusted"" not to ""dodge"" another meaningful vote. He said: ""It's the height of irresponsibility for any government to threaten its citizens with these consequences. ""Rule out no deal, extend Article 50, but do it today - this should not be left until the middle of March."" But Mrs May surprised the House by quoting a TV advert in her response: ""If he wants to end the uncertainty and deal with the issues he raised...then he should vote for a deal. Simples.""

Rail passengers 'face another difficult year',"Rail passengers face ""another difficult year"" with more major timetable changes and engineering works, MPs warn. Government management must improve ""considerably"" ahead of the changes, a Public Accounts Committee report found. It said passengers suffered ""significant financial and emotional costs"" during problems last year and they risk ""continuing to pay the price"" for strategic failures. The government said a ""root-and-branch"" review of the railways was under way. But the PAC said the Department for Transport still had ""a way to go"" before Network Rail - which manages tracks and other infrastructure - and train operators work together in a way that minimises disruption during infrastructure projects. Trains chaos: What's really going on? Broken rail disrupts trains across country Last May, Network Rail attempted to roll out timetable changes which affected 46% of all services. The report found it caused ""unprecedented disruption"" for weeks across the south-east and north of England. Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern failed to run 780 scheduled services on average each day, the equivalent of one in 10 trains. Other services were ""significantly delayed and overcrowded"". Rail users expressed their frustrations at Manchester Piccadilly At the time, passengerstold the BBC how the problems affected them. One, Rebecca Pipe, from Rochdale, said her health was suffering, because travelling home from Manchester Victoria after treatment for breast cancer was ""horrible and incredibly stressful"". Another passenger, Karen Bregan, who suffers from back problems, said having to stand on trains every day into Manchester left her ""really stressed and uncomfortable"". The PAC report warns that even more timetable changes than last May are expected 12 months on, with ""significant changes"" also due in December. The report also found: The DfT's management of the railway continues to be characterised by cost overruns, project delays and disruption There is not enough transparency about what service improvements passengers can expect More transparency is needed over the levels of profit rail companies can make More should be done to ensure passengers with disabilities are getting the support they need Beyond rail, more clarity is needed about how some road investment projects will now be funded A report published by the regulator Office of Rail and Road (ORR) in September said ""no-one took charge"" during the timetable last year's travel chaos. It said track manager Network Rail, two train operators and the DfT ""had all made mistakes"". But ORR chair Prof Stephen Glaister told the BBC ""it was unclear"" who should have the responsibility for tackling the problems. DfT said last summer's disruption was ""unacceptable"" and the Glaister Report's initial findings had helped deliver timetable changes more successfully in December. ""The independently-chaired root-and-branch review of our railway is considering all parts of the rail industry to ensure the focus is on putting passengers first.

Labour row erupts over Hezbollah ban,"Hezbollah supporters fly the group's flag in Lebanon Labour MPs have criticised their own front bench during a debate in the Commons over the proscribing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. Parts of the Lebanese group have been proscribed since 2001, with its military wing banned since 2008. The government has said it can no longer distinguish between the group's military and political wings, and will ban it in its entirety. But earlier, a Labour spokesman questioned the government's evidence. Shadow home office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour would not be opposing the motion on Tuesday night and it passed without a vote. If the decision is approved by the House of Lords, supporting Hezbollah will become an offence carrying a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Mr Thomas-Symonds was criticised by Labour colleagues for not taking a stronger stance, and he declined to respond to Home Secretary Sajid Javid when asked to be clear if he supported the ban. UK to ban Hezbollah as terrorist organisation Hezbollah - translated as the Party of God - is a Shia Muslim political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It was formed as a resistance movement during the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon in the early 1980s. The militant group's capture of two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border attack led to a month-long war with Israel in 2006. But last month, its political wing was awarded three cabinet posts in the newly formed Lebanese cabinet after it made gains, alongside its allies, in the 2018 parliamentary elections. The group, which is backed by Iran, has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to support forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in battles against predominantly Sunni Muslim rebel forces and the jihadist Islamic State group. When Home Secretary Sajid Javidannounced the ban,external, he said Hezbollah was ""continuing in its attempts to destabilise the fragile situation in the Middle East"" and that he would ban ""any terrorist organisation which threatens our safety and security, whatever their motivations or ideology"". He said the group was ""committed to armed resistance to the state of Israel"" and ""continues to amass weapons in direct contravention of UN Security Council Resolutions, putting the security of the region at risk"". Before the debate, a Labour spokesman said: ""The Home Office has previously ruled that there was not sufficient evidence that the political wing of Hezbollah fell foul of proscription criteria, a position confirmed by ministers in the House of Commons last year. ""Ministers have not yet provided any clear evidence to suggest this has changed."" The spokesman also said that because the political arm was part of a democratically elected government, such a ban would interfere with diplomatic relations. Mr Thomas-Symonds said it was his job to ""provide scrutiny"" of the home secretary. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott watched on as Nick Thomas-Symonds presented Labour's position in the Commons But Labour MP Wes Streeting hit back at the comments during the debate, saying: ""There is a long and proud tradition, a strong and proud social democratic tradition, in the Labour Party of confronting and facing down murderous, hateful ideology."" Referring to Mr Thomas-Symonds, he said: ""I deeply regret that that proud tradition has not found expression at the frontbench despatch box this evening, but it will find expression on the backbenches."" And he added: ""I would just say plainly, simply and unequivocally, it is not good enough to say we won't be opposing - we should be making clear that we would troop through the lobby and vote for it if there's a division. That's what people across the country want to hear."" His colleague Louise Ellman also criticised the shadow home office minister for being ""unable to give proper, full support to the banning of this terrorist organisation Hezbollah in its entirety."" She added: ""Hezbollah are not our friends and today would have been a very good opportunity to say so."" Presenting the new measure in the Commons, Mr Javid said: ""There have long been calls to ban the whole group with the distinction between the two factions derided as smoke and mirrors. ""Hezbollah themselves have laughed off the suggestion there is a difference. ""I've carefully considered the evidence and I'm satisfied they are one and the same with the entire organisation linked to terrorism."" In addition to Hezbollah, the draft order also proscribed Ansaroul Islam and Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Muslimin (JNIM) as terrorist organisations. Ansaroul Islam and JNIM are militant Islamist groups active in West Africa - both have claimed responsibility for attacks in the region.

French retailer cancels sports hijab sale,"The French-owned firm claims to be the world's largest sporting goods retailer French sportswear retailer Decathlon has scrapped plans to sell a hijab for women runners in France following a public outcry. The firm said it had decided to suspend the product following ""a wave of insults"" and ""unprecedented threats"". French politicians said the ""running hijab"" contradicted the country's secular values, and some lawmakers suggested a boycott of the brand. Decathlon initially stood by the hijab, which is already for sale in Morocco. The issues of how Muslim women dress in public has often stoked controversy in France. The Islamic veil across Europe Why some Muslim women wear the veil What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? ""We are making the decision... to not market this product in France at this time,"" Decathlon spokesman Xavier Rivoire told RTL radio on Tuesday. He had earlier told AFP news agency that the initial decision was to ""make sport accessible for all women in the world"". Demand for the product began in Morocco, where it is well received The plain, lightweight headscarf, which covers the hair and not the face, was to go on sale in 49 countries from March. Sports equipment manufacturer Nike has marketed a sports hijab in France since 2017. The French-owned company said it had received 500 calls and emails to complain about its ""running hijab"", with some of its staff in stores being insulted, and even physically threatened. Health Minister AgnÃ¨s Buzyn told RTL that although such a product is not prohibited in France, ""it's a vision of women that I don't share. I would prefer if a French brand did not promote the headscarf"". The spokeswoman for President Emmanuel Macron's La RÃ©publique en Marche partyAurore BergÃ© also weighed in on the issue on Twitter,external, suggesting a boycott. ""My choice as a woman and citizen will be to no longer put my trust in a brand that breaks away from our values,"" she said. Replying to Ms BergÃ© on Twitter,external, Decathlon said: ""Our goal is simple: to offer [women who run with an often unsuitable hijab] an adapted sport product, without judgement."" Later, the sporting goods giant said it wanted to restore peace after the ""violent"" reaction ""went beyond our desire to meet the needs of our customers"". France argues any outward religious symbol, such as the veil, does not maintain the appearance of neutrality required of students and public sector workers under the country's strict laws for secularism. The Muslim headscarf is allowed in public spaces in France, but has been banned in state schools and some public buildings since 2004. Part bikini, part burqa, the burqini swimsuit sparked huge controversy in France In 2016, multiple French regions banned the burkini - a full-body swimsuit - from its beaches.The bans were later ruled illegal by France's highest court. Burkini ban boosts online sales 'by 200%' EU ruling could force hijabis out of work Muslim women respond to 'burkini' ban These bans led rights groups of accusing France of Islamophobia and stigmatising Muslim women, after already banning full-face coverings in 2010.
