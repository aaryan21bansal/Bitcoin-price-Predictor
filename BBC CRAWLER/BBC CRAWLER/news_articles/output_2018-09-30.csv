School to ban bikes without number platesVideoVideoChoir 'makes me feel safe'NI police face tribunal over beard policyVideoVideoThreat to the 'black Christ of Alabama',"Head teacher Amit Amin says the policy will help people report pupils who cycle dangerously Children have been told they will be banned from cycling to their south London school if they do not put number plates on their bikes. Teachers at Stanley Park High, in Carshalton, are introducing the scheme so members of the public can report pupils cycling dangerously. The secondary school said the main aim was to keep children safe. Charity Cycling UK questioned why Stanley Park High ""want to make cycling to school more difficult"". On the school's website,head teacher Amit Amin wrote,external: ""All students who cycle to school will be required to display a school-issued bicycle number plate when riding to and from school. ""Students without a number plate will not be permitted to cycle to school, or lock their bicycles on school grounds."" Mr Amin said the measure was in response to incidents of children cycling in a way that ""endangers themselves and others"". A school statement added: ""Our absolute priority is the safety of our students, and the aim of this initiative is simply to ensure their safety as they travel to and from school."" The plates are being introduced on 1 October as part of a scheme to encourage cycling, which includes subsidised bike lights and maintenance workshops. Latest news and stories from London Duncan Dollimore, of Cycling UK, said Mr Amin's actions were ""part of a trend of head teachers trespassing on parental responsibilities"". Mr Dollimore said schools should focus on encouraging local authorities to adopt 20mph speed limits and traffic-calming measures instead of making ""cycling to school more difficult"". Schools across England have imposed various restrictions recently, includingcycling safety testsandmandatory helmets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

NI police face tribunal over beard policyVideoVideoThreat to the 'black Christ of Alabama',"A police policy brought in this year requires officers working with breathing apparatus to ""remain clean shaven whilst on duty"" A police officer is taking an industrial tribunal case against the PSNI over a ban on facial hair. It follows a police review of the force's policies in 2017. This resulted in a change regarding officers required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE) at short notice as part of their duties. The updated policy - implemented this year - requires these officers to ""remain clean shaven whilst on duty"" for health and safety reasons. The policy is to be challenged at an industrial tribunal scheduled to begin in November. Solicitor Niall McMullan, who is representing the officer, said the case focuses on the issues of sex discrimination and proportionality. ""He has worked in his particular division of the PSNI for six years and he will state he is yet to wear the relevant safety mask,"" said Mr McMullan. ""To request he now remain entirely clean shaven and remove from him the personal choice of having a moustache, does not appear proportionate or capable of being justified. ""Furthermore, he is concerned how this new policy is being implemented against men, whilst other sections of the policy, which are arguably more applicable to women, are being breached without action taken. ""My client will also state the manner in which the PSNI sought his adherence to the said policy, was victimisation."" Superintendent Patricia Foy from the PSNI's Operational Policy Department said: ""Officers and staff within certain roles are required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE) as a means of control to prevent the inhalation of hazardous substances at work. ""When worn and correctly used, RPE can prevent serious lung conditions caused by inhaling dust and other contaminants. Supt Foy said a range of guidance had been given as part of a review of the PSNI's corporate appearance and protective equipment standard policy in 2017. ""A study by the Health and Safety Executive indicated that 'as facial hair is grown, the protection offered by a tight-fitting mask reduces'. ""As a result, a change was made in relation to officers and staff who carry out those roles. ""The updated policy requires that those officers and staff who may be required at short notice to wear RPE must remain clean shaven whilst on duty."" Supt Foy said the new policy was developed in consultation with the Police Federation ""and other key stakeholders"".

Huge surge in Indonesia quake toll,"This video can not be played It is feared many people remain trapped in collapsed buildings At least 832 people were killed in the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the national disaster agency says. Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference. The quake triggered tsunami waves as high as 6m (20ft), he added. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said the final death toll could be thousands. Rescuers have been digging by hand in the search for survivors in the city of Palu. ""What we now desperately need is heavy machinery to clear the rubble. I have my staff on the ground, but it's impossible just to rely on their strength alone to clear this,"" Muhammad Syaugi, head of the national search-and-rescue agency, told AFP news agency. There have also been concerns about the town of Donggala, where the impact is still unclear. In pictures: Search for survivors The Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected by the earthquake and tsunami which it described as a tragedy that ""could get much worse"". Strong aftershocks have continued to hit the island since Friday's earthquake. President Joko Widodo visited Palu to view sites affected by the disaster, including Talise Beach - the main tourist area that was badly affected by the tsunami. ""I know there are many problems that need to be solved in a short time, including communications,"" he said. Many remain missing in the city of 335,000, some thought to be trapped in the debris of collapsed buildings. Rescue teams dug by hand to free 24 people trapped in the rubble of the Roa-Roa hotel in the city of Palu, but there are fears that dozens more remain trapped. The tsunami left a trail of destruction Bodies have been lying in city streets and the injured are being treated in tents because of damage to hospitals. Anxious survivors in Palu bedded down in the open air on Saturday night, heeding advice by officials not to return to their homes as a precaution. ""It feels very tense,"" Risa Kusuma, who was with her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre, told AFP. ""Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies. Clean water is scarce. The minimarkets are looted everywhere."" By Rebecca Henschke, in Poso In Poso, a four-hour drive from Palu, supplies are running out. State-owned petrol stations have closed as they have run dry. People are queuing up at roadside stalls, buying petrol in bottles to take into the affected area and to find missing loved ones. Supermarkets have limited food left and it is difficult to find bottled water. Ermi Liana, who is travelling with our BBC team, doesn't know if her parents are alive. ""They live close to a bridge that collapsed. I can't reach them by phone,"" she says. ""I can only pray they are alive."" We haven't seen any aid heading in and there is still no communication link to the town of Donggala. The 7.5 magnitude quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10km (6.2 miles),externaljust off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT), triggering a tsunami, US monitors say. Many people were on the beach in Palu, preparing for a festival, and were caught when waves swept in. Video shows people screaming and fleeing in panic. As well as destroying homes, the quake wrecked a shopping centre, a mosque, a hotel and a road bridge. An air traffic controller at Palu airport died ensuring a plane took off safely after the quake. This video can not be played The moment the tsunami hit When the quake hit, ""we all panicked and ran out of the house,"" Anser Bachmid, 39, told AFP news agency. ""People here need aid - food, drink, clean water. We don't know what to eat for dinner tonight."" ""I just ran when I saw the waves hitting homes on the coastline,"" Palu resident Rusidanto said. Dwi Haris, who was in the city for a wedding, was staying in a hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake struck. ""There was no time to save ourselves,"",externalhe told the Associated Press news agency. ""I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall... I heard my wife cry for help but then silence. I don't know what happened to her and my child. I hope they are safe."" With back and shoulder injuries, he is being treated outdoors at Palu's Army Hospital. Aid is being flown from the capital Jakarta into Palu airport, using the part of its runway still intact. Patients are being treated in the open outside city hospitals and at least one military field hospital has been erected. The regional head of the Indonesian Doctors Association (IDI), Komang, asked the authorities for immediate help. ""We need tents, medicines, medical personnel, tarpaulins, blankets and more of other things,"" he said. The UK-based charity Save the Children is sending an assessment team to the disaster zone. ""Unfortunately the more information that we're getting, the worse the situation appears to be,"" charity spokesman Tom Howells told the BBC from Jakarta. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

Dozens feared trapped under quake rubble,"This video can not be played Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" A picture of large-scale destruction is emerging in and around the Indonesian city of Palu after an earthquake and tsunami struck on Friday. At least 844 people are confirmed to have died but that figure is expected to rise sharply as more remote areas are reached. The authorities have said they will begin burying victims in mass graves, fearing disease could begin to spread. Dozens of people are thought to be trapped alive under the rubble. In Palu, rescuers are awaiting heavy machinery to search the ruins of a hotel and a shopping centre as aftershocks made it unsafe for them to go in. ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Air traffic controller hailed as quake hero In pictures: Search for survivors A tsunami warning had been issued after the magnitude-7.5 earthquake hit on Friday, but it is unclear whether it was still in place when the waves hit. Videos show people screaming as 6m-high waves power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the region to urge a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors. Mr Widodo has also agreed to accept international help for disaster response and relief, Thomas Lembong, the head of the Indonesian investment board said on Twitter on Monday. Meanwhile, Indonesia's justice ministry is reporting that 1,200 convicts escaped from three different detention facilities in the Sulawesi region following the earthquake and tsunami.

By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu Lying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Read Rebecca's first full report from the disaster zone Blocked roads, a damaged airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. Roads crumbled as the ground underneath gave way ""We don't know for sure what is the impact,"" said Mr Nugroho. Local media report that mobile phone signals have been detected in the rubble of the shopping mall in Palu, and shouts have been heard under the debris of the Roa Roa Hotel. Dozens of people were known to be inside the Roa Roa hotel One volunteer, Thalib Bawano, told AFP news agency that three people had been rescued from the hotel rubble, where more than 50 people may be trapped. ""We also heard voices at several points, including a child,"" he said. ""They were asking for help, but they are still there till now. We gave them motivation... so they can have spirit because they are trapped between life and death."" ""We gave them water and food but that's not what they wanted. They wanted to get out. 'We want to get out, out, out. Help! Help!' they kept screaming. That's what we heard. Some were just knocking."" In Palu, people have been sleeping in the open, wary of returning to their homes, even if they are still intact. With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. ""What you'll see, you know, as the days go by and people don't have access to adequate hygiene supplies, shelter, you'll see the situation deteriorate if they don't get that access so, we've sent shelter kits,"" Tom Howells, programme director for Save The Children, said on Sunday. Military aircraft have been evacuating some of the injured A shattered mosque in Palu With supplies limited, people have been raiding damaged shops for food, water and medicine. ""We don't have any other choice, we must get food,"" one man told AFP. Meanwhile mass graves are being dug, one of them for up to 300 bodies. The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles),externaljust off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami, US monitors say. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected. A sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. It remains unclear why it was not effective this time, but Mr Nugroho said Indonesia's part of the network has suffered from a lack of funding.

Mum and daughter stab death victims named,"Police were called by paramedics to a house in Carpenters Lane just after 07:40 BST on Saturday The family of a mother and daughter who died in a stabbing in a Kent village have said they are ""too shocked"" to comprehend their loss. Margaret Harris, in her 70s, and her daughter Sharon, in her 50s, died at their home in Hadlow early on Saturday. Margaret's husband David needed to be airlifted to hospital with serious injuries after also being stabbed. Jack Ralph, 28, from Hadlow, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. Mr Ralph, of Carpenters Lane, is due to appear before Medway magistrates on Monday. Forensic teams were sent to the scene in Hadlow Doris Pope, the sister of Margaret Harris, said: ""We are just too shocked and haven't quite come to terms with it."" Neighbours described the stabbing as ""truly horrific"" and something that had ""rocked"" the ""quiet and friendly"" village near Tonbridge. One local resident, Margaret Maile, 63, described the couple as ""quiet but pleasant"". ""They've lived here longer than us and we've been here 32 years,"" she said. ""It's very sad, you just don't expect something like this to happen here."" Neighbours said the couple had lived in the area for many years Nigel Keogh, a 51-year-old plasterer who lives across the street from the victims, described Mr and Mrs Harris as a ""nice couple"", adding: ""They kept themselves to themselves. They own a big campervan and would go out on trips in it."" On Sunday, Reverend Paul White led prayers in the street and said the village's St Mary's Church was open to mourners all day on Monday.

Ronaldo denies rape claim as 'fake news',"The Portuguese superstar now plays for Italy's Juventus Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed as ""fake news"" accusations by a US woman who alleges she was raped by the Portuguese footballer in 2009. In an Instagram video, Ronaldo said: ""They want to promote [themselves] by [using] my name. It's normal."" Ronaldo's lawyers say they will sue Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, which originally reported the allegations. The magazine wrote that Kathryn Mayorga had claimed Ronaldo, 33, raped her in a hotel room in Las Vegas. Ms Mayorga, 34, is reported to have filed a rape report with Las Vegas police shortly after the alleged incident. In 2010, she reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Her lawyers are now seeking to declare the non-disclosure agreement void. In a statement, Ronaldo's lawyer Christian Schertz said ""the reporting in Spiegel is blatantly illegal"". He added that he had been instructed to seek compensation for ""moral damages"" over ""probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years"". Ronaldo ready for Juventus challenge Ronaldo 'to accept fine and suspended jail term' in tax case Ronaldo joined Italy's Juventus from Real Madrid for Â£99.2m earlier this year.

Kellyanne Conway: I was sexually assaulted,"Kellyanne Conway managed Donald Trump's election campaign White House adviser Kellyanne Conway has revealed that she was sexually assaulted as a younger woman. ""I'm a victim of sexual assault,"" she told CNN without giving details. Ms Conway, 51, has hinted previously that she was molested by Congressmen. The comment came as she was defending President Trump's embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing allegations of sexual assault. ""I feel very empathetic... towards victims of sexual assault,"" she said. Profile: Trump's choice for Supreme Court Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words What will FBI inquiry actually look into? The Senate vote on Mr Kavanaugh's nomination was delayed dramatically this week when the president ordered further FBI background checks on his character. In an earlier confirmation hearing watched by millions in the US and around the world, Dr Christine Blasey Ford accused the judge of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. The FBI is also investigating an allegation of historic sexual misconduct made by at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez. It is not the first time that she has spoken of prior sexual assault. Ms Conway raised the issue in 2016 while managing Mr Trump's election campaign, passionately defending him when asked in an MSNBC interview about his record in dealing with women. ""I would talk to some of the members of Congress out there,"",externalshe said. ""When I was younger and prettier, them rubbing up against girls, sticking their tongues down women's throats, uninvited, who didn't like it."" In 2017,she described that interview as her ""#MeToo moment"",external, but said that ""nobody cared"" about it due to her political views. Ms Conway made her latest disclosure to CNN's Jake Tapper on his State of the Union news show, saying:""I feel very empathetic, frankly, towards victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape."",external ""I'm a victim of sexual assault. I don't expect Judge Kavanaugh, or Jake Tapper, or Jeff Flake, or anybody, to be held responsible for that. You have to be responsible for your own conduct,"" she added. ""We do treat people differently who are either the victims or the perpetrators of this based on their politics now, based on their gender. That is a huge mistake."" Allow Twitter content?

N Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim,"This video can not be played A rare instance of a defector fleeing through the demilitarised zone was captured on CCTV in 2017 The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said. Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011. Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors. Pyongyang has made no public comments. The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship. My friend the North Korean defector Tough reality for North Korean defectors Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas. China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them. Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months. Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations. Seeing through Kim's new friendly image How Kim the outcast became popular North Korea's missile and nuclear programme This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula. But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then. ""Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,"" Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.

New advice for children on social media,"Medical experts have been told to draw up advice on the maximum amount of time young people should spend on social media, the health secretary has said. In an interview with the Observer,external, father-of-three Matt Hancock said he was ""very worried"" about the impact on children's mental health. He said he hoped the guidelines would become the ""norm"", like the recommended maximum alcohol consumption for adults. England's chief medical officer has been asked to put together the advice. Mr Hancock told the newspaper: ""I am, as a father, very worried about the growing evidence of the impact of social media on children's mental health. ""Unrestricted use (of social media) by younger children risks being very damaging to their mental health. ""So I have asked the chief medical officer to bring forward formal guidance on its use by children."" Instagram 'worst for young mental health' Is social media making your child sad? Would you log off social media for a month? Confessions of a smartphone addict Mr Hancock believes guidelines could empower parents to enforce sensible time limits and explain them to children. ""As a parent you want to be able to say, 'The rules say you shouldn't use social media for more than a certain period of time,'"" he said. Earlier this year, the former culture secretary became the first MP tolaunch his own smart phone app, where fans and constituents can discuss community issues. He criticised Facebook and Instagram for not enforcing their rules on age limits and asked Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer, to bring forward guidance on the minimum ages for users of different sites. England Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, has welcomed advice on screen time and age for children and parents alike. And NHS England said it was right to highlight social media's role in a rise in young people's mental health issues. But the Centre for Mental Health charity has said that debate around social media and mental health is ""polarised and often lacking in evidence"". ""Blaming social media for mental health difficulties with many complex causes simply alienates the young people whose lives are being debated and social media companies who could do more to help young people to thrive,"" chief executive Sarah Hughes said. Campaigner and TES columnist Natasha Devon accused policymakers of using social media as a ""catch-all bogeyman,external"" and said that austerity measures and changes to the education system also affected children's mental health.

Foreign buyers could face new housing tax,"About 4,750 people are estimated to have slept rough on any given night in England in 2017 Foreign property buyers will face an extra tax with the money raised being spent on tackling rough sleeping, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. She said foreign buyers could face a surcharge of 1% or 3% on top of stamp duty to stop them driving up UK prices. Rough sleeping has been rising for the past seven years that the Conservatives have been in government. Homelessness charity Shelter said the housing crisis will remain until more social housing is built. Stamp duty is a tax on properties worth more than Â£125,000. ""The money we raise from this extra stamp duty is going to be spent on dealing with the issue of rough sleeping,"" Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme. Is this the solution to the UK's housing problem? Seaside break from homelessness 'You can't solve homelessness without homes' Mrs May said evidence showed that foreign buyers who do not pay tax in the UK push up house prices and lower home ownership in the UK. Rough sleeping is defined by the government as sleeping in the open air - parks, streets, doorways or bus shelters - or people who sleep in buildings that were not designed for habitation. About 4,750 people are estimated to have slept rough on any given night in England in 2017. Most councils provide an estimate based on intelligence from local services but some conduct a count of the number of people seen sleeping rough on a single night. ""We've sadly seen roughly sleeping going up recently, which is why it is is important we are taking a number of actions,"" Mrs May said from Birmingham, where her party's annual conference has begun. ""We've already put money in to projects to ensure that we are helping those who are sleeping rough, this will enable more money to be put in."" Mrs May highlighted projects such as theHousing First model, being piloted in the West Midlands, which sees rough sleepers given a home, rather than shelters. In August, the government announceda Â£100m strategy to tackle rough sleepingon English streets, but it was criticised as it became apparent no new money was being invested. This video can not be played Four stories of rough sleeping in England The Conservatives say this policy would help British residents ""get the right home for them"" and ""end the scourge of rough sleeping for good"". It is unclear when the new rates would be introduced. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Conservatives were ""desperately trying to play catch up"" with a ""rehash"" of his party's proposals from Labour's 2017 manifesto. ""Unlike the Tories' proposal this weekend, Labour's fully costed offshore company property levy targeted the tax avoiders and those seeking to speculate on UK property markets,"" he added. While Shelter welcomed the proposed funding, it said it was ""a national disgrace that so many of our fellow citizens are still sleeping rough in modern Britain"". ""We need to understand that the housing crisis will remain for as long as we fail to build more social homes to give people a secure and affordable way to live,"" the charity said. In 2016-17, about 217,000 new homes were built in England - almost a third short of the government's target of 300,000.

Tax on foreign buyers to tackle homelessness,"About 4,750 people are estimated to have slept rough on any given night in England in 2017 Foreign property buyers will face an extra tax with the money raised being spent on tackling rough sleeping, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. She said foreign buyers could face a surcharge of 1% or 3% on top of stamp duty to stop them driving up UK prices. Rough sleeping has been rising for the past seven years that the Conservatives have been in government. Homelessness charity Shelter said the housing crisis will remain until more social housing is built. Stamp duty is a tax on properties worth more than Â£125,000. ""The money we raise from this extra stamp duty is going to be spent on dealing with the issue of rough sleeping,"" Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme. Is this the solution to the UK's housing problem? Seaside break from homelessness 'You can't solve homelessness without homes' Mrs May said evidence showed that foreign buyers who do not pay tax in the UK push up house prices and lower home ownership in the UK. Rough sleeping is defined by the government as sleeping in the open air - parks, streets, doorways or bus shelters - or people who sleep in buildings that were not designed for habitation. About 4,750 people are estimated to have slept rough on any given night in England in 2017. Most councils provide an estimate based on intelligence from local services but some conduct a count of the number of people seen sleeping rough on a single night. ""We've sadly seen roughly sleeping going up recently, which is why it is is important we are taking a number of actions,"" Mrs May said from Birmingham, where her party's annual conference has begun. ""We've already put money in to projects to ensure that we are helping those who are sleeping rough, this will enable more money to be put in."" Mrs May highlighted projects such as theHousing First model, being piloted in the West Midlands, which sees rough sleepers given a home, rather than shelters. In August, the government announceda Â£100m strategy to tackle rough sleepingon English streets, but it was criticised as it became apparent no new money was being invested. This video can not be played Four stories of rough sleeping in England The Conservatives say this policy would help British residents ""get the right home for them"" and ""end the scourge of rough sleeping for good"". It is unclear when the new rates would be introduced. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Conservatives were ""desperately trying to play catch up"" with a ""rehash"" of his party's proposals from Labour's 2017 manifesto. ""Unlike the Tories' proposal this weekend, Labour's fully costed offshore company property levy targeted the tax avoiders and those seeking to speculate on UK property markets,"" he added. While Shelter welcomed the proposed funding, it said it was ""a national disgrace that so many of our fellow citizens are still sleeping rough in modern Britain"". ""We need to understand that the housing crisis will remain for as long as we fail to build more social homes to give people a secure and affordable way to live,"" the charity said. In 2016-17, about 217,000 new homes were built in England - almost a third short of the government's target of 300,000. Labour party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""The Tories are offering watered down, half-baked policies that don't begin to compare with Labour's radical plan to rebuild Britain after years of austerity.""

Ronaldo denies rape claim as 'fake news'The Portuguese footballer responds to claims by a US woman that he raped her in Las Vegas in 2009.Europe,"The Portuguese superstar now plays for Italy's Juventus Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed as ""fake news"" accusations by a US woman who alleges she was raped by the Portuguese footballer in 2009. In an Instagram video, Ronaldo said: ""They want to promote [themselves] by [using] my name. It's normal."" Ronaldo's lawyers say they will sue Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, which originally reported the allegations. The magazine wrote that Kathryn Mayorga had claimed Ronaldo, 33, raped her in a hotel room in Las Vegas. Ms Mayorga, 34, is reported to have filed a rape report with Las Vegas police shortly after the alleged incident. In 2010, she reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Her lawyers are now seeking to declare the non-disclosure agreement void. In a statement, Ronaldo's lawyer Christian Schertz said ""the reporting in Spiegel is blatantly illegal"". He added that he had been instructed to seek compensation for ""moral damages"" over ""probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years"". Ronaldo ready for Juventus challenge Ronaldo 'to accept fine and suspended jail term' in tax case Ronaldo joined Italy's Juventus from Real Madrid for Â£99.2m earlier this year.

Russian woman 'identifies' Salisbury suspectA woman in the Russian village of Beryozovka tells the BBC she recognises the Salisbury suspect.Europe,"The Bellingcat website released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) A woman in the far east of Russia has told the BBC she recognises one of the key suspects in the Salisbury attack as a military intelligence officer. The woman identified him immediately from photographs as Anatoliy Chepiga, a decorated ""Hero of Russia"". Her assertion supports research by the Bellingcat online investigations team,which also identified Col Chepiga,externalas one of the Salisbury suspects. The man told Russian state TV he was Ruslan Boshirov, a civilian. The BBC understands that British officials do not dispute the findings by Bellingcat. British police believe the suspects were not using their real names. Russia denies any involvement in the Novichok nerve agent attack, in which former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned on 4 March. Skripal suspect was 'honoured by Putin' The website behind the Skripal revelation Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? A BBC team travelled some 5,000 miles east of Moscow to the village of Beryozovka, where Anatoliy Chepiga grew up, close to Russia's border with China. This video can not be played A BBC team showed photographs to residents in Anatoliy Chepiga's old village There, a woman identified a young Anatoliy in the photographs discovered and published by Bellingcat. She then confirmed that a mugshot released by British police of ""Ruslan Boshirov"" was also Col Chepiga. ""I know where his parents used to live, that he was a military man. An officer. He fought in war zones, then he was in Moscow,"" she told the BBC - the first foreign journalists to visit since the Bellingcat report. Nervous about speaking, she asked to remain anonymous, but said she had seen Col Chepiga as an adult, with his child, and she was sure he and ""Boshirov"" were one and the same. She added: ""It's him in the photos, of course."" Locals say the family moved out of Beryozovka several years ago. Villagers told the BBC that Col Chepiga's family no longer live in Beryozovka While Col Chepiga's parents were well known, he was not a regular visitor himself as an adult. Many residents had no idea what he looked like. Not all had heard of the Salisbury poisoning. One man who had, and studied with Anatoliy Chepiga at the village school, swore at the BBC team and claimed the allegations were false. He instructed another local not to talk to journalists. An elderly woman, speaking only through her window, was non-committal about the photographs, insisting that images could be doctored. She did not want to give her name but could not believe the ""horrible story"" about someone she said she had ""valued, respected and liked"". That woman confirmed Anatoliy Chepiga was a ""Hero of Russia"", a title bestowed by the country's president. The BBC showed photos of the Salisbury suspect to various villagers in Beryozovka, Russia On Friday, Vladimir Putin's spokesman said he had ""no information"" about any such person being decorated. He declined to say whether that meant the award was for secret missions. The announcement, though, is still included on the webpage of a local veterans group. The group's leader told the BBC the information on Col Chepiga was sent to them for inclusion. No one there knew him personally. At the construction company the BBC Russian service believes was founded and run by Col Chepiga's father in the 1990s, staff would not speak to journalists. When we called a mobile phone number linked to the parents, a man picked up and claimed to be from Uzbekistan. He said he had bought the phone ""on the street"" three months ago from ""a Russian"". The line was then disconnected. Two weeks ago, President Putin himself said the suspects wanted by British police were civilians. Nothing special and nothing criminal, he said. On Friday, his spokesman told journalists that the Kremlin would not discuss any further what he called ""informal investigations"" into the poisoning. But the questions over Russia's explanations, and the true identity of the Salisbury suspects, are only mounting. Additional research by the BBC Russian service.

"N Korea defector numbers 'drop' under KimTighter border controls and price hikes by smugglers are key factors, a South Korean MP says.Asia","This video can not be played A rare instance of a defector fleeing through the demilitarised zone was captured on CCTV in 2017 The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said. Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011. Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors. Pyongyang has made no public comments. The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship. My friend the North Korean defector Tough reality for North Korean defectors Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas. China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them. Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months. Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations. Seeing through Kim's new friendly image How Kim the outcast became popular North Korea's missile and nuclear programme This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula. But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then. ""Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,"" Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.

Four-year paint job on college gate,"The new paintwork at Christ's College Gatehouse One of Cambridge University's imposing college gates has been restored by a paint job that has taken four years to complete. The heraldic detail, which dates from the early 1500s, had not been painted for ""many years"" and had started to look faded. The four-year project included research into the original colours and methods used, repairs, and the painting itself. College bursar David Ball said he was ""really pleased"" with the result. The Gatehouse on St Andrew's Street is the main entrance to Christ's College and is highly visible to tourists and shoppers in the city. The Great Gate at Christ's College, Cambridge, before the painting The new look gate, on St Andrew's Street, is highly visible in Cambridge city centre It was built by Lady Margaret Beaufort, the grandmother of Henry VIII, who founded the college in the early years of the 16th Century. Much of the facade, including the late 16th Century oak doors, remained largely unchanged until the masonry was refaced with harder stone in 1714. A statue of Lady Margaret was added in the 19th Century. Football rules' Cambridge 'birthplace' marked by sculpture Blumenfeld sculpture donated to university institute Mr Ball said: ""It's many years since we last repainted the gatehouse, and in total it's taken about four years to research the right colours to be used, to restore wear and tear to the stonework and then to complete the repainting itself, which was undertaken by some very skilled craftsmen and women. ""We're really pleased with the results."" The restoration was carried out by Longstanton-based Brown and Ralph, which said the conservation of the stonework would ""not only increase its natural life but also brighten the Cambridge streetscape"".

Europe thrash US to regain Ryder CupFrancesco Molinari secures the winning point as Europe regain the Ryder Cup with victory over the US.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Ryder Cup 2018: How Europe secured victory over the United States Europe thrashed the United States 17Â½-10Â½ to regain the Ryder Cup - prompting wild celebrations, tears, and one player dressing as a pillar box at Le Golf National in France. Open champion Francesco Molinari beat Phil Mickelson to get Europe to the 14Â½-point winning mark, simultaneously becoming the first European to win five points in one Ryder Cup. The Italian, who was immediately drenched in beer by celebrating fans, said it ""means more than winning majors"". Spaniard Sergio Garcia secured a victory of his own to surpass Sir Nick Faldo as the Ryder Cup's leading points scorer with 25Â½, then sobbed as he was called a ""legend"" by team-mate Justin Rose. ""I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help it, what a week,"" he said. ""It's been a rough year, but we fought hard. I'm so thankful to Thomas Bjorn for believing in me."" Tommy Fleetwood and Rory McIlroy led 'thunder clap' cheers with an exuberant 70,000-strong crowd, while captain Thomas Bjorn embraced each of his ""amazing"" players. ""Some people say golf is boring - well, this is certainly not boring,"" said Bjorn. ""I've experienced a lot of Ryder Cups but this is the top one."" His opposing captain Jim Furyk said: ""You have to tip your cap, they outplayed us."" This video can not be played Ryder Cup 2018: Captain Thomas Bjorn and the European team lift the Ryder Cup Why WhatsApp was key to Europe's victory Listen: The Cut podcast - Europe win the Ryder Cup Read: How Europe regained Ryder Cup, relive the action Read: All the results and stats Jon Rahm, Ian Poulter, Thorbjorn Olesen, Henrik Stenson and Alex Noren joined Molinari and Garcia in winning singles matches after the Americans, trailing 10-6, had threatened a comeback by winning 3Â½ of the first five points on the final day. Poulter - nicknamed 'The Postman' because he 'always delivers a point' - found a pillar-box fancy-dress outfit to the delight of the partisan crowd, then led the charge on to the 18th green when Noren holed a 35-foot putt to win the final match. That spirit has prevailed throughout the European team all week. They went in to the match as underdogs despite the US not having won in Europe since 1993. The American side boasted 31 major titles, and 11 of their players are in the world's top 17. But Le Golf National is a different course to those the Americans are used to playing on - the tight fairways and deep, penal rough, a world away from the vast majority of PGA Tour courses. Only three of the American dozen had played a competitive round at the home of the French Open before this week, and it showed as the European players, who have played in excess of 200 rounds between them, looked more at ease. This video can not be played Paul Casey, Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson feature in final day best shots The Americans put their best players out at the top of Sunday's singles order and the gamble appeared to be paying off for captain Jim Furyk with three wins and a halved match out of the first five. ""We got some momentum but the Europeans responded well as they have all week,"" said Furyk. ""Europe did a good job on a golf course they know pretty well but they did a great job playing it. They hit key shots and knocked in the clutch putts. But it's been a wonderful week."" Both the opening matches went down to the 18th, with Justin Thomas defeating McIlroy after an epic battle to put the American's first point on the board before Brooks Koepka rolled in a three-footer to share his equally entertaining match with Paul Casey - the only one of the 28 matches to end all square. This video can not be played Ryder Cup 2018: Rory McIlroy mobbed by fans in Ryder Cup victory interview McIlroy was two ahead after four holes but Thomas hit back with birdies on the eighth and 10th. They were still level on the 18th but after Thomas boomed his drive down the middle, McIlroy pushed his tee shot into a bunker. His ball plugged and he was unable to get it out with his first attempt. His third shot careered into the water to effectively end the contest, with Thomas hitting his second to eight feet. The point meant the American, who was joint eighth at the French Open earlier in the summer, finished as his team's top points scorer with four, from five matches. World number two Rose failed to recover from losing the second and third holes to Webb Simpson and was three down after eight. The Englishman birdied the par-three 16th but the American holed his second shot to close out a 3&2 win. Fleetwood, who won four matches in partnership with Molinari on Friday and Saturday, also harboured hopes of becoming the first European to win all five matches at a single Ryder Cup but they were crushed by Tony Finau. None of the first 11 holes were halved but the American won eight of them to the Englishman's three to go five ahead and he eventually won 6&4. Poulter donned a pillar box outfit while celebrating Europe's victory But then the tide turned. Poulter, so often the European to spark a momentum change, holed a birdie putt on the 14th to edge ahead of world number one Dustin Johnson in their see-saw contest and the roar reverberated around the course. Moments later, those around the 14th green were roaring again when Olesen completed an unlikely 5&4 victory over Jordan Spieth to put Europe 11Â½-9Â½ ahead. Olesen had not played since losing in the fourballs on Friday morning and his victory was built on four birdies on the front nine as he went five clear, while Spieth, who has been one of the US team's star players with three points, never recovered from three successive bogeys. Poulter, unbeaten in five previous singles matches, then went two holes up on Johnson after the American dumped his second to the par-four 15th into the water. Up on the 16th, Rahm missed a short putt to allow Tiger Woods to get back within a hole but the Spaniard nailed his approach to the 17th to four feet and holed the putt to add another blue point. Rahm punched the air in delight, striding around the green in raucous celebration, before calming himself enough to console Woods, who had waited patiently to congratulate his conqueror. This video can not be played Passionate Poulter & ruthless Rahm feature in final-day key battles The defeat left Woods, who won his first tournament in five years at the Tour Championship last week, with zero points from his four matches. Bryson DeChambeau and Mickelson also ended with zero points, while all the Europeans contributed. Johnson won the 16th to stay in touch with Poulter but the thousands gathered round the 17th green were expecting to celebrate another European point minutes later. Poulter, for once, failed to deliver, missing a six-footer to win the match. However, he strode to the final tee, smashed his drive down the middle and flicked a mid-iron to six feet, a putt conceded by Johnson, to put Europe 13Â½-9Â½ ahead and just one point from regaining the trophy. Any one of Molinari, Garcia, or Stenson could have secured the winning point - and it was the Italian who did so. The winning moment came when Mickelson, three down with three to play, hit his tee shot on the par-three 16th into the water and conceded the hole and match.

Davidson urges Tory Brexit 'silence',"Ruth Davidson has called for a ""period of silence"" among her Conservative colleagues to allow the prime minister to get a Brexit deal ""over the line"". The Scottish Tory leader said the two years following the EU referendum had provided enough time for debate. Her comments follow Boris Johnson's description of the Chequers plan as ""deranged and entirely preposterous"". She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland it was now time to get behind the prime minister. Theresa May: ""I do believe in Brexit"" What is a ""Canada-style"" trade deal? At a glance: Chequers plan As Tory activists assembled in Birmingham for their party conference, she said: ""There's been time over the last two years for debate. ""The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as November of last year. ""Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country. ""In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one."" Her comments followed another strident intervention in the Brexit debate by the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. He told the Sunday Times: ""Unlike the prime minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it's the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016."" Theresa May laterinsisted she did believe in Brexit,telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the Chequers plan had the ability to deliver a good free trade deal with the European Union. Ms Davidson also said she would go into the next election with a manifesto commitment to block a second Scottish independence referendum because in 2014 ""the people of Scotland were promised this would be a once in a generation event"". Asked about calls for another referendum on any Brexit deal, she said: ""In terms of our history in Scotland, I've been pretty vocal about the fact that you can't re-run referendums if you are a nationalist because you didn't get the result you want. ""I'd be pretty hypocritical if I said you could re-run this Brexit referendum because it wasn't the result the I argued for.""

PM plans extra tax for foreign home buyers,"About 4,750 people are estimated to have slept rough on any given night in England in 2017 Foreign property buyers will face an extra tax with the money raised being spent on tackling rough sleeping, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. She said foreign buyers could face a surcharge of 1% or 3% on top of stamp duty to stop them driving up UK prices. Rough sleeping has been rising for the past seven years that the Conservatives have been in government. Homelessness charity Shelter said the housing crisis will remain until more social housing is built. Stamp duty is a tax on properties worth more than Â£125,000. ""The money we raise from this extra stamp duty is going to be spent on dealing with the issue of rough sleeping,"" Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme. Is this the solution to the UK's housing problem? Seaside break from homelessness 'You can't solve homelessness without homes' Mrs May said evidence showed that foreign buyers who do not pay tax in the UK push up house prices and lower home ownership in the UK. Rough sleeping is defined by the government as sleeping in the open air - parks, streets, doorways or bus shelters - or people who sleep in buildings that were not designed for habitation. About 4,750 people are estimated to have slept rough on any given night in England in 2017. Most councils provide an estimate based on intelligence from local services but some conduct a count of the number of people seen sleeping rough on a single night. ""We've sadly seen roughly sleeping going up recently, which is why it is is important we are taking a number of actions,"" Mrs May said from Birmingham, where her party's annual conference has begun. ""We've already put money in to projects to ensure that we are helping those who are sleeping rough, this will enable more money to be put in."" Mrs May highlighted projects such as theHousing First model, being piloted in the West Midlands, which sees rough sleepers given a home, rather than shelters. In August, the government announceda Â£100m strategy to tackle rough sleepingon English streets, but it was criticised as it became apparent no new money was being invested. This video can not be played Four stories of rough sleeping in England The Conservatives say this policy would help British residents ""get the right home for them"" and ""end the scourge of rough sleeping for good"". It is unclear when the new rates would be introduced. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Conservatives were ""desperately trying to play catch up"" with a ""rehash"" of his party's proposals from Labour's 2017 manifesto. ""Unlike the Tories' proposal this weekend, Labour's fully costed offshore company property levy targeted the tax avoiders and those seeking to speculate on UK property markets,"" he added. While Shelter welcomed the proposed funding, it said it was ""a national disgrace that so many of our fellow citizens are still sleeping rough in modern Britain"". ""We need to understand that the housing crisis will remain for as long as we fail to build more social homes to give people a secure and affordable way to live,"" the charity said. In 2016-17, about 217,000 new homes were built in England - almost a third short of the government's target of 300,000. Labour party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""The Tories are offering watered down, half-baked policies that don't begin to compare with Labour's radical plan to rebuild Britain after years of austerity."" Underproposals announced last week, Labour said if it was in government it would introduce a new levy on second homes that are used as holiday homes, ban letting agent fees and scrap laws allowing private landlords to evict tenants without giving a reason.

The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics,"Westminster is buzzing with talk of splits, general elections, second referendums and even the formation of new political parties as Brexit strains traditional loyalties to breaking point. With votes on any deal struck by Theresa May with the EU expected to happen this autumn, here is a guide to the main factions in the Commons: Jeremy Wright and David Lidington - cabinet ministers loyal to the PM Government ministers, basically - there are just over 100 them out of a total of 316 Tory MPs - and those backbenchers who support Theresa May's Brexit policies, or at least are not willing to vote against them and threaten her leadership. Most Tory MPs fall into this category but it is not enough for Mrs May to be sure of winning key Commons votes, even with the support of the DUP's 10 MPs, who unlike Mrs May backed Leave in the EU referendum. Ten members of Mrs May's government have quit in recent months - most of them because they are against her Chequers plan for post-Brexit trade, although Defence Minister Guto Bebb quit because he is in favour of it. Mr Bebb thought she had caved in to the hard Brexiteers (see below) over customs legislation. He has now joined the People's Vote campaign (see below). Kuennsberg: May plans to 'keep calm and carry on' At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Sixty Conservative MPs, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured above), are members of the European Research Group - a pro-Brexit lobby, who are against Theresa May's plans for trading arrangements with the EU. They are well-organised and highly motivated and the PM's continued survival in Number 10 is, largely, in their hands. The rebel ranks were swollen by ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretary David Davis and his deputy Steve Baker, who all quit in protest at her blueprint for post-Brexit trade with the EU hammered out at her country residence Chequers, in July. Mr Baker claims as many as 80 Conservative MPs are prepared to vote against the Chequers plan. He has warned about a ""catastrophic split"" in the Conservative Party if it is not able to unite around a different vision. Mr Johnson has thrown grenades - and a ""suicide vest"" - into the debate from the pages of national newspapers, with increasingly strident attacks on the Chequers proposal, prompting an angry backlash from Theresa May loyalists. May warned of Tory split over Brexit plan Johnson: PM's Brexit plan a 'suicide vest' At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know The Dominic Grieve gang. Like most of his cohorts, who number about a dozen and include former minister Nicky Morgan (seated behind Mr Grieve in the picture above) who led an unsuccessful rebellion in the customs vote, the former attorney general is not a natural rebel. Mr Grieve and his supporters inflicted the government's first Brexit defeat, in December, securing a ""meaningful vote"" for MPs on the final deal with Brussels, but some wonder whether his gang have the killer instinct of their pro-Brexit rivals when that final showdown happens in the autumn. Mr Grievehas said he will quit the party,externalif Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, in reaction to a row over the former foreign secretary's comments about the burka. Government survives key Brexit trade vote Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a close ally of Labour's Chuka Umunna in the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum (see below), has called in the past for the creation of a new centre-ground party. She also backed a call by fellow Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames - a longstanding pro-European and the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - for a ""government of national unity"", made up of senior figures from different parties to sort out Brexit, although that idea seems to have disappeared from the radar. But it is the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the UK's traditional centre party, who has emerged as the biggest cheerleader for a new centre party. Sir Vince Cable is openly encouraging disaffected anti-Brexit Labour and Tory MPs to form new groups and work with the Lib Dems to colonise what he believes is the vast territory that has opened up in British politics as Labour moves to the left under Jeremy Corbyn and Tory Brexiteers push their party to the right. Sir Vince, who has said he will stand down as Lib Dem leader once Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", admits his party, with just 12 MPs, has struggled to achieve the rapid growth in support it wanted despite being the only national party campaigning for a second referendum and has set out plans to transform into a ""movement for moderates"". Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' Former Education Secretary Justine Greening is the most senior Conservative to have called for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. She was backed by Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry, and another prominent backbencher, Sarah Wollaston, has also joined the People's Vote campaign. along with Phillip Lee and Guto Bebb. No 10 rejects Greening's referendum call Jeremy Corbyn's supporters insist the party has never been more united behind its leader - despite a bitter and divisive row about anti-Semitism that dragged on for months over the summer. The vast majority of the shadow cabinet - about 30 MPs - and most of the 47 new Labour MPs elected last year, in addition to a handful of long-serving left wing backbenchers, are fiercely loyal to the leader and back his Brexit stance. But many, maybe even the majority, of the 257 Labour MPs, including the self-styled ""moderates"" who served in government during the Blair/Brown era, remain unhappy with the direction the party is going in. Some Corbyn critics have faced no confidence votes from their local parties, a sign they could face de-selection before the next general election. Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back' Why Corbyn allies want MP selection change Jeremy Corbyn's backing for Brexit and refusal to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum, after campaigning for Remain in the referendum, are a major sore point among ""moderate"" Labour MPs, who suspect he remains a Eurosceptic at heart. The cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, including prominent figures such as Chuka Umunna (pictured above), Chris Leslie and Stephen Doughty. They outnumber members of other parties in the group, which also includes Lib Dems, Green MP Caroline Lucas, five Conservative MPs and Plaid Cymru's four MPs. These MPs tend to eschew party labels when commenting on Brexit. The Labour members are in open revolt against their party leadership's opposition to a second referendum - but they insist they are not operating as a party within a party. Chuka Umunna haswritten to members of his local party in Streatham,external, South London, to deny speculation he is involved in talks about the formation of a new party. The idea that the People's Vote is the forerunner of a such a party is ""patently absurd"", he writes. But he has also claimed Jeremy Corbyn's supporters are trying to force ""moderate"" MPs like himself out of Labour, something the party leadership says is simply not the case. Call off the dogs, Umunna tells Corbyn Turn fire outwards, Corbyn urges MPs Like the members of the People's Vote campaign, the SNP's 35 MPs, led by Ian Blackford (pictured) are against Brexit and want the UK to stay in the EU single market and customs union. They have said they won't stand in the way of a second referendum but have not committed to voting for one. One reason for this is that Scotland voted for Remain in 2016 and it did not make any difference to the result. They are likely to vote against anything resembling a ""hard Brexit"". Kate Hoey (pictured), John Mann, Frank Field and Graham Stringer - along with the currently independent Kelvin Hopkins - voted with the government in key Brexit votes, helping to ensure Theresa May's survival. This is the core of a group who say they are standing up for the millions of Labour supporters who voted to Leave the EU. Mr Field has resigned the Labour whip in Parliament - and is fighting to remain a member of the party - after claiming it has become a ""force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". The MP's opponents say he jumped before he was pushed after losing a confidence vote organised by local activists in Birkenhead angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes, which they believe robbed Labour of the chance to force a general election it could have won. Ms Hoey isalso facing callsto be expelled from Labour and has lost a confidence vote in her local Vauxhall Labour Party.

FBI contacts second woman over Kavanaugh,"Brett Kavanaugh angrily denied allegations he faces at a hearing on Thursday The FBI has approached the second woman to accuse US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as it begins a fresh inquiry into him. Deborah Ramirez accuses Judge Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her during a drinking game when they were students at Yale University in the 1980s. He has denied the allegation, describing it as a smear. President Donald Trump ordered a new investigation after the judge's first accuser testified to a Senate panel. What will the FBI inquiry actually do? Kavanaugh deploys Trump and Clinton playbook A moment of reckoning for American women The panel approved Judge Kavanaugh's nomination but asked for the further inquiry before the full Senate votes on his appointment to America's top court. Despite ordering the FBI investigation, President Trump has continued to defend his nominee Mr Kavanaugh, who denies all the allegations against him. On Saturday, Mr Trump said the FBI had ""free rein"" to investigate the judge. ""They're going to do whatever they have to do, whatever it is they do. They'll be doing things that we have never even thought of. And hopefully at the conclusion everything will be fine,"" the president said. The Supreme Court has the final say on some of the most contentious matters in the US and appointments are for life. Judge Kavanaugh is expected to tilt the court in favour of conservatives. Her lawyer, John Clune, announced that the FBI had ""reached out"" to interview his client and she had agreed to co-operate with their investigation. He made no further comment. Ms Ramirez alleges the incident occurred during the 1983-4 academic year when they were both taking part in a drinking game at a dormitory party. At one point, she told the New Yorker,a plastic penis was pointed in her direction,externaland Brett Kavanaugh then apparently showed his actual penis, which she accidentally touched when she pushed him away. In the interview, she acknowledges gaps in her memory caused by alcohol that night, which is said to have made her hesitant to come forward when contacted. Christine Blasey Ford testified to the Senate committee that he had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Judge Kavanaugh angrily denied that he had ever assaulted her or anyone else. Mark Judge, a high school friend of Judge Kavanaugh who Dr Ford says was in the room at the time of the assault, has promised to co-operate with any law enforcement agency that will ""confidentially investigate"" the allegations. Who is Brett Kavanaugh? Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor He has said he has no memory of the incident. Two others who were allegedly present in the house during the alleged assault, PJ Smyth and Dr Ford's friend Leland Ingham Keyser, are willing to co-operate ""fully"" with the FBI's investigation, their lawyers said. This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake is challenged by a sexual assault survivor. A third woman who has also publicly accused Judge Kavanaugh, Julie Swetnick, alleges he was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. She says she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party attended by Brett Kavanaugh. Ms Swetnick's lawyer said on Saturday that they had yet to hear from the FBI. Announcing the move, President Trump said: ""I've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file. ""As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week."" The inquiry involves the FBI reopening its previously completed background check on Judge Kavanaugh. This may mean going back to old witnesses - or speaking to new ones. Dr Ford's lawyer said her client welcomed the step but questioned the time limit of a week to hold the investigation.

Social media limits for young proposed,"Medical experts have been told to draw up advice on the maximum amount of time young people should spend on social media, the health secretary has said. In an interview with the Observer,external, father-of-three Matt Hancock said he was ""very worried"" about the impact on children's mental health. He said he hoped the guidelines would become the ""norm"", like the recommended maximum alcohol consumption for adults. England's chief medical officer has been asked to put together the advice. Mr Hancock told the newspaper: ""I am, as a father, very worried about the growing evidence of the impact of social media on children's mental health. ""Unrestricted use (of social media) by younger children risks being very damaging to their mental health.

Earlier this year, the former culture secretary became the first MP tolaunch his own smart phone app, where fans and constituents can discuss community issues. He criticised Facebook and Instagram for not enforcing their rules on age limits and asked Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer, to bring forward guidance on the minimum ages for users of different sites. England Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, has welcomed advice on screen time and age for children and parents alike. And NHS England said it was right to highlight social media's role in a rise in young people's mental health issues. But the Centre for Mental Health charity has said that debate around social media and mental health is ""polarised and often lacking in evidence"".

Three in five Britons 'believe in miracles'A survey commissioned for BBC Local Radio also suggests 43% of UK adults have prayed for a miracle.UK,"The Bible says Jesus Christ fed a crowd of 5,000 with just five loaves and fish Three in five UK adults say they believe some form of miracle is possible, a survey commissioned by the BBC has suggested. Nearly half of those questioned on behalf of BBC Local Radio admitted to praying for a miracle at some time. However, when it comes to the miracles of Jesus, nearly half say they do not believe he did miraculous things. Market research firm Comres surveyed 2,002 British adults by telephone between 16 and 26 August. The survey suggested: 62% of British adults believe some form of miracle is possible today Nearly three-quarters aged 18-24 say they believe some form of miracle is possible today, more than any other age group 43% say they have prayed for a miracle 37% of British adults who attend a religious service at least monthly say they believe the miracles of Jesus happened word for word as described in the Bible Half of this group say they have prayed for a miracle which was answered in the way they had hoped But 37% of Christians have never prayed for a miracle A miracle is regarded by many as a fortuitous event believed to have been caused by divine intervention, prayer or worship. As a practising Christian, Jemma Adams believes in miracles. ""I'm an ex-drug addict"" she explains. ""At 17 I had crack psychosis and jumped off the top of a tower block and survived. Not only did I survive, but I didn't break one bone. "" It was a miraculous experience, and evidence for her, that miracles are possible. She was sent to drug rehabilitation after her fall and began her journey to recovery. It has ended with her helping women who are in a similar situation to hers. As a practising Christian, Jemma Adams believes in miracles Jemma worships at the Victory Outreach Church in Hackney, East London, where David Elwin is the pastor. David also has a history of drug-use, violence and spending time in prison. ""Miracles are the foundation of a Christian's faith,"" he says. ""The foundation of the Christian faith is the miracle that Jesus rose from the dead. It's vitally important that we maintain that as our foundation and our roots."" Pastor David Elwin says he believes in miracles The survey suggests 59% of adults who identify as Christian have prayed for a miracle, with around half of these people (29%) saying their prayer was answered in the way they hoped. Monsignor Peter Fleetwood, a Catholic hospital chaplain in Liverpool, says families will ask him to pray for a miracle to bring someone back from the brink of death. He believes in those cases a miracle would be a terrible thing because it would be prolonging a life that is already at its natural end. He also thinks you can be a Christian and interpret the miracles of Jesus in a different light. He uses the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 - where Jesus fed a crowd with five loaves and two fish, as an example of how spontaneous generosity can cause a sense of wonder. ""One explanation may be that he inspired people to share what they had with them in their baskets,"" he explains. ""So rather than magically producing food, it's making food appear in another way. There are all sorts of ways it can be seen and still be wonderful."" Both Jemma Adams and Father Fleetwood believe the best miracles are in the smaller things. ""I see miracles every day,"" Jemma says. ""I see women who were hopeless addicts get clean. A miracle to me is someone that was going to die, get hope again.""

Four-year paint job on college gateA faded gatehouse which dates back to the 16th Century is given a makeover.Cambridgeshire,"The new paintwork at Christ's College Gatehouse One of Cambridge University's imposing college gates has been restored by a paint job that has taken four years to complete. The heraldic detail, which dates from the early 1500s, had not been painted for ""many years"" and had started to look faded. The four-year project included research into the original colours and methods used, repairs, and the painting itself. College bursar David Ball said he was ""really pleased"" with the result. The Gatehouse on St Andrew's Street is the main entrance to Christ's College and is highly visible to tourists and shoppers in the city. The Great Gate at Christ's College, Cambridge, before the painting The new look gate, on St Andrew's Street, is highly visible in Cambridge city centre It was built by Lady Margaret Beaufort, the grandmother of Henry VIII, who founded the college in the early years of the 16th Century. Much of the facade, including the late 16th Century oak doors, remained largely unchanged until the masonry was refaced with harder stone in 1714. A statue of Lady Margaret was added in the 19th Century. Football rules' Cambridge 'birthplace' marked by sculpture Blumenfeld sculpture donated to university institute Mr Ball said: ""It's many years since we last repainted the gatehouse, and in total it's taken about four years to research the right colours to be used, to restore wear and tear to the stonework and then to complete the repainting itself, which was undertaken by some very skilled craftsmen and women. ""We're really pleased with the results."" The restoration was carried out by Longstanton-based Brown and Ralph, which said the conservation of the stonework would ""not only increase its natural life but also brighten the Cambridge streetscape"".

Rescuers search for Indonesia survivors,"This video can not be played Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down Rescuers have been digging by hand in the frantic search for survivors in the Indonesian city of Palu, which is reeling from an earthquake and tsunami. At least 408 people have been killed but there are fears the death toll could rise significantly as workers reach areas closer to the epicentre. Search efforts are being hampered by blocked roads and a collapsed bridge. The Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected by the earthquake and tsunami. In pictures: Indonesia earthquake and tsunami There are particular concerns about the town of Donggala, where the impact is still unclear. ""This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,"" the Red Cross said in a statement. Yenni Suryani, the Indonesia country manager for the aid agency Catholic Relief Services, said Donggala appears to be inaccessible by road or air and that help may have to come by sea. Strong aftershocks have continued to hit the island since Friday's earthquake. Rescue teams dug by hand to free 24 people trapped in the rubble of the Roa-Roa hotel in the city of Palu. The hotel's owner told local media people could still be heard crying out for help, but said that no heavy lifting equipment was available to rescue them. Dozens remain missing in the city of 335,000, some thought to be trapped in the debris of collapsed buildings. A bridge was destroyed by the tsunami Bodies have been lying in city streets and the injured are being treated in tents because of damage to hospitals. Anxious survivors in Palu bedded down in the open air on Saturday night, heeding advice by officials not to return to their homes as a precaution. By Rebecca Henschke, in Poso In Poso, a four-hour drive from Palu, supplies are running out. State-owned petrol stations have closed as they have run dry. People are queuing up at roadside stalls, buying petrol in bottles to take into the affected area and to find missing loved ones. Supermarkets have limited food left and it is difficult to find bottled water. Ermi Liana, who is travelling with our BBC team, doesn't know if her parents are alive. ""They live close to the bridge that collapsed. I can't reach them by phone,"" she says. ""I can only pray they are alive."" We haven't seen any aid heading in and there is still no communication link to the town of Donggala. The 7.5 magnitude quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10km (6.2 miles),externaljust off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT), triggering a tsunami, US monitors say. Many people were on the beach in Palu, preparing for a festival, and were caught when waves up to 3m (10ft) in height swept in. Video shows people screaming and fleeing in panic. ""The tsunami... dragged cars, logs, houses,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency, told Reuters news agency. ""It hit everything on land."" As well as destroying homes, the quake wrecked a shopping centre, a mosque, a hotel and a road bridge. An air traffic controller at Palu airport died ensuring a plane took off safely after Friday's quake. When the quake hit, ""we all panicked and ran out of the house,"" Anser Bachmid, 39, told AFP news agency. ""People here need aid - food, drink, clean water. We don't know what to eat for dinner tonight."" ""I just ran when I saw the waves hitting homes on the coastline,"" Palu resident Rusidanto said. Survivors spent the night in the open Dwi Haris, who was in the city for a wedding, was staying in a hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake struck. ""There was no time to save ourselves,"",externalhe told the Associated Press news agency. ""I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall... I heard my wife cry for help but then silence. I don't know what happened to her and my child. I hope they are safe."" With back and shoulder injuries, he is being treated outdoors at Palu's Army Hospital. Aid is being flown from the capital Jakarta into Palu airport, using the part of its runway still intact. Patients are being treated in the open outside city hospitals and at least one military field hospital has been erected. The regional head of the Indonesian Doctors Association (IDI), Komang, asked the authorities for immediate help. ""We need tents, medicines, medical personnel, tarpaulins, blankets and more of other things,"" he said. The UK-based charity Save the Children is sending an assessment team to the disaster zone. ""Unfortunately the more information that we're getting, the worse the situation appears to be,"" charity spokesman Tom Howells told the BBC from Jakarta. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

May: Brexit plan critics are playing politics,"This video can not be played The prime minister rejects Boris Johnson's claims that she doesn't believe in Brexit Theresa May has rejected claims she does not believe in Brexit - and insisted she would make a success of it ""regardless of the outcome"" of talks. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show her plan for post-Brexit trade with the EU was not dead, despite it having been rejected by EU leaders. And she urged the Tory party - in Birmingham for their annual conference - to ""come together"" and back it. Boris Johnson has called her so-called Chequers plan ""deranged"". In his latest broadside against her Brexit strategy, the former foreign secretary suggested he might be able to strike a better deal than her with Brussels. He toldthe Sunday Times,external: ""Unlike the prime minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it's the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016."" Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Davidson calls for Tory Brexit 'silence' European Research Group Tories won't back PM's plan The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics At-a-glance: Chequers plan Mr Johnson also set out domestic policy ideas, including building a bridge between Britain and Ireland and putting the HS2 scheme on hold to focus on a rail link in northern England. Mrs May, who campaigned for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, hit back at Mr Johnson in her Andrew Marr interview. She said: ""I do believe in Brexit. Crucially, I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of Brexit for the future. ""That's why I want us to get a really good free trade deal with the European Union, which is what lies at the heart of the Chequers plan."" But she also said she was prepared for a ""no deal"" scenario, saying: ""We will make a success of Brexit, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations."" Anti-Brexit campaigners stage a protest outside the Conservative conference The Labour Party has said it will back Mrs May in Parliament if she agrees to their plan for a customs union with the EU and a Brexit deal that guarantees workers' rights and protects jobs. Mrs May said: ""My message to the Labour Party is that they should stop playing politics with Brexit and start acting in the national interest. ""My message to my party is let's come together and get the best deal for Britain."" This video can not be played Tories applaud Sir Digby Jones's attack on Boris Johnson EU leaders have rejected her Chequers plan because they believe it would undermine the single market by allowing the UK to ""cherry pick"" bits of EU law it liked and ditch the rest. Mrs May said: ""We think we are putting forward a proposal that will maintain the integrity of the single market."" She said she wanted a more detailed response from the EU on their objections. Later on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt hit back at the EU's negotiation stance in his speech to the party conference. He said the EU seemed to want to ""punish"" the UK for leaving, and added: ""If you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out of it won't diminish, it will grow and we won't be the only prisoner that will want to escape."" Mr Hunt also addressed EU leaders directly, saying: ""If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister, you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom, more prosperity, more opportunities than ever before in history."" In the main conference hall, pro-Brexit former CBI chief Sir Digby Jones gave a watching Mrs May a boost with a speech hailing her for standing up to the EU ""bully boys"" and attacking Mr Johnson as an ""irrelevance"". By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent, in Birmingham Just like the Labour conference last week, the Conservatives are keen to show us they have plenty of songs on their playlist. But just like the Labour conference last week, one record is louder than all the others and seems jammed on repeat: Brexit. Autumn guarantees two things: leaves falling off trees and Conservative conferences in which there is a series of deftly choreographed Johnsonian interventions, before and during the main event. Forty-eight hours on from his 4,000 or so words for the Daily Telegraph, one word from Mr Johnson is sufficient to grab a headline or two today: ""deranged"". The big question of the next few days, beyond the Brexit noise: does the PM offer any indication, however vague, of the possibility of her shifting on her much criticised Brexit plan? But former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who like Mr Johnson quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit proposals, told Sky News the Chequers plan ""will die"" because ""it's just wrong"".

FBI contacts second woman over KavanaughAgents investigating the US Supreme Court nominee approach Deborah Ramirez for an interview.US & Canada,"Brett Kavanaugh angrily denied allegations he faces at a hearing on Thursday The FBI has approached the second woman to accuse US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as it begins a fresh inquiry into him. Deborah Ramirez accuses Judge Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her during a drinking game when they were students at Yale University in the 1980s. He has denied the allegation, describing it as a smear. President Donald Trump ordered a new investigation after the judge's first accuser testified to a Senate panel. What will the FBI inquiry actually do? Kavanaugh deploys Trump and Clinton playbook A moment of reckoning for American women The panel approved Judge Kavanaugh's nomination but asked for the further inquiry before the full Senate votes on his appointment to America's top court. Despite ordering the FBI investigation, President Trump has continued to defend his nominee Mr Kavanaugh, who denies all the allegations against him. On Saturday, Mr Trump said the FBI had ""free rein"" to investigate the judge. ""They're going to do whatever they have to do, whatever it is they do. They'll be doing things that we have never even thought of. And hopefully at the conclusion everything will be fine,"" the president said. The Supreme Court has the final say on some of the most contentious matters in the US and appointments are for life. Judge Kavanaugh is expected to tilt the court in favour of conservatives. Her lawyer, John Clune, announced that the FBI had ""reached out"" to interview his client and she had agreed to co-operate with their investigation. He made no further comment. Ms Ramirez alleges the incident occurred during the 1983-4 academic year when they were both taking part in a drinking game at a dormitory party. At one point, she told the New Yorker,a plastic penis was pointed in her direction,externaland Brett Kavanaugh then apparently showed his actual penis, which she accidentally touched when she pushed him away. In the interview, she acknowledges gaps in her memory caused by alcohol that night, which is said to have made her hesitant to come forward when contacted. Christine Blasey Ford testified to the Senate committee that he had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Judge Kavanaugh angrily denied that he had ever assaulted her or anyone else. Mark Judge, a high school friend of Judge Kavanaugh who Dr Ford says was in the room at the time of the assault, has promised to co-operate with any law enforcement agency that will ""confidentially investigate"" the allegations. Who is Brett Kavanaugh? Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor He has said he has no memory of the incident. Two others who were allegedly present in the house during the alleged assault, PJ Smyth and Dr Ford's friend Leland Ingham Keyser, are willing to co-operate ""fully"" with the FBI's investigation, their lawyers said. This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake is challenged by a sexual assault survivor. A third woman who has also publicly accused Judge Kavanaugh, Julie Swetnick, alleges he was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. She says she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party attended by Brett Kavanaugh. Ms Swetnick's lawyer said on Saturday that they had yet to hear from the FBI. Announcing the move, President Trump said: ""I've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file. ""As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week."" The inquiry involves the FBI reopening its previously completed background check on Judge Kavanaugh. This may mean going back to old witnesses - or speaking to new ones. Dr Ford's lawyer said her client welcomed the step but questioned the time limit of a week to hold the investigation.

Three in five Britons 'believe in miracles',"The Bible says Jesus Christ fed a crowd of 5,000 with just five loaves and fish Three in five UK adults say they believe some form of miracle is possible, a survey commissioned by the BBC has suggested. Nearly half of those questioned on behalf of BBC Local Radio admitted to praying for a miracle at some time. However, when it comes to the miracles of Jesus, nearly half say they do not believe he did miraculous things. Market research firm Comres surveyed 2,002 British adults by telephone between 16 and 26 August. The survey suggested: 62% of British adults believe some form of miracle is possible today Nearly three-quarters aged 18-24 say they believe some form of miracle is possible today, more than any other age group 43% say they have prayed for a miracle 37% of British adults who attend a religious service at least monthly say they believe the miracles of Jesus happened word for word as described in the Bible Half of this group say they have prayed for a miracle which was answered in the way they had hoped But 37% of Christians have never prayed for a miracle A miracle is regarded by many as a fortuitous event believed to have been caused by divine intervention, prayer or worship. As a practising Christian, Jemma Adams believes in miracles. ""I'm an ex-drug addict"" she explains. ""At 17 I had crack psychosis and jumped off the top of a tower block and survived. Not only did I survive, but I didn't break one bone. "" It was a miraculous experience, and evidence for her, that miracles are possible. She was sent to drug rehabilitation after her fall and began her journey to recovery. It has ended with her helping women who are in a similar situation to hers. As a practising Christian, Jemma Adams believes in miracles Jemma worships at the Victory Outreach Church in Hackney, East London, where David Elwin is the pastor. David also has a history of drug-use, violence and spending time in prison. ""Miracles are the foundation of a Christian's faith,"" he says. ""The foundation of the Christian faith is the miracle that Jesus rose from the dead. It's vitally important that we maintain that as our foundation and our roots."" Pastor David Elwin says he believes in miracles The survey suggests 59% of adults who identify as Christian have prayed for a miracle, with around half of these people (29%) saying their prayer was answered in the way they hoped. Monsignor Peter Fleetwood, a Catholic hospital chaplain in Liverpool, says families will ask him to pray for a miracle to bring someone back from the brink of death. He believes in those cases a miracle would be a terrible thing because it would be prolonging a life that is already at its natural end. He also thinks you can be a Christian and interpret the miracles of Jesus in a different light. He uses the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 - where Jesus fed a crowd with five loaves and two fish, as an example of how spontaneous generosity can cause a sense of wonder. ""One explanation may be that he inspired people to share what they had with them in their baskets,"" he explains. ""So rather than magically producing food, it's making food appear in another way. There are all sorts of ways it can be seen and still be wonderful."" Both Jemma Adams and Father Fleetwood believe the best miracles are in the smaller things. ""I see miracles every day,"" Jemma says. ""I see women who were hopeless addicts get clean. A miracle to me is someone that was going to die, get hope again.""
