Zaghari-Ratcliffe 'needs urgent psychiatric help',"This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe warns of the ""deep scars"" left by his wife's five-year imprisonment in Iran Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016, needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a medical report sent by a charity to the UK government. The charity worker faces a new court hearing in Tehran on Sunday, a week after her ankle tag was removed. The report says she is suffering from major depression and PTSD. Despite her sentence coming to an end, she is still waiting to return to the UK to be reunited with her family. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for membership of organisations working against the Iranian government, allegations which she has always denied. Prior to the recent removal of the ankle tag, the dual national had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson has called for her permanent releaseso she can return home to her husband and young daughter in the UK. 'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? The report - commissioned by the human rights charity Redress - says she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence. The Redress report was based on a medical evaluation carried out virtually by doctors while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was under house arrest towards the end of last year. It was completed last month and sent to the government on Thursday. Neither Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her husband Richard has felt able to read the report in full, but both feel that it is important to have her ordeal documented, giving the charity the go-ahead to share the details with the BBC. In the medical evaluation, she also told doctors she suffered hair loss, had to listen to her female guard talking loudly to her child while separated from her own daughter, and developed OCD around washing. According to the report, her post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder are due to ""extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran"" and the uncertainty about her fate - and warns things could worsen without her being treated and reunited with her family in the UK. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in August 2018 Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old. Whilst in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence, she was interrogated - often blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day, she told the doctors who examined her online. ""The interrogations were traumatising,"" she is quoted as saying in the report. ""They were threatening to send my child away, told me my husband was a spy, that he had already left me, that he was lying to me, that he worked for the British intelligence service. ""They said he was unfaithful, they said he was not an accountant and that he had always been lying to me. They told me I had been fired from my job."" She says she was in a tiny cell - a 1.5 to 2-metre square - during solitary confinement. It had no window, made her feel claustrophobic and she could not tell the difference between night and day. ""The light was left on all the time there was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on,"" she says. ""There were times I could not breathe."" She was only allowed one sanitary pad a month during this time. Gabriella, now six, counted down the days to her mother's release Mr Ratcliffe says of his wife's documented experiences: ""This is mental torture. It's a really horrific experience. And it's cumulative. And it builds up. And of course, most of it has been hidden away. ""She didn't talk about it a lot when she came out. I don't talk to the media about some of the stuff. But I think it's important to put it on the record. It's important that our government takes responsibility for protecting people."" The two doctors carrying out the evaluation were told that, while in prison, she developed OCD centred around cleaning rituals. Mr Ratcliffe spoke to the BBC of his wife's ""need to try and control what you can, leading to a sort of obsessive control about certain things and having certain routines to cope with the other things you can't control - all the things that are completely out of your hands"". He adds: ""And of course, Nazanin's entire life is out of her hands."" Her interrogators tried to pressure her into co-operating with them, in exchange for clemency, she told the doctors. ""I said that I could not do, that I said I needed so much psychological help that I was not even sure I could work for myself, let alone work for my captors,"" she reported. She told the doctors that one of her female guards would talk loudly to her child just outside her cell, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was separated from her own daughter. ""It was unbearable,"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the medics. ""I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me."" Richard Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since 2016 In July 2018, she spent a week in a psychiatric hospital, accompanied by prison guards and chained to the bed by both her feet and hands. Her incarceration took a significant physical toll on her health as well, the report finds. At one point, in jail, her hair was falling out and she was too weak to climb up to the top bunk in the women's ward where she was held for most of her imprisonment. The report details the continuing guilt and anguish she feels and says she has tried to put a brave face on her ordeal and hide her symptoms from her parents, with whom she now lives. ""She knows that her suffering traumatises her parents and that her post-traumatic symptoms, like irritation and anger, harm her parents' psychological health,"" the report says. ""She also knows that her absence might create serious traumatic problems in her daughter who is being forced to grow up without the presence of her caring mother. Her imprisonment is a huge burden on her marital relationship. As her husband is struggling to gain her freedom, these efforts also keep him in a constant state of stress and suffering instead of continuing the ordinary life of a parent and a husband."" Dr Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, is one of the doctors who conducted the evaluation for the Independent Forensic Expert Group. She described Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a ""remarkably resilient woman"" who was ""trying to keep hope, trying to be strong"" during her evaluation. But she said: ""Her current situation continues the psychological torture. Although she has finished five years of being imprisoned, she faces ongoing threat and uncertainty."" She may have spared her parents the details, but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reported to the doctors that she felt constant sadness, had suicidal thoughts, and suffered other manifestations of extreme anxiety - including trembling, tingling, and hot and cold sweats. Concern that lumps in her breasts could be cancerous have contributed to her anxiety. And she also has continuing neurological and muscular-skeleton problems, as a result of prolonged confinement, according to the report. The doctors say it is ""possible that the positions in which she was handcuffed for extended periods led to nerve and joint injury"" in her right hand. And even once she is safely home in the UK with her family, the report makes clear that there will be a long road to recovery. She will need medication as well as psychotherapy and treatment for her physical symptoms. ""Nazanin's healing can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification,"" it concludes. ""In order to recover, she needs to be in a safe and non-threatening environment."" But it's not clear whether Sunday's court hearing will be used to block her return to the UK. ""The threat of a second trial remains very real,"" says Rupert Skilbeck of Redress, which acts as her and her husband's legal representative. ""This report is evidence of the severe suffering that Nazanin has experienced in Iran due to the mistreatment suffered and the cruelty of a legal process that has never followed the rule of law, making it impossible for Nazanin to know when she will be reunited with her family."" Her treatment, Redress says, clearly amounts to torture. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""Iran continues to put Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe through a cruel and intolerable ordeal. Nazanin must be allowed to return permanently to her family in the UK and we will continue to do all we can to achieve this.""

"Society has 'just accepted' dead women, says MP","This video can not be played Jess Phillips lists all women killed in the UK over the last year where a man has been convicted or charged. Labour's shadow domestic violence minister, Jess Phillips, has said society has ""just accepted"" dead women as ""one of those things"". She read out the names of 118 women and girls killed in the UK this year, where a man has been charged or convicted as the primary perpetrator, in an International Women's Day debate. Ms Phillips said there was currently no government research into the data. Ministers say they have prioritised support for victims during lockdown. Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concerns ,externalDomestic abuse helpline sees lockdown surge 'I felt like a slave to my husband in my marriage' Since being elected in 2015, Ms Phillips has marked the annual International Women's Day debate by remembering the individuals whose lives were taken in the past twelve months. Reading lists out in the chamber is normally prohibited, but Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing said she was suspending a three-minute time limit on speeches to enable this tradition to go ahead. The debate was dominated by tributes to 33-year-old Sarah Everard, who disappeared in south London on 3 March. A Metropolitan police officeris being questioned on suspicion of murderand kidnap after human remains were found in the search for Ms Everard. MPs said her death shone a spotlight once more on the scale of the violence against women. Sarah Everard walked down a busy main road in Clapham before she disappeared Speaking in the Commons chamber, Ms Phillips said: ""In this place we count what we care about. ""We count the vaccines done, the number of people on benefits, we rule or oppose based on a count and we obsessively track that data. We love to count data of our own popularity. However, we don't currently count dead women."" She said there was no government study done into data on victims of domestic abuse who are killed, die by suicide or die suddenly. ""Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,"" she added. ""Dead women is just one of those things. Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common."" Listening to Ms Phillips read out the list of victims, the Labour MP, Rosie Duffield, said it was ""impossible not to be overcome as those names echo round the chamber"". Canterbury MP Rosie Duffield has previously spoken of her personal experience of domestic abuse. She said: ""Every year we bring tissues, we prepare ourselves mentally as well as we can"" to list to the ""horrific list"" but pandemic or not, she said, ""women are tired having to pre-empt possible violence and risk assess every action"". SNP deputy leader at Westminster Kirsten Oswald told how she feels walking alone in the dark:  ""I will not change my behaviour, but do feel scared sometimes"", she said. ""I cross the road, I have my keys in my hand, I think about where the street lights are, where the dark alleys are."" ""I'm aware and vigilant, because, like all women, I have to be."" The Conservative MP, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said things would only change when there were greater societal changes and ""more women in the room"" in positions of authority. ""Despite everything that's been achieved for women's rights,"" he said the debate proved ""this is not a job that has been done, it is still very much a job to do"". As vigils highlighting women's safety are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard, more than 200 women have signed an open letter to the government calling for a ""firm commitment"" to tackle male violence. The letter, which has been signed by Labour MP Harriet Harman, charity workers and campaigners, says ""women are still at risk doing the most simple of things"". ""Something has to change - and it cannot be women, the victims in this, to be responsible for leading that charge."" Domestic abuse charities have warned that calls to their helplines have""gone through the roof"" since the lockdown began. More than 40,000 calls and contacts were made to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline in the first three months of the lockdown in 2020. Under the government's Domestic Abuse Bill, councils in England will get an extra Â£6m to provide support and safe accommodation for abuse survivors and their families. The additional money comes on top of a Â£10m emergency fund given to councils to help domestic abuse survivors during the pandemic.

How much are council tax bills going up?,"The biggest rise for 2021-22 is just under 7%, more than seven times the current rate of inflation Council tax bills are going up by at least twice the rate of inflation across Wales. The rises range from 2.65% in Rhondda Cynon Taf to 6.95% in Wrexham, although the north-eastern county still charges less than most authorities in Wales. The Welsh Government hasincreased its funding for councils by more than inflationfor the second year running. It said a hardship fund ensured council costs of the pandemic would not be an ""added pressure"" on council tax payers. Inflation was 0.9% in the year to January 2021, according tothe latest figures available from the Office for National Statistics,external. Core funding from the Welsh Government,externalcovers between two-thirds and three-quarters of each council's spending. The rest comes from council tax, and other income such as fees and direct charges for council-run services. The figures do not include charges for police forces and town or community councils A spokesperson for the Welsh Local Government Association said: ""All councils will use their local discretion to set their council tax levels, in line with local needs and circumstances. ""This year more than ever we have seen the importance of our essential local services, and council tax is a vital revenue stream to help fund them. ""However, local authorities also recognise that many families have been hard hit by the pandemic and councils have strived to keep any increases as low as possible whilst continuing to maintain local services in our communities."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""In 2021-22, local authorities in Wales will receive Â£4.65bn in general revenue allocations from core funding and non-domestic rates. This is an increase of 3.8% on a like-for-like basis and follows this year's 4.3% increase. ""Local authorities in Wales have the flexibility to set their budgets and council tax levels according to local needs and priorities. These decisions are an important part of local democracy, and ones for which individual authorities are accountable to their local electorates. ""We have also provided more than Â£206m in our budget to continue the Local Government Hardship Fund, which will ensure the financial impacts of the pandemic on local government will not be an added pressure on council taxpayers."" Pembrokeshire charges the lowest council tax of any county council in Wales Pembrokeshire will still have the lowest charge for each type of property - Â£1,190 for Band D. While Rhondda Cynon Taf will once again see the smallest increase, it has the fifth-highest charge of the 22 Welsh councils for each property band. Charges for the police and - in areas that have them - town and community councils can add about Â£300 a year to a household's bill.

Uber and Lyft to swap data on banned drivers,"Uber and rival app Lyft plan to share with each other the names of US drivers they ban from their platforms because of ""serious"" safety incidents, such as sexual assault. The two firms said the programme, to be managed by a background check company, was aimed at improving industry safety. They said other US firms could opt to participate. Both Uber and Lyft have faced scrutiny and legal action over their handling of sexual assault and other safety issues. They have responded to the criticism by introducing measures such as recurring background checks and new features, such as emergency buttons in their apps. The new programme, which is only active in the US, will also allow the two firms to share information about drivers involved in certain serious incidents such as rape and non-consensual kissing, as well as non-sexual physical assaults. Uber fined over withholding sexual assault records Uber: 6,000 US sexual assault reports in two years Scott Berkowitz, president and founder of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, said the effort meant ""perpetrators will no longer be able to hide or escape accountability by simply switching ridesharing platforms"". ""By putting aside competition, they are placing users first and building a safer rideshare community for all,"" he said inthe announcement,externalshared by the companies on Thursday. Lawyer Kristen Barton of Estey & Bomberger, which represents women who have sued the ridesharing companies for inadequate protections from sexual violence, called the programme a ""step in the right direction"". But she cautioned that the database's usefulness would be limited by its focus on drivers that the companies have banned. ""There's no guarantee that when a report against a driver is lodged that that is being followed up on and resulting in deactivation by the companies,"" she said, adding that only a small number of people who are assaulted even report the incident. ""While it is a good start, it's just not going to capture enough information to stop assaults from occurring,"" she said. In 2019, Uber said it had received nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault in the US in the previous two years. It said problems arose in a tiny fraction of the 2.3 billion rides during that time. It later clashed with state regulators in California, who wanted access to the reports, ultimately leading to a fine. Lyft has delayed publication of a similar report, citing the privacy disagreement. The company is also facing lawsuits from dozens of women in the US, who say they were harmed after the firm failed to protect passengers from its drivers. Lyft is active in the US and Canada. Uber, which operates in 71 countries around the world, said the data-sharing initiative was limited to the US, with no plans to expand at this time. The firm has faced concerns over its handling of safety incidents outside the US as well. In the UK, Uber had its London licence suspended, in part because of safety concerns. However, in September last year, Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled the firm could continue operating, saying it had improved its record despite ""historical failings"".

'No indication' Oxford jab linked to blood clotsThe EU's medicines regulator reassures states after several countries suspended use of the vaccine.Europe,"Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused their rollouts of the vaccine on Thursday There is no indication that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is linked to an increased risk of blood clots, the EU's medicines regulator says. It said the number of cases in vaccinated people was no higher than in the general population. The statement came after a number of countries, including Denmark and Norway, suspended the use of the jab. The suspension followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a dose of the jab. ""There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday. ""The vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,"" it added. It said there had been 30 cases of ""thromboembolic events"" among the five million Europeans who have received the jab. What you need to know about vaccine safety Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Europe in vaccine race to save summer AstraZeneca said the drug's safety had been studied extensively in clinical trials. ""Regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine,"" a spokesperson said. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence the vaccine had caused problems, andpeople should still go and get vaccinated when asked to do so,external. ""Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,"" said Phil Bryan of the MHRA. The decision to temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca's jab has come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the drug. However, there was a positive development on Thursday as the EMA approved the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine.""More safe and effective vaccines are coming to the market,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted,external, although some reports suggest that J&J vaccine shipments may not arrive until April. It comes on the same day a study revealed that the US Novax vaccine is 96% effective in preventing the original strain of covid and 86% effective against the English strain. Novavax is hoping to file for approval in the UK during the second quarter of 2021, AFP news agency reports. Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. The suspensions in Italy and Austria involve different batches of the vaccine. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have also suspended the use of the same batch as Austria. Romania has suspended use of 4,200 doses from the same batch of vaccines as Italy. In an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a ""precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died"". Italy's medicines body said its decision was ""precautionary"", adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events"". Two Italians are reported to have died after receiving the vaccine, and an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that their deaths are what prompted the temporary suspension. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Austria, meanwhile, took its decision after a woman died 10 days after vaccination because of ""severe blood coagulation problems"". The Austrian doses were part of a batch of one million doses, identified as ABV5300, that was sent to 17 European countries. What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid The EMA said its safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case but made clear that there was ""no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions"". No details of the Danish death have been given, but health officials said they were pausing use of the vaccine for 14 days in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called a ""precautionary measure"". Although no link had been established, he said ""we must respond in a timely and careful manner"" until a conclusion was reached. Norway's public health institute said it would follow the Danish move to halt all use of the vaccine until the Danish cases were investigated. ""We are waiting for more information to see if there is a link between the vaccine and this blood clot case,"" said Geir Bukholm of the National Institute of Health. Iceland was also suspending use of the vaccine, the chief epidemiologist told public broadcaster Ruv, to ""err on the side of caution"". Later on Thursday, France and Germany said they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. ""The benefits... are higher than the risks,"" French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Officials say they have received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people who had recently received a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things. A full investigation into batch quality is ongoing, but a defect is considered unlikely. Overall, 30 cases of thromboembolic events have been reported among the five million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area. Any approved treatment, including vaccines, carries a risk of some side effects for some people, but most are usually mild and severe ones are rare. It's also worth noting that blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. They are believed to cause symptoms in around one in every thousand people in the UK every year.

Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. The suspensions in Italy and Austria involve different batches of the vaccine. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have also suspended the use of the same batch as Austria. Romania has suspended use of 4,200 doses from the same batch of vaccines as Italy. In an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a ""precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died"". Italy's medicines body said its decision was ""precautionary"", adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events"". Two Italians are reported to have died after receiving the vaccine, and an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that their deaths are what prompted the temporary suspension. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Austria, meanwhile, took its decision after a woman died 10 days after vaccination because of ""severe blood coagulation problems"". The Austrian doses were part of a batch of one million doses, identified as ABV5300, that was sent to 17 European countries. What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid The EMA said its safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case but made clear that there was ""no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions"". No details of the Danish death have been given, but health officials said they were pausing use of the vaccine for 14 days in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called a ""precautionary measure"". Although no link had been established, he said ""we must respond in a timely and careful manner"" until a conclusion was reached. Norway's public health institute said it would follow the Danish move to halt all use of the vaccine until the Danish cases were investigated. ""We are waiting for more information to see if there is a link between the vaccine and this blood clot case,"" said Geir Bukholm of the National Institute of Health. Iceland was also suspending use of the vaccine, the chief epidemiologist told public broadcaster Ruv, to ""err on the side of caution"". Later on Thursday, France and Germany said they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. ""The benefits... are higher than the risks,"" French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Officials say they have received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people who had recently received a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things. A full investigation into batch quality is ongoing, but a defect is considered unlikely. Overall, 30 cases of thromboembolic events have been reported among the five million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area. Any approved treatment, including vaccines, carries a risk of some side effects for some people, but most are usually mild and severe ones are rare. It's also worth noting that blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. They are believed to cause symptoms in around one in every thousand people in the UK every year.

"Zaghari-Ratcliffe 'needs urgent psychiatric help'The British-Iranian woman faces a new court hearing this weekend, following a five-year sentence.UK","This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe warns of the ""deep scars"" left by his wife's five-year imprisonment in Iran Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016, needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a medical report sent by a charity to the UK government. The charity worker faces a new court hearing in Tehran on Sunday, a week after her ankle tag was removed. The report says she is suffering from major depression and PTSD. Despite her sentence coming to an end, she is still waiting to return to the UK to be reunited with her family. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for membership of organisations working against the Iranian government, allegations which she has always denied. Prior to the recent removal of the ankle tag, the dual national had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson has called for her permanent releaseso she can return home to her husband and young daughter in the UK. 'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? The report - commissioned by the human rights charity Redress - says she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence. The Redress report was based on a medical evaluation carried out virtually by doctors while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was under house arrest towards the end of last year. It was completed last month and sent to the government on Thursday. Neither Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her husband Richard has felt able to read the report in full, but both feel that it is important to have her ordeal documented, giving the charity the go-ahead to share the details with the BBC. In the medical evaluation, she also told doctors she suffered hair loss, had to listen to her female guard talking loudly to her child while separated from her own daughter, and developed OCD around washing. According to the report, her post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder are due to ""extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran"" and the uncertainty about her fate - and warns things could worsen without her being treated and reunited with her family in the UK. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in August 2018 Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old. Whilst in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence, she was interrogated - often blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day, she told the doctors who examined her online. ""The interrogations were traumatising,"" she is quoted as saying in the report. ""They were threatening to send my child away, told me my husband was a spy, that he had already left me, that he was lying to me, that he worked for the British intelligence service. ""They said he was unfaithful, they said he was not an accountant and that he had always been lying to me. They told me I had been fired from my job."" She says she was in a tiny cell - a 1.5 to 2-metre square - during solitary confinement. It had no window, made her feel claustrophobic and she could not tell the difference between night and day. ""The light was left on all the time there was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on,"" she says. ""There were times I could not breathe."" She was only allowed one sanitary pad a month during this time. Gabriella, now six, counted down the days to her mother's release Mr Ratcliffe says of his wife's documented experiences: ""This is mental torture. It's a really horrific experience. And it's cumulative. And it builds up. And of course, most of it has been hidden away. ""She didn't talk about it a lot when she came out. I don't talk to the media about some of the stuff. But I think it's important to put it on the record. It's important that our government takes responsibility for protecting people."" The two doctors carrying out the evaluation were told that, while in prison, she developed OCD centred around cleaning rituals. Mr Ratcliffe spoke to the BBC of his wife's ""need to try and control what you can, leading to a sort of obsessive control about certain things and having certain routines to cope with the other things you can't control - all the things that are completely out of your hands"". He adds: ""And of course, Nazanin's entire life is out of her hands."" Her interrogators tried to pressure her into co-operating with them, in exchange for clemency, she told the doctors. ""I said that I could not do, that I said I needed so much psychological help that I was not even sure I could work for myself, let alone work for my captors,"" she reported. She told the doctors that one of her female guards would talk loudly to her child just outside her cell, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was separated from her own daughter. ""It was unbearable,"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the medics. ""I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me."" Richard Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since 2016 In July 2018, she spent a week in a psychiatric hospital, accompanied by prison guards and chained to the bed by both her feet and hands. Her incarceration took a significant physical toll on her health as well, the report finds. At one point, in jail, her hair was falling out and she was too weak to climb up to the top bunk in the women's ward where she was held for most of her imprisonment. The report details the continuing guilt and anguish she feels and says she has tried to put a brave face on her ordeal and hide her symptoms from her parents, with whom she now lives. ""She knows that her suffering traumatises her parents and that her post-traumatic symptoms, like irritation and anger, harm her parents' psychological health,"" the report says. ""She also knows that her absence might create serious traumatic problems in her daughter who is being forced to grow up without the presence of her caring mother. Her imprisonment is a huge burden on her marital relationship. As her husband is struggling to gain her freedom, these efforts also keep him in a constant state of stress and suffering instead of continuing the ordinary life of a parent and a husband."" Dr Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, is one of the doctors who conducted the evaluation for the Independent Forensic Expert Group. She described Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a ""remarkably resilient woman"" who was ""trying to keep hope, trying to be strong"" during her evaluation. But she said: ""Her current situation continues the psychological torture. Although she has finished five years of being imprisoned, she faces ongoing threat and uncertainty."" She may have spared her parents the details, but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reported to the doctors that she felt constant sadness, had suicidal thoughts, and suffered other manifestations of extreme anxiety - including trembling, tingling, and hot and cold sweats. Concern that lumps in her breasts could be cancerous have contributed to her anxiety. And she also has continuing neurological and muscular-skeleton problems, as a result of prolonged confinement, according to the report. The doctors say it is ""possible that the positions in which she was handcuffed for extended periods led to nerve and joint injury"" in her right hand. And even once she is safely home in the UK with her family, the report makes clear that there will be a long road to recovery. She will need medication as well as psychotherapy and treatment for her physical symptoms. ""Nazanin's healing can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification,"" it concludes. ""In order to recover, she needs to be in a safe and non-threatening environment."" But it's not clear whether Sunday's court hearing will be used to block her return to the UK. ""The threat of a second trial remains very real,"" says Rupert Skilbeck of Redress, which acts as her and her husband's legal representative. ""This report is evidence of the severe suffering that Nazanin has experienced in Iran due to the mistreatment suffered and the cruelty of a legal process that has never followed the rule of law, making it impossible for Nazanin to know when she will be reunited with her family."" Her treatment, Redress says, clearly amounts to torture. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""Iran continues to put Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe through a cruel and intolerable ordeal. Nazanin must be allowed to return permanently to her family in the UK and we will continue to do all we can to achieve this.""

Homeless people to be prioritised for vaccinationExperts say the move reflects the heightened risks from coronavirus for people who are homeless.Health,"People in England who are homeless or sleeping rough will be prioritised for Covid vaccines, alongside those aged 16 to 65 with underlying conditions that put them at increased risk. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the strategy would save more lives among those most at risk in society. The move came following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Two in every five adults have now received at least one vaccine. The JCVI's advice has been shared with experts leading vaccination programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nadhim Zahawi, minister for Covid vaccine deployment, said this was a very challenging period for people who were homeless. He added: ""We know those experiencing rough sleeping or homelessness are not always able to access healthcare routinely, and therefore can often have a range of health issues which can leave them at an increased risk of this virus. ""Following the recommendation by the JCVI, local teams will now be able to prioritise this group for vaccination alongside priority group 6 and make sure fewer people fall seriously ill or die from Covid-19."" In a letter to the health secretary, experts from the JCVI said people experiencing homelessness had a higher risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19 and high rates of other undiagnosed illnesses. The team added: ""Due to current restrictions, many thousands of people who experience rough sleeping have been accommodated in emergency accommodation. ""This provides a unique opportunity to in-reach vaccination to a population that is otherwise often unable to access basic healthcare."" Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said that during the pandemic, the government had helped provide accommodation for 37,000 people at risk of rough sleeping. Jon Sparkes, of the homeless charity Crisis, welcomed the move and said the government should ensure local areas had adequate resources. He added: ""But make no mistake, the vaccine will not make homelessness safe. ""Whether it is living on the streets, or in cars and sheds, or constantly moving between friends' sofas, homelessness is extremely damaging to both your physical and mental health. ""We desperately need a plan to ensure everyone has a safe and secure home."" OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries VACCINE:When will I get the jab?

Vigil planned as women share concerns,"Vigils highlighting women's safety on the streets are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard in south London. Reclaim These Streets events are planned across the UK on Saturday, and in Clapham, where she was last seen. Organisers said it was ""wrong that the response to violence against women requires women to behave differently"". Thousands of women are sharing online their anxieties and anger about staying safe when alone in public places. Following the arrest of a police officer on suspicion of Ms Everard's kidnap and murder, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick said: ""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets. ""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared."" Organisers of Saturday afternoon's vigil on Clapham Common said local police had ""told women not to go out at night this week"", but they say ""women are not the problem"". ""This is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day."" Vigils are planned for other cities and towns on Saturday, including Cardiff, Liverpool and St Andrews. The disappearance has prompted discussion on social media about the precautions women feel they have to take when they go out on their own. Helena Wadia told BBC Radio 5 Live said she wrote about her experience on Twitter to highlight how common it is for women to feel unsafe. Helena Wadia said changing her behaviour in public spaces was ""exhausting"" She said: ""The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old. I have been self-policing since then, we moderate everything. ""Our clothing, our drinking, we get taxis where maybe we can't afford it, we hold keys between our fingers, we don't wear headphones when we're jogging, we stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting."" Another tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces has been liked more than 120,000 times. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the concerns shared by women ""are so powerful because each and every woman can relate"". ""Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence,"" she added. Maya Tutton, who created the Our Streets Now anti-harassment campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she first experienced harassment in public at the age of 12. ""What these incidents make you do isâ¦ that they make you fear going outside and they make you feel that you are not an equal citizen to your male counterparts and that you don't have those fundamental human rights to go about your everyday life without living in fear,"" the 22-year-old said. ""We're so at the end of our tether with violence against women and girls never being a priority and never being an issue that we put money and resources into tackling."" Ms Tutton added: ""By not putting the emphasis on the perpetrator and on really tackling that culture, what we're doing is we're not getting to the root of the problem - we are being forced to change our behaviour."" 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' 5 Live Your Call: Do you feel safe? News Special podcast One in three women are subjected to violence - WHO Labour MP Jess Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, said there should not be a message to women ""where we're told what to do or what we have to do"". ""The reality is that for most women they have had some sort of experience that they feel frightened of,"" she told the Today programme. ""Women aren't weak because of a fault in their personality, women are weak because of men's violence."" Sarah Everard walked down a busy main road in Clapham before she disappeared As part of an International Women's Day debate in the House of Commons on Thursday, she read out the names of 118 women who have died since this date last year - where a man had been charged or convicted as the primary perpetrator. It took more than four minutes for her to do so. She told MPs there was currently no government study into the patterns every year of women who are killed. ""Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives - dead women is just one of those things."" But, she added: ""Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common. Dead women do count."" This video can not be played Jess Phillips lists all women killed in the UK over the last year where a man has been convicted or charged. Ms Phillips concluded saying that the name of Sarah Everard, not included on the list, ""rings out across all of our media"". ""Let's pray every day and work every day so that nobody's name ends up on this list again,"" she said. Julie Bindel, a campaigner on women's issues since the 1970s, said: ""The message from wider society and from all police officers during these many operations on violence against women should be a message for men. ""Only men can stop male violence."" She praised a tweet from one man, Stuart Edwards, who asked if there were steps men could take to reduce women's anxiety. Allow Twitter content?

Marian FitzGerald, a visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, said while women's fear was real, statistics showed women were less likely to be murdered than men. She said Ms Everard's disappearance ""shouldn't make women any more fearful than they already were"". ""Yes, the fear is real and it is always heightened when something like this is in the news. That doesn't mean to say that the risk has changed,"" she said. ""It hasn't changed much over many years. Women account for about a third of all murders. Men are far more likely to be murdered. ""Men are far more likely to be murdered by someone they don't know. Men are far more likely to be murdered in public places."" Asked about young women who have said they should not have to be fearful, Ms FitzGerald said: ""In terms of the risk that we face, I know that the current situation is frightening... the reason why we remember these cases is because they are so rare and we should hold on to that."" In 2019-20, 71% of female murder victims were killed at home compared to 36% of male murder victims. Around one in 10 of female murder victims were killed on the streets.

Hundreds of UK firms hacked in global cyber-crisisHackers linked to China have found footholds inside hundreds of companies after a mass hack.Technology,"Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers. Cyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack. It comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems. But some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses. Meanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly. The hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium. Microsoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies. The attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world. US warns of 'active threat' over Microsoft attack EU bank authority hit by Microsoft email hack Microsoft email server hacks put Biden in a bind Microsoft released software updates for the so called ""zero-day"" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves. However, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected. According to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries. Cyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves. ""As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,"" Jake Moore at Eset said. ""The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers."" This video can not be played Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers A webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network. Once installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks. Globally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK. Cyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems. CyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour. The companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail. Sean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: ""It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems. ""It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind. ""There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.""

'No indication' Oxford jab linked to blood clots,"Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused their rollouts of the vaccine on Thursday There is no indication that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is linked to an increased risk of blood clots, the EU's medicines regulator says. It said the number of cases in vaccinated people was no higher than in the general population. The statement came after a number of countries, including Denmark and Norway, suspended the use of the jab. The suspension followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a dose of the jab. ""There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday. ""The vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,"" it added. It said there had been 30 cases of ""thromboembolic events"" among the five million Europeans who have received the jab. What you need to know about vaccine safety Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Europe in vaccine race to save summer AstraZeneca said the drug's safety had been studied extensively in clinical trials. ""Regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine,"" a spokesperson said. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence the vaccine had caused problems, andpeople should still go and get vaccinated when asked to do so,external. ""Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,"" said Phil Bryan of the MHRA. The decision to temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca's jab has come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the drug. However, there was a positive development on Thursday as the EMA approved the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine.""More safe and effective vaccines are coming to the market,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted,external, although some reports suggest that J&J vaccine shipments may not arrive until April. It comes on the same day a study revealed that the US Novax vaccine is 96% effective in preventing the original strain of covid and 86% effective against the English strain. Novavax is hoping to file for approval in the UK during the second quarter of 2021, AFP news agency reports. Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. The suspensions in Italy and Austria involve different batches of the vaccine. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have also suspended the use of the same batch as Austria. Romania has suspended use of 4,200 doses from the same batch of vaccines as Italy. In an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a ""precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died"". Italy's medicines body said its decision was ""precautionary"", adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events"". Two Italians are reported to have died after receiving the vaccine, and an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that their deaths are what prompted the temporary suspension. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Austria, meanwhile, took its decision after a woman died 10 days after vaccination because of ""severe blood coagulation problems"". The Austrian doses were part of a batch of one million doses, identified as ABV5300, that was sent to 17 European countries. What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid The EMA said its safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case but made clear that there was ""no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions"". No details of the Danish death have been given, but health officials said they were pausing use of the vaccine for 14 days in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called a ""precautionary measure"". Although no link had been established, he said ""we must respond in a timely and careful manner"" until a conclusion was reached. Norway's public health institute said it would follow the Danish move to halt all use of the vaccine until the Danish cases were investigated. ""We are waiting for more information to see if there is a link between the vaccine and this blood clot case,"" said Geir Bukholm of the National Institute of Health. Iceland was also suspending use of the vaccine, the chief epidemiologist told public broadcaster Ruv, to ""err on the side of caution"". Later on Thursday, France and Germany said they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. ""The benefits... are higher than the risks,"" French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Officials say they have received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people who had recently received a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things. A full investigation into batch quality is ongoing, but a defect is considered unlikely. Overall, 30 cases of thromboembolic events have been reported among the five million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area. Any approved treatment, including vaccines, carries a risk of some side effects for some people, but most are usually mild and severe ones are rare. It's also worth noting that blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. They are believed to cause symptoms in around one in every thousand people in the UK every year.

Vigil planned,"Vigils highlighting women's safety on the streets are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard in south London. Reclaim These Streets events are planned across the UK on Saturday, and in Clapham, where she was last seen. Organisers said it was ""wrong that the response to violence against women requires women to behave differently"". Thousands of women are sharing online their anxieties and anger about staying safe when alone in public places. Following the arrest of a police officer on suspicion of Ms Everard's kidnap and murder, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick said: ""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets. ""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared."" Organisers of Saturday afternoon's vigil on Clapham Common said local police had ""told women not to go out at night this week"", but they say ""women are not the problem"". ""This is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day."" Vigils are planned for other cities and towns on Saturday, including Cardiff, Liverpool and St Andrews. The disappearance has prompted discussion on social media about the precautions women feel they have to take when they go out on their own. Helena Wadia told BBC Radio 5 Live said she wrote about her experience on Twitter to highlight how common it is for women to feel unsafe. Helena Wadia said changing her behaviour in public spaces was ""exhausting"" She said: ""The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old. I have been self-policing since then, we moderate everything. ""Our clothing, our drinking, we get taxis where maybe we can't afford it, we hold keys between our fingers, we don't wear headphones when we're jogging, we stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting."" Another tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces has been liked more than 120,000 times. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the concerns shared by women ""are so powerful because each and every woman can relate"". ""Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence,"" she added. Maya Tutton, who created the Our Streets Now anti-harassment campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she first experienced harassment in public at the age of 12. ""What these incidents make you do isâ¦ that they make you fear going outside and they make you feel that you are not an equal citizen to your male counterparts and that you don't have those fundamental human rights to go about your everyday life without living in fear,"" the 22-year-old said. ""We're so at the end of our tether with violence against women and girls never being a priority and never being an issue that we put money and resources into tackling."" Ms Tutton added: ""By not putting the emphasis on the perpetrator and on really tackling that culture, what we're doing is we're not getting to the root of the problem - we are being forced to change our behaviour."" 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' 5 Live Your Call: Do you feel safe? News Special podcast One in three women are subjected to violence - WHO Labour MP Jess Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, said there should not be a message to women ""where we're told what to do or what we have to do"". ""The reality is that for most women they have had some sort of experience that they feel frightened of,"" she told the Today programme. ""Women aren't weak because of a fault in their personality, women are weak because of men's violence."" Sarah Everard walked down a busy main road in Clapham before she disappeared As part of an International Women's Day debate in the House of Commons on Thursday, she read out the names of 118 women who have died since this date last year - where a man had been charged or convicted as the primary perpetrator. It took more than four minutes for her to do so. She told MPs there was currently no government study into the patterns every year of women who are killed. ""Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives - dead women is just one of those things."" But, she added: ""Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common. Dead women do count."" This video can not be played Jess Phillips lists all women killed in the UK over the last year where a man has been convicted or charged. Ms Phillips concluded saying that the name of Sarah Everard, not included on the list, ""rings out across all of our media"". ""Let's pray every day and work every day so that nobody's name ends up on this list again,"" she said. Julie Bindel, a campaigner on women's issues since the 1970s, said: ""The message from wider society and from all police officers during these many operations on violence against women should be a message for men. ""Only men can stop male violence."" She praised a tweet from one man, Stuart Edwards, who asked if there were steps men could take to reduce women's anxiety. Allow Twitter content?

Marian FitzGerald, a visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, said while women's fear was real, statistics showed women were less likely to be murdered than men. She said Ms Everard's disappearance ""shouldn't make women any more fearful than they already were"". ""Yes, the fear is real and it is always heightened when something like this is in the news. That doesn't mean to say that the risk has changed,"" she said. ""It hasn't changed much over many years. Women account for about a third of all murders. Men are far more likely to be murdered. ""Men are far more likely to be murdered by someone they don't know. Men are far more likely to be murdered in public places."" Asked about young women who have said they should not have to be fearful, Ms FitzGerald said: ""In terms of the risk that we face, I know that the current situation is frightening... the reason why we remember these cases is because they are so rare and we should hold on to that."" In 2019-20, 71% of female murder victims were killed at home compared to 36% of male murder victims. Around one in 10 of female murder victims were killed on the streets. The World Health Organization reported this week that one in three women across the worldhave been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes.

'Nobody is going to protect us',"Women ""will be worried and may well be feeling scared"" after the disappearance of Sarah Everard, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick has said. On social media, in WhatsApp groups and in Zoom calls across the country, women have been talking about the case of the 33-year-old, who went missing in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. A Met police officer continues to be questioned on suspicion of murder and kidnap after human remains were found during the search for her. Some women are sharing their anger, frustration and fear online - reflecting each others' experiences of walking alone on the streets. Sarah Everard walked down a busy main road in Clapham before she disappeared ""I learned from a very young age that I would have to change my behaviour in order to keep myself safe,"" Grace Jessup tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""We're seeing a lot of women coming out and saying, 'we're tired of this, we're sick of this'. ""We're also kind of sick of the fact that this is a shock to men. ""This has been my reality, since I was about 14 years old, walking down the road in a school uniform and being harassed by passers-by."" Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concerns Murder police question officer over Sarah Everard Grace says she never goes out without telling a friend to text her when they get home, or vice versa. ""If you don't, they'll follow up with you, and they'll make sure that you're safe. Because we have learned nobody is going to protect us."" Grace is 31 and says she's been ""walking down the road and holding keys in your hand"" for 18 years now Grace used to live in Clapham, close to where Sarah Everard was last seen. ""She could have been me, she could have been any of my friends,"" she says. She plans to go to a vigil planned on Saturday at Clapham Common. ""For me, it's not only a vigil, it's a space for us to just come together. This has hurt us, as young women. ""So I think it's important for us to gather, to acknowledge how that feels for us. And obviously, as a result pay tribute to her."" Daisy Edwards lives five minutes' walk from the last place Sarah Everard was seen. She moved to the area a few months ago and also plans to go to the vigil on Saturday. She saw the missing person posters around the streets last week. ""I'm really shocked at myself actually, how I didn't initially see the missing posters and take it seriously. I think maybe I've been desensitised to it."" Daisy says she's used to taking precautions if walking somewhere alone, especially at night. ""If I feel that someone's following me I turn around and look at their face, or maybe stop to take a phone call - I've faked phone calls before."" Daisy, 26, only moved to the area in the last few months from her parents' in Kent Some men are asking on social media what they can do to help women feel safe if they're walking alone. Most of the replies centre around giving women space on the street if you walk behind them or past them. But some people are also very keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen. BBC Sounds: How to Stop Men Hurting Women ""The issue with the argument is that women can't win,"" says Daisy. ""They want women to not treat all men as potential attackers, but then we also are asked to keep ourselves safe. ""Keeping ourselves safe means that we have to see everyone as potential attackers, because if we were to say, 'OK, not all men, we will treat everyone as innocent until proven guilty', that's when these things happen. ""And that's when people say, she should have been more careful. ""So it's really tough, because I think it's an attitude that's really built into society."" Shy can remember a few instances when she has felt scared walking in public on her own. Two days ago, for example, on a lunchtime walk. ""I went past a couple of guys and I had my headphones on. ""I heard them make comments and I heard them say something like, 'oi, come over here.' I just ignored it carried on walking. ""And they said it again: 'Come over here, hey, I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.' ""That is wrong. Because if you're trying to get someone's attention, and she's not acknowledging you, she's ignoring you. You need to back off. ""If this had happened during the evening with headphones in, would someone say to me, 'oh, you shouldn't have your headphones in'? Or that I shouldn't have gone down that road?"" Shy says being the same age as Sarah - 33 - meant the story hit closer to home ""I want to make something very clear, I'm not saying every man is the problem. I do not think that at all,"" says Shy. But, she says, she's already started making precautions for when she can go out more as lockdown restrictions ease. ""I was on the phone to my friend this morning. And we were already googling different apps that we can put on our phone in case of emergencies. We've got an agreement where we will be on the phone to each other anyway."" Shy lives in Birmingham and says the case of Sarah Everard has resonated across the country. ""I travel for work, so I go all over the country pretty much. I don't think it's a London issue. I don't think it's a Birmingham issue. I think it's an overall issue.""

UK delays Brexit border checks on EU goods again,"Post-Brexit checks on some EU goods coming into Great Britain have been delayed by six months in order to give businesses more time to prepare. The government said the new timetable would help firms recovering in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The need for health certificates on imports such as meat and milk will be pushed back from next month to October. And in-person inspections on such animal products due from July will now begin in January 2022. It is the second time that the timetable for these checks, originally due after the post-Brexit transition ended in January 2021, has been put back. The European Union has been implementing full checks on goods sent from the UK since the start of this year. Minister accuses EU of 'ill will' over Brexit deal NI official being sent to US amid UK-EU tensions Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the disruption caused by the pandemic had ""lasted longer and has been deeper than we anticipated"". In astatement,externaloutlining the changes, he insisted the government had been ""confident of being ready on time"" for the checks to take effect. But he added: ""We have listened to businesses who have made a strong case that they need more time to prepare."" Under the revised timetable: Importers of animal products will have to pre-notify officials from 1 October, instead of next month Safety and security declarations on imports will be pushed back from July to January 2022 Customs declarations will be required at the point of import on all goods from the same time Checks on live animals and low-risk plant products will take place from March 2022 The British Retail Consortium, which represents everything from major supermarkets to fast food chains and online businesses, said it would have been ""foolhardy"" not to delay checks given the current state of border infrastructure and IT systems. Its director of food Andrew Opie said the new timetable had come ""in the nick of time,"" with many border posts ""little more than a hole in the ground"". He added that pushing ahead without a delay ""might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products"". He urged the government not to ""rest on its laurels,"" and use the next six month to ""establish and communicate the new systems"" with businesses. Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jack Dromey said the government's ""chopping and changing"" of rules ""smacks of ill-preparedness and incompetence"". ""They have had years to prepare for this but can't stop missing their own deadlines,"" he added. ""The government need to pull their sleeves up, listen to businesses who have been desperately coming forward with practical solutions, and get this sorted."" This extension is not ideal, but it does mean that supermarket shelves, for example, should be kept relatively well-stocked during the recovery from the pandemic. It is far from clear that all port infrastructure would have been ready to cope with these import arrangements. It is theoretically possible that other countries exporting to the UK would argue these grace periods violate key world trade principles on offering the same access to all countries. In practice, in the middle of a pandemic, it seems unlikely that a few months' continuation of favourable import arrangements for EU firms would really lead to a significant backlash. British exporters that are facing non-tariff barriers in trade with the EU and even with Northern Ireland, might, however, express concern about the impact of EU competitors having ongoing free access to the UK market. Effectively there has been a post-Brexit transition period - but only for EU firms exporting into the UK. The latest delay comes amid a row over the UK's decision to postpone a separate set of border checks on GB goods arriving in Northern Ireland. Under the UK's withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland is following the EU's rules on goods in order to avoid border posts with the Irish Republic. But that has required a new set of checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? EU legal action imminent over UK extensions The UK has unilaterally pushed back the full implementation of some of these checks, after disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries. The UK has insisted the move is lawful and justified - but the EU has threatened a legal challenge. Earlier, the EU's diplomatic representative in the UK called for a reset in relations, amid rising tensions over borders and other issues. Joao Vale de Alemeida said there was a need to ""change the mindset"" and ""give up on trying score points on the disputes of the past"".

'No indication' Oxford jab linked to blood clotsThe EU's medicines regulator reassures states after several countries suspend use of the vaccine.Europe,"Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused their rollouts of the vaccine on Thursday There is no indication that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is linked to an increased risk of blood clots, the EU's medicines regulator says. It said the number of cases in vaccinated people was no higher than in the general population. The statement came after a number of countries, including Denmark and Norway, suspended the use of the jab. The suspension followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a dose of the jab. ""There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday. ""The vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,"" it added. It said there had been 30 cases of ""thromboembolic events"" among the five million Europeans who have received the jab. What you need to know about vaccine safety Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Europe in vaccine race to save summer AstraZeneca said the drug's safety had been studied extensively in clinical trials. ""Regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine,"" a spokesperson said. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence the vaccine had caused problems, andpeople should still go and get vaccinated when asked to do so,external. ""Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,"" said Phil Bryan of the MHRA. The decision to temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca's jab has come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the drug. However, there was a positive development on Thursday as the EMA approved the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine.""More safe and effective vaccines are coming to the market,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted,external, although some reports suggest that J&J vaccine shipments may not arrive until April. It comes on the same day a study revealed that the US Novax vaccine is 96% effective in preventing the original strain of covid and 86% effective against the English strain. Novavax is hoping to file for approval in the UK during the second quarter of 2021, AFP news agency reports. Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. The suspensions in Italy and Austria involve different batches of the vaccine. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have also suspended the use of the same batch as Austria. Romania has suspended use of 4,200 doses from the same batch of vaccines as Italy. In an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a ""precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died"". Italy's medicines body said its decision was ""precautionary"", adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events"". Two Italians are reported to have died after receiving the vaccine, and an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that their deaths are what prompted the temporary suspension. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Austria, meanwhile, took its decision after a woman died 10 days after vaccination because of ""severe blood coagulation problems"". The Austrian doses were part of a batch of one million doses, identified as ABV5300, that was sent to 17 European countries. What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid The EMA said its safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case but made clear that there was ""no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions"". No details of the Danish death have been given, but health officials said they were pausing use of the vaccine for 14 days in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called a ""precautionary measure"". Although no link had been established, he said ""we must respond in a timely and careful manner"" until a conclusion was reached. Norway's public health institute said it would follow the Danish move to halt all use of the vaccine until the Danish cases were investigated. ""We are waiting for more information to see if there is a link between the vaccine and this blood clot case,"" said Geir Bukholm of the National Institute of Health. Iceland was also suspending use of the vaccine, the chief epidemiologist told public broadcaster Ruv, to ""err on the side of caution"". Later on Thursday, France and Germany said they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. ""The benefits... are higher than the risks,"" French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Officials say they have received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people who had recently received a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things. A full investigation into batch quality is ongoing, but a defect is considered unlikely. Overall, 30 cases of thromboembolic events have been reported among the five million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area. Any approved treatment, including vaccines, carries a risk of some side effects for some people, but most are usually mild and severe ones are rare. It's also worth noting that blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. They are believed to cause symptoms in around one in every thousand people in the UK every year.

Hundreds of UK firms hacked in global cyber crisis,"Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers. Cyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack. It comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems. But some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses. Meanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly. The hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium. Microsoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies. The attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world. US warns of 'active threat' over Microsoft attack EU bank authority hit by Microsoft email hack Microsoft email server hacks put Biden in a bind Microsoft released software updates for the so called ""zero-day"" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves. However, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected. According to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries. Cyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves. ""As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,"" Jake Moore at Eset said. ""The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers."" This video can not be played Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers A webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network. Once installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks. Globally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK. Cyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems. CyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour. The companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail. Sean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: ""It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems. ""It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind. ""There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.""

Scotland's housing market slump 'worst in UK',"Scotland had the weakest figures for new buyer inquiries of any nation or region in the UK The market for homes has slowed further with lockdown, and more in Scotland than other parts of the UK. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is reporting that interest from potential buyers was down in February. The number of properties being put on the market was also down, for the fourth consecutive month. More surveyors reported prices rising than falling. RICS expects the easing of Covid restrictions in coming months to bring more activity back. Unlike last spring, the housing market has remained open in Scotland during lockdown in 2021, but with distancing restrictions. Tax cut for home buyers in Scotland will end 'as planned' Stamp duty holiday extended in England and NI Scotland had the weakest figures for new buyer inquiries of any nation or region in the UK. The only region that was weaker for selling instructions was Yorkshire, and the only part of the UK with weaker price growth was London. In the monthly RICS report, comments from agents noted some pockets of activity. In rural Scotland - from Elgin, Fraserburgh, the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway - agents noted strong demand for properties. With slow supply, they said home sales can be quick. Phiddy Robertson of the Galbraith Group in Inverness, said: ""The market is starved of good quality property. ""Buyers are paying significant premiums to secure attractive coastal property and we are seeing more interest than ever from southern buyers looking for second homes."" One Edinburgh agent said fewer people are making inquiries about properties In Edinburgh and Glasgow, surveyors found the market more patchy, noting that more flats are coming on the market as private landlords sell. In the housing rental market, Scotland had the biggest drop in property availability of any part of the UK. John Brown, a rental agent in Edinburgh, commented: ""The market is fragmented, with fewer enquiries and longer void periods between tenancies.

LiveLiveCovid in Scotland: First Minister's Questions2 hours ago2 hours ago Latest headlines - Covid in Scotland and FMQsLatest headlines - Covid in Scotland and FMQs2 hours ago WATCH AGAIN: Johnstone on road building plansWATCH AGAIN: Johnstone on road building plans3 hours ago Greens: Will the Scottish government cut air passenger duty?Greens: Will the Scottish government cut air passenger duty?Live Covid in Scotland: First Minister's Questions  2 hours ago,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says 591 new Covid cases have been reported, representing 2.5% of the tests carried out There have been 22 more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours of people who tested positive in the previous 28 days A total of 1,825,800 people in Scotland have now had their first vaccination dose Ms Sturgeon says the return of more pupils to school next week will go ahead as planned, as will easing restrictions on outdoor meetings from Friday The Conservatives' Ruth Davidson asks about the legal advice in the Alex Salmond case and the costs to taxpayers. Ms Sturgeon says the government has set out all the substantive advice ""warts and all"" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says thousands of people do not know they have cancer and asks about the impact on services. Ms Sturgeon says the majority of cancer treatments have continued Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie asks about the GFG Alliance aluminium smelter and power station in Lochaber Questioned by Alison Johnstone from the Scottish Greens, the first minister says she has no plans to cut air passenger duty  That's all from the live page team today.

Alison Johnstone from the Scottish Greens asks the first minister about air passenger duty and UK government plans to cut it. She also asks about plans to build new roads. She calls it ""irresponsible"" because it flies in the face of the climate emergency, particularly in the build-up to the Cop26 conference later this year. She asks the first minister if she will take responsibility to make sure APD is not cut in Scotland. The FM says she has no plans to cut air passenger duty and says the Scottish government's economy recovery plan must be consistent with its moral obligation to meet net zero targets. She says if anyone looks at the Scottish government's budget they will see strongly the commitment to a ""green sustainable recovery"".  Allow Twitter content?

Rennie asks what updates the government has received about the GFG Alliance aluminium smelter
and power station in Lochaber. In 2016, the company received a Scottish government guarantee worth Â£575m, promising an ""oven-ready"" plan to build a factory, create 2,000 jobs and add Â£1bn to the local economy. None of this has happened five years later, Mr Rennie points out. The Scottish government is in regular contact with GFG Alliance, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister says the original investment plan for Fort William was
impacted by a sharp fall in UK automotive output. The business has brought forward new investment plans
totalling Â£94m, she says. ""We will continue to liaise very closely with them about the challenges they
face and steps they need to take to deliver on those commitments,"" Ms Sturgeon adds. Mr Sarwar says those steps will be ""little comfort"" for the missing 7,000 people when they get a late cancer diagnosis that will impact on their survival rate. He recognises the strain Covid has had on the NHS. He says Covid has not created this problem, it has put extra pressure on an already-overstretched workforce. He says the government has not met the cancer waiting time since 2012 and asks if the focus should be on a plan for the NHS that makes sure we never again have to choose between treating a virus or treating cancer. The FM says the NHS has coped admirably and is at the point now of dealing with whatever Covid throws at us and seeing patients who have had treatments delayed.   Allow Twitter content?

Mr Sarwar adds that Macmillan Cancer Research believes progress is ""nowhere near fast enough"" for people to be diagnosed. He says urgent cancer referrals have dropped by 22% and there are thousands more people who suspect they have cancer and are waiting for diagnosis. He says diagnosis, and early diagnosis is vital and asks how many people referred for diagnostic tests are waiting longer than the six-week target. The first minister does not have the figure but promises it later. She says she agrees with the concerns. She encourages people to come forward and says screening programmes are restarting. Cancer recovery plans include two new early cancer diagnostic centres being established in the spring, along with prehabilitation and a single point of contact for patients to support them through their journey. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asks about Covid. He says more than 7,000 people in Scotland have died from the virus since the first death here a year ago. He adds that 7,000 fewer people had a confirmed cancer diagnosis in the first eight months of the pandemic and it remains Scotland's biggest killer. He adds that thousands of people who have cancer do not know it and are not receiving treatment. He asks the first minister what action she will take now to fully restart cancer services, launch a catch-up programme and find the ""missing 7,000"". Ms Sturgeon gently corrects Mr Sarwar, pointing out the real figure of Scottish lives lost is more than 9,000 under NRS figures. She says he is right to raise the issue that many have suffered and even died due to the impact and consequences of dealing with Covid. She says when we look back, the toll will be much greater than just the direct toll of the pandemic. She says the majority of cancer treatments have continued and will continue. Some treatment plans have changed to minimise risk. She says she is funding health boards to support cancer services and remobilise them. She takes the opportunity to tell anyone with worries, concerns or changes to contact their GP now. They are encouraged to come forward. Ruth Davidson continues to probe the first minister about the legal advice. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood says that since the government's senior lawyer wrote the note in question on 17 December 2018, to the time the Scottish government conceded the case, the bill exceeded Â£100,000. ""It was perhaps even Â£200,000, because the Scottish government wonât
tell us their side of the bill,"" says Ms Davidson. She says we know the first minister personally adopted the advice, because Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, sent a note saying
she and the first minister were unclear what had changed, Nicola Sturgeon replies that it is her job as first minister to ask questions and query things she  doesnât fully understand. It would be more remarkable if she didnât ask questions, she says. There was a mistake made by the government in the application of the procedure, and ultimately that is why it couldnât defend the judicial review, Ms Sturgeon adds. ""People donât have to take my word for it, they can look at all the material and draw their own conclusions, as Iâm sure the committee will in due
course,"" she says.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood, asks Nicola Sturgeon about the legal advice it received in the Alex Salmond case. She says the government's senior lawyer warned the first minister personally about ""ploughing on
regardless"" with the case because of the large expenses bill that would arise. How much taxpayers money did it cost from that moment?, she asks the first minister. Ms Sturgeon says the government set out the cost of the judicial review. She doesnât have
that breakdown to hand,  but will look into whether she can provide it to parliament. The FM says Ms Davidson is quoting from the legal advice already published. Anybody who wants to read it can go onto the Scottish government website and read an ""unvarnished account, warts and all"", she says. It sets out very clearly the error made by the Scottish government and the way it became fully realised and understood, she adds. Cancer patients are much less protected against Covid-19 than other people after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the first real-world study in this area suggests. With a 12-week wait for the second dose this could leave them vulnerable, says the King's College London and Francis Crick Institute research team. An early second dose appeared to boost cancer patients' protection. Cancer charities are calling for the vaccine strategy to be reviewed. Readmore here. The first minister starts off with a reminder that one year ago today was when the WHO declared Covid-19 a global pandemic. She says the last 12 months have been ""incredibly tough"" but we do now have real grounds for cautious optimism. She says case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths have all fallen in recent weeks and she expects the R number to stay below one when it is published later today. 40% of the population have received the first dose of the vaccine. The first minister confirms that the planned reopening of schools will go ahead on Monday, as will all the plans to change rules on outdoor meetings. Plans for the phased reopening of the economy will be announced on Tuesday. Finally she reminds us to stay at home and heed all current advice. As of 08:30 this morning, 1,825,800 people in
Scotland had received their first dose of the vaccine, an increase of 16,642 since Tuesday. In addition, 141,433 have received
their second dose, an increase of 8,673. In total 25,315 received a vaccination yesterday. Ms Sturgeon says ""virtually
everybody"" in the over-65 age group has now received their first dose. For other age groups the latest figures are: Â·60-64: 45% Â·55-59: 38% Â·50-54: 31% Nicola Sturgeon begins with an update of the
latest coronavirus figures. The first minister confirms that a further 591 people have tested
positive for Covid - 19, 2.5% of the tests carried out yesterday. This takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 207,747. There are 556 people in hospital with recently confirmed
Covid-19, a decrease of 26, and 42 in intensive care, down seven from
yesterday. There have also been 22 more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours of
people who tested positive in the previous 28 days. That brings the total number of
deaths by that measurement to 7,483. National Records of Scotland figures published
on Wednesday revealed that as of 7 March, a total of 9.725 deaths had been registered
where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Nicola Sturgeon will begin her coronavirus update in the Holyrood chamber shortly. The first minister will then take questions from opposition leaders and MSPs. You can follow proceedings right here on this live page or

Channel or Radio Scotland. Stay with us... Nicola Sturgeon has justified a
part-time return of high school S1-S3 pupils to school on mental health
grounds. Head teachershave raised concernsthat the
focus to implement blended learning for just a few weeks is having a wider
impact on their long-term provision. But the first minister told MSPs on Holyroodâs
Covid-19 committee on Wednesday that even a limited return from Monday would be good for
young peopleâs needs, beyond just education. âWe will all see and be concerned about not
just the educational impact of being out of school 100% of the time, but the
wellbeing impact as well, being separated from friends and normal life,"" she said. âSo we decided to try, even if it was limited,
in the time between now and Easter, to get young people back into school for
some periods, and to reacquaint them ahead of the Easter holidays.â It was the second time John Swinney has survived a vote of no confidence in the past year Deputy First Minister John Swinney has survived a vote of no confidence at Holyrood after MSPs rejected the motion by 65 to 57. The vote was tabled by the Tories after a row over the government providing its legal advice to an inquiry committee. The motion was voted down after the Greens sided with the SNP to dismiss the move as a political stunt. Mr Swinney had agreed to publish ""key"" papers from the government's legal battle with Alex Salmond. However, the committee said it was ""not reassured"" that it had been given access to all the material it had asked for. Readmore here. Â© 2025 BBC.

NHS waits at record high as second wave hits care,"The Covid surge in January hit key services including cancer and routine surgery, NHS England figures show. Less than half the expected number of operations were done, pushing the waiting list to a record-high of 4.6m. More than 300,000 of those have been waiting more than a year for treatment - compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began. Surgeons described it as a dire situation which would take a long time to turnaround. Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Behind today's statistics are people waiting in limbo. ""Many will be in considerable pain, others will have restricted mobility and be at risk of isolation and loneliness. ""Dealing with this daunting backlog will take time, and also sustained investment in the NHS,"" he said. Similar problems are also being seen in Scotland where 39,000 people have been waiting over a year for treatment. The NHS Confederation has warned the true picture could be much worse with nearly 6 million fewer referrals made by GPs in England for routine treatments, which includes operations such as knee and hip replacements, last year, suggested there was an additional hidden backlog. The organisation, which represents hospitals, said it was likely people have not sought help or found it difficult to access services during the pandemic. The numbers starting treatment for cancer and being referred for urgent check-ups returned to pre-pandemic levels in the autumn. But the data for January showed a dip in numbers for the first time since the first wave - just under 23,000 people started treatment, compared to nearly 27,500 in January 2020. Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: ""While it's positive that urgent referrals did not plummet as they did in the first wave, these January figures show that the pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on cancer patients."" NHS England said given the scale of Covid admissions seen in January, some disruption had been unavoidable. Medical director Prof Stephen Powis said: ""Admitting more than 100,000 Covid patients to hospital in a single month inevitably had a knock-on effect on some non-urgent care. ""However, thanks to the hard work of NHS staff and the innovations in treatment and care developed over the course of the pandemic, hospitals treated more than one million people with other conditions in January, at the peak of the winter wave, nearly twice as many as they did last April. ""That is a testament to the skill, dedication and commitment nurses, doctors, therapists and countless other staff showed in the most challenging period in NHS history.""

Norway and Denmark suspend AstraZeneca vaccine,"Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused their rollouts of the vaccine on Thursday There is no indication that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is linked to an increased risk of blood clots, the EU's medicines regulator says. It said the number of cases in vaccinated people was no higher than in the general population. The statement came after a number of countries, including Denmark and Norway, suspended the use of the jab. The suspension followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a dose of the jab. ""There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday. ""The vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,"" it added. It said there had been 30 cases of ""thromboembolic events"" among the five million Europeans who have received the jab. What you need to know about vaccine safety Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Europe in vaccine race to save summer AstraZeneca said the drug's safety had been studied extensively in clinical trials. ""Regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine,"" a spokesperson said. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence the vaccine had caused problems, andpeople should still go and get vaccinated when asked to do so,external. ""Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,"" said Phil Bryan of the MHRA. The decision to temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca's jab has come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the drug. However, there was a positive development on Thursday as the EMA approved the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine.""More safe and effective vaccines are coming to the market,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted,external, although some reports suggest that J&J vaccine shipments may not arrive until April. It comes on the same day a study revealed that the US Novax vaccine is 96% effective in preventing the original strain of covid and 86% effective against the English strain. Novavax is hoping to file for approval in the UK during the second quarter of 2021, AFP news agency reports. Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. The suspensions in Italy and Austria involve different batches of the vaccine. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have also suspended the use of the same batch as Austria. Romania has suspended use of 4,200 doses from the same batch of vaccines as Italy. In an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a ""precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died"". Italy's medicines body said its decision was ""precautionary"", adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events"". Two Italians are reported to have died after receiving the vaccine, and an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that their deaths are what prompted the temporary suspension. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Austria, meanwhile, took its decision after a woman died 10 days after vaccination because of ""severe blood coagulation problems"". The Austrian doses were part of a batch of one million doses, identified as ABV5300, that was sent to 17 European countries. What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid The EMA said its safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case but made clear that there was ""no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions"". No details of the Danish death have been given, but health officials said they were pausing use of the vaccine for 14 days in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called a ""precautionary measure"". Although no link had been established, he said ""we must respond in a timely and careful manner"" until a conclusion was reached. Norway's public health institute said it would follow the Danish move to halt all use of the vaccine until the Danish cases were investigated. ""We are waiting for more information to see if there is a link between the vaccine and this blood clot case,"" said Geir Bukholm of the National Institute of Health. Iceland was also suspending use of the vaccine, the chief epidemiologist told public broadcaster Ruv, to ""err on the side of caution"". Later on Thursday, France and Germany said they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. ""The benefits... are higher than the risks,"" French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Officials say they have received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people who had recently received a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things. A full investigation into batch quality is ongoing, but a defect is considered unlikely. Overall, 30 cases of thromboembolic events have been reported among the five million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area. Any approved treatment, including vaccines, carries a risk of some side effects for some people, but most are usually mild and severe ones are rare. It's also worth noting that blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. They are believed to cause symptoms in around one in every thousand people in the UK every year.

UK delays post-Brexit border checks on EU goods,"Post-Brexit checks on some EU goods coming into Great Britain have been delayed by six months in order to give businesses more time to prepare. The government said the new timetable would help firms recovering in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The need for health certificates on imports such as meat and milk will be pushed back from next month to October. And in-person inspections on such animal products due from July will now begin in January 2022. It is the second time that the timetable for these checks, originally due after the post-Brexit transition ended in January 2021, has been put back. The European Union has been implementing full checks on goods sent from the UK since the start of this year. Minister accuses EU of 'ill will' over Brexit deal NI official being sent to US amid UK-EU tensions Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the disruption caused by the pandemic had ""lasted longer and has been deeper than we anticipated"". In astatement,externaloutlining the changes, he insisted the government had been ""confident of being ready on time"" for the checks to take effect. But he added: ""We have listened to businesses who have made a strong case that they need more time to prepare."" Under the revised timetable: Importers of animal products will have to pre-notify officials from 1 October, instead of next month Safety and security declarations on imports will be pushed back from July to January 2022 Customs declarations will be required at the point of import on all goods from the same time Checks on live animals and low-risk plant products will take place from March 2022 The British Retail Consortium, which represents everything from major supermarkets to fast food chains and online businesses, said it would have been ""foolhardy"" not to delay checks given the current state of border infrastructure and IT systems. Its director of food Andrew Opie said the new timetable had come ""in the nick of time,"" with many border posts ""little more than a hole in the ground"". He added that pushing ahead without a delay ""might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products"". He urged the government not to ""rest on its laurels,"" and use the next six month to ""establish and communicate the new systems"" with businesses. Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jack Dromey said the government's ""chopping and changing"" of rules ""smacks of ill-preparedness and incompetence"". ""They have had years to prepare for this but can't stop missing their own deadlines,"" he added. ""The government need to pull their sleeves up, listen to businesses who have been desperately coming forward with practical solutions, and get this sorted."" This extension is not ideal, but it does mean that supermarket shelves, for example, should be kept relatively well-stocked during the recovery from the pandemic. It is far from clear that all port infrastructure would have been ready to cope with these import arrangements. It is theoretically possible that other countries exporting to the UK would argue these grace periods violate key world trade principles on offering the same access to all countries. In practice, in the middle of a pandemic, it seems unlikely that a few months' continuation of favourable import arrangements for EU firms would really lead to a significant backlash. British exporters that are facing non-tariff barriers in trade with the EU and even with Northern Ireland, might, however, express concern about the impact of EU competitors having ongoing free access to the UK market. Effectively there has been a post-Brexit transition period - but only for EU firms exporting into the UK. The latest delay comes amid a row over the UK's decision to postpone a separate set of border checks on GB goods arriving in Northern Ireland. Under the UK's withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland is following the EU's rules on goods in order to avoid border posts with the Irish Republic. But that has required a new set of checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? EU legal action imminent over UK extensions The UK has unilaterally pushed back the full implementation of some of these checks, after disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries. The UK has insisted the move is lawful and justified - but the EU has threatened a legal challenge. Earlier, the EU's diplomatic representative in the UK called for a reset in relations, amid rising tensions over borders and other issues. Joao Vale de Alemeida said there was a need to ""change the mindset"" and ""give up on trying score points on the disputes of the past"".

John Lewis warns of 'painful' store closures,"This video can not be played Chairman Sharon White on 'painful' John Lewis closures Retail giant John Lewis has warned of further ""painful"" store closures after the pandemic saw it report its first ever annual loss. The group swung to a loss of Â£517m for the year to January, against profits of Â£146m the previous year. The retailer said it ""does not expect"" all of its department stores to reopen once lockdown restrictions ease. It has previously been reportedthe chain was considering closing up to eight more stores to try to cut costs. Any further closures would be in addition to eight already announced in 2020. The firm, which has 42 John Lewis shops, said talks with landlords are ongoing and it will make a final decision about the ""small number"" of shops to close at the end of March. The rise in internet shopping, accelerated by various lockdown measures during the pandemic, has forced John Lewis to rethink how many stores it needs. It said that before last March, every Â£6 in Â£10 spent on its websites was driven by its shops. That figure is now just Â£3 in Â£10. Chairman Sharon White told the BBC that the decision to close stores was ""painful"" but necessary due to a ""decade of changes in shopping habits in one year"". ""There is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store,"" she added. ""Regrettably, we do not expect to reopen all our John Lewis shops at the end of lockdown, which will also have implications for our supply chain."" She said John Lewis would do everything it could ""to lessen the impact"", but she added: ""We want to ensure our stores reflect how customers want to shop - 'right space, right place'."" Sharon White landed in the driving seat just weeks before the pandemic and swiftly had to make some tough decisions - closing stores, slashing jobs and cutting costs. She also had to tell partners that for the first time in more than 50 years they wouldn't receive their much cherished annual bonus. These past 12 months have clearly focused minds on how many big department stores it needs. Despite lockdown restrictions, John Lewis sales were flat last year. In other words, it managed to transfer all those lost sales from the High Street to online. Its website business was already strong and it predicts 70% of sales will be online from 2025. But another raft of store closures is a real blow for the towns they're based in. Some will think it's going too far - that there could be an opportunity for it to add sales, given that so many of its rivals have either beaten a retreat or disappeared altogether. John Lewis went on a big expansion spree back in 2007, almost doubling the number of stores in its portfolio. As sad as it is, it's now set to rein those numbers in. John Lewis' hefty annual loss was mainly due to the write-down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs. The group announced last July it was closing John Lewis stores in Birmingham, Croydon, Watford, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, as well as the smaller hubs at St Pancras station and Heathrow, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. In September,John Lewis also announced it was scrapping its staff bonusfor the first time since 1953. The partnership, which also runs Waitrose supermarkets, is now targeting savings of Â£300m a year by 2022. David Cartmell lost his job as a stock manager at the John Lewis store in Birmingham last year David Cartmell took great pride in working at the John Lewis store in Birmingham until it closed last year and he was made redundant. He says the news of further store closures on Thursday came as ""little surprise"". ""I always knew the original eight store closures, including my branch were just the tip of the iceberg,"" the former stock manager says. One of the groups' big problems, David says, is its past expansion strategy: ""We were trying to make the chain as common as Debenhams."" As overheads including bills, rents, salaries and bonuses mounted, he says the group became a ""victim"" of its own previous marker of success. ""We were trying to use an old business model to keep up our biggest competitors such as Amazon in a digital age."" Now, he feels ""absolutely sorry"" for the workers waiting to hear the fate of their own stores. In addition to closing some John Lewis stores, the group is trialling running dedicated John Lewis shopping areas in some Waitrose supermarkets. Waitrose benefitted from a jump in demand for online deliveries as people sought to minimise trips to the supermarket. John Lewis said the Waitrose website was taking about 240,000 orders a week, and now ""stands as a Â£1bn sales business"". The increased demand for groceries, however, did not offset the problems at the group's department stores. As a result, John Lewis confirmed that it would not return the business rates relief it has received from government during the Covid crisis. It said it had claimed Â£190m in combined rates relief and support under the furlough scheme, and that it would claim business rates relief between April and June. It said the holiday from the tax levied on non-domestic properties had helped it avoid ""a more severe restructuring of the partnership, which would have put more jobs at risk at a time when the High Street is already under pressure"". ""We are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain,"" it added. Grocers such as Morrisons, Tesco and Asdasaid in Decemberthat they would return more than Â£1.7bn in rates relief. This came after supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, were criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders.

Denmark halts AstraZeneca vaccine 'as precaution',"Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused their rollouts of the vaccine on Thursday There is no indication that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is linked to an increased risk of blood clots, the EU's medicines regulator says. It said the number of cases in vaccinated people was no higher than in the general population. The statement came after a number of countries, including Denmark and Norway, suspended the use of the jab. The suspension followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a dose of the jab. ""There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday. ""The vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,"" it added. It said there had been 30 cases of ""thromboembolic events"" among the five million Europeans who have received the jab. What you need to know about vaccine safety Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Europe in vaccine race to save summer AstraZeneca said the drug's safety had been studied extensively in clinical trials. ""Regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine,"" a spokesperson said. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence the vaccine had caused problems, andpeople should still go and get vaccinated when asked to do so,external. ""Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,"" said Phil Bryan of the MHRA. The decision to temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca's jab has come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the drug. However, there was a positive development on Thursday as the EMA approved the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine.""More safe and effective vaccines are coming to the market,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted,external, although some reports suggest that J&J vaccine shipments may not arrive until April. It comes on the same day a study revealed that the US Novax vaccine is 96% effective in preventing the original strain of covid and 86% effective against the English strain. Novavax is hoping to file for approval in the UK during the second quarter of 2021, AFP news agency reports. Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. The suspensions in Italy and Austria involve different batches of the vaccine. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have also suspended the use of the same batch as Austria. Romania has suspended use of 4,200 doses from the same batch of vaccines as Italy. In an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a ""precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died"". Italy's medicines body said its decision was ""precautionary"", adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events"". Two Italians are reported to have died after receiving the vaccine, and an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that their deaths are what prompted the temporary suspension. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Austria, meanwhile, took its decision after a woman died 10 days after vaccination because of ""severe blood coagulation problems"". The Austrian doses were part of a batch of one million doses, identified as ABV5300, that was sent to 17 European countries. What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid The EMA said its safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case but made clear that there was ""no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions"". No details of the Danish death have been given, but health officials said they were pausing use of the vaccine for 14 days in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called a ""precautionary measure"". Although no link had been established, he said ""we must respond in a timely and careful manner"" until a conclusion was reached. Norway's public health institute said it would follow the Danish move to halt all use of the vaccine until the Danish cases were investigated. ""We are waiting for more information to see if there is a link between the vaccine and this blood clot case,"" said Geir Bukholm of the National Institute of Health. Iceland was also suspending use of the vaccine, the chief epidemiologist told public broadcaster Ruv, to ""err on the side of caution"". Later on Thursday, France and Germany said they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. ""The benefits... are higher than the risks,"" French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Officials say they have received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people who had recently received a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things. A full investigation into batch quality is ongoing, but a defect is considered unlikely. Overall, 30 cases of thromboembolic events have been reported among the five million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area. Any approved treatment, including vaccines, carries a risk of some side effects for some people, but most are usually mild and severe ones are rare. It's also worth noting that blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. They are believed to cause symptoms in around one in every thousand people in the UK every year.

Covid in Scotland: First Minister's Questions,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says 591 new Covid cases have been reported, representing 2.5% of the tests carried out There have been 22 more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours of people who tested positive in the previous 28 days A total of 1,825,800 people in Scotland have now had their first vaccination dose Ms Sturgeon says the return of more pupils to school next week will go ahead as planned, as will easing restrictions on outdoor meetings from Friday The Conservatives' Ruth Davidson asks about the legal advice in the Alex Salmond case and the costs to taxpayers. Ms Sturgeon says the government has set out all the substantive advice ""warts and all"" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says thousands of people do not know they have cancer and asks about the impact on services. Ms Sturgeon says the majority of cancer treatments have continued Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie asks about the GFG Alliance aluminium smelter and power station in Lochaber Questioned by Alison Johnstone from the Scottish Greens, the first minister says she has no plans to cut air passenger duty  That's all from the live page team today.

Alison Johnstone from the Scottish Greens asks the first minister about air passenger duty and UK government plans to cut it. She also asks about plans to build new roads. She calls it ""irresponsible"" because it flies in the face of the climate emergency, particularly in the build-up to the Cop26 conference later this year. She asks the first minister if she will take responsibility to make sure APD is not cut in Scotland. The FM says she has no plans to cut air passenger duty and says the Scottish government's economy recovery plan must be consistent with its moral obligation to meet net zero targets. She says if anyone looks at the Scottish government's budget they will see strongly the commitment to a ""green sustainable recovery"".  Allow Twitter content?

Rennie asks what updates the government has received about the GFG Alliance aluminium smelter
and power station in Lochaber. In 2016, the company received a Scottish government guarantee worth Â£575m, promising an ""oven-ready"" plan to build a factory, create 2,000 jobs and add Â£1bn to the local economy. None of this has happened five years later, Mr Rennie points out. The Scottish government is in regular contact with GFG Alliance, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister says the original investment plan for Fort William was
impacted by a sharp fall in UK automotive output. The business has brought forward new investment plans
totalling Â£94m, she says. ""We will continue to liaise very closely with them about the challenges they
face and steps they need to take to deliver on those commitments,"" Ms Sturgeon adds. Mr Sarwar says those steps will be ""little comfort"" for the missing 7,000 people when they get a late cancer diagnosis that will impact on their survival rate. He recognises the strain Covid has had on the NHS. He says Covid has not created this problem, it has put extra pressure on an already-overstretched workforce. He says the government has not met the cancer waiting time since 2012 and asks if the focus should be on a plan for the NHS that makes sure we never again have to choose between treating a virus or treating cancer. The FM says the NHS has coped admirably and is at the point now of dealing with whatever Covid throws at us and seeing patients who have had treatments delayed.   Allow Twitter content?

Mr Sarwar adds that Macmillan Cancer Research believes progress is ""nowhere near fast enough"" for people to be diagnosed. He says urgent cancer referrals have dropped by 22% and there are thousands more people who suspect they have cancer and are waiting for diagnosis. He says diagnosis, and early diagnosis is vital and asks how many people referred for diagnostic tests are waiting longer than the six-week target. The first minister does not have the figure but promises it later. She says she agrees with the concerns. She encourages people to come forward and says screening programmes are restarting. Cancer recovery plans include two new early cancer diagnostic centres being established in the spring, along with prehabilitation and a single point of contact for patients to support them through their journey. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asks about Covid. He says more than 7,000 people in Scotland have died from the virus since the first death here a year ago. He adds that 7,000 fewer people had a confirmed cancer diagnosis in the first eight months of the pandemic and it remains Scotland's biggest killer. He adds that thousands of people who have cancer do not know it and are not receiving treatment. He asks the first minister what action she will take now to fully restart cancer services, launch a catch-up programme and find the ""missing 7,000"". Ms Sturgeon gently corrects Mr Sarwar, pointing out the real figure of Scottish lives lost is more than 9,000 under NRS figures. She says he is right to raise the issue that many have suffered and even died due to the impact and consequences of dealing with Covid. She says when we look back, the toll will be much greater than just the direct toll of the pandemic. She says the majority of cancer treatments have continued and will continue. Some treatment plans have changed to minimise risk. She says she is funding health boards to support cancer services and remobilise them. She takes the opportunity to tell anyone with worries, concerns or changes to contact their GP now. They are encouraged to come forward. Ruth Davidson continues to probe the first minister about the legal advice. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood says that since the government's senior lawyer wrote the note in question on 17 December 2018, to the time the Scottish government conceded the case, the bill exceeded Â£100,000. ""It was perhaps even Â£200,000, because the Scottish government wonât
tell us their side of the bill,"" says Ms Davidson. She says we know the first minister personally adopted the advice, because Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, sent a note saying
she and the first minister were unclear what had changed, Nicola Sturgeon replies that it is her job as first minister to ask questions and query things she  doesnât fully understand. It would be more remarkable if she didnât ask questions, she says. There was a mistake made by the government in the application of the procedure, and ultimately that is why it couldnât defend the judicial review, Ms Sturgeon adds. ""People donât have to take my word for it, they can look at all the material and draw their own conclusions, as Iâm sure the committee will in due
course,"" she says.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood, asks Nicola Sturgeon about the legal advice it received in the Alex Salmond case. She says the government's senior lawyer warned the first minister personally about ""ploughing on
regardless"" with the case because of the large expenses bill that would arise. How much taxpayers money did it cost from that moment?, she asks the first minister. Ms Sturgeon says the government set out the cost of the judicial review. She doesnât have
that breakdown to hand,  but will look into whether she can provide it to parliament. The FM says Ms Davidson is quoting from the legal advice already published. Anybody who wants to read it can go onto the Scottish government website and read an ""unvarnished account, warts and all"", she says. It sets out very clearly the error made by the Scottish government and the way it became fully realised and understood, she adds. Cancer patients are much less protected against Covid-19 than other people after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the first real-world study in this area suggests. With a 12-week wait for the second dose this could leave them vulnerable, says the King's College London and Francis Crick Institute research team. An early second dose appeared to boost cancer patients' protection. Cancer charities are calling for the vaccine strategy to be reviewed. Readmore here. The first minister starts off with a reminder that one year ago today was when the WHO declared Covid-19 a global pandemic. She says the last 12 months have been ""incredibly tough"" but we do now have real grounds for cautious optimism. She says case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths have all fallen in recent weeks and she expects the R number to stay below one when it is published later today. 40% of the population have received the first dose of the vaccine. The first minister confirms that the planned reopening of schools will go ahead on Monday, as will all the plans to change rules on outdoor meetings. Plans for the phased reopening of the economy will be announced on Tuesday. Finally she reminds us to stay at home and heed all current advice. As of 08:30 this morning, 1,825,800 people in
Scotland had received their first dose of the vaccine, an increase of 16,642 since Tuesday. In addition, 141,433 have received
their second dose, an increase of 8,673. In total 25,315 received a vaccination yesterday. Ms Sturgeon says ""virtually
everybody"" in the over-65 age group has now received their first dose. For other age groups the latest figures are: Â·60-64: 45% Â·55-59: 38% Â·50-54: 31% Nicola Sturgeon begins with an update of the
latest coronavirus figures. The first minister confirms that a further 591 people have tested
positive for Covid - 19, 2.5% of the tests carried out yesterday. This takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 207,747. There are 556 people in hospital with recently confirmed
Covid-19, a decrease of 26, and 42 in intensive care, down seven from
yesterday. There have also been 22 more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours of
people who tested positive in the previous 28 days. That brings the total number of
deaths by that measurement to 7,483. National Records of Scotland figures published
on Wednesday revealed that as of 7 March, a total of 9.725 deaths had been registered
where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Nicola Sturgeon will begin her coronavirus update in the Holyrood chamber shortly. The first minister will then take questions from opposition leaders and MSPs. You can follow proceedings right here on this live page or

part-time return of high school S1-S3 pupils to school on mental health
grounds. Head teachershave raised concernsthat the
focus to implement blended learning for just a few weeks is having a wider
impact on their long-term provision. But the first minister told MSPs on Holyroodâs
Covid-19 committee on Wednesday that even a limited return from Monday would be good for
young peopleâs needs, beyond just education. âWe will all see and be concerned about not
just the educational impact of being out of school 100% of the time, but the
wellbeing impact as well, being separated from friends and normal life,"" she said. âSo we decided to try, even if it was limited,
in the time between now and Easter, to get young people back into school for
some periods, and to reacquaint them ahead of the Easter holidays.â It was the second time John Swinney has survived a vote of no confidence in the past year Deputy First Minister John Swinney has survived a vote of no confidence at Holyrood after MSPs rejected the motion by 65 to 57. The vote was tabled by the Tories after a row over the government providing its legal advice to an inquiry committee. The motion was voted down after the Greens sided with the SNP to dismiss the move as a political stunt. Mr Swinney had agreed to publish ""key"" papers from the government's legal battle with Alex Salmond. However, the committee said it was ""not reassured"" that it had been given access to all the material it had asked for. Readmore here. Â© 2025 BBC.

NHS waits at record high as second wave hits careScale of cancelled treatments is revealed with hospitals facing 'dire' backlog after Covid surge.HealthComments,"The Covid surge in January hit key services including cancer and routine surgery, NHS England figures show. Less than half the expected number of operations were done, pushing the waiting list to a record-high of 4.6m. More than 300,000 of those have been waiting more than a year for treatment - compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began. Surgeons described it as a dire situation which would take a long time to turnaround. Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Behind today's statistics are people waiting in limbo. ""Many will be in considerable pain, others will have restricted mobility and be at risk of isolation and loneliness. ""Dealing with this daunting backlog will take time, and also sustained investment in the NHS,"" he said. Similar problems are also being seen in Scotland where 39,000 people have been waiting over a year for treatment. The NHS Confederation has warned the true picture could be much worse with nearly 6 million fewer referrals made by GPs in England for routine treatments, which includes operations such as knee and hip replacements, last year, suggested there was an additional hidden backlog. The organisation, which represents hospitals, said it was likely people have not sought help or found it difficult to access services during the pandemic. The numbers starting treatment for cancer and being referred for urgent check-ups returned to pre-pandemic levels in the autumn. But the data for January showed a dip in numbers for the first time since the first wave - just under 23,000 people started treatment, compared to nearly 27,500 in January 2020. Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: ""While it's positive that urgent referrals did not plummet as they did in the first wave, these January figures show that the pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on cancer patients."" NHS England said given the scale of Covid admissions seen in January, some disruption had been unavoidable. Medical director Prof Stephen Powis said: ""Admitting more than 100,000 Covid patients to hospital in a single month inevitably had a knock-on effect on some non-urgent care. ""However, thanks to the hard work of NHS staff and the innovations in treatment and care developed over the course of the pandemic, hospitals treated more than one million people with other conditions in January, at the peak of the winter wave, nearly twice as many as they did last April. ""That is a testament to the skill, dedication and commitment nurses, doctors, therapists and countless other staff showed in the most challenging period in NHS history.""

UK delays post-Brexit border checks on EU goodsThe government says the move will allow firms to prepare and concentrate on recovering from Covid.UK Politics,"Post-Brexit checks on some EU goods coming into Great Britain have been delayed by six months in order to give businesses more time to prepare. The government said the new timetable would help firms recovering in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The need for health certificates on imports such as meat and milk will be pushed back from next month to October. And in-person inspections on such animal products due from July will now begin in January 2022. It is the second time that the timetable for these checks, originally due after the post-Brexit transition ended in January 2021, has been put back. The European Union has been implementing full checks on goods sent from the UK since the start of this year. Minister accuses EU of 'ill will' over Brexit deal NI official being sent to US amid UK-EU tensions Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the disruption caused by the pandemic had ""lasted longer and has been deeper than we anticipated"". In astatement,externaloutlining the changes, he insisted the government had been ""confident of being ready on time"" for the checks to take effect. But he added: ""We have listened to businesses who have made a strong case that they need more time to prepare."" Under the revised timetable: Importers of animal products will have to pre-notify officials from 1 October, instead of next month Safety and security declarations on imports will be pushed back from July to January 2022 Customs declarations will be required at the point of import on all goods from the same time Checks on live animals and low-risk plant products will take place from March 2022 The British Retail Consortium, which represents everything from major supermarkets to fast food chains and online businesses, said it would have been ""foolhardy"" not to delay checks given the current state of border infrastructure and IT systems. Its director of food Andrew Opie said the new timetable had come ""in the nick of time,"" with many border posts ""little more than a hole in the ground"". He added that pushing ahead without a delay ""might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products"". He urged the government not to ""rest on its laurels,"" and use the next six month to ""establish and communicate the new systems"" with businesses. Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jack Dromey said the government's ""chopping and changing"" of rules ""smacks of ill-preparedness and incompetence"". ""They have had years to prepare for this but can't stop missing their own deadlines,"" he added. ""The government need to pull their sleeves up, listen to businesses who have been desperately coming forward with practical solutions, and get this sorted."" This extension is not ideal, but it does mean that supermarket shelves, for example, should be kept relatively well-stocked during the recovery from the pandemic. It is far from clear that all port infrastructure would have been ready to cope with these import arrangements. It is theoretically possible that other countries exporting to the UK would argue these grace periods violate key world trade principles on offering the same access to all countries. In practice, in the middle of a pandemic, it seems unlikely that a few months' continuation of favourable import arrangements for EU firms would really lead to a significant backlash. British exporters that are facing non-tariff barriers in trade with the EU and even with Northern Ireland, might, however, express concern about the impact of EU competitors having ongoing free access to the UK market. Effectively there has been a post-Brexit transition period - but only for EU firms exporting into the UK. The latest delay comes amid a row over the UK's decision to postpone a separate set of border checks on GB goods arriving in Northern Ireland. Under the UK's withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland is following the EU's rules on goods in order to avoid border posts with the Irish Republic. But that has required a new set of checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? EU legal action imminent over UK extensions The UK has unilaterally pushed back the full implementation of some of these checks, after disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries. The UK has insisted the move is lawful and justified - but the EU has threatened a legal challenge. Earlier, the EU's diplomatic representative in the UK called for a reset in relations, amid rising tensions over borders and other issues. Joao Vale de Alemeida said there was a need to ""change the mindset"" and ""give up on trying score points on the disputes of the past"".

John Lewis warns of 'painful' store closuresThe retail giant reports big losses and says it does not expect to reopen all of its shops post-lockdown.Business,"This video can not be played Chairman Sharon White on 'painful' John Lewis closures Retail giant John Lewis has warned of further ""painful"" store closures after the pandemic saw it report its first ever annual loss. The group swung to a loss of Â£517m for the year to January, against profits of Â£146m the previous year. The retailer said it ""does not expect"" all of its department stores to reopen once lockdown restrictions ease. It has previously been reportedthe chain was considering closing up to eight more stores to try to cut costs. Any further closures would be in addition to eight already announced in 2020. The firm, which has 42 John Lewis shops, said talks with landlords are ongoing and it will make a final decision about the ""small number"" of shops to close at the end of March. The rise in internet shopping, accelerated by various lockdown measures during the pandemic, has forced John Lewis to rethink how many stores it needs. It said that before last March, every Â£6 in Â£10 spent on its websites was driven by its shops. That figure is now just Â£3 in Â£10. Chairman Sharon White told the BBC that the decision to close stores was ""painful"" but necessary due to a ""decade of changes in shopping habits in one year"". ""There is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store,"" she added. ""Regrettably, we do not expect to reopen all our John Lewis shops at the end of lockdown, which will also have implications for our supply chain."" She said John Lewis would do everything it could ""to lessen the impact"", but she added: ""We want to ensure our stores reflect how customers want to shop - 'right space, right place'."" Sharon White landed in the driving seat just weeks before the pandemic and swiftly had to make some tough decisions - closing stores, slashing jobs and cutting costs. She also had to tell partners that for the first time in more than 50 years they wouldn't receive their much cherished annual bonus. These past 12 months have clearly focused minds on how many big department stores it needs. Despite lockdown restrictions, John Lewis sales were flat last year. In other words, it managed to transfer all those lost sales from the High Street to online. Its website business was already strong and it predicts 70% of sales will be online from 2025. But another raft of store closures is a real blow for the towns they're based in. Some will think it's going too far - that there could be an opportunity for it to add sales, given that so many of its rivals have either beaten a retreat or disappeared altogether. John Lewis went on a big expansion spree back in 2007, almost doubling the number of stores in its portfolio. As sad as it is, it's now set to rein those numbers in. John Lewis' hefty annual loss was mainly due to the write-down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs. The group announced last July it was closing John Lewis stores in Birmingham, Croydon, Watford, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, as well as the smaller hubs at St Pancras station and Heathrow, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. In September,John Lewis also announced it was scrapping its staff bonusfor the first time since 1953. The partnership, which also runs Waitrose supermarkets, is now targeting savings of Â£300m a year by 2022. David Cartmell lost his job as a stock manager at the John Lewis store in Birmingham last year David Cartmell took great pride in working at the John Lewis store in Birmingham until it closed last year and he was made redundant. He says the news of further store closures on Thursday came as ""little surprise"". ""I always knew the original eight store closures, including my branch were just the tip of the iceberg,"" the former stock manager says. One of the groups' big problems, David says, is its past expansion strategy: ""We were trying to make the chain as common as Debenhams."" As overheads including bills, rents, salaries and bonuses mounted, he says the group became a ""victim"" of its own previous marker of success. ""We were trying to use an old business model to keep up our biggest competitors such as Amazon in a digital age."" Now, he feels ""absolutely sorry"" for the workers waiting to hear the fate of their own stores. In addition to closing some John Lewis stores, the group is trialling running dedicated John Lewis shopping areas in some Waitrose supermarkets. Waitrose benefitted from a jump in demand for online deliveries as people sought to minimise trips to the supermarket. John Lewis said the Waitrose website was taking about 240,000 orders a week, and now ""stands as a Â£1bn sales business"". The increased demand for groceries, however, did not offset the problems at the group's department stores. As a result, John Lewis confirmed that it would not return the business rates relief it has received from government during the Covid crisis. It said it had claimed Â£190m in combined rates relief and support under the furlough scheme, and that it would claim business rates relief between April and June. It said the holiday from the tax levied on non-domestic properties had helped it avoid ""a more severe restructuring of the partnership, which would have put more jobs at risk at a time when the High Street is already under pressure"". ""We are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain,"" it added. Grocers such as Morrisons, Tesco and Asdasaid in Decemberthat they would return more than Â£1.7bn in rates relief. This came after supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, were criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders.

"Denmark halts AstraZeneca vaccine 'as precaution'The decision follows a death and reports of blood clots, but the health minister says no link is established.","Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused their rollouts of the vaccine on Thursday There is no indication that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is linked to an increased risk of blood clots, the EU's medicines regulator says. It said the number of cases in vaccinated people was no higher than in the general population. The statement came after a number of countries, including Denmark and Norway, suspended the use of the jab. The suspension followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a dose of the jab. ""There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday. ""The vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,"" it added. It said there had been 30 cases of ""thromboembolic events"" among the five million Europeans who have received the jab. What you need to know about vaccine safety Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Europe in vaccine race to save summer AstraZeneca said the drug's safety had been studied extensively in clinical trials. ""Regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine,"" a spokesperson said. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence the vaccine had caused problems, andpeople should still go and get vaccinated when asked to do so,external. ""Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,"" said Phil Bryan of the MHRA. The decision to temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca's jab has come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the drug. However, there was a positive development on Thursday as the EMA approved the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine.""More safe and effective vaccines are coming to the market,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted,external, although some reports suggest that J&J vaccine shipments may not arrive until April. It comes on the same day a study revealed that the US Novax vaccine is 96% effective in preventing the original strain of covid and 86% effective against the English strain. Novavax is hoping to file for approval in the UK during the second quarter of 2021, AFP news agency reports. Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. The suspensions in Italy and Austria involve different batches of the vaccine. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have also suspended the use of the same batch as Austria. Romania has suspended use of 4,200 doses from the same batch of vaccines as Italy. In an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a ""precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died"". Italy's medicines body said its decision was ""precautionary"", adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events"". Two Italians are reported to have died after receiving the vaccine, and an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that their deaths are what prompted the temporary suspension. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Austria, meanwhile, took its decision after a woman died 10 days after vaccination because of ""severe blood coagulation problems"". The Austrian doses were part of a batch of one million doses, identified as ABV5300, that was sent to 17 European countries. What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid The EMA said its safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case but made clear that there was ""no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions"". No details of the Danish death have been given, but health officials said they were pausing use of the vaccine for 14 days in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called a ""precautionary measure"". Although no link had been established, he said ""we must respond in a timely and careful manner"" until a conclusion was reached. Norway's public health institute said it would follow the Danish move to halt all use of the vaccine until the Danish cases were investigated. ""We are waiting for more information to see if there is a link between the vaccine and this blood clot case,"" said Geir Bukholm of the National Institute of Health. Iceland was also suspending use of the vaccine, the chief epidemiologist told public broadcaster Ruv, to ""err on the side of caution"". Later on Thursday, France and Germany said they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. ""The benefits... are higher than the risks,"" French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Officials say they have received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people who had recently received a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things. A full investigation into batch quality is ongoing, but a defect is considered unlikely. Overall, 30 cases of thromboembolic events have been reported among the five million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area. Any approved treatment, including vaccines, carries a risk of some side effects for some people, but most are usually mild and severe ones are rare.

China approves plan to control Hong Kong elections,"Critics say the electoral reforms will effectively wipe out any remaining opposition when enacted China's legislature has approved a resolution to overhaul Hong Kong's electoral system - its latest move to tighten control over the city. The ""patriots governing Hong Kong"" resolution was passed at the National People's Congress (NPC) on Thursday. It will reduce democratic representation and allow a pro-Beijing panel to vet and elect candidates. The former British colony was handed back to China in 1997 under a model called ""one country, two systems"". Under the deal, which gave the territory freedoms not available in mainland China, Hong Kong also had its own mini-constitution and an elected parliament. The latest Chinese move follows a series of measures that have tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong, including the passing of a national security law and a crackdown on activists and opposition politicians. Detailed legislation will now be drafted and could be enacted in Hong Kong within the next few months. Marriage, romance proposals fuel anger in ChinaWhat are the two sessions? China NPC: Beijing to overhaul Hong Kong electoral system The UK says it will ""hollow out the space for democratic debate"" in Hong Kong. Other critics say they will effectively wipe out any remaining opposition. Almost 24 years after China took back control of Hong Kong from Britain, this was the moment it remade the free-wheeling, sometimes unruly territory's political system in its own image. The symbolism couldn't have been starker. Seated in the Great Hall of the People, 2,895 delegates voted in favour of the changes, none against. Whether the one abstention was a miscue on the electronic voting buttons, or a lone act of defiance, we'll never know. There have been other milestones in recent years at which observers have pronounced the death of Hong Kong. The national security law, for example, has all but wiped out the ability to express dissent on the streets. Once again, China is arguing that this reform - with its political loyalty test for candidates - is necessary to ensure stability. But critics will argue it abolishes another fundamental underpinning of the city's special freedoms - the ability to channel dissent through the political process itself. The pro-democracy protests, although sometimes violent, were accompanied by mass popular support with as many as two million taking peacefully to the streets. In late 2019, the democrats won a landslide in Hong Kong's local elections, the city's only truly democratic ballot. That may have spooked Beijing more than barricades and petrol bombs. But is its victory now complete? ""It is very sad,"" the former Democratic Party chairperson Emily Lau told me. ""But I insist this doesn't mean the game is over for Hong Kong because the fight will go on."" Thousands of lawmakers gathered as the annual NPC meeting began on Friday in Beijing Hong Kong's parliament - or Legislative Council (LegCo) - helps to make Hong Kong's laws. It is made up of 70 seats - but only about half are directly voted for by the public. In recent years, some of the seats have been filled by pro-democracy figures. The other half has mostly been filled by smaller groups representing special interests such as business, banking and trade, sectors which are historically pro-Beijing. The proposed new law will give Hong Kong's heavily pro-Beijing electoral vetting committee the power to vet all LegCo candidates and elect many of its members. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam says she and Hong Kong's government ""firmly support"" the move. ""What they're really referring to [when they say 'patriot'] is that they will pick the people that they like, someone who is one of them,"" one resident told BBC Chinese. ""Basically, it's a step backwards, becoming more and more like the mainland,"" he said. But another resident, identified as Ms Ho, said she supported the law. ""Hong Kong has already returned [to China]. So under this situation, the Chinese government's law should be the framework for our [patriot law],"" she said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the dilution of elections in Hong Kong would further undermine trust in China. However, the Chinese embassy in London's chargÃ© d'affaires Yang Xiaoguang told the BBC that the UK and China had a ""different definition"" of democracy. Asked about possible UK sanctions against Chinese individuals over Hong Kong and other issues, Mr Yang said China would ""safeguard our interests at any cost"". Earlier,the US condemned China's ""continuing assault on democratic institutions in Hong Kong"". Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. This is supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has. But fears that this model was being eroded led to huge pro-democracy protests in 2019. Some protests turned violent and last year, the NPC passed a controversial national security law, which effectively reduces Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Beijing said the law would target ""sedition"" and bring stability. Since the law has been enacted in June, around 100 people have been arrested, including China critic and media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who was denied bail and is in detention awaiting trial.

LiveLiveCovid in Scotland: First Minister's QuestionsLess than a minute ago,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says 591 new Covid cases have been reported, representing 2.5% of the tests carried out There have been 22 more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours of people who tested positive in the previous 28 days A total of 1,825,800 people in Scotland have now had their first vaccination dose Ms Sturgeon says the return of more pupils to school next week will go ahead as planned, as will easing restrictions on outdoor meetings from Friday The Conservatives' Ruth Davidson asks about the legal advice in the Alex Salmond case and the costs to taxpayers. Ms Sturgeon says the government has set out all the substantive advice ""warts and all"" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says thousands of people do not know they have cancer and asks about the impact on services. Ms Sturgeon says the majority of cancer treatments have continued Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie asks about the GFG Alliance aluminium smelter and power station in Lochaber Questioned by Alison Johnstone from the Scottish Greens, the first minister says she has no plans to cut air passenger duty  That's all from the live page team today.

Alison Johnstone from the Scottish Greens asks the first minister about air passenger duty and UK government plans to cut it. She also asks about plans to build new roads. She calls it ""irresponsible"" because it flies in the face of the climate emergency, particularly in the build-up to the Cop26 conference later this year. She asks the first minister if she will take responsibility to make sure APD is not cut in Scotland. The FM says she has no plans to cut air passenger duty and says the Scottish government's economy recovery plan must be consistent with its moral obligation to meet net zero targets. She says if anyone looks at the Scottish government's budget they will see strongly the commitment to a ""green sustainable recovery"".  Allow Twitter content?

Rennie asks what updates the government has received about the GFG Alliance aluminium smelter
and power station in Lochaber. In 2016, the company received a Scottish government guarantee worth Â£575m, promising an ""oven-ready"" plan to build a factory, create 2,000 jobs and add Â£1bn to the local economy. None of this has happened five years later, Mr Rennie points out. The Scottish government is in regular contact with GFG Alliance, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister says the original investment plan for Fort William was
impacted by a sharp fall in UK automotive output. The business has brought forward new investment plans
totalling Â£94m, she says. ""We will continue to liaise very closely with them about the challenges they
face and steps they need to take to deliver on those commitments,"" Ms Sturgeon adds. Mr Sarwar says those steps will be ""little comfort"" for the missing 7,000 people when they get a late cancer diagnosis that will impact on their survival rate. He recognises the strain Covid has had on the NHS. He says Covid has not created this problem, it has put extra pressure on an already-overstretched workforce. He says the government has not met the cancer waiting time since 2012 and asks if the focus should be on a plan for the NHS that makes sure we never again have to choose between treating a virus or treating cancer. The FM says the NHS has coped admirably and is at the point now of dealing with whatever Covid throws at us and seeing patients who have had treatments delayed.   Allow Twitter content?

Mr Sarwar adds that Macmillan Cancer Research believes progress is ""nowhere near fast enough"" for people to be diagnosed. He says urgent cancer referrals have dropped by 22% and there are thousands more people who suspect they have cancer and are waiting for diagnosis. He says diagnosis, and early diagnosis is vital and asks how many people referred for diagnostic tests are waiting longer than the six-week target. The first minister does not have the figure but promises it later. She says she agrees with the concerns. She encourages people to come forward and says screening programmes are restarting. Cancer recovery plans include two new early cancer diagnostic centres being established in the spring, along with prehabilitation and a single point of contact for patients to support them through their journey. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar asks about Covid. He says more than 7,000 people in Scotland have died from the virus since the first death here a year ago. He adds that 7,000 fewer people had a confirmed cancer diagnosis in the first eight months of the pandemic and it remains Scotland's biggest killer. He adds that thousands of people who have cancer do not know it and are not receiving treatment. He asks the first minister what action she will take now to fully restart cancer services, launch a catch-up programme and find the ""missing 7,000"". Ms Sturgeon gently corrects Mr Sarwar, pointing out the real figure of Scottish lives lost is more than 9,000 under NRS figures. She says he is right to raise the issue that many have suffered and even died due to the impact and consequences of dealing with Covid. She says when we look back, the toll will be much greater than just the direct toll of the pandemic. She says the majority of cancer treatments have continued and will continue. Some treatment plans have changed to minimise risk. She says she is funding health boards to support cancer services and remobilise them. She takes the opportunity to tell anyone with worries, concerns or changes to contact their GP now. They are encouraged to come forward. Ruth Davidson continues to probe the first minister about the legal advice. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood says that since the government's senior lawyer wrote the note in question on 17 December 2018, to the time the Scottish government conceded the case, the bill exceeded Â£100,000. ""It was perhaps even Â£200,000, because the Scottish government wonât
tell us their side of the bill,"" says Ms Davidson. She says we know the first minister personally adopted the advice, because Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, sent a note saying
she and the first minister were unclear what had changed, Nicola Sturgeon replies that it is her job as first minister to ask questions and query things she  doesnât fully understand. It would be more remarkable if she didnât ask questions, she says. There was a mistake made by the government in the application of the procedure, and ultimately that is why it couldnât defend the judicial review, Ms Sturgeon adds. ""People donât have to take my word for it, they can look at all the material and draw their own conclusions, as Iâm sure the committee will in due
course,"" she says.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood, asks Nicola Sturgeon about the legal advice it received in the Alex Salmond case. She says the government's senior lawyer warned the first minister personally about ""ploughing on
regardless"" with the case because of the large expenses bill that would arise. How much taxpayers money did it cost from that moment?, she asks the first minister. Ms Sturgeon says the government set out the cost of the judicial review. She doesnât have
that breakdown to hand,  but will look into whether she can provide it to parliament. The FM says Ms Davidson is quoting from the legal advice already published. Anybody who wants to read it can go onto the Scottish government website and read an ""unvarnished account, warts and all"", she says. It sets out very clearly the error made by the Scottish government and the way it became fully realised and understood, she adds. Cancer patients are much less protected against Covid-19 than other people after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the first real-world study in this area suggests. With a 12-week wait for the second dose this could leave them vulnerable, says the King's College London and Francis Crick Institute research team. An early second dose appeared to boost cancer patients' protection. Cancer charities are calling for the vaccine strategy to be reviewed. Readmore here. The first minister starts off with a reminder that one year ago today was when the WHO declared Covid-19 a global pandemic. She says the last 12 months have been ""incredibly tough"" but we do now have real grounds for cautious optimism. She says case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths have all fallen in recent weeks and she expects the R number to stay below one when it is published later today. 40% of the population have received the first dose of the vaccine. The first minister confirms that the planned reopening of schools will go ahead on Monday, as will all the plans to change rules on outdoor meetings. Plans for the phased reopening of the economy will be announced on Tuesday. Finally she reminds us to stay at home and heed all current advice. As of 08:30 this morning, 1,825,800 people in
Scotland had received their first dose of the vaccine, an increase of 16,642 since Tuesday. In addition, 141,433 have received
their second dose, an increase of 8,673. In total 25,315 received a vaccination yesterday. Ms Sturgeon says ""virtually
everybody"" in the over-65 age group has now received their first dose. For other age groups the latest figures are: Â·60-64: 45% Â·55-59: 38% Â·50-54: 31% Nicola Sturgeon begins with an update of the
latest coronavirus figures. The first minister confirms that a further 591 people have tested
positive for Covid - 19, 2.5% of the tests carried out yesterday. This takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 207,747. There are 556 people in hospital with recently confirmed
Covid-19, a decrease of 26, and 42 in intensive care, down seven from
yesterday. There have also been 22 more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours of
people who tested positive in the previous 28 days. That brings the total number of
deaths by that measurement to 7,483. National Records of Scotland figures published
on Wednesday revealed that as of 7 March, a total of 9.725 deaths had been registered
where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Nicola Sturgeon will begin her coronavirus update in the Holyrood chamber shortly. The first minister will then take questions from opposition leaders and MSPs. You can follow proceedings right here on this live page or

part-time return of high school S1-S3 pupils to school on mental health
grounds. Head teachershave raised concernsthat the
focus to implement blended learning for just a few weeks is having a wider
impact on their long-term provision. But the first minister told MSPs on Holyroodâs
Covid-19 committee on Wednesday that even a limited return from Monday would be good for
young peopleâs needs, beyond just education. âWe will all see and be concerned about not
just the educational impact of being out of school 100% of the time, but the
wellbeing impact as well, being separated from friends and normal life,"" she said. âSo we decided to try, even if it was limited,
in the time between now and Easter, to get young people back into school for
some periods, and to reacquaint them ahead of the Easter holidays.â It was the second time John Swinney has survived a vote of no confidence in the past year Deputy First Minister John Swinney has survived a vote of no confidence at Holyrood after MSPs rejected the motion by 65 to 57. The vote was tabled by the Tories after a row over the government providing its legal advice to an inquiry committee. The motion was voted down after the Greens sided with the SNP to dismiss the move as a political stunt. Mr Swinney had agreed to publish ""key"" papers from the government's legal battle with Alex Salmond. However, the committee said it was ""not reassured"" that it had been given access to all the material it had asked for. Readmore here. Â© 2025 BBC.

NHS waits at record high as second wave hits careThe scale of cancelled treatments is revealed with hospitals facing 'dire' backlog after Covid surge.,"The Covid surge in January hit key services including cancer and routine surgery, NHS England figures show. Less than half the expected number of operations were done, pushing the waiting list to a record-high of 4.6m. More than 300,000 of those have been waiting more than a year for treatment - compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began. Surgeons described it as a dire situation which would take a long time to turnaround. Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Behind today's statistics are people waiting in limbo. ""Many will be in considerable pain, others will have restricted mobility and be at risk of isolation and loneliness. ""Dealing with this daunting backlog will take time, and also sustained investment in the NHS,"" he said. Similar problems are also being seen in Scotland where 39,000 people have been waiting over a year for treatment. The NHS Confederation has warned the true picture could be much worse with nearly 6 million fewer referrals made by GPs in England for routine treatments, which includes operations such as knee and hip replacements, last year, suggested there was an additional hidden backlog. The organisation, which represents hospitals, said it was likely people have not sought help or found it difficult to access services during the pandemic. The numbers starting treatment for cancer and being referred for urgent check-ups returned to pre-pandemic levels in the autumn. But the data for January showed a dip in numbers for the first time since the first wave - just under 23,000 people started treatment, compared to nearly 27,500 in January 2020. Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: ""While it's positive that urgent referrals did not plummet as they did in the first wave, these January figures show that the pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on cancer patients."" NHS England said given the scale of Covid admissions seen in January, some disruption had been unavoidable. Medical director Prof Stephen Powis said: ""Admitting more than 100,000 Covid patients to hospital in a single month inevitably had a knock-on effect on some non-urgent care. ""However, thanks to the hard work of NHS staff and the innovations in treatment and care developed over the course of the pandemic, hospitals treated more than one million people with other conditions in January, at the peak of the winter wave, nearly twice as many as they did last April. ""That is a testament to the skill, dedication and commitment nurses, doctors, therapists and countless other staff showed in the most challenging period in NHS history.""

All Scottish councils poised to agree tax freeze,"All of Scotland's 32 local authorities have frozen council tax rates at last year's levels. The Scottish government offered councils incentives in return for not raising the cost of the bills. Glasgow and Stirling were the last authorities to consider council tax levels when they set their 2021/22 budgets on Thursday. Other councils had been through that process since last month, with all agreeing to a freeze. Local authorities are to receive a cash equivalent of a 3% council tax increase in return for not putting up levels. The move forms part of the Scottish government'sspending plans for the coming year, which Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said were aimed at striking a balance between raising revenue to pay for public services and helping Scotland recover from the Covid pandemic. Ms Forbes said she was pleased the freeze had been agreed by all the councils. She said: ""With people facing unprecedented challenges and extra pressures, now is a time to work together to provide stability and certainty. ""I am pleased that councils have taken advantage of this additional support and have protected household finances. This will make a real difference to people across Scotland."" Points to note: Band D is highlighted above as the average council tax bill for householders in Scotland. The Band D figures do not include water and sewerage charges. Therefore, the final household bill will be bigger. It will come as a relief to the Scottish government when they are finally able to confirm that council tax bills will not rise anywhere in Scotland this year. The SNP believes it will be a popular measure at a time when some families are facing financial pressures because of the pandemic. So it will be a relief for the government - but no real surprise. If any council were to decide to put up the council tax, the rise would need to be significant to be worthwhile. This is because they would have lost out on some government funding if they put up bills. The Scottish government will be hopeful that a new council tax freeze proves as popular with the public as they think the first one did. Between 2007 and 2017 the basic council tax rate didn't rise anywhere in Scotland. Since then councils have been able to put it up within agreed limits, though it's worth noting that some still opted for lower rises and even freezes. The basic argument between some in local government and Holyrood is not over whether voters will welcome another freeze - most accept they will. The argument is over whether councils have enough money overall and if they are too dependent on government cash. Most council income either comes directly from the government or, like council tax, is heavily influenced by it. Councils had already been given extra government money to cope with the pandemic but have also lost income - sports centres have been closed, facilities cannot be hired out and they have lost income from car parking. The underlying issue is whether the council tax itself is fit for purpose and whether councils should have a broader range of ways to raise finances. Fourteen years ago when the SNP first took control of Holyrood, a council tax freeze was meant to be a temporary measure while a way to replace the council tax was found. Finding an alternative or finding palatable ways of giving councils more financial independence from central government is easier said than done.

Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concerns,"Vigils highlighting women's safety on the streets are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard in south London. Reclaim These Streets events are planned across the UK on Saturday, and in Clapham, where she was last seen. Organisers said it was ""wrong that the response to violence against women requires women to behave differently"". Thousands of women are sharing online their anxieties and anger about staying safe when alone in public places. Following the arrest of a police officer on suspicion of Ms Everard's kidnap and murder, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick said: ""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets. ""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared."" Organisers of Saturday afternoon's vigil on Clapham Common said local police had ""told women not to go out at night this week"", but they say ""women are not the problem"". ""This is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day."" Vigils are planned for other cities and towns on Saturday, including Cardiff, Liverpool and St Andrews. The disappearance has prompted discussion on social media about the precautions women feel they have to take when they go out on their own. Helena Wadia told BBC Radio 5 Live said she wrote about her experience on Twitter to highlight how common it is for women to feel unsafe. Helena Wadia said changing her behaviour in public spaces was ""exhausting"" She said: ""The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old. I have been self-policing since then, we moderate everything. ""Our clothing, our drinking, we get taxis where maybe we can't afford it, we hold keys between our fingers, we don't wear headphones when we're jogging, we stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting."" Another tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces has been liked more than 120,000 times. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the concerns shared by women ""are so powerful because each and every woman can relate"". ""Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence,"" she added. Maya Tutton, who created the Our Streets Now anti-harassment campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she first experienced harassment in public at the age of 12. ""What these incidents make you do isâ¦ that they make you fear going outside and they make you feel that you are not an equal citizen to your male counterparts and that you don't have those fundamental human rights to go about your everyday life without living in fear,"" the 22-year-old said. ""We're so at the end of our tether with violence against women and girls never being a priority and never being an issue that we put money and resources into tackling."" Ms Tutton added: ""By not putting the emphasis on the perpetrator and on really tackling that culture, what we're doing is we're not getting to the root of the problem - we are being forced to change our behaviour."" 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' 5 Live Your Call: Do you feel safe? News Special podcast One in three women are subjected to violence - WHO Labour MP Jess Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, said there should not be a message to women ""where we're told what to do or what we have to do"". ""The reality is that for most women they have had some sort of experience that they feel frightened of,"" she told the Today programme. ""Women aren't weak because of a fault in their personality, women are weak because of men's violence."" Sarah Everard walked down a busy main road in Clapham before she disappeared As part of an International Women's Day debate in the House of Commons on Thursday, she read out the names of 118 women who have died since this date last year - where a man had been charged or convicted as the primary perpetrator. It took more than four minutes for her to do so. She told MPs there was currently no government study into the patterns every year of women who are killed. ""Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives - dead women is just one of those things."" But, she added: ""Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common. Dead women do count."" This video can not be played Jess Phillips lists all women killed in the UK over the last year where a man has been convicted or charged. Ms Phillips concluded saying that the name of Sarah Everard, not included on the list, ""rings out across all of our media"". ""Let's pray every day and work every day so that nobody's name ends up on this list again,"" she said. Julie Bindel, a campaigner on women's issues since the 1970s, said: ""The message from wider society and from all police officers during these many operations on violence against women should be a message for men. ""Only men can stop male violence."" She praised a tweet from one man, Stuart Edwards, who asked if there were steps men could take to reduce women's anxiety. Allow Twitter content?

Marian FitzGerald, a visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, said while women's fear was real, statistics showed women were less likely to be murdered than men. She said Ms Everard's disappearance ""shouldn't make women any more fearful than they already were"". ""Yes, the fear is real and it is always heightened when something like this is in the news. That doesn't mean to say that the risk has changed,"" she said. ""It hasn't changed much over many years. Women account for about a third of all murders. Men are far more likely to be murdered.

NHS waits at record high as second wave hits careThe scale of cancelled treatments is revealed with hospitals facing 'dire' backlog after Covid surge.Health,"The Covid surge in January hit key services including cancer and routine surgery, NHS England figures show. Less than half the expected number of operations were done, pushing the waiting list to a record-high of 4.6m. More than 300,000 of those have been waiting more than a year for treatment - compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began. Surgeons described it as a dire situation which would take a long time to turnaround. Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Behind today's statistics are people waiting in limbo. ""Many will be in considerable pain, others will have restricted mobility and be at risk of isolation and loneliness. ""Dealing with this daunting backlog will take time, and also sustained investment in the NHS,"" he said. Similar problems are also being seen in Scotland where 39,000 people have been waiting over a year for treatment. The NHS Confederation has warned the true picture could be much worse with nearly 6 million fewer referrals made by GPs in England for routine treatments, which includes operations such as knee and hip replacements, last year, suggested there was an additional hidden backlog. The organisation, which represents hospitals, said it was likely people have not sought help or found it difficult to access services during the pandemic. The numbers starting treatment for cancer and being referred for urgent check-ups returned to pre-pandemic levels in the autumn. But the data for January showed a dip in numbers for the first time since the first wave - just under 23,000 people started treatment, compared to nearly 27,500 in January 2020. Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: ""While it's positive that urgent referrals did not plummet as they did in the first wave, these January figures show that the pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on cancer patients."" NHS England said given the scale of Covid admissions seen in January, some disruption had been unavoidable. Medical director Prof Stephen Powis said: ""Admitting more than 100,000 Covid patients to hospital in a single month inevitably had a knock-on effect on some non-urgent care. ""However, thanks to the hard work of NHS staff and the innovations in treatment and care developed over the course of the pandemic, hospitals treated more than one million people with other conditions in January, at the peak of the winter wave, nearly twice as many as they did last April.

Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concernsOrganisers say it's wrong the response to violence against women requires them to behave differently.UK,"Vigils highlighting women's safety on the streets are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard in south London. Reclaim These Streets events are planned across the UK on Saturday, and in Clapham, where she was last seen. Organisers said it was ""wrong that the response to violence against women requires women to behave differently"". Thousands of women are sharing online their anxieties and anger about staying safe when alone in public places. Following the arrest of a police officer on suspicion of Ms Everard's kidnap and murder, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick said: ""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets. ""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared."" Organisers of Saturday afternoon's vigil on Clapham Common said local police had ""told women not to go out at night this week"", but they say ""women are not the problem"". ""This is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day."" Vigils are planned for other cities and towns on Saturday, including Cardiff, Liverpool and St Andrews. The disappearance has prompted discussion on social media about the precautions women feel they have to take when they go out on their own. Helena Wadia told BBC Radio 5 Live said she wrote about her experience on Twitter to highlight how common it is for women to feel unsafe. Helena Wadia said changing her behaviour in public spaces was ""exhausting"" She said: ""The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old. I have been self-policing since then, we moderate everything. ""Our clothing, our drinking, we get taxis where maybe we can't afford it, we hold keys between our fingers, we don't wear headphones when we're jogging, we stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting."" Another tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces has been liked more than 120,000 times. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the concerns shared by women ""are so powerful because each and every woman can relate"". ""Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence,"" she added. Maya Tutton, who created the Our Streets Now anti-harassment campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she first experienced harassment in public at the age of 12. ""What these incidents make you do isâ¦ that they make you fear going outside and they make you feel that you are not an equal citizen to your male counterparts and that you don't have those fundamental human rights to go about your everyday life without living in fear,"" the 22-year-old said. ""We're so at the end of our tether with violence against women and girls never being a priority and never being an issue that we put money and resources into tackling."" Ms Tutton added: ""By not putting the emphasis on the perpetrator and on really tackling that culture, what we're doing is we're not getting to the root of the problem - we are being forced to change our behaviour.""

"Scotland's housing market slump 'worst in UK'Interest from potential buyers and number of properties on the market were down, the surveyors body said.Scotland business","Scotland had the weakest figures for new buyer inquiries of any nation or region in the UK The market for homes has slowed further with lockdown, and more in Scotland than other parts of the UK. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is reporting that interest from potential buyers was down in February. The number of properties being put on the market was also down, for the fourth consecutive month. More surveyors reported prices rising than falling. RICS expects the easing of Covid restrictions in coming months to bring more activity back. Unlike last spring, the housing market has remained open in Scotland during lockdown in 2021, but with distancing restrictions. Tax cut for home buyers in Scotland will end 'as planned' Stamp duty holiday extended in England and NI Scotland had the weakest figures for new buyer inquiries of any nation or region in the UK. The only region that was weaker for selling instructions was Yorkshire, and the only part of the UK with weaker price growth was London. In the monthly RICS report, comments from agents noted some pockets of activity. In rural Scotland - from Elgin, Fraserburgh, the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway - agents noted strong demand for properties. With slow supply, they said home sales can be quick. Phiddy Robertson of the Galbraith Group in Inverness, said: ""The market is starved of good quality property. ""Buyers are paying significant premiums to secure attractive coastal property and we are seeing more interest than ever from southern buyers looking for second homes."" One Edinburgh agent said fewer people are making inquiries about properties In Edinburgh and Glasgow, surveyors found the market more patchy, noting that more flats are coming on the market as private landlords sell. In the housing rental market, Scotland had the biggest drop in property availability of any part of the UK. John Brown, a rental agent in Edinburgh, commented: ""The market is fragmented, with fewer enquiries and longer void periods between tenancies. ""It's clear landlords are looking to reduce portfolios. More legislation, and Energy Performance Certificate standards being enforced, add to costs. ""Students are registering for next year but trying to be uncommitted - that's the Covid effect"". In Dumfries at the Savills agency, Carolyn Davies said renters are looking for demand for rural properties ""but broadband speeds now need to be established prior to letting"".

The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is reporting that interest from potential buyers was down in February. The number of properties being put on the market was also down, for the fourth consecutive month. More surveyors reported prices rising than falling. RICS expects the easing of Covid restrictions in coming months to bring more activity back. Unlike last spring, the housing market has remained open in Scotland during lockdown in 2021, but with distancing restrictions. Tax cut for home buyers in Scotland will end 'as planned' Stamp duty holiday extended in England and NI Scotland had the weakest figures for new buyer inquiries of any nation or region in the UK. The only region that was weaker for selling instructions was Yorkshire, and the only part of the UK with weaker price growth was London. In the monthly RICS report, comments from agents noted some pockets of activity. In rural Scotland - from Elgin, Fraserburgh, the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway - agents noted strong demand for properties. With slow supply, they said home sales can be quick. Phiddy Robertson of the Galbraith Group in Inverness, said: ""The market is starved of good quality property. ""Buyers are paying significant premiums to secure attractive coastal property and we are seeing more interest than ever from southern buyers looking for second homes."" One Edinburgh agent said fewer people are making inquiries about properties In Edinburgh and Glasgow, surveyors found the market more patchy, noting that more flats are coming on the market as private landlords sell. In the housing rental market, Scotland had the biggest drop in property availability of any part of the UK. John Brown, a rental agent in Edinburgh, commented: ""The market is fragmented, with fewer enquiries and longer void periods between tenancies. ""It's clear landlords are looking to reduce portfolios. More legislation, and Energy Performance Certificate standards being enforced, add to costs. ""Students are registering for next year but trying to be uncommitted - that's the Covid effect"". In Dumfries at the Savills agency, Carolyn Davies said renters are looking for demand for rural properties ""but broadband speeds now need to be established prior to letting"".

NI official being sent to US amid UK-EU tensions,"A senior official from the Northern Ireland Office is to be sent to the US to try to build relations with the administration of President Joe Biden. It comes amid UK-EU tensions over the UK's decision to extend an exemption on Brexit checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Irish supermarkets. The two sides are also at odds in a row over Covid-19 vaccine exports. The US president has previously expressed concerns about the situation in Ireland after Brexit. He told reporters in Novemberthe US did not want a ""guarded border"" on the island of Irelandand that it had taken a lot of hard work to reach a settlement and end decades of conflict. And before his election, Mr Biden - an Irish American - said thatany UK-US post-Brexit trade deal had to be ""contingent"" on respect for the Good Friday Agreementand must not endanger the peace process. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Doing business with the Irish Sea Border The EU hascomplained UK's unilateral decision to extend grace periods on Brexit checks breaches part of the Brexit dealknown as the Northern Ireland Protocol, and has threatened the UK with legal action. Joao Vale de Almeida, the EU's ambassador to the UK, told ITV's Peston programme on Wednesday it would ""move forward"" with its legal action in the coming days. He said the bloc had to take legal action but he hoped that ""with some reflection"" the two sides could ""come to an understanding on the way forward"". But earlierBrexit minister Lord Frost said London would defend ""vigorously"" any legal action brought by Brusselsand that the measures taken were ""operational, technical and temporary"". And in response to criticism from MPs on Wednesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also insisted the move had been ""lawful"". ""My view is having spoken to businesses, if we hadn't have taken the action that we took last week, we would have had empty shelves in supermarkets in Northern Ireland imminently now,"" he said. ""I think that would have raised tensions further and it may well have undermined the protocol fatally in a way that is not actually in the best interests of either the EU, the UK or the people of Northern Ireland."" This video can not be played The UK has not ""blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components"", the PM tells the Commons The UK and EU have also rowed over the export of Covid-19 vaccines, with Boris Johnsonrejecting the bloc's claim that the government was stopping jabs from leaving the country. In a briefing note, European Council President Charles Michel had said the UK and the US had imposed an""outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory"",external. Mr Michel had said his claim about the UK's position was based on ""facts"", but the Foreign Office decided to summon an EU official to explain what it called the president's ""incorrect assertions"". The EU has faced production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. In January, it introduced a a system of controls on exports, requiring manufacturers to seek permission from national governments for planned sales. The bloc also drafted regulations which would haveoverridden the Northern Ireland Protocol, potentially allowing it to stop vaccines bound for Northern Ireland, but backed down after widespread criticism. PM: UK hasn't banned export of Covid vaccines EU says UK grace period extension breaches law UK acted to prevent 'empty shelves' - NI secretary US doesn't want guarded border on Ireland - Biden LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Urgent action needed on foreign influence - ex-spyChristopher Steele, who compiled the Trump-Russia dossier, says Russia and China are concerns.UK","Ex-British spy Christopher Steele wrote a dossier alleging links between Trump and Russia The UK urgently needs new legislation to restrict foreign influence over its government and institutions, according to ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele. Mr Steele, who compiled a dossier on former US President Donald Trump's ties to Moscow, told the BBC that Russia and China were the greatest concerns. He called for those working on behalf of foreign countries to be registered, like they are in the US and Australia. The Home Office says such a scheme will be part of forthcoming legislation. Mr Steele told the BBC: ""The word is out that that we're a bit of a soft touch - that we don't have regulators with teeth and we don't have legislation which is up to date and fit for purpose."" More must be done to stop Russia meddling - ex-spy UK 'badly underestimated' Russian threat Russia report: The unanswered questions The former spy was behind the so-called Trump-Russia dossier, which was released in 2017 and alleged that there had been collusion between Moscow and Mr Trump's 2016 election campaign. Its claims sparked controversy and lawsuits and Mr Steele remained unwilling to discuss it in detail with the BBC. But he did warn that the UK was in a worse position than the US when it came to foreign influence on public life. He said the US, unlike the UK, had the tools in the form of legislation to go after those secretly working on behalf of foreign nations. He pointed specifically to its Foreign Agent Registration Act, which has been the model for recent Australian legislation. ""We are way behind our allies,"" he said. The threat comes not from traditional espionage - undercover agents stealing secrets from governments - but from people who wield influence to serve the agenda of foreign governments without being open about it. ""There's a lack of transparency in Britain about the way in which foreign actors, and particularly those emanating from authoritarian states, are exerting influence over our policies,"" Mr Steele said. Russia's goals included lobbying to keep Russian individuals off sanctions lists and disguising who was behind particular businesses, he added. He argued that China's influence was more ""diffuse"" and concentrated in areas like academia. Mr Steele said there was a risk that if the UK became dependent on money from China in these areas, it would be less likely to criticise Beijing's behaviour. Some parts of the economy have become over dependent on foreign money, Mr Steele said, and professionals in the UK needed to be more diligent about knowing who their clients were. Russia has previously denied allegations of interference Last summer,a report from the Intelligence and Security Committee(ISC) on Russian activity in the UK called for new powers to counter the influence - which the government has said it is looking at. Mr Steele argued that individuals working on behalf of foreign states should be required to register. ""When you talk about foreign agents in this instance you are not talking about people who are committing treason or selling secrets to the Russians or the Chinese. You are talking about their agents, in the sense of people who are pursuing their agenda in the UK for money,"" he said. This included PR companies, lobbyists, law firms and even, Steele acknowledged, private intelligence companies like his own if they carried out work on behalf of foreign governments. He said the intention was not to ban lobbying on behalf of foreign governments - which can be legitimate -  but to make it ""transparent and accountable"". Conservative MP Bob Seely issued a report last month for the Henry Jackson Society think tank calling for a Foreign Lobbying Act which would require foreign agents and their proxies to register. Mr Steele, who said he had briefed MPs on the issues, said there needed to be criminal sanctions for failing to register - otherwise there would be a risk that any fine would be factored in as a cost of doing business. The new Australian law, passed in 2018 amid concerns over Chinese influence, includes penalties of six months to five years in prison for failing to register or providing misleading information. Mr Steele also thinks the definition of foreign agents needs to be broadly drawn to capture influence in areas like academia and the media - although he believes government and politics remain the top targets. ""Politics is the ultimate goal of the authoritarian states we're talking about and their influence operations, because ultimately it's governments that make decisions about legislation and it's governments that make decisions about imposing sanctions,"" he said. The risk of not taking action, Mr Steele believes, is that influence will grow to the point where it prevents sanctions being imposed on Russia and China. The former intelligence officer questioned why the ISC's recommendations had not yet been implemented. ""I think it's very urgent and I'm surprised, in a way, that the more hasn't been done about it, since the ISC report came out,"" he said. Mr Steele said he was worried that a post-Brexit drive for investment would make it harder to clamp down on such activities, with risks for the integrity of the institutions. ""Eventually, in the long term, you will lose out because people will realise that your country has been compromised,"" he added. The Home Office said the government would introduce a foreign agent registration scheme ""as part of forthcoming legislation to counter hostile activity by states"". ""This follows consideration of similar laws in like-minded countries including the US and Australia,"" the statement added.

Warren Buffett finally joins exclusive $100bn club,"Warren Buffett has finally joined the exclusive $100bn (Â£72bn) club that includes Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. The 90-year-old is the chairman of investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, which has seen its shares rise to a record level this year. On Wednesday his net worth edged above $100bn for the first time. Regarded as the world's most successful investor, Mr Buffett has given away billions of his wealth to charity. Warren Buffett sells off shares in US airlines Billionaire fortunes hit record high during pandemic Billionaire Mackenzie Scott marries science teacher While Mr Buffett has been a fixture at the top of the world's wealth rankings for decades, his personal fortune hasn't topped $100bn until now. One reason is his sizeable charitable donations - he has given away more than $37bn in Berkshire Hathaway stock since 2006. Mr Buffett is a co-founder of the Giving Pledge, a campaign to encourage billionaire philanthropy. Mackenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has also signed up to the pledge and gave away more than $4bn of her fortune in just four months last year. This video can not be played Shane Ryan of ready meals company Fiid: 'Learn from your knockbacks' The fifth member of the exclusive cohort is LVMH's Bernard Arnault and his family. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerburg has just slipped out of the exclusive ranks, according to the Forbes real-time billionaires list. Mr Buffett's net worth comes almost entirely from owning about one-sixth of Berkshire Hathaway, a roughly $600bn company. Its share price is up 15% this year, surpassing $400,000 a share. The investment firm had been struggling in recent years to find deals to spark its growth given its sheer size. The Omaha-based company is a major shareholder in Apple and other tech stocks that have seen their values surge during the pandemic. Berkshire Hathaway was a failing textile company before Mr Buffett took control of it 1965. It now owns more than 90 businesses.

John Lewis warns of further store closures,"This video can not be played Chairman Sharon White on 'painful' John Lewis closures Retail giant John Lewis has warned of further ""painful"" store closures after the pandemic saw it report its first ever annual loss. The group swung to a loss of Â£517m for the year to January, against profits of Â£146m the previous year. The retailer said it ""does not expect"" all of its department stores to reopen once lockdown restrictions ease. It has previously been reportedthe chain was considering closing up to eight more stores to try to cut costs. Any further closures would be in addition to eight already announced in 2020. The firm, which has 42 John Lewis shops, said talks with landlords are ongoing and it will make a final decision about the ""small number"" of shops to close at the end of March. The rise in internet shopping, accelerated by various lockdown measures during the pandemic, has forced John Lewis to rethink how many stores it needs. It said that before last March, every Â£6 in Â£10 spent on its websites was driven by its shops. That figure is now just Â£3 in Â£10. Chairman Sharon White told the BBC that the decision to close stores was ""painful"" but necessary due to a ""decade of changes in shopping habits in one year"". ""There is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store,"" she added. ""Regrettably, we do not expect to reopen all our John Lewis shops at the end of lockdown, which will also have implications for our supply chain."" She said John Lewis would do everything it could ""to lessen the impact"", but she added: ""We want to ensure our stores reflect how customers want to shop - 'right space, right place'."" Sharon White landed in the driving seat just weeks before the pandemic and swiftly had to make some tough decisions - closing stores, slashing jobs and cutting costs. She also had to tell partners that for the first time in more than 50 years they wouldn't receive their much cherished annual bonus. These past 12 months have clearly focused minds on how many big department stores it needs. Despite lockdown restrictions, John Lewis sales were flat last year. In other words, it managed to transfer all those lost sales from the High Street to online. Its website business was already strong and it predicts 70% of sales will be online from 2025. But another raft of store closures is a real blow for the towns they're based in. Some will think it's going too far - that there could be an opportunity for it to add sales, given that so many of its rivals have either beaten a retreat or disappeared altogether. John Lewis went on a big expansion spree back in 2007, almost doubling the number of stores in its portfolio. As sad as it is, it's now set to rein those numbers in. John Lewis' hefty annual loss was mainly due to the write-down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs. The group announced last July it was closing John Lewis stores in Birmingham, Croydon, Watford, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, as well as the smaller hubs at St Pancras station and Heathrow, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. In September,John Lewis also announced it was scrapping its staff bonusfor the first time since 1953. The partnership, which also runs Waitrose supermarkets, is now targeting savings of Â£300m a year by 2022. David Cartmell lost his job as a stock manager at the John Lewis store in Birmingham last year David Cartmell took great pride in working at the John Lewis store in Birmingham until it closed last year and he was made redundant. He says the news of further store closures on Thursday came as ""little surprise"". ""I always knew the original eight store closures, including my branch were just the tip of the iceberg,"" the former stock manager says. One of the groups' big problems, David says, is its past expansion strategy: ""We were trying to make the chain as common as Debenhams."" As overheads including bills, rents, salaries and bonuses mounted, he says the group became a ""victim"" of its own previous marker of success. ""We were trying to use an old business model to keep up our biggest competitors such as Amazon in a digital age."" Now, he feels ""absolutely sorry"" for the workers waiting to hear the fate of their own stores. In addition to closing some John Lewis stores, the group is trialling running dedicated John Lewis shopping areas in some Waitrose supermarkets. Waitrose benefitted from a jump in demand for online deliveries as people sought to minimise trips to the supermarket. John Lewis said the Waitrose website was taking about 240,000 orders a week, and now ""stands as a Â£1bn sales business"". The increased demand for groceries, however, did not offset the problems at the group's department stores. As a result, John Lewis confirmed that it would not return the business rates relief it has received from government during the Covid crisis. It said it had claimed Â£190m in combined rates relief and support under the furlough scheme, and that it would claim business rates relief between April and June. It said the holiday from the tax levied on non-domestic properties had helped it avoid ""a more severe restructuring of the partnership, which would have put more jobs at risk at a time when the High Street is already under pressure"". ""We are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain,"" it added. Grocers such as Morrisons, Tesco and Asdasaid in Decemberthat they would return more than Â£1.7bn in rates relief. This came after supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, were criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders.

M&S to sell clothes from rival brands online,"M&S will start selling clothes from 11 rival brands on its website this spring in a bid to boost its online sales. Marks said the move to sell items from Hobbs, Joules, Phase Eight and White Stuff from March was part of its ongoing ""transformation programme"". An M&S spokesman said the move came as part of plans to ""turbocharge online growth"". Last year, M&S posted its first loss in its 94 years as a publicly-listed company as Covid hit shop sales. Online clothing and homeware sales were up 34%according to its latest interim results,external, as losses across the business reached Â£87.6m in the six months to 26 September. The High Street stalwart is in the middle of a wide-reaching transformation programme,which last year saw 7,000 job cutsacross stores and management. Marks & Spencer snaps up Jaeger fashion brand M&S expands its scan-and-pay app to all UK stores Other brands set to be marketed on the M&S website online from spring include the menswear brand Jack & Jones and lingerie firm Sloggi. They will appear alongside other M&S items, while its own 'Classics' and 'Limited' ranges are being cut. The firm had already been experimenting with selling other brands on its website, such as womenswear retailer Nobody's Child, which was the first to launch last autumn. Executives hope new labels will draw in customers that might not typically shop with M&S, as well as offering existing customers something new. Neil Harrison, director of brands at M&S, said: ""The exciting mix will offer our 22 million customers products we already know they love and introduce them to some new brands."" This is a big shake-up for M&S fashion. New tie-ups have been coming thick and fast these last few months giving customers more choice. Up until last year, M&S only stocked clothing from its own collections. Now it's branching out with other brands to complement its own offer - and it's a sensible move. So too is pruning its own, sometimes confusing, fashion ranges. This pandemic has wreaked havoc for retail but it's also creating opportunities. Take Next, a business which already had lots of third-party brands on its website pre-pandemic. On Wednesday, it took a stake in Reiss, which will allow the chain to use Next's online infrastructure. Boohoo and Asos have also been snapping up High Street brands, like Karen Millen and Topshop, as they try to attract a broader range of shoppers. There's been quite a battle for brands this last year and M&S clearly thinks that it's now taking a big, strategic, step in the right direction. Although M&S said that there could also be ""future opportunities"" in UK stores for some brands, its key focus in recent months has been on overhauling its website amid rising competition from fast fashion firms such as Asos and Boohoo. The retailer recently announcedthat it will launch 46 new websites in overseas markets from Iceland to Uzbekistan in order to grow its online business. In January it also confirmed that it had bought the Jaeger fashion brand, but not its scores of shops and concessions. Steve Rowe, chief executive of M&S, has previously said his goal is to deliver long-term transformation and build a brand that is more digital ""in a world that will never be the same again"".

Magic tricks revealed in politics and adverts,"The ""forcing techniques"" of magic can also be used by businesses and politicians Understanding how magic tricks work could help to protect people from manipulation by politicians and marketing, say researchers. A study from Goldsmiths, University of London, says the psychology used by magicians to deceive audiences can also be used to influence consumer choices. Magic tricks use ""powerful tools"" to control behaviour, say the researchers. The psychologists looked at how tricks create an ""illusion of choice"", when the audience has no real control. The research - Mind control trick: magicians' forcing and free will, by psychologists Alice Pailhes and Gustav Kuhn - examines how magicians control their audiences' decisions - and how this can be applied to other areas. ""A lot of these magic principles show that you can very easily manipulate and influence decisions that people make - and even though they feel free to have made that decision, the magician has pretty much full control,"" says Dr Kuhn. Gustav Kuhn says magic tricks can rely on people thinking they have more choice than they really have He says in the same way that someone might be directed to choose the ""right"" card in a magic trick, so, too, we can be ""nudged"" towards buying products in the supermarket. The study, published in Trends in Cognitive Science, identifies different psychological tools used by magicians. At its most simple it can be recognising that people tend to behave in similar ways - so the researchers say that if people are asked to pick one of four cards laid in front of them, 60% of right-handed people will pick the one that is third from the left. This ""position force"" can be used to push customers towards certain products, depending on where they have been placed. ""Mental priming"" uses a repeated series of visual and verbal cues to steer an audience in a trick - and researchers found that many people could not explain why they had picked the same ""random"" number or card. There is also the so-called ""equivoke"" used by magicians - where the audience believes they are making independent decisions during a trick, while in reality nothing they do has ""any impact on the outcome"". ""Regardless of the spectator's choice, the sequences result in the same outcome. The equivoke is highly effective in providing an illusory sense of control,"" says the study. An example of this would be a card trick in which someone is invited to cut a pack of cards, with a series of stages of cutting and putting cards back on top - the ""vast majority"" fail to realise they have no impact on the target card. Dr Kuhn says the magician's ""illusion of choice"", playing on the need to feel in control, can be applied elsewhere - to consumer decisions, online entertainment or political debates. ""It really deals with one of the most fundamental concepts in humanity - do we genuinely have free will? ""We feel we need it, but this experience of free will might actually be an illusion - and it's an illusion that magicians often manipulate,"" says the psychologist. Dr Kuhn, part of the Magic Lab research team, says there is growing interest in understanding how magicians' ""forcing techniques"" can be used to influence behaviour. He sees politicians increasingly drawing on the tactic of ""misdirection"", where a magician draws the audience's attention in one direction, with something noisy or spectacular, while the real moves are being made out of sight. ""Even if you know you're being misdirected, the problem is these principles are just incredibly effective and they still have an impact,"" says Dr Kuhn. Using techniques from magic to ""modify behaviour"" can bring positive benefits, says co-author Alice Pailhes. ""They might provide new ways of encouraging better decisions in health and wellbeing,"" she says, such as steering people towards healthier food. ""But covert control and modification of people's thoughts raises serious ethical issues, too."" And she warns of ""unwanted influences, such as political propaganda"". ""We believe that understanding magicians' forcing techniques is a valuable tool to raise awareness about the ease by which our choices can be manipulated,"" says the psychologist.

Mexico takes big step towards legalised cannabis,"If approved, Mexico would be one of the world's largest regulated markets for cannabis Mexico's lower house has approved a bill that would legalise the recreational use of cannabis. It will now go to the Senate for a final vote, which President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's party is confident will pass. This would make Mexico one of the world's largest regulated markets for cannabis. Mexico has struggled with a bloody war against powerful drug cartels, with violence killing thousands yearly. Lawmakers voted in favour of the bill by 316 votes to 129. It hadalready been approved in the Senatein November but another vote is needed following some alterations by the lower house. The legislation would let users with a permit carry up to 28g and grow as many as eight plants at home for personal use. At present, it is illegal to carry more than five grams. It would also allow for other licences for the cultivation, transformation, research and export or import of cannabis, Reuters news agency reports. Health risks of recreational cannabis Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? Mr LÃ³pez Obrador has argued that the bill could help tackle the country's powerful drug cartels. One lawmaker from his Morena party told AFP news agency that the law would help to achieve peace. However critics have argued that the bill could make marijuana more accessible to children. Others have questioned why Mexicans would be able to buy as much alcohol as they like, yet be liable for prosecution if they grow more than eight cannabis plants. Should the bill be approved, Mexico would become the third country in the world, after Uruguay and Canada, to legalise cannabis for recreational use nationwide. A number of foreign cannabis-growing companies from Canada and California are said to be interested in tapping into the market opportunity presented by the legislation.

"Grenfell predicted a decade before, memo showsThe firm that made the cladding was warned of a fire that could kill 60 to 70 people, the inquiry hears.UK","The inquiry has already found the cladding was the main cause of the fire spreading The firm that made the Grenfell Tower cladding was warned of the risks of a building fire that would kill ""60 to 70"" people a decade before the tragedy. The chilling prediction of the Grenfell fire came at a presentation attended by a marketing manager from Arconic. Gerard Sonntag sent an internal memo suggesting the company stop selling the flammable version of its product, the public inquiry heard. It never happened and the fire, made worse by Arconic's cladding, killed 72. The public inquiry is hearing evidence relating to three Arconic employees who have refused to give evidence, citing a law in France where they live. Reading from internal company documents obtained by investigators, the senior inquiry counsel, Richard Millett QC said that the company's marketing manager had been ""very impressed"" by a presentation on fire safety which he attended in 2007. A consultant, Fred-Roderich Pohl set out the risks of the plastic used to make aluminium composite cladding (ACM), which he said had the same ""fuel power"" as a 19,000-litre truck of oil. The plastic, polyethylene or PE, is highly flammable. Mr Pohl showed pictures of a fire in Doha, Qatar, which developed quickly in the cladding system. In his memo about the presentation, Mr Sonntag said Mr Pohl warned: ""What will happen if only one building made out of PE is on fire and kills 60 to 70 persons."" It was a chilling prediction of the exact circumstances of the Grenfell Tower fire. In his memo, Mr Sonntag also asked colleagues what the responsibility of the cladding supplier would be in that situation. This is now a key question for the inquiry and the police, who are investigating Arconic's sales of flammable cladding. 11 key things weâve learned from the inquiry Who were the victims? Arconic now says that it made the raw materials for cladding systems and could not be held responsible for the ways in which they were used. Mr Sonntag's response to the 2007 presentation was to recommend the company stop selling the PE version of the cladding in favour of a fire-retardant (FR) type. He also said Arconic should cut production costs so that the FR version could be produced at the same price as the cheaper PE version. The company did pursue this strategy but kept the PE version on the market until after the Grenfell fire, when the role of the product in allowing flames to spread had become clear. Because three key French Arconic employees won't give evidence, Mr Millett said open questions remained, including whether Mr Sonntag's recommendations were fully discussed by the company.

"Magic tricks revealed in politics and advertsMagicians use ""powerful tools"" of psychology that could manipulate people in other ways, says study.Family & Education","The ""forcing techniques"" of magic can also be used by businesses and politicians Understanding how magic tricks work could help to protect people from manipulation by politicians and marketing, say researchers. A study from Goldsmiths, University of London, says the psychology used by magicians to deceive audiences can also be used to influence consumer choices. Magic tricks use ""powerful tools"" to control behaviour, say the researchers. The psychologists looked at how tricks create an ""illusion of choice"", when the audience has no real control. The research - Mind control trick: magicians' forcing and free will, by psychologists Alice Pailhes and Gustav Kuhn - examines how magicians control their audiences' decisions - and how this can be applied to other areas. ""A lot of these magic principles show that you can very easily manipulate and influence decisions that people make - and even though they feel free to have made that decision, the magician has pretty much full control,"" says Dr Kuhn. Gustav Kuhn says magic tricks can rely on people thinking they have more choice than they really have He says in the same way that someone might be directed to choose the ""right"" card in a magic trick, so, too, we can be ""nudged"" towards buying products in the supermarket. The study, published in Trends in Cognitive Science, identifies different psychological tools used by magicians. At its most simple it can be recognising that people tend to behave in similar ways - so the researchers say that if people are asked to pick one of four cards laid in front of them, 60% of right-handed people will pick the one that is third from the left. This ""position force"" can be used to push customers towards certain products, depending on where they have been placed. ""Mental priming"" uses a repeated series of visual and verbal cues to steer an audience in a trick - and researchers found that many people could not explain why they had picked the same ""random"" number or card. There is also the so-called ""equivoke"" used by magicians - where the audience believes they are making independent decisions during a trick, while in reality nothing they do has ""any impact on the outcome"". ""Regardless of the spectator's choice, the sequences result in the same outcome. The equivoke is highly effective in providing an illusory sense of control,"" says the study. An example of this would be a card trick in which someone is invited to cut a pack of cards, with a series of stages of cutting and putting cards back on top - the ""vast majority"" fail to realise they have no impact on the target card. Dr Kuhn says the magician's ""illusion of choice"", playing on the need to feel in control, can be applied elsewhere - to consumer decisions, online entertainment or political debates. ""It really deals with one of the most fundamental concepts in humanity - do we genuinely have free will? ""We feel we need it, but this experience of free will might actually be an illusion - and it's an illusion that magicians often manipulate,"" says the psychologist. Dr Kuhn, part of the Magic Lab research team, says there is growing interest in understanding how magicians' ""forcing techniques"" can be used to influence behaviour. He sees politicians increasingly drawing on the tactic of ""misdirection"", where a magician draws the audience's attention in one direction, with something noisy or spectacular, while the real moves are being made out of sight. ""Even if you know you're being misdirected, the problem is these principles are just incredibly effective and they still have an impact,"" says Dr Kuhn. Using techniques from magic to ""modify behaviour"" can bring positive benefits, says co-author Alice Pailhes. ""They might provide new ways of encouraging better decisions in health and wellbeing,"" she says, such as steering people towards healthier food. ""But covert control and modification of people's thoughts raises serious ethical issues, too."" And she warns of ""unwanted influences, such as political propaganda"". ""We believe that understanding magicians' forcing techniques is a valuable tool to raise awareness about the ease by which our choices can be manipulated,"" says the psychologist.
