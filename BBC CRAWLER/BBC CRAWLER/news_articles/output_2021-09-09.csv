Student hacker jailed for selling exam answers,"Hayder Aljayyash recruited Noureldien Eltarki to find students to buy the papers A former student has been jailed for 20 months for hacking university computers and selling exam answers for thousands of pounds. Hayder Aljayyash, 29, was studying for a master's degree in embedded system design at the University of South Wales when he broke into its systems. Aljayyash's crimes were committed between November 2017 and May 2019. Cardiff Crown Court heard Aljayyash, from Iraq, remained undetected by using ""sophisticated"" techniques. It was told he recruited housemate and fellow student Noureldien Eltarki, 30, to find students to buy the papers. Eltarki, from Libya, was given a nine-month suspended sentence for agreeing to sell unlawfully obtained exams and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work. Both men pleaded guilty to their charges at a previous hearing. The system breach was discovered by maths lecturer, Liam Harris, while marking an exam in May 2019. Jim Davis, prosecuting, said it became obvious to Mr Harris a number of students had answered questions by copying his own marking scheme and solutions. Five students had even copied typing mistakes from Mr Harris's original working papers. A team was then set up within the university to investigate and determine the size of the data breach. Cardiff Crown Court heard the university established a ""war room"" to process 140 million log records, which identified an IP address - linked to a house in Brook Street, Treforest, where Aljayyash and Eltarki were both living - from which the systems were accessed. The men were sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court Both men studied at the university's engineering and computer sciences faculty. Police were informed of what had happened and arrested Aljayyash at home on 30 May 2019. Mr Davis told the court police seized computer equipment belonging to Aljayyash, including USB sticks and a laptop which contained ""numerous files which matched those downloaded as part of the university breach"". The court heard the defendant used staff log-in details to access the network almost 700 times. Mr Davis said Aljayyash used ""a sophisticated key logging device to acquire details of staff usernames and passwords"". The court heard Aljayyash made about Â£20,000, including Â£6,500 from one second-year student. Eltarki was paid Â£300 or Â£400 each time by Aljayyash for finding students to buy the stolen papers. The court heard the investigation and new security measures cost the university more than Â£100,000. Sentencing Aljayyash, Judge Wynn Morgan told the defendant had ""obvious talent and skill,"" and what he did was ""planned and consistent"". He called the scheme ""very sophisticated"" and said it had ""damaged the reputation of the institution"". He told Aljayyash that his motive was ""financial greed"". The court heard Aljayyash accepted responsibility for what he did and was ""ashamed"" of his actions. The court was told he has moved to Doncaster, where he was volunteering at a charity shop fixing laptops and helping other asylum seekers to use technology. The court heard he was ""intent on helping people use the internet for good"". Susan Ferrier, who defended Eltarki, told the court her client realised he had made as ""stupid a decision as he could have"". Judge Wynn Morgan told Eltarki the ""scheme was evidently not your idea but you attempted making money on the side which is self-evidently wrong"". After the case, South Wales Police's Det Con Marc Troake said: ""Through collaborative and intensive investigation involving South Wales Police and IT teams at the University of South Wales, we were able to trace these individuals who believed they could cheat the system. ""I hope that this sentence serves as a warning to those thinking about attempting to overcome security protocols for financial gain.""

"Don't mix business and public duty, top Tory told","Ben Elliot runs a concierge company for wealthy clients Conservative Party co-chair Ben Elliot has been warned to maintain a ""clear distinction"" between his public duties and his private business interests. The lobbying watchdog investigated after reports suggested Mr Elliot's firm Quintessentially had arranged access to top politicians for clients. It found it ""had not been engaging in consultant lobbying activity"". But it urged Mr Elliot to be ""cautious"" and ensure his two roles remain separate. Mr Elliot's spokesman said: ""The registrar has made clear that Quintessentially does not lobby government and therefore does not need to register as a lobbyist."" Labour said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should sack him from his role in the Conservative Party. Lobbying is the widely used term for individuals, businesses, trade unions, groups or charities trying to persuade a government to change its policies. The Tory Party money man with A-list connections Top Tory marketing Covid tests prompts questions The Office of the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists (ORCL) began an investigation last month into whether Quintessentially - which provides art, travel services and property for wealthy clients - had become an ""unregistered consultant lobbyist"". It found the company had given ""substantive assurances that no consultant lobbying is undertaken"" on behalf of customers. But the ORCL also said Mr Elliot should be careful ""about the possibility of engaging in consultant lobbying activity (perhaps unintentionally) by not making a clear enough distinction between his role as a director of Quintessentially and his other activities connected to government"". Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds said: ""The lobbying regulator is sending a clear message to Boris Johnson about the actions of the co-chair of the Conservative Party.""

First UK LGBT business champion appointed,"Iain Anderson has been appointed as the first LGBT business champion The UK's first LGBT business champion has pledged to build a bridge between the government and the LGBT community. Iain Anderson, executive chairman of public relations firm Cicero, will focus on improving workplace equality at a small business level. OneCIPD report suggested,external40% of LGB employees had experienced conflict at work, rising to 55% of trans employees. Earlier this year, the government's LGBT advisory panel wasdisbanded after several members quit. One, Jayne Ozanne, accused the government of creating a ""hostile environment"" for LGBT people. The members left over the government's handling of LGBT rights and amid claims it was ""dragging its feet"" on a pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy. ""I definitely see my role as a link between the LGBT community, government and business and I want to build a bridge between the three parties,"" Mr Anderson said. ""If businesses see me, and in turn government, putting in place tangible ways to allow LGBT people to be themselves, they'll understand that this is a priority area and do more about it."" Mr Anderson, a Stonewall ambassador, was appointed to the new unpaid position by equalities minister Liz Truss. He told the BBC that the UK had ""come a long way"" on LGBT issues, but there was ""still a lot of prejudice and discrimination out there"". He added that large firms had put in a lot of work on improving conditions for LGBT workers and he wanted to help small firms ""buddy up"" with bigger companies to learn from their experiences. ""I don't want this to be a burden, I want this to be an opportunity,"" he added. Stonewall's Robbie de Santos described the appointment as a ""really important move"" and said it was the government's responsibility to ""set the tone and culture"" for what was happening in the UK. ""Where35% of LGBT+ people hide who they are at work for fear of discrimination,external- and two in five haven't told anyone about being bi at work - we are in a situation where the government does need to step in. ""It's just not on that huge sections of the LGBT population can have that experience at work, so it's a welcome sign the government has appointed someone specifically to look at this. If you think about how much of time we spend at work, it's really key."" For his part, Mr Anderson said that coming out as gay at work helped his business to thrive. ""I've been in business 30 years and I didn't feel able to be myself at work for about half that time,"" he said. LGBT people faced an average pay gap of 16% compared to heterosexual people, a2019 YouGov survey for LinkedIn suggested,external- roughly double the UK's gender pay gap. While gender pay gap reporting has become compulsory for large businesses - suspended during the pandemic - Mr Anderson is not pushing for mandatory reporting of LGBT pay gaps. ""I'm open to conversations with businesses and organisations about any suggestions they have to improve the workplace for LGBT people. If pay gap reporting is one of those suggestions, then I'm more than happy to look at this as an option."" He also acknowledges that LGBT pay gap reporting is more ""tricky"" as not all employees wish to be out at work. In the role, he will also help British businesses to advocate LGBT equality in their international trading partners ahead of the UK's first global LGBT conference next summer. Small business owner Jose Franca urged the government not to use the appointment as a 'tick-box' exercise. Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Business (FSB), welcomed Mr Anderson's appointment. ""We hope this will instil a new clear focus on LGBT+ individuals who run small businesses right across the country who are so often overlooked compared to others. ""All too often, it is only larger companies and corporates that offered serious engagement with these issues, it's vital that small business owners and the self-employed are also considered and involved. ""The government must lead the way on this, by offering mentoring opportunities, role models and an expanded business network"". Matthew Percival, skills and inclusion director at the Confederation of British Industry said: ""Employers need to be thinking about all groups of society, taking steps to understand and respond to the experiences of LGBT employees. ""Forums or networks that help LGBT colleagues put forward their views and priorities to management are one of many practical ways in which this can be done."" He added that the government could ""send a powerful signal"" by ratifying the International Labour Organization'sViolence and Harassment Convention,external, described as the first international treaty to recognise the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment. Jose Franca, who runs an LGBT business group, urged the government not to make the role a ""tick-box"" exercise. ""We feel that small business LGBT+ members aren't being represented and we say to the government, don't use us as tick-box exercise, engage with us - what are our challenges? Give us the spotlight,"" says Mr Franca, a developmental consultant who helps lead an LGBTQ+ support group for the FSB.

Amazon offers to pay college fees for US staff,"Amazon has offered to cover the cost of college tuition of all 750,000 of its frontline workers in the US. It comes as the online shopping giant struggles to attract and retain staff amid an industry wide labour shortage. The firm said it would invest $1.2bn in the scheme, with workers able to access the annual funding for as long as they remain at Amazon. It is the latest big firm to offer to fund workers' education after similar moves by Walmart and Target. In a blog post,external, Amazon said its college tuition offer would apply at ""hundreds of education partners across the country"" without stating which ones. The shopping giant said it would also cover other types of education including high school diplomas and English language courses, as well as extending on-the-job career training to 300,000. ""Amazon is now the largest job creator in the US, and we know that investing in free skills training for our teams can have a huge impact for hundreds of thousands of families across the country,"" said Dave Clark, head of worldwide consumer at Amazon. McDonaldâs in US hiring 14-year-olds amid shortage US job vacancies hit a record 10.1 million US firms are offering a range of benefits and incentives to lure employees back to the workforce as restrictions ease. According to the US Labor Department, job openings hit a fresh record high of 10.9 million in July, surpassing the number of unemployed people by more than two million. Experts say a mixture of people leaving the workforce during the pandemic, lingering concerns about Covid and a lack of childcare have prolonged the shortage. Last month Walmart said it would pay the costs of tuition and books for its hourly staffers, with about 1.5 million people eligible. And Target said it would offer free undergraduate degrees to more than 340,000 employees at its US stores. Firms have also raised starting wages or offered bonuses to win workers, with some even urging 14 and 15 year-olds to apply to tackle the shortage.

Hong Kong police raid Tiananmen Square museum,"A paper model of the Goddess of Democracy was removed from the museum A museum commemorating the deadly 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown has been raided by Hong Kong police. Officers were later seen carrying exhibits out of the June 4 Museum. Four members of the group that ran the museum, the Hong Kong Alliance, were detained on Wednesday - including prominent pro-democracy activist and barrister Chow Hang Tung. The arrests were made under the national security law, which has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Police have accused Ms Chow of inciting subversion, her lawyers said. The group, known for organising the city's famed annual vigil for Tiananmen Square victims, denies accusations of being a foreign agent. The museum was closed down by officials in June. Thursday's raid was carried out by the newly created national security unit. Among the exhibits seen being removed was a paper model of the Goddess of Democracy - a symbol of the 1989 pro-democracy student movement in Beijing. Officers were also seen carrying out photos of the large candlelit vigils for Tiananmen victims. The national security unit had earlier requested that the Hong Kong Alliance hand over information, reportedly including personal details of all members since the group's founding and financial records. On Tuesday, the deadline for the request, the alliance members handed over a letter explaining their refusal to co-operate. The next morning, police officers arrested members of the alliance's standing committee at their homes or offices. Ms Chow, a human rights lawyer, was arrested earlier this year and charged with promoting unauthorised assembly. She was later released on bail. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? What were the Tiananmen Square protests about? She had been due on Wednesday to represent an opposition politician charged under the national security law at a bail hearing but was arrested at her office before she could appear in court. China recently imposed a broadly worded national security law in Hong Kong that criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent but China says it is meant to maintain stability.

France and UK clash over Border Force tactic plans,"UK Border Force officials working with migrants brought into Dover harbour on Thursday France has hit out at the UK over plans to turn back some boats carrying migrants across the Channel to England. The government wants the Border Force to turn away boats - but only in limited circumstances under a pre-authorised policy signed off by Home Secretary Priti Patel. France said this would break international maritime law, and also accused the UK of financial blackmail. Boris Johnson's spokesman has said any new plans will be safe and legal. The UK's Border Force has been training for months to use the highly controversial tactic of turning boats back in certain circumstances. Government sources told the BBC that the final training may take place within days, subject to the weather, meaning the tactic could be in place and ready to be used whenever the UK thinks it is practical, safe and legal to do so. Are migrant 'pushbacks' in the Channel legal? What happens to people found in the Channel? What happens when they reach the UK? But France - as well as campaigners and critics - have questioned the legality of the plan. They believe it breaks international maritime law, which says people at risk of losing their lives at sea must be rescued. The government's lawyers say turning boats back would be legal in limited and specific circumstances - although they have not confirmed what these will be. A man being brought ashore in Dover on Thursday In a strongly worded tweet,,externalFrench interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said France would not accept any practice that breaks maritime law. ""UK's commitment must be kept,"" he said. ""I clearly said it to my counterpart Priti Patel. The friendship between our two countries deserves better than posturing which undermines the cooperation between our ministries"". He also accused the UK of financial blackmail - referring to a deal the UK and France struck over money earlier this year, when the British government promised to pay Â£54.2m for extra action on the French side of the Channel such as doubling the number of coast patrols. Since then, Ms Patel has warned that Britain could withhold the money, unless more boats are intercepted. The PM's spokesman rejected those accusations, saying the government has ""provided our French counterparts significant sums of money previously, and we've agreed another bilateral agreement backed by millions of pounds"". And he said: ""Any approach Border Force use is safe and legal. Our operational activities comply with domestic and international law."" He added that ""we continue to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options"" and any approach ""is tested through multiple sea trials"". The UK has a legal right to intercept people at sea where necessary to prevent crime or to protect borders. But whatever the legal advice the UK government has received on migrant boats, it's questionable whether such an operation could continue once there is a clear sign of danger. Border Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible. So their window of opportunity to run a push-back operation could be very tight. But more importantlyâ¦ is this really ever going to happen? The intervention from the French interior minister may have just sunk the operation before a single Border Force ship has set sail. There are no international waters in the Dover Strait - so any operation would need French co-operation. And GÃ©rald Darmanin's statement makes clear France's opposition to any confrontation of dinghies in one of the world's most dangerous shipping lanes. Charities and opposition politicians have also criticised the plan. The British Red Cross said it was concerned that sending people back to sea could ""make already treacherous journeys even more perilous"". ""Crossing the Channel in a small boat is only ever a desperate last resort, and an extremely dangerous one. When people's lives are in danger they need help, compassion and humanity, not to have their ordeal extended."" Amnesty International UK said people ""only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them"". And the boss of charity Refugee Action said the policy was ""about bullying refugees to score political points rather than breaking up smuggling gangs. ""We all want the boats to stop but this plan massively increases the chances of families drowning at sea."" Labour also said the tactic risks lives, adding: ""That the home secretary is even considering these dangerous proposals shows how badly she has lost control of this situation."" Boats used by migrants to cross the Channel are stored at a warehouse in Dover Rising numbers of migrants have been crossing the English Channel in recent months - since Sunday more than 1,700 people have crossed by boat. And in total this year, more than 14,000 migrants have made the journey across. The Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world. Many migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities. The government has previously spoken of cracking down on the organised crime gangs who smuggle people across the Channel, often for profit. On Thursday, No 10 said the public expects the government to act. ""We know this is a long-standing problem that the public expect us to address. It simply cannot be right that dangerous... that criminal gangs are able to exploit our most vulnerable and put their lives at risk. ""It needs to be addressed, it's what the public want, and it's what we're doing."" If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port If they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them Each country has search-and-rescue zones An EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it ""I HAD HOPE THAT ONE DAY I WOULD BREAK THROUGH"":The prize-winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo GOING 'FILTER FREE':Will Hayley decide to drop the filters and embrace her 'flaws'?

LiveLiveMSPs back Scottish vaccine passports25 minutes ago,"SNP and Scottish Green MSPs back a scheme requiring people going to nightclubs and big sports stadia to show their Covid vaccination status The vaccine passports will come into force in Scotland on 1 October, the same day a similar scheme begins in England Ahead of a vote, a debate took place at the Scottish Parliament in which opposition MSPs voiced their objections Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was unclear how the passports would work Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie said there was no evidence the scheme would encourage the unvaccinated to get a jab And Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton told the debate: ""You should never have to provide any aspect of your medical history to a bouncer to get into a nightclub."" BBC Scotland News People queued for entry into nightclubs when they reopened Holyrood votes to back controversial plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme in Scotland. 68 MSPs voted for the government motion, with 55 against. The move will mean that only people who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events and many concerts and festivals. The Scottish government says the plan is designed to allow large events to go ahead as safely as possible. Details of the proposals wereonly published by the government,externalon Thursday morning - just hours before the vote. The closing speeches have taken place, with Health Secretary Humza Yousaf speaking for the government. MSPs will shortly back this motion With the backing of the Greens this motion is guaranteed to pass at 5.30pm. The Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems will all vote against it. The UK medicines regulator has approved the use of Pfizer and AstraZeneca as Covid booster vaccines, paving the way for a rollout ahead of the winter. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the UK vaccine advisory body, has not decided if they are needed, and who should be eligible. The JCVI has saida third dose should be offeredto people with severely-weakened immune systems. Up to half a million people over the age of 12 in the UK are in this group. Read more here.

Ms Mackay implores the Conservatives to lobby their colleagues at Westminster to extend furlough. The Green MSP says if the health of the population was the only thing at risk then wider restrictions would ""probably be an obvious step"" - however she says this is ""no longer a choice"" with the end of furlough coming. Having worked with the government on the scheme, she welcomes the provisional end date for passports at the end of February and says medical data will be ""limited"" so as not to adversely affect marginalised groups. She concludes saying we are ""in the realm of the least worst option"", but says her party will continue to work with the government on the issue. Vaccination certification will be introduced for the following events and venues: Scottish Green MSP Gillian Mackay outlines her party's position on vaccine passports Gillian Mackay of the Scottish Greens sets out the reasons behind her party's backing of vaccine passports after ""hoping"" it would not be a necessary measure. She says Scotland is ""on the brink"" of re-imposing restrictions and cites health boards that have stopped certain procedures due to Covid pressure. Ms Mackay asks the cabinet secretary to divulge if there has been any more uptake of the vaccination among young people since last week and argues for more encouragement for these age groups to get jagged. She says the passport scheme does not appear to have increased vaccine hesitancy, but says she ""implores"" health boards to reach out to groups that have already expressed concerns. To date  75.1% of 18-29 year olds have had a first dose, with about 700-800 typically coming forward for their first jab each day. That means that roughly 200,000 people in this age group are still unvaccinated. Progress has been brisker among 16 and 17-year-olds, with more than 60% having had a first dose despite the rollout to this age group only starting in August. When it comes to figures for both doses, 57.5% of 18-29 year olds are fully vaccinated. For 16 and 17 year olds, the figure is much lower - 8.9% - as many of them have only recently had their first jab. New apps are being developed to display and read the Scottish vaccine passport's QR codes MSPs are debating controversial plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme in Scotland. The move will mean that only people who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events and many concerts and festivals. The Scottish government says the plan is designed to allow large events to go ahead as safely as possible. Details of the proposals wereonly published by the government,externalon Thursday morning - just hours before the vote. The Scottish government has published the latest Covid-19 statistics. And on vaccinations: Mr Cole-Hamilton says the passports represent the beginning of medical ID cards as they require a photo. He also argues they may not increase the rate of vaccination uptake among young people either as there is already a black market for vaccine certificates in France. Finally, he calls on the government to exempt young people from having to use the scheme for things like football matches as it would ""artificially put pressure"" on them to decide whether or not to have the vaccine. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says his party is ""fundamentally opposed"" to the passport scheme on grounds of ideology and
practicality. He says it does not address the booster programme, which could result in ""another crushing burden"" to the hospitality industry. After talks with industry representatives, he says there is concern vaccine passports could give people a ""false sense of security"" which could lead to increased transmission of the virus. One alternative plan would be to present a negative lateral flow test for access to venues, he says, as it does not ""compel you to access
certain form of treatment"". Ms Baillie asks why the Scottish government is moving at ""snail's pace"" on improving Test and Protect. The Scottish Labour MSP warns: ""They are simply not coping."" Jackie Baillie warns there is a real danger that vaccine hesitancy may become entrenched if the passport scheme is introduced. Scottish Labour's health spokesperson also warns about exacerbating inequalities. She asks if the SNP government have engaged with the nightime and hospitality industries. Ms Baillie warns the government is in danger of giving a false sense of confidence. Mr Ross points out that the vaccine status app the government is rolling out will need an update in future and that the government has not provided sector specific detail on how the scheme will be operated. He quotes Steven Montgomery from the Hospitality Group who said the sector does not know how passports are going to work. Mr Swinney asks Mr Ross to set out what he believes are the steps to take to avoid more restrictions, to which the Scottish Conservative Party leader says contact tracing should be improved. Mr Ross concludes that his party will not be voting for the vaccine passport scheme. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross begins by repeating his question to Mr Swinney - what is a nightclub? Mr Swinney says this question is the subject of further discussions with the night-time industry and will be set out in regulations. Mr Ross says the deputy first minister wants parliamentarians to ""impose"" vaccine passports on establishments without knowing which ones it will affect. He also disagrees with MSP John Mason, who argues that the parliament's Covid committee would look at the details while today MSPs vote ""in principle"". Mr Swinney says: ""We propose
that vaccination certification should be introduced once all adults have had
the opportunity to be fully vaccinated."" Vaccination certification will be introduced for the following events and venues: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
MSPs to vote on Scottish vaccine passport scheme,"People queued for entry into nightclubs when they reopened MSPs are to vote on controversial plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme in Scotland. The move will mean that only people who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events and many concerts and festivals. The Scottish government says the plan is designed to allow large events to go ahead as safely as possible. Details of the proposals wereonly published by the government,externalon Thursday morning - just hours before the vote. It says the government is still ""working with stakeholders to finalise a definition"" of what is and is not a nightclub - which has been one of the key concerns of the licensed trade. Opposition parties and some of the businesses that will be affected have questioned how the scheme will work in practice, and have complained of a lack of detail from the government. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already vowed to vote against the plans - with the Conservatives describing it as ""shambolic, last-minute, kneejerk decision making"". What do we know about Scotland's vaccine passport? How will Scotland's vaccine certificate change? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The Scottish Greens have been highly critical of vaccine passports in the past - as have some senior Scottish government ministers - but have since signed a formal partnership agreement with the SNP and are thought to be unlikely to vote against the scheme. This would give the government enough votes in the Scottish Parliament to pass the new rules. Assuming the proposals are approved by Holyrood, the passport scheme is expected to come into force from 1 October, once all adults in Scotland have had the chance to be fully vaccinated. Leon Thompson, of the trade body UK Hospitality Scotland, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmethat his members were ""very concerned"" about a lack of detail on how the passports would work. He said: ""There's been some very rushed and hurried conversations with officials over the last few days but we still have no real information on how the Scottish government will introduce the scheme."" Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on football clubs Mr Thompson said there was real difficulty in defining what counted as a nightclub and added that he had seen no evidence from the Scottish government that this was going to make a difference to infection rates. The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) has alsoraised concernsabout how the scheme will impact on its clubs. And some people who had one of their vaccine doses outside of Scotland haveexperienced problemsin getting an accurate vaccination certificate. The new rules will mean people over the age of 18 will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues. Unseated indoor live events, with more than 500 people in the audience. Unseated outdoor live events, with more than 4,000 people in the audience. Any event, of any nature, which has more than 10,000 people in attendance. People who have had two vaccines in Scotland can already download or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code. By the end of the month, it is expected that this code will also be available on a new NHS Scotland Status app. These codes can be scanned at a venue to confirm the user is fully vaccinated. Anyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. Similar schemes are already in operation in other European countries, while people in England will need to have a ""Covid pass"" to access ""higher risk"" settings such as nightclubsfrom the end of this month. A major goal of the scheme is to encourage more younger people to be vaccinated - with the latest figures showing that uptake among those under the age of 40 in Scotland has been lower than older age groups. Many areas of Scotland have seen some of the highest Covid rates in Europe in recent weeks - although there are signs thatthe surge in cases is beginning to slow down. The number of people in hospital and intensive care units has also been steadily rising, with health professionals warning that that NHS is coming under increasing strain. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that vaccine passports will be a direct alternative to imposing tougher restrictions on venues, many of which have only recently reopened. She told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that certification was a ""reasonable response to a very difficult situation, and much more proportionate than any likely alternatives"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said at the weekend that his party would vote against the scheme, which he has described as an attempt by the government to ""look in control of a virus that is clearly out of control."" He said there was a chance that using vaccine passports might actually entrench vaccine hesitancy rather than encourage uptake, and argued that the government should be focusing on ramping up the vaccine rollout and improving Test and Protect rather than creating a new system. Conservative leader Douglas Ross confirmed on Thursday morning that his party would also vote against vaccine passports, adding: ""There are still no answers to any of the key questions on infrastructure, administration, fraud, enforcement and data concerns.""

Victims call for Met Police commissioner to go,"Dame Cressida Dick became the first woman to lead the Metropolitan Police when she was appointed in 2017 Victims of police injustice are calling for the prime minister to replace Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick when her contract comes to an end in April. In an open letter, they accuse her of ""presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover-up"". The BBC understands Dame Cressida, 60, has been offered a two-year extension and that negotiations are ongoing. Since her appointment in 2017, she has been involved in several controversies. Two of the seven who signed the letter,published in the Daily Mail,external, are Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephenwas murdered in a racist attack,external, and Lady Brittan, whose home was raided when her husband Lord Brittanwas falsely accused of child abuse. PM 'has complete confidence' in Met Police boss Met Police chief: 'I'm a bit different' The others include Alastair Morgan, whose brother Daniel was murdered in 1987 - the killer remains unidentified and a report into the caseaccused the force of institutional corruptionand sparked denials from the Met's leadership - and the son of D-Day Army officer Lord Bramall,who was falsely accusedof child sexual abuse by thepaedophile and fantasist Carl Beech. BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini,who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, and the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor -another victim of Beech's false allegations- are also signatories, as is Sir Edward Heath's biographer Michael McManus. The former prime minister was another public figuresmeared by Beech. This video can not be played Paul Gambaccini: ""The Metropolitan Police have obfuscated the truth from the people of this country"" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Mr Proctor said it was ""utterly extraordinary"" the government should contemplate extending Dame Cressida's tenure ""even for a day, let alone two years"". He said the letter's signatories were linked by their common experiences of police malpractice over a number of years, and they had come up with no reason why the chief commissioner ""who has failed and failed and failed"" should be given an extension. ""There must be other chief commissioners outside of London who'd be prepared to do the job and do it a great deal better, with integrity and without cover-up after cover-up. ""I personally believe she should have resigned months ago. I'm not fighting for myself, I'm fighting for the future so that it won't happen to anyone else. ""And it could happen to someone else if changes are not made at the top of the Metropolitan Police. No-one has been held responsible for the problems Operation Midland [the Carl Beech allegations investigation] created. ""The commissioner even got a damehood - quite outrageous."" Harvey Proctor said Dame Cressida should have resigned months ago Mr Proctor said he received an apology in person from Lord Hogan-Howe, Dame Cressida's predecessor, who was the Met's chief commissioner while Beech's allegations were treated as ""credible and true"", but he rejected an apology from Dame Cressida because ""her words and actions did not go hand in hand"". ""I call on the prime minister and the home secretary to meet with all seven of us to hear our experiences - and I would defy them then to continue with any extension of her remit."" Mr Gambaccini, who sued the Met over the way it dealt with accusations against him, said Dame Cressida postponed the case for as long as possible in what he described as ""three and a half years of non-honesty"". Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, he also said that he and his fellow signatories ""all found that the leadership of the Metropolitan Police is breathtakingly corrupt"". He accused both the chief commissioner and the force of misleading the public. Lady Brittan, the widow of Lord Brittan, is among those calling for Dame Cressida's tenure to end As the first female Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick was bound to be well received when she was appointed in 2017. It was the job she had always wanted and it meant a return to the force where she had spent most of her career and where she was popular with the rank and file. Some of the criticism now being levelled at her relates to her time at Scotland Yard before she was in the top job. In 2014 as an assistant commissioner she was in charge of the team involved in Operation Midland - the disastrous long-running inquiry into an alleged VIP paedophile ring. When Midland collapsed and the complainant, Carl Beech, was exposed as a serial liar, criticism was levelled at a number of officers including one detective who had initially described Beech's story as ""credible and true"". Cressida Dick admitted that she had heard the officer say this on the radio and had done nothing to correct it. The former MP Harvey Proctor, who lost his job and his home as a result of being falsely accused by Carl Beech, is one of the seven signatories to the letter saying that Dame Cressida must not have her contract extended. He, like the others, does not believe that over the past four years she has displayed the right characteristics to remain in the role. Doreen, now Baroness, Lawrence is the first name on the letter. She says she is unhappy that the commissioner has closed her son's murder inquiry and, as a lifelong race campaigner, she is also concerned about the Met's use of stop and search. The signatories were brought together by the Daily Mail, which has been calling for Cressida Dick to go. The commissioner recently described herself as an honourable person. The question now is whether she will want to accept a two-year extension. Mr Gambaccini also criticised the BBC for its reporting of his case, accusing it of being on the ""side of wrongdoers"". He has previously described the corporation as ""the worst employer in the world"", alleging that no senior managers were in touch with him during his time under investigation by the Met Police. The BBC said it had no comment to make. In February 2017, Dame Cressida became the first woman to lead London's force since its inception in 1829. Her appointment wascriticised at the time by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly shot dead during an operation she led in 2005. Now Dame Cressida is coming to the end of a five-year contract, Home Secretary Priti Patel has consulted with London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Downing Street over the decision to ask her to stay on for two more years, according to media reports. Protesters demonstrate outside Scotland Yard over the treatment of people by police at the Sarah Everard vigil The Met commissioner resisted pressure on her to resign in March when the force came under scrutiny over thehandling of a vigil held in memory of Sarah Everard,the marketing executive murdered by then-Met Police constable Wayne Couzens. The force has faced repeated accusations of racial bias in its use of stop-and-search powers and was hit with criticism over the security of Wembley stadium during the final of the Euro 2020 championships. Since the start of the year, both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the home secretary havepublicly backed Dame Cressida. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The appointment of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service is a formal process which will be confirmed in the proper way."" The mayor of London and Met Police have declined to comment.

"France and UK clash over Border Force tactic plansFrance says turning boats away would break maritime law, but No 10 says all its actions are legal.UK","UK Border Force officials working with migrants brought into Dover harbour on Thursday France has hit out at the UK over plans to turn back some boats carrying migrants across the Channel to England. The government wants the Border Force to turn away boats - but only in limited circumstances under a pre-authorised policy signed off by Home Secretary Priti Patel. France said this would break international maritime law, and also accused the UK of financial blackmail. Boris Johnson's spokesman has said any new plans will be safe and legal. The UK's Border Force has been training for months to use the highly controversial tactic of turning boats back in certain circumstances. Government sources told the BBC that the final training may take place within days, subject to the weather, meaning the tactic could be in place and ready to be used whenever the UK thinks it is practical, safe and legal to do so. Are migrant 'pushbacks' in the Channel legal? What happens to people found in the Channel? What happens when they reach the UK? But France - as well as campaigners and critics - have questioned the legality of the plan. They believe it breaks international maritime law, which says people at risk of losing their lives at sea must be rescued. The government's lawyers say turning boats back would be legal in limited and specific circumstances - although they have not confirmed what these will be. A man being brought ashore in Dover on Thursday In a strongly worded tweet,,externalFrench interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said France would not accept any practice that breaks maritime law. ""UK's commitment must be kept,"" he said. ""I clearly said it to my counterpart Priti Patel. The friendship between our two countries deserves better than posturing which undermines the cooperation between our ministries"". He also accused the UK of financial blackmail - referring to a deal the UK and France struck over money earlier this year, when the British government promised to pay Â£54.2m for extra action on the French side of the Channel such as doubling the number of coast patrols. Since then, Ms Patel has warned that Britain could withhold the money, unless more boats are intercepted. The PM's spokesman rejected those accusations, saying the government has ""provided our French counterparts significant sums of money previously, and we've agreed another bilateral agreement backed by millions of pounds"". And he said: ""Any approach Border Force use is safe and legal. Our operational activities comply with domestic and international law."" He added that ""we continue to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options"" and any approach ""is tested through multiple sea trials"". The UK has a legal right to intercept people at sea where necessary to prevent crime or to protect borders. But whatever the legal advice the UK government has received on migrant boats, it's questionable whether such an operation could continue once there is a clear sign of danger. Border Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible. So their window of opportunity to run a push-back operation could be very tight. But more importantlyâ¦ is this really ever going to happen? The intervention from the French interior minister may have just sunk the operation before a single Border Force ship has set sail. There are no international waters in the Dover Strait - so any operation would need French co-operation. And GÃ©rald Darmanin's statement makes clear France's opposition to any confrontation of dinghies in one of the world's most dangerous shipping lanes. Charities and opposition politicians have also criticised the plan. The British Red Cross said it was concerned that sending people back to sea could ""make already treacherous journeys even more perilous"". ""Crossing the Channel in a small boat is only ever a desperate last resort, and an extremely dangerous one. When people's lives are in danger they need help, compassion and humanity, not to have their ordeal extended."" Amnesty International UK said people ""only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them"". And the boss of charity Refugee Action said the policy was ""about bullying refugees to score political points rather than breaking up smuggling gangs. ""We all want the boats to stop but this plan massively increases the chances of families drowning at sea."" Labour also said the tactic risks lives, adding: ""That the home secretary is even considering these dangerous proposals shows how badly she has lost control of this situation."" Boats used by migrants to cross the Channel are stored at a warehouse in Dover Rising numbers of migrants have been crossing the English Channel in recent months - since Sunday more than 1,700 people have crossed by boat. And in total this year, more than 14,000 migrants have made the journey across. The Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world. Many migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities. The government has previously spoken of cracking down on the organised crime gangs who smuggle people across the Channel, often for profit. On Thursday, No 10 said the public expects the government to act. ""We know this is a long-standing problem that the public expect us to address. It simply cannot be right that dangerous... that criminal gangs are able to exploit our most vulnerable and put their lives at risk. ""It needs to be addressed, it's what the public want, and it's what we're doing."" If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port If they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them Each country has search-and-rescue zones An EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it ""I HAD HOPE THAT ONE DAY I WOULD BREAK THROUGH"":The prize-winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo GOING 'FILTER FREE':Will Hayley decide to drop the filters and embrace her 'flaws'?

DUP may quit Stormont 'within weeks' over protocol,"This video can not be played ""A choice between the political institutions and Protocol"" The Democratic Unionist Party may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its demands over the Northern Ireland Protocol are not met, its leader has suggested. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson also said he feared a returnto the loyalist street violence seen earlier in the yearunless the issue was resolved. He said his party would also now boycott most north-south ministerial meetings. He said relations could not be ""business as usual"". Most Stormont parties criticised the speech while theEU's Brexit negotiator called for calm. During his speech in Belfast, Sir Jeffrey said it would be clear ""within weeks"" if there was a basis for the assembly and executive to continue, or if an election was needed. ""I say not as a threat, but as a matter of political reality, that our political institutions will not survive a failure to resolve the problems that the protocol has created,"" Sir Jeffrey said. ""Neither will they survive an indefinite 'stand still' period; urgent action is needed."" He also said DUP ministers would resign from their posts rather than implement further border checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. ""If in the final analysis those who are democratically elected by the people of Northern Ireland lack the power to prevent such checks, and the protocol issues remain, then the position in office of DUP Ministers would become untenable,"" Sir Jeffrey added. The protocol is part of the UK government's Brexit deal with the European Union. It keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods to ensure free trade across the Irish border. However, it has led to additional checks on goods being traded across the Irish Sea, which has drawn criticism and protests from unionists. Not all the checks have been implemented due to what are known as grace periods. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson laid it out pretty clearly today. His message for the government was blunt -  you can either have the political institutions or the protocol - you can't have both. In terms of the mechanics of how you bring down government in Northern Ireland, essentially what has to happen is that the first minister or deputy first minister needs to resign. There then is a period of seven days, and if the positions are not filled within that period, it's over to the secretary of state who has to set a date within a reasonable period of time for an election. However, we know from James Brokenshire's time as secretary of state, that a reasonable period can last for months and months on end. There's no guarantee that if the DUP walk away from government that we will end up in an election within a matter of weeks. The smart money would suggest that Brandon Lewis may well take the view that there is no point in calling an election when we have one already scheduled for next May. Earlier this week theUK government indefinitely extended the grace periodswhich it said was necessary to create space for further talks with the EU. Sir Jeffrey's speech came as theEuropean Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic began a two-day visit to Northern Irelandfor talks with business and political leaders. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, said he believed in devolution and wanted to return to the assembly as an assembly member (MLA). He said he wanted to provide a ""window of opportunity"" to find a solution and expressed concern there could be a return to disorder on Northern Ireland's streets ""unless we grapple with this issue"". EU's Sefcovic to discuss protocol on NI visit The DUP leader outlined four steps his party would take, including an end to its engagement with north-south bodies, except for co-operation on health matters. The north-south arrangements, provisioned for by the Good Friday Agreement, feature six all-Ireland bodies, with responsibility for matters such as waterways and food standards, which operate under the policy direction of the North-South Ministerial Council. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin (left) and Tanaiste Leo Varadkar attended a meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in July It is comprised of ministers from both sides of the border. Ministers from Northern Ireland are required to attend under the Ministerial Code of office. The DUP attended the last meeting of the council in July. Sir Jeffrey said this was done ""as an act of good faith"" but issues remain unresolved. ""Therefore, as the protocol issues remain unresolved, the DUP will immediately withdraw from the structures of Strand Two of the Belfast Agreement relating to north south arrangements, while we will ensure important health related matters continue to be addressed on a cooperative basis,"" he said. Sir Jeffrey also outlined that DUP ministers would ""seek to block additional checks at the ports"" and would examine the legality of the current checks and ""whether they should have required executive approval"". The DUP leader also explained his executive team would ""seek to frustrate and prevent"" alignment between NI Assembly legislation and laws passed by the EU. What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Further delays confirmed for Irish Sea border checks ""Let me be clear if the choice is ultimately between remaining in office or implementing the protocol in its present form, then the only option for any unionist minister would be to cease to hold such office,"" he said. ""Time is short and consequences will follow. ""The prize of a successful outcome is not just for unionism, but for all of Northern Ireland and it is not just for the UK, but for the EU as well."" Sir Jeffery said he feared a return to street violence in loyalist areas witnessed in April. ""Since the start of July, the streets have been quieter in terms of violence, but I fear that unless we grapple with this issue, this will prove to be merely a pause, rather than an end to the disorder,"" he said. He echoed this view in an interview later with the BBC's Political Thinking podcast with Nick Robinson. ""If politics fails ... then I fear there will be others who may decide to step into the gap,"" he said. He went on to say that he and other community leaders had ""been saying to the boys on the streets please don't be on the streets"" and that as a result, Northern Ireland had been peaceful ""all summer"". A DUP withdrawal from its executive roles, including first minister, would not automatically trigger an assembly election, however, it would begin the process. Given the joint nature of the office, First Minister Paul Givan's departure would also remove Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill as Deputy First Minister. This would then start a seven-day process for the parties to agree to fresh nominations.. If this did not happen, NI Secretary Brandon Lewis would be responsible for calling an election within a ""reasonable"" timeframe. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said the speech had ""created new challenges"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said it was a ""reckless, irresponsible and short-sighted election stunt"". She said the DUP was ""clearly in panic mode, driven by poor opinion polls"" and are ""focused on their own narrow self-interest"". UUP leader Doug Beattie said his party shared the DUP's concerns about the protocol but it would be a ""bad idea"" to collapse Stormont SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""naive in the extreme"" and that the DUP leader had ""offered no solutions"". ""I think it is very dangerous when people are languishing on waiting lists and we're dealing with a global pandemic, we have people playing indulgent games that are more about polls than protocols,"" he told BBC NI's The Nolan Show. Alliance Party leader and Stormont Justice Minister Naomi Long said there was a need for ""pragmatic solutions"" to protocol matters rather than for ""people to escalate this into a constitutional crisis"". Naomi Long said Sir Jeffrey should offer solutions for the parties to debate Mrs Long described Sir Jeffrey's address as ""cynical party posturing to try and recover perceived electoral losses because of polling"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said his party shared the DUP's concerns about the protocol, but that it would be a ""bad idea"" to collapse Stormont. ""The problem is we do need to have some sort of a treaty which deals with the issues between the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he said. On Tuesday, the UUPpublished a paper detailing its recommendations,external""for a common-sense solution to the problems created by the protocol"". It included provisions for a new criminal offence ""to knowingly export goods designed for the UK internal market into the EU single market"". Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said Sir Jeffrey's speech included ""some fine words"", but ""it is actions that count"". Simon Coveney, the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, said unionist concerns about the protocol had been ""taken seriously"", but ""no positive agenda is served by blocking practical north-south co-operation or by the breakdown of the other institutions of the Good Friday Agreement"". ""The EU is already listening closely to concerns in Northern Ireland and is ready to work in good faith to minimise friction,"" he continued.

BBC Scotland News People queued for entry into nightclubs when they reopened Holyrood votes to back controversial plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme in Scotland. 68 MSPs voted for the government motion, with 55 against. The move will mean that only people who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events and many concerts and festivals. The Scottish government says the plan is designed to allow large events to go ahead as safely as possible. Details of the proposals wereonly published by the government,externalon Thursday morning - just hours before the vote. The closing speeches have taken place, with Health Secretary Humza Yousaf speaking for the government.

The UK medicines regulator has approved the use of Pfizer and AstraZeneca as Covid booster vaccines, paving the way for a rollout ahead of the winter. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the UK vaccine advisory body, has not decided if they are needed, and who should be eligible. The JCVI has saida third dose should be offeredto people with severely-weakened immune systems. Up to half a million people over the age of 12 in the UK are in this group. Read more here.

Ms Mackay implores the Conservatives to lobby their colleagues at Westminster to extend furlough. The Green MSP says if the health of the population was the only thing at risk then wider restrictions would ""probably be an obvious step"" - however she says this is ""no longer a choice"" with the end of furlough coming. Having worked with the government on the scheme, she welcomes the provisional end date for passports at the end of February and says medical data will be ""limited"" so as not to adversely affect marginalised groups. She concludes saying we are ""in the realm of the least worst option"", but says her party will continue to work with the government on the issue. Vaccination certification will be introduced for the following events and venues: Scottish Green MSP Gillian Mackay outlines her party's position on vaccine passports Gillian Mackay of the Scottish Greens sets out the reasons behind her party's backing of vaccine passports after ""hoping"" it would not be a necessary measure. She says Scotland is ""on the brink"" of re-imposing restrictions and cites health boards that have stopped certain procedures due to Covid pressure. Ms Mackay asks the cabinet secretary to divulge if there has been any more uptake of the vaccination among young people since last week and argues for more encouragement for these age groups to get jagged. She says the passport scheme does not appear to have increased vaccine hesitancy, but says she ""implores"" health boards to reach out to groups that have already expressed concerns. To date  75.1% of 18-29 year olds have had a first dose, with about 700-800 typically coming forward for their first jab each day. That means that roughly 200,000 people in this age group are still unvaccinated. Progress has been brisker among 16 and 17-year-olds, with more than 60% having had a first dose despite the rollout to this age group only starting in August. When it comes to figures for both doses, 57.5% of 18-29 year olds are fully vaccinated. For 16 and 17 year olds, the figure is much lower - 8.9% - as many of them have only recently had their first jab. New apps are being developed to display and read the Scottish vaccine passport's QR codes MSPs are debating controversial plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme in Scotland. The move will mean that only people who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events and many concerts and festivals. The Scottish government says the plan is designed to allow large events to go ahead as safely as possible. Details of the proposals wereonly published by the government,externalon Thursday morning - just hours before the vote. The Scottish government has published the latest Covid-19 statistics. And on vaccinations: Mr Cole-Hamilton says the passports represent the beginning of medical ID cards as they require a photo. He also argues they may not increase the rate of vaccination uptake among young people either as there is already a black market for vaccine certificates in France. Finally, he calls on the government to exempt young people from having to use the scheme for things like football matches as it would ""artificially put pressure"" on them to decide whether or not to have the vaccine. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says his party is ""fundamentally opposed"" to the passport scheme on grounds of ideology and
practicality. He says it does not address the booster programme, which could result in ""another crushing burden"" to the hospitality industry. After talks with industry representatives, he says there is concern vaccine passports could give people a ""false sense of security"" which could lead to increased transmission of the virus. One alternative plan would be to present a negative lateral flow test for access to venues, he says, as it does not ""compel you to access
certain form of treatment"". Ms Baillie asks why the Scottish government is moving at ""snail's pace"" on improving Test and Protect. The Scottish Labour MSP warns: ""They are simply not coping."" Jackie Baillie warns there is a real danger that vaccine hesitancy may become entrenched if the passport scheme is introduced. Scottish Labour's health spokesperson also warns about exacerbating inequalities. She asks if the SNP government have engaged with the nightime and hospitality industries. Ms Baillie warns the government is in danger of giving a false sense of confidence. Mr Ross points out that the vaccine status app the government is rolling out will need an update in future and that the government has not provided sector specific detail on how the scheme will be operated. He quotes Steven Montgomery from the Hospitality Group who said the sector does not know how passports are going to work. Mr Swinney asks Mr Ross to set out what he believes are the steps to take to avoid more restrictions, to which the Scottish Conservative Party leader says contact tracing should be improved. Mr Ross concludes that his party will not be voting for the vaccine passport scheme. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross begins by repeating his question to Mr Swinney - what is a nightclub? Mr Swinney says this question is the subject of further discussions with the night-time industry and will be set out in regulations. Mr Ross says the deputy first minister wants parliamentarians to ""impose"" vaccine passports on establishments without knowing which ones it will affect. He also disagrees with MSP John Mason, who argues that the parliament's Covid committee would look at the details while today MSPs vote ""in principle"". Mr Swinney says: ""We propose
that vaccination certification should be introduced once all adults have had
the opportunity to be fully vaccinated."" Vaccination certification will be introduced for the following events and venues: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Having worked with the government on the scheme, she welcomes the provisional end date for passports at the end of February and says medical data will be ""limited"" so as not to adversely affect marginalised groups. She concludes saying we are ""in the realm of the least worst option"", but says her party will continue to work with the government on the issue. Vaccination certification will be introduced for the following events and venues: Scottish Green MSP Gillian Mackay outlines her party's position on vaccine passports Gillian Mackay of the Scottish Greens sets out the reasons behind her party's backing of vaccine passports after ""hoping"" it would not be a necessary measure. She says Scotland is ""on the brink"" of re-imposing restrictions and cites health boards that have stopped certain procedures due to Covid pressure. Ms Mackay asks the cabinet secretary to divulge if there has been any more uptake of the vaccination among young people since last week and argues for more encouragement for these age groups to get jagged. She says the passport scheme does not appear to have increased vaccine hesitancy, but says she ""implores"" health boards to reach out to groups that have already expressed concerns. To date  75.1% of 18-29 year olds have had a first dose, with about 700-800 typically coming forward for their first jab each day. That means that roughly 200,000 people in this age group are still unvaccinated. Progress has been brisker among 16 and 17-year-olds, with more than 60% having had a first dose despite the rollout to this age group only starting in August. When it comes to figures for both doses, 57.5% of 18-29 year olds are fully vaccinated. For 16 and 17 year olds, the figure is much lower - 8.9% - as many of them have only recently had their first jab. New apps are being developed to display and read the Scottish vaccine passport's QR codes MSPs are debating controversial plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme in Scotland.

Details of the proposals wereonly published by the government,externalon Thursday morning - just hours before the vote. The Scottish government has published the latest Covid-19 statistics. And on vaccinations: Mr Cole-Hamilton says the passports represent the beginning of medical ID cards as they require a photo. He also argues they may not increase the rate of vaccination uptake among young people either as there is already a black market for vaccine certificates in France. Finally, he calls on the government to exempt young people from having to use the scheme for things like football matches as it would ""artificially put pressure"" on them to decide whether or not to have the vaccine. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says his party is ""fundamentally opposed"" to the passport scheme on grounds of ideology and
practicality. He says it does not address the booster programme, which could result in ""another crushing burden"" to the hospitality industry. After talks with industry representatives, he says there is concern vaccine passports could give people a ""false sense of security"" which could lead to increased transmission of the virus. One alternative plan would be to present a negative lateral flow test for access to venues, he says, as it does not ""compel you to access

Jackie Baillie warns there is a real danger that vaccine hesitancy may become entrenched if the passport scheme is introduced. Scottish Labour's health spokesperson also warns about exacerbating inequalities. She asks if the SNP government have engaged with the nightime and hospitality industries. Ms Baillie warns the government is in danger of giving a false sense of confidence. Mr Ross points out that the vaccine status app the government is rolling out will need an update in future and that the government has not provided sector specific detail on how the scheme will be operated.

Dial down political rhetoric on protocol - EU chief,"Maros Sefcovic is in Northern Ireland to meet political, business and civic leaders European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic has urged politicians to ""dial down the rhetoric"" on the Northern Ireland Protocol. He was responding to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's warning that his partymay quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands are not met. Mr Sefcovic is in Northern Ireland to meet political, business and civic leaders. The UK wants the protocol,which puts a trade border in the Irish Sea, changed. Unionists believe it undermines their place in the United Kingdom and want it to be scrapped. Mr Sefcovic said he had already spoken to Sir Jeffrey ""a couple of weeks ago"". ""I will see him this afternoon as I will see also the other political leaders,"" he said on Thursday. ""We will have the opportunity to discuss this face to face and my message will be 'let's work on the concrete problems'. ""Let's focus on the issues which are the most important for the people of Northern Ireland, let's be constructive, let's dial down the political rhetoric, let's bring calm and focus on what is our task to accomplish."" Mr Sefcovic, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, described Sir Jeffrey as a ""very experienced politician"" who wants the best for Northern Ireland. ""I can assure him that is my intention as well,"" Mr Sefcovic added. Mr Sefcovic (centre) met First Minister Paul Givan (left) and Declan Kearney, junior minister at the Executive Office during a visit to Stormont Mr Sefcovic said the purpose of his trip to Northern Ireland was to find out ""face-to-face"" what the problems were with the implementation of the protocol.

""I came here to listen, to learn what are the concrete problems that the people of Northern Ireland are facing with the implementation of the protocol. ""But I am also here to talk about opportunities the protocol is bringing, especially to the economy and of course the people of Northern Ireland, and I am starting with the business representatives."" On Monday,the UK delayed new checks on goods from Great Britain entering Northern Irelandas required by the protocol. Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, said the move was necessary to ""provide space for further potential discussions"" with the EU. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had taken note of the decision. ""We are talking over the last few weeks constructively on solving the issues linked with the protocol and I hope that also the way that we handled Monday's announcement coming from London just proves that we are ready to do our utmost to look for every possible solution within the protocol to resolve the problems."" However the EU has repeatedly said the sort of fundamental renegotiation Lord Frost wants is not on offer. Further delays confirmed for Irish Sea border checks What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Technical discussions between the UK and EU on an agri-food agreement have reached a stalemate. The EU has offered the UK a Swiss-style deal which would involve the UK following EU rules. The UK has rejected that and instead asked for a deal in which the EU would recognise UK standards as equivalent to its own. An EU official has suggested that the issue could be unlocked with a bespoke arrangement which recognises Northern Ireland's unique circumstances. It is not yet clear what such an arrangement might involve and the EU is wary that the UK would demand the same deal for GB-EU agri-food trade. What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol?

"Accountancy giant sets working class staff targetBy 2030, KPMG wants 29% of its senior staff to have parents that worked in ""routine and manual"" jobs.Business","KPMG has 7,300 London staff based at its office in Canary Wharf. Accounting giant KPMG has become one of the first large UK businesses to set a target for the number of employees from working class backgrounds. KPMG has defined working class as having parents with ""routine and manual"" jobs, such as drivers, cleaners and farm workers. It wants 29% of its partners and directors to come from working class backgrounds by 2030. That compares with 23% of partners and 20% of directors at the moment.

Accountancy giant sets working class staff target,"KPMG has 7,300 London staff based at its office in Canary Wharf. Accounting giant KPMG has become one of the first large UK businesses to set a target for the number of employees from working class backgrounds. KPMG has defined working class as having parents with ""routine and manual"" jobs, such as drivers, cleaners and farm workers. It wants 29% of its partners and directors to come from working class backgrounds by 2030. That compares with 23% of partners and 20% of directors at the moment. KMPG said that these employees were paid 8.6% less than those from the other socio-economic groups. In February, KMPG faced a backlash after its former chairman dismissed the notion of ""unconscious bias"" training. Earlier this month the firmwas accused by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC)  of giving it ""false and misleading"" informationabout collapsed construction giant Carillion.

LiveLiveScottish vaccine passports debateMSPs will vote on a scheme requiring people going to nightclubs and big sports stadia to show their Covid vaccination status.Scotland,"SNP and Scottish Green MSPs back a scheme requiring people going to nightclubs and big sports stadia to show their Covid vaccination status The vaccine passports will come into force in Scotland on 1 October, the same day a similar scheme begins in England Ahead of a vote, a debate took place at the Scottish Parliament in which opposition MSPs voiced their objections Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was unclear how the passports would work Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie said there was no evidence the scheme would encourage the unvaccinated to get a jab And Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton told the debate: ""You should never have to provide any aspect of your medical history to a bouncer to get into a nightclub."" BBC Scotland News People queued for entry into nightclubs when they reopened Holyrood votes to back controversial plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme in Scotland. 68 MSPs voted for the government motion, with 55 against. The move will mean that only people who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events and many concerts and festivals. The Scottish government says the plan is designed to allow large events to go ahead as safely as possible. Details of the proposals wereonly published by the government,externalon Thursday morning - just hours before the vote. The closing speeches have taken place, with Health Secretary Humza Yousaf speaking for the government. MSPs will shortly back this motion With the backing of the Greens this motion is guaranteed to pass at 5.30pm. The Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems will all vote against it. The UK medicines regulator has approved the use of Pfizer and AstraZeneca as Covid booster vaccines, paving the way for a rollout ahead of the winter. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the UK vaccine advisory body, has not decided if they are needed, and who should be eligible. The JCVI has saida third dose should be offeredto people with severely-weakened immune systems. Up to half a million people over the age of 12 in the UK are in this group. Read more here.

Ms Mackay implores the Conservatives to lobby their colleagues at Westminster to extend furlough. The Green MSP says if the health of the population was the only thing at risk then wider restrictions would ""probably be an obvious step"" - however she says this is ""no longer a choice"" with the end of furlough coming. Having worked with the government on the scheme, she welcomes the provisional end date for passports at the end of February and says medical data will be ""limited"" so as not to adversely affect marginalised groups. She concludes saying we are ""in the realm of the least worst option"", but says her party will continue to work with the government on the issue. Vaccination certification will be introduced for the following events and venues: Scottish Green MSP Gillian Mackay outlines her party's position on vaccine passports Gillian Mackay of the Scottish Greens sets out the reasons behind her party's backing of vaccine passports after ""hoping"" it would not be a necessary measure. She says Scotland is ""on the brink"" of re-imposing restrictions and cites health boards that have stopped certain procedures due to Covid pressure. Ms Mackay asks the cabinet secretary to divulge if there has been any more uptake of the vaccination among young people since last week and argues for more encouragement for these age groups to get jagged. She says the passport scheme does not appear to have increased vaccine hesitancy, but says she ""implores"" health boards to reach out to groups that have already expressed concerns. To date  75.1% of 18-29 year olds have had a first dose, with about 700-800 typically coming forward for their first jab each day. That means that roughly 200,000 people in this age group are still unvaccinated. Progress has been brisker among 16 and 17-year-olds, with more than 60% having had a first dose despite the rollout to this age group only starting in August. When it comes to figures for both doses, 57.5% of 18-29 year olds are fully vaccinated. For 16 and 17 year olds, the figure is much lower - 8.9% - as many of them have only recently had their first jab. New apps are being developed to display and read the Scottish vaccine passport's QR codes MSPs are debating controversial plans to introduce a vaccine passport scheme in Scotland. The move will mean that only people who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events and many concerts and festivals. The Scottish government says the plan is designed to allow large events to go ahead as safely as possible. Details of the proposals wereonly published by the government,externalon Thursday morning - just hours before the vote. The Scottish government has published the latest Covid-19 statistics. And on vaccinations: Mr Cole-Hamilton says the passports represent the beginning of medical ID cards as they require a photo. He also argues they may not increase the rate of vaccination uptake among young people either as there is already a black market for vaccine certificates in France. Finally, he calls on the government to exempt young people from having to use the scheme for things like football matches as it would ""artificially put pressure"" on them to decide whether or not to have the vaccine. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says his party is ""fundamentally opposed"" to the passport scheme on grounds of ideology and
practicality. He says it does not address the booster programme, which could result in ""another crushing burden"" to the hospitality industry. After talks with industry representatives, he says there is concern vaccine passports could give people a ""false sense of security"" which could lead to increased transmission of the virus. One alternative plan would be to present a negative lateral flow test for access to venues, he says, as it does not ""compel you to access
certain form of treatment"". Ms Baillie asks why the Scottish government is moving at ""snail's pace"" on improving Test and Protect. The Scottish Labour MSP warns: ""They are simply not coping."" Jackie Baillie warns there is a real danger that vaccine hesitancy may become entrenched if the passport scheme is introduced. Scottish Labour's health spokesperson also warns about exacerbating inequalities. She asks if the SNP government have engaged with the nightime and hospitality industries. Ms Baillie warns the government is in danger of giving a false sense of confidence. Mr Ross points out that the vaccine status app the government is rolling out will need an update in future and that the government has not provided sector specific detail on how the scheme will be operated. He quotes Steven Montgomery from the Hospitality Group who said the sector does not know how passports are going to work. Mr Swinney asks Mr Ross to set out what he believes are the steps to take to avoid more restrictions, to which the Scottish Conservative Party leader says contact tracing should be improved. Mr Ross concludes that his party will not be voting for the vaccine passport scheme. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross begins by repeating his question to Mr Swinney - what is a nightclub? Mr Swinney says this question is the subject of further discussions with the night-time industry and will be set out in regulations. Mr Ross says the deputy first minister wants parliamentarians to ""impose"" vaccine passports on establishments without knowing which ones it will affect. He also disagrees with MSP John Mason, who argues that the parliament's Covid committee would look at the details while today MSPs vote ""in principle"". Mr Swinney says: ""We propose
that vaccination certification should be introduced once all adults have had
the opportunity to be fully vaccinated."" Vaccination certification will be introduced for the following events and venues: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Racist fan's Whatsapp post 'harassed' footballer,"Sawyers played for West Brom between 2009 and 2013 and then rejoined the club from Brentford in 2019 A football fan's Facebook message about a Championship footballer was intentionally racist and not the result of autocorrect, a court has found. West Bromwich Albion's Romaine Sawyers became aware of the post after the team was beaten 5-0 by Manchester City. Simon Silwood, 50, of Kingswinford, admitted being its source but had blamed the language on a misspelling. But that was rejected and he was found guilty of sending a racial slur under the Malicious Communications Act. West Brom has issued Silwood with a lifetime ban. Opening the case at Walsall Magistrates' Court, prosecutor Simon Brownsey said Silwood deliberately sought to make a ""blatant"" racist pun about the midfielder, currently on loan at Stoke City. Simon Silwood (centre) told police he believed his message on the Facebook group was ""stupid not racial"" The post was on a ""sarcastic"" fan zone Facebook group titled ""Romaine Sawyers - Ballon d'Or"", a reference to the annual award to the world's best player. Silwood, of Randall Close, Kingswinford, said he had meant to type that Mr Sawyers should win the ""buffoon d'Or"". He claimed a misspelling, of ""bafoon"", had autocorrected on his device to ""baboon"". District Judge Briony Clarke said she did not believe Silwood, a steel worker, was a credible witness and was sure that he had sent the message deliberately. Mr Brownsey said the player became aware of the content after speaking to police to report racial abuse on Instagram. In a statement provided to the court, Mr Sawyers said: ""As I read it, I felt numb and did not know what to say. ""Having seen [the word] I assumed it was referring to the colour of my skin."" He added: ""The word has left me feeling harassed, alarmed and distressed and I find the message to be racist. ""The whole incident has left me extremely upset."" Football 'sliding backwards' on racism Euro 2020 racism: Saka troll confronted Latest news and updates from the West Midlands A spokesperson for West Bromwich Albion said: ""The club welcomes the guilty verdict and has issued a lifetime ban to the person in question."" According to the prosecution, Silwood had been ""upset with how the game went"" on 26 January. The court heard he was charged following work carried out by PC Stuart Ward, the UK's first dedicated hate crime officer within a football unit. Silwood is set to be sentenced on 30 September. He had faced a charge of sending a message by means of a public electronic communications network that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character.

Football 'sliding backwards' on racism,"This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand says he ""expected"" racist abuse towards black England stars after their Euros penalty miss Rio Ferdinand says football is ""sliding backwards"" and racism is being normalised because of the prevalence of racist abuse online. The former England captain was speaking to a joint parliamentary committee seeking possible improvements to the government's draft Online Safety Bill. Ferdinand, 42, said he had seen family members ""disintegrate"" after he was abused on social media. ""Self-esteem, your mental health is at risk,"" Ferdinand said. Bolton report racist social media abuse of striker Kachunga to police The former Manchester United defender said it was ""disheartening"" to see racism in football rising to the levels of the 1970s and 80s. He cited the abuse received by England players Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho after July's penalty shootout defeat by Italy in the Euro 2020 final. ""When those three players missed those penalties, the first thing I thought was 'let's see what happens on social media',"" Ferdinand said. ""I expected [the abuse] to happen."" This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand: ""I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids"" On Wednesday Ferdinand's brother Anton spoke to the Home Affairs select committee, askingwhether it would take a tragedyfor social media companies to act on online racist abuse. At that hearing, representatives of Twitter and Instagram argued they were attempting to address the issue. Katy Minshall, head of UK public policy and philanthropy at Twitter, said the company was starting to focus its work on the ease with which footballers could be contacted on social media, while Tara Hopkins, the director of public policy at Instagram, said 95% of hateful content was proactively removed from the platform. Anton Ferdinand: Football, Racism and Me Rio Ferdinand now works as a pundit after earning 83 England caps in a 14-year international career Rio Ferdinand told the joint committee of MPs and peers that it was ""baffling"" that social media companies had tools that track copyright breaches on, for example, his YouTube channel but could not use that same technology to pick up certain emojis or words used in racially abusive posts. He stressed that harmful content affected more than just the person who received it, saying: ""I have seen members of my family disintegrate at times when it happens."" ""I have to sit there with my kids and explain what the monkey emoji means in that context,"" Ferdinand added. The former Leeds and West Ham player condemned the fact that perpetrators were allowed to remain anonymous online, saying it was ""normalising racist behaviour"". ""If you put it in the context of a young person who supports a certain player at whatever level, he is looking through that feed and seeing racist language,"" he continued. ""That young person then goes into his network of friends and 'it's fine, it's normal so I'll say that at school so it's OK'. ""When there are no repercussions, there is nothing done to expose that person for their ignorant language, then people are going to think it's normal."" Ferdinand agreed that social media companies profited from prejudice and said that placing the onus on victims to report abuse or block abusers was ""an easy cop-out"" for platforms. Ferdinand spoke to the committee alongside Edleen John, the Football Association's director of international relations, corporate affairs and equality, diversity and inclusion, and Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari. John commented on how the draft bill could tackle the issue of identity verification for social media users, suggesting a ""layered"" approach. ""Social media companies seem to believe that it's a binary option where people have to provide all information or no information,"" she said. John instead suggested ""multiple mechanisms"" could be used to tackle the issue, using identity verification alongside ""default settings"" and limiting the reach of an account. She believed this approach would reduce the use of 'burner' accounts, which are set up to send abusive messages before being quickly deleted, with users able to set up a new account shortly after. John said she ""consistently receives platitudes"" from social media organisations in response to concerns and cited anecdotal evidence of a player who was blocked by a platform for reporting abuse too many times. Bhandari said the current system was ""frictionless"" and called for an amendment to the draft bill that would give communications regulator Ofcom ""power to introduce codes of practice"". ""You need to give Ofcom the power to regulate harmful but legal content,"" he said. Bhandari added that the public response to the abuse of the England trio after the Euro 2020 final should offer a template for future regulations. ""The unified public condemnation of that says to us that what the public are demanding is that every piece of hate that was spat out that night needed to be taken off the platforms,"" he continued. ""The way in which to do that is to give a regulator the power to reflect contemporary social practices. ""We would have to put checks and balances in. We also have to balance against dealing with an evolving problem. We can't legislate through the rear-view mirror, we have to legislate through the windscreen, looking ahead."" Imran Ahmed, chief executive and founder of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), also spoke at the hearing after a report from his organisation in July found Instagram failed to remove 94% of accounts that had sent racist messages to Rashford, Saka and Sancho after the Euros final defeat. ""When it comes to racism against footballers, the reason why the abuse matters isn't because they're a wealthy footballer,"" Ahmed said. ""Imagine what they would call me, my mum or anyone else from a minority. It is a sense of, 'these places aren't for you. These are our places'."" The committee hearing is one of several steps in the process of the draft bill - which aims ""to establish a new regulatory framework to tackle harmful content online"" - being passed into law. The draft bill places new duties on social media firms to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines. Some campaigners saythe plans will lead to censorship, while others warn fines do not go far enough. The draft legislation has been two years in the making and is especially geared towards keeping children safe. As well as racist abuse, it covers terrorism, disinformation, pornography, grooming, revenge porn, hate speech, images of child abuse and posts relating to suicide and eating disorders. Late additions to the bill include provisions to tackle online scams, such as romance fraud and fake investment opportunities.

Migrant boats could be turned back in new UK move,"A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, aboard a Border Force vessel Boats carrying migrants across the English Channel could be turned back from the UK, if personally approved by Home Secretary Priti Patel. The government has authorised Border Force officials to use the new tactic - but only in limited circumstances. However France is strongly against the plan, saying it breaks maritime law and accusing the UK of blackmail. But Boris Johnson's spokesman said any plans would be ""safe and legal"" and would comply with the law. Rising numbers of migrants have been crossing the English Channel in recent months - and so far this week more than 1,500 people have crossed by boat. The Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world. Many migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities. What happens to migrants found in the Channel? Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? What happens when they reach the UK? Government sources have confirmed to the BBC that a Border Force team has been training for months to begin the operation. It is understood that the final training may take place within days, subject to the weather - meaning the tactic would then be ready to be used whenever is it practical and safe to do so. But France says the move flouts international maritime law, which says people at risk of losing their lives at sea must be rescued. France's interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin - who met Ms Patel on Wednesday for talks on the migrant crisis - also accused the UK of financial blackmail. He was referring to a deal the UK and France struck over money earlier this year, when the UK promised to pay France Â£54.2m for extra action such as doubling the number of coast patrols. Since then, Ms Patel has warned that Britain could withhold the money, unless more boats are intercepted. ""UK's commitment must be kept,"" said Mr Darmanin. ""I clearly said it to my counterpart Priti Patel. The friendship between our two countries deserves better than posturing which undermines the cooperation between our ministries"". The government's lawyers say turning boats back would be legal in limited and specific circumstances - although they have not confirmed what these will be. Because the legal and safety risks are so high, it is also understood that Border Force chiefs have asked Ms Patel to personally support decisions to use the tactic, meaning she would have to be available to take a call from a Border Force vessel if and when they believe the tactic can be used safely. The UK has a legal right to intercept people at sea where necessary to prevent crime or to protect borders. But whatever the legal advice the UK government has received on migrant boats, it's questionable whether such an operation could continue once there is a clear sign of danger. Border Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible. So their window of opportunity to run a push-back operation could be very tight. But more importantlyâ¦ is this really ever going to happen? The intervention from the French interior minister may have just sunk the operation before a single Border Force ship has set sail. There are no international waters in the Dover Strait - so any operation would need French cooperation. And Gerald Darmanin's statement makes clear France's opposition to any confrontation of dinghies in one of the world's most dangerous shipping lanes. The tactic has never been used before in the English Channel, but it has been in the Mediterranean, said the Immigration Services Union (ISU) which represents borders, immigration and customs staff. Lucy Moreton from the ISU said she would be ""very surprised"" if it ends up being used at all - calling it ""dead in the water"". ""There are understandably a lot of constraints around it, and you cannot do this with a vessel which is in any way vulnerable. ""But more importantly, you also need the consent of the French to do it. Because as you turn the vessel back towards France, when it crosses the median line it has to be intercepted and rescued by the French, and it appears the French will simply not engage in this."" If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port If they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them Each country has search-and-rescue zones An EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it Ms Patel met Mr Darmanin, on Wednesday for talks on the migrant crisis - but the two sides failed to agree any new measures. More than 12,600 migrants have made the journey across the English Channel so far this year. Charities urged the Home Office to take a ""more humane and responsible approach"" towards asylum seekers. Amnesty International UK has said people have the right to seek asylum in the UK and ""only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them"". And the head of the Refugee Council said: ""Rather than spending time, resource and immense effort on pushing these very vulnerable people away, this government must give people options for safe routes to stop such perilous journeys in the first place. ""Refugee family reunion is one such safe route that has saved thousands of lives. Resettlement is another. We urge this government to rethink its brutal policy and think about the individual lives at the heart of these desperate journeys."" Labour also said the tactic risks lives, adding: ""That the home secretary is even considering these dangerous proposals shows how badly she has lost control of this situation."" The Home Office said it continues to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options to find ways of stopping small boats making the journey. The prime minister's spokesman said the same, and that the UK's activities ""comply with international and domestic law"". And the government added that it needs to use every possible tactic at itsÂ disposal to tackle people smuggling. Ms Patel has repeatedlyspoken out about organised crime gangs,externalwho smuggle people to the UK for profit - and thatthe new Nationality and Borders Billaims to ""break their business model"". She will host the final day of the G7 interior ministers meeting on Thursday, with illegal migration anticipated to be the focus.

Football 'sliding backwards' on racismRio Ferdinand says racism is being normalised by the prevalence of racist abuse online.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand says he ""expected"" racist abuse towards black England stars after their Euros penalty miss Rio Ferdinand says football is ""sliding backwards"" and racism is being normalised because of the prevalence of racist abuse online. The former England captain was speaking to a joint parliamentary committee seeking possible improvements to the government's draft Online Safety Bill. Ferdinand, 42, said he had seen family members ""disintegrate"" after he was abused on social media. ""Self-esteem, your mental health is at risk,"" Ferdinand said. Bolton report racist social media abuse of striker Kachunga to police The former Manchester United defender said it was ""disheartening"" to see racism in football rising to the levels of the 1970s and 80s. He cited the abuse received by England players Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho after July's penalty shootout defeat by Italy in the Euro 2020 final. ""When those three players missed those penalties, the first thing I thought was 'let's see what happens on social media',"" Ferdinand said. ""I expected [the abuse] to happen."" This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand: ""I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids"" On Wednesday Ferdinand's brother Anton spoke to the Home Affairs select committee, askingwhether it would take a tragedyfor social media companies to act on online racist abuse. At that hearing, representatives of Twitter and Instagram argued they were attempting to address the issue. Katy Minshall, head of UK public policy and philanthropy at Twitter, said the company was starting to focus its work on the ease with which footballers could be contacted on social media, while Tara Hopkins, the director of public policy at Instagram, said 95% of hateful content was proactively removed from the platform. Anton Ferdinand: Football, Racism and Me Rio Ferdinand now works as a pundit after earning 83 England caps in a 14-year international career Rio Ferdinand told the joint committee of MPs and peers that it was ""baffling"" that social media companies had tools that track copyright breaches on, for example, his YouTube channel but could not use that same technology to pick up certain emojis or words used in racially abusive posts. He stressed that harmful content affected more than just the person who received it, saying: ""I have seen members of my family disintegrate at times when it happens."" ""I have to sit there with my kids and explain what the monkey emoji means in that context,"" Ferdinand added. The former Leeds and West Ham player condemned the fact that perpetrators were allowed to remain anonymous online, saying it was ""normalising racist behaviour"". ""If you put it in the context of a young person who supports a certain player at whatever level, he is looking through that feed and seeing racist language,"" he continued. ""That young person then goes into his network of friends and 'it's fine, it's normal so I'll say that at school so it's OK'. ""When there are no repercussions, there is nothing done to expose that person for their ignorant language, then people are going to think it's normal."" Ferdinand agreed that social media companies profited from prejudice and said that placing the onus on victims to report abuse or block abusers was ""an easy cop-out"" for platforms. Ferdinand spoke to the committee alongside Edleen John, the Football Association's director of international relations, corporate affairs and equality, diversity and inclusion, and Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari. John commented on how the draft bill could tackle the issue of identity verification for social media users, suggesting a ""layered"" approach. ""Social media companies seem to believe that it's a binary option where people have to provide all information or no information,"" she said. John instead suggested ""multiple mechanisms"" could be used to tackle the issue, using identity verification alongside ""default settings"" and limiting the reach of an account. She believed this approach would reduce the use of 'burner' accounts, which are set up to send abusive messages before being quickly deleted, with users able to set up a new account shortly after. John said she ""consistently receives platitudes"" from social media organisations in response to concerns and cited anecdotal evidence of a player who was blocked by a platform for reporting abuse too many times. Bhandari said the current system was ""frictionless"" and called for an amendment to the draft bill that would give communications regulator Ofcom ""power to introduce codes of practice"". ""You need to give Ofcom the power to regulate harmful but legal content,"" he said. Bhandari added that the public response to the abuse of the England trio after the Euro 2020 final should offer a template for future regulations. ""The unified public condemnation of that says to us that what the public are demanding is that every piece of hate that was spat out that night needed to be taken off the platforms,"" he continued. ""The way in which to do that is to give a regulator the power to reflect contemporary social practices. ""We would have to put checks and balances in. We also have to balance against dealing with an evolving problem. We can't legislate through the rear-view mirror, we have to legislate through the windscreen, looking ahead."" Imran Ahmed, chief executive and founder of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), also spoke at the hearing after a report from his organisation in July found Instagram failed to remove 94% of accounts that had sent racist messages to Rashford, Saka and Sancho after the Euros final defeat.

Three to bring in Europe roaming charges,"Three is the latest mobile network to announce it is reintroducing roaming charges between the UK and Europe. From 23 May 2022, customers who have taken out a new or upgraded contract after 1 October will have to pay Â£2 a day to use their monthly allowance of minutes, texts and data in the EU. It follows similar announcements from EE and Vodafone earlier this year. Three is also extending changes to other destinations,introducing a Â£5 a day charge for roaming outside Europe.,external The move effectively ends Three's long-standing roaming feature, branded ""Go Roam"", which allowed customers to use their contract allowances in 71 countries, including distant locations such as the USA, Hong Kong and Australia. ""This is a huge blow to Three customers,"" said Paolo Pescatore, a telecoms analyst at PP Foresight. ""Free roaming to so many destinations helped lure and retain users. Now this is no longer a differentiator, it will be hard for Three to stand out in an increasingly crowded and cut-throat market,"" he warned. Mobile roaming charges: What you need to know Vodafone to bring back roaming charges from January EE to reintroduce Europe roaming charges In a statement, Three said: ""The new charge ensures that customers are clear on what they will pay when using their phone in another country and only those who roam will pay for the service. ""It will also ensure that we can continue investing in our UK network."" The change does not affect roaming to Ireland or in the Isle of Man. Mobile operators have also said they are under pressure from rising costs, including wholesale costs which can be much higher for UK networks. Under EU rules, citizens could use their contract's minutes, texts, and data while roaming in the EU. But that is no longer the case post-Brexit as the trade deal did not include it. UK law does, however, cap roaming charges at Â£45 per month, unless the user explicitly decides to spend more. All major UK operators had previously said they had no plans to reintroduce roaming fees in Europe. EE was the first to break ranks and announce that it would do so, followed by Vodafone. O2 said there is currently no change in its stated position - that it has no plans to change roaming fees. In a statement, Sky Mobile said: ""Customers will not be charged roaming charges in EU countries and will be able to continue to use their data, call and text allowances as they do in the UK.""

PayPal raises fees between UK and Europe,"PayPal is introducing new fees for payments between businesses in the UK and those in Europe, from November. British businesses will be charged a 1.29% fee for payments from theEuropean Economic Area,externaland vice versa. Most currently pay about 0.5% in similar charges, which have remained unchanged since before the UK left the EU customs union and single market. PayPal said it was now incurring extra costs, such as the rise in interchange fees between the UK and EEA. European rules capping credit and debit card interchange fees at 0.2% and 0.3% no longer apply to UK businesses. And both Visa andMastercard have announced they will raise them fivefoldfrom mid-October. The EEA is made up of the 27 remaining European Union states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. And the new charges apply to the whole of the UK, Guernsey, Jersey, Gibraltar, and the Isle of Man. Bitcoin comes to UK PayPal - but not for payments eBay sellers can no longer use PayPal Most businesses will see their current 0.5% fee raised to 1.29% - still lower than PayPal's standard 1.99% for the rest of the world - but some of those with their own customised agreements with PayPal will have their existing rate raised by 1.29%. The new fee,externalwas first mentioned on the same daythe company announced it would accept cryptocurrency Bitcoinbut details were not released until this week. PayPal said it was ""simplifying"" its cross-border fees. ""In a highly competitive market, this will make it easier for these businesses to compare PayPal's pricing with that of other providers and to better appreciate the value we provide,"" it said. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said any rise in payment-platform fees ""is unwelcome news for small businesses and entrepreneurs"". ""Since the start of the year, around one in four small exporters have stopped exporting to the EU, citing amongst other reasons the costs involved in selling to EU-based customers,"" vice-chairman Martin McTague said. And over the past three months, a little over 40% of small exporters said the value of their exports had dropped. ""We need to see stronger support for small exporters from the government, including a relaunched SME [Small and Medium Enterprises]Brexit Support Fund and a reformed Tradeshow Access Programme,"" McTague added.

Ferdinand tells MPs online hate is 'normalising' racism,"A joint committee of MPs and Peers is examining the government's Online Safety Bill Former England captain Rio Ferdinand gave evidence to MPs and Peers about the government's draft Online Safety Bill The ex-Manchester United player told MPs abuse online is ""normalising"" racist behaviour with ""no repercussions"" And he described how he had to explain to his children why people use the monkey emoji The government's proposed new laws would set up new rules to tackle harmful online content Other witnesses who gave evidence were Imran Ahmed, from Centre for Countering Digital Hate, chair of Kick It Out Sanjay Bhandari, and Edleen John from the FA Nancy Kelley the CEO of Stonewall and Danny Stone MBE, the Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust are also gave evidence Paul Seddon, Richard Morris and Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Thanks for following along with us today. Goodbye. This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand: 'I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids' In response to suggestions earlier from Imran Ahmed that Facebook ""doesn't want to look for harm on their site to avoid then having to become responsible for it"", a spokesperson for the company said: âFacebook
has long called for new rules to set high standards across the internet. ""We
already have strict policies against harmful content on our platforms, but
regulations are needed so that private companies arenât making so many
important decisions alone. ""While we know we have more to do, our
industry-leading transparency reports show we are removing more harmful content
before anyone reports it to us.â The penultimate question comes from Suzanne Webb who asks the panel if they think online platforms understand the scale of the work they need to do once the bill comes in to law. Nancy Kelley replies: ""I think they know the scale of the problem better than anyone sitting in this room. Whether they know the scale of the work required for them to address the problem, I'm not sure."" Danny Stone says: ""I think they are having a bit of an internal debate about it. I think some probably understand and know what's coming"" But he adds: ""I think that, in some cases they are going to get a bit of a shock"" He ends by saying he thinks that the government's Online Safety Bill is a ""great piece of legislation trying to set an international standard - that has to be welcomed."" Baroness Kidron asks what Danny Stone's views are on offensive material and rules from different social media providers. Danny Stone says sometimes the BBFC - which classifies films and video content - may ban a film in the UK, but it is most likely still available somewhere online and in dark corners of the internet, but it is about limiting the audience to a harmful film. This, he says, is how he views trying to regulate abuse on popular social media websites, that there should be a minimum standard which he says should be set by Parliament, ""not Mark Zuckerberg"". John The SNP's John Nicolson asks the panel how seriously social media platforms take the issue of online abuse. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says she thinks platforms are genuinely concerned at a ""generalised level"" - but this isn't always reflected in how they regulate content on their sites. Mr Nicolson introduces a story of his own - saying that as a gay man he was once called a ""greasy bender"" on Twitter. ""Most people would accept it crosses a line"" he says. But he adds that when he reported the abuse, the firm told him the post did not breach its community guidelines. He says he went back and forward ""two or three times"" with the company ""but absolutely nothing happened"". ""They know I am a Member of Parliament, they know I sit on this committee.  If they are prepared to behave with such utter disdain to somebody with a wee bit of influence, can you imagine the disdain for the average LGBT person."" Nancy Kelley says: ""We don't have to imagine it - we can see it."" Conservative Dean Russell asks if organisations see removing anonymity as the easiest way to tackle ""cross-pollination"" of hatred from different groups. Danny Stone says ""this isn't really addressed"" in the bill at the moment. He says social media platforms should be legally liable where data to identify a social media user cannot be used. There are ""various reasons"" why people might want to keep anonymity, he says, but there should be an appropriate middle measure to allow some people to keep anonymous accounts where it is necessary. Nancy Kelley says these platforms can identify anonymous abusive accounts and delete them - they just don't. She says Stonewall has ""deep concerns"" for LGBT people around the world if social media companies insist on people using real names. ""Even in very liberal, accepting environments, [publishing names] increases the danger to our community"", she tells MPs. 90% of LGBT social media users in Egypt, Lebanon and Iran are reluctant to share their names even on social media private messages for fear of legal repercussions. She says in Egypt in particular, authorities are known to use online sting operations where they try to find gay men using social media so they can arrest them. Conservative MP Dean Russell asks the panel whether social media firms are reflecting an increase in abuse within society, or contributing to it. Danny Stone, director at the Antisemitism Policy Trust, says platforms ""facilitate the spread"" of hatred. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says it is important not to ""confuse"" the situation online with wider attitudes towards LGBT people, which she says have improved over the last 50 years. But she says social media can ""radicalise"" people's views, and ""enables"" a minority of people to spread abuse. The panel is asked about the issue of getting information about the scale of abuse from social media firms. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says there is an ""absence of high-quality studies"" - although some studies do exist. She says the regulator should be able to require firms to hand over relevant data. Danny Stone from the Antisemitism Policy Trust says there is ""some data out there"" - and points to some data collected by the European Union. He adds though that he has been trying to persuade one social media firm to give him a PowerPoint slide they use in training sessions for ten years, but although it has been promised he is yet to receive it. Nancy Kelly, the CEO of Stonewall Nancy Kelly, chief executive of Stonewall, says that existing legislation does not really account for abuse online, she says much legislation against homophobic and transphobic abuse are made for workplaces and face-to-face interactions. She says introducing duties of care for social media companies is something Stonewall is fully behind. She adds that the LGBT community suffers direct insults, forced outing and identifying where people live (otherwise known as ""doxing""). Some people may have to move house or change jobs as a result of these instances. Danny Stone MBE, director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust says offline and online abuse is ""similarly connected"". He says there have been anti-Semitic murders and anti-Semitic manifestoes shared by extremists shared online. He adds that he does not post any pictures of his children online as there is a chance someone might want to hurt his children because of the work he does. Smaller social platforms can disseminate false information about LGBT people in the same way they can share anti-Semitic misinformation, Ms Kelly adds. Danny Stone MBE, Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust The committee is now taking evidence from the final panel. Nancy Kelley, is the chief executive of Stonewall, and Danny Stone MBE, is director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust. Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Sanjay Bhandari, the chair
of Kick It Out, suggested that one of the key things the government can do
to to force tech firms to deal with racist abuse on their platforms is to set
up a code of practice around the reach of anonymous accounts. The bill currently deals primarily with content
moderation - how the tech platforms deal with hate speech after it has been
posted. But MPs also ask if they need to consider ways to make those
behind abuse more accountable a key part of the legislation. There was consensus that there is a lack of data
about who the hateful posters are, and that is something that the regulator
needs to audit, all panellists agreed. But Mr Bhandari also raised on the biggest
issues facing regulators when he told MPs if that ""if I was being
continuously punched in the face, then arresting someone is good but I also want
them to stop them punching me in the first place."" How to stop people
posting hateful comments is sadly probably a job both beyond the reach of Ofcom
or the tech firms. Edleen John says the international football community is ""looking at us, and the opportunity we have to put in place the first piece of legislation that can become a blueprint for other organisations and other countries as well. Chair of the committee Damian Collins ends this section of the hearing by asking Ms John what discussions are being held an executive level with football's governing bodies such as Uefa and Fifa. She says: ""We absolutely have conversations right to the top of the organisations around discrimination, around online abuse, around sanctions and around what we can do as a collective to make it clear that this isn't something that we want in our game, and our game is for all."" Conservative peer Lord Gilbert goes back to the issue of the responsibility in the bill on social media companies to remove content that is not legal but ""harmful"". He asks whether ""harmful"" should be defined in the bill, or whether the definition of what is illegal should simply be widened instead. Sanjay Bhandari, chair at anti-racism group Kick it Out, says he doesn't favour either approach. He says if what is ""harmful"" is defined in the bill, then it will have to be continually updated with new legislation to reflect new forms of abuse. He says instead, a regulator - in this case, Ofcom - should be given powers to make the decision, reflecting contemporary social views on morals. John Nicolson asks about homophobia in football. Rio Ferdinand says he recently met a footballer who had come out as gay, and his lawyer had advised him not to because of the pressure and emotional toll it could take on him. Mr Nicolson asks what message it sends to young gay disadvantaged teenagers if a wealthy footballer cannot come out as gay. Rio Ferdinand says ""the amount of eyeballs"" and press attention ""is so much bigger"" than in other sports. Rio Ferdinand continue saying that previously racism had ""got better"" but had never ""gone away"". But now racists are ""empowered"" by seeing others do the same online. Sanjay Bhandari says that social media companies need to be compelled to share all data that they have available on an account. Edleen John says that quite often, data shared by social media companies is not complete, and their own investigations will point to a completely different type of person sharing the abuse. SNP MP John Nicolson asks who the panel who would throw a banana or send money emojis to footballers. Rio Ferdinand replies: ""Sometimes it's young school boys ranging ages 13, 14 years old, sometimes younger. Or maybe an estate agent or a banker. ""Really it is from all different types. You can't just pinpoint one type of person from a certain particular background and say that is the actual stereotypical racist who's putting this abuse online or at stadiums or wherever. It's a very varied demographic demographic of people. John Nicolson asks what lessons can be learned how to tackle it. Ferdinand says the landscape is very different now. ""I think with social media, we've never been in this in this area, this time is very different. He says anonymity online is ""the big difference"". ""The fact that you can be anonymous online, gives you a certain amount of power - it enables you to puff your chest out, and be able to really say what you really feel, especially compounded with the fact that there's no repercussions, at the moment"". In 2018, Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a banana skin thrown in his direction as he celebrated scoring in front of Tottenham fans at the Emirates Stadium. Edleen
John says she backs one of the key elements in the bill - that firms should not just be responsible for taking down posts that are illegal, but also ""harmful"". She says she recognises ""how difficult it is"" to define precisely what content this should cover. But she adds that Parliament is a ""better place to define this"" than in the boardrooms of social media companies. Labour peer Lord Knight asks the panel whether the bill should ""do more"" on education. Edleen John from the Football Association says education is ""absolutely one part of it"" and will be important in trying to combat racism in the younger generations. But she says the ""responsibility at the moment"" should be on holding social media firms to account. She says this includes making sure the platforms do not ""amplify"" the racism present online - and that education is not used as an excuse to deviate from this aim. Â© 2025 BBC.

Long waits for ambulances continue in England,"Patients needing ambulances for life-threatening calls are often waiting longer than they should, latest NHS England figures show. The average response time was around eight and a half minutes in August - the target for urgent calls is seven minutes. Data also reveals the number waiting for routine operations rose to a record high of 5.6 million in July. The NHS in England is set to receive an extra Â£5.4bn over the next six months. The money has been allocated to help the health service respond to Covid-19, and to tackle the backlog caused by the pandemic. Since it began, hospitals in England have treated more than 450,000 patients with coronavirus. MPs this week also voted for alonger term plan for a new tax to fund health and social care. Will Boris Johnsonâs plan for the NHS work? MPs approve NHS and social care tax rise Mandatory Covid jabs for health staff considered NHS England figures show that waiting times for ambulances were slightly shorter, on average, in August than in July. But they were still more than one minute longer than the seven-minute target for responding to the most urgent calls. These are for people who are struggling to breathe or have had a cardiac arrest. The average response time for an ambulance that can take a patient to hospital - rather than a paramedic coming by bike or car - for this category in August was close to the worst on record - 11 minutes 10 seconds.

Dr Aseem Malhotra said the ambulance for his father, Prof Kailash Chand, should have arrived more quickly Heart specialist Dr Aseem Malhotra believes his father's death in July could have been prevented if an ambulance had arrived more quickly. His father, Prof Kailash Chand, had complained of chest discomfort before asking for help from neighbours, who were also doctors. They called an ambulance because they believed Prof Chand had had a cardiac arrest, and tried to resuscitate him. Dr Malhotra was on the phone to them at the time. ""I stayed on the line - 10 minutes passed, 15 minutes passed, 20 minutes passed. ""It took over 30 minutes before the ambulance arrived,"" he said. Dr Malhotra then saw his father being attached to a heart monitor via a videocall. ""It was the flat line. There was nothing to shock. ""We had missed that window. My father was gone."" Dr Malhotra said if he'd known the ambulance would take so long, he would have asked the neighbour to take him straight to hospital. North West Ambulance says it is investigating the incident. The figure of 5.6 million people waiting to start routine NHS hospital treatment is the highest since records began in August 2007, and up from 5.45m in July. Nearly 1.8 million have been waiting longer than 18 weeks, while more than 293,000 have been waiting for more than a year. That number has fallen - a sign of efforts to tackle the backlog caused by Covid. NHS England said staff had contended with one of the busiest summers on record in A&E, and hospitals were currently treating more than 6,000 patients with Covid. A total of around half a million Covid patients have been treated to date in English hospitals. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said: ""NHS staff have pulled out all the stops to deliver millions more tests, checks, treatments and operations than they did last summer despite caring for many more Covid patients. ""We do not know how many of those who held back from accessing care during the pandemic still need treatment, but we expect more to come forward in the coming months, and I urge anyone who needs the NHS to come forward."" Mr Tim Mitchell, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said the waiting times figures showed new funding for planned surgery was ""sorely needed"". ""Behind these eye-watering statistics are patients waiting in pain for hip and knee replacements and for heart, brain and other operations,"" he said. The new surgical hubs planned by the NHS to keep surgery going if there are further outbreaks of Covid would need additional doctors, nurses and surgeons to staff them, Mr Mitchell said. Data shows there are long waiting times for ambulances across the three other UK nations, but these waits are measured differently and can't be directly compared.

Numbers on furlough drop to new low,"The number of people on furlough has continued to fall, with young people leading the way, latest figures show. At the end of July, 1.6 million people were still on furlough, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. But older people and the travel sector did less well, with half of eligible travel workers still on the scheme. The Resolution Foundation said the numbers of people coming off furlough had ""slowed to a trickle"". Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, 11.6 million workers have benefited from the government programme, which is due to be wound up at the end of this month. At the peak of the pandemic in May last year, nearly nine million people were on furlough. There had been ""a striking fall"" in the number of young people on furlough, the Treasury said. A total of 121,600 people aged 18 to 34 came off the scheme during the months of June and July, it added. What's happening with the people still on furlough? What impact has the furlough scheme had? The number of people on furlough in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, as well as accommodation and food services have seen particularly large reductions in the number of jobs on furlough, the Treasury said. Numbers furloughed from these sectors declined by 26,200 and 96,700 in July respectively. However, concern remains over the number of people in the travel industry who are still on furlough. According to the Treasury figures, 51% of people employed in passenger air transport and 41% of travel agency and tour operator workers are still on furlough. Last month, British Airways warned it was facinga ""serious"" problem over wage costs, which would ""steeply increase"" after the end of the furlough scheme. Older people are also more likely to be still on furlough. Those aged 65 and over had the highest rate of furlough, at 8%. ""As the end of the furlough scheme looms into view, men, older people and travel sector workers are particularly at risk,"" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. She described the rates of furlough in the travel industry as ""alarmingly high"", adding: ""Where an entire industry is struggling, it's going to make life even harder if the end of furlough means you lose your job. ""There just aren't going to be enough travel industry jobs around, so an awful lot of people will have to move industry."" BA has warned its wage costs will increase ""steeply"" when the furlough scheme ends At the same time, latest figures for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) have shown a consistent fall in demand, with about 800,000 people claiming the most recent grant. Across all five grants available under SEISS, 9.9 million claims have been made and more than Â£27bn has been claimed by almost three million people. Charlie McCurdy, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the number of people coming off furlough over the summer had ""slowed to a trickle"". ""As a result, up to a million employees could still be on furlough when the scheme closes at the end of this month,"" he added. ""While we expect most of these staff to return to their previous roles, a significant number will not, and we could see a fresh rise in unemployment this autumn. ""Given these circumstances, now is not the right time to cut Universal Credit by Â£20 a week. The government must change course."" Are you currently on furlough?

How green is Scotland's space industry?,"Flight test vehicle ADA was launched from Benbecula Airport Scotland's space industry says it wants to operate in an environmentally-friendly way. But with plans lodged for several space ports, bringing the prospect of more regular launches, can blasting rockets into space ever be green? Crofter Dorothy Pritchard expects a space port in Sutherland to create much-needed skilled jobs The industry is a thriving one, according to Daniel Smith of the Scottish Space Leadership Council and founder of space marketing company, AstroAgency. ""Glasgow makes more satellites than anywhere else in the world outside of California, and there are five space ports planned for Scotland,"" he says. Those proposed locations are Unst in Shetland; North Uist in the Western Isles; Machrihanish in Argyll; the Moine peninsula in Sutherland and Prestwick Airport in Ayrshire - where it has been proposed to launch human space flights by 2035. Some of the sites - potentially Space Hub Sutherland in the north west Highlands, Spaceport 1 in North Uist and SaxaVord Spaceport in Unst - could be launching small, micro and pocket-sized nano satellites into space on a regular basis from next year. One of the companies involved in Space Hub Sutherland, rockets manufacturer Orbex, has set up its UK headquarters in Forres in Moray. Several landmark launches and rocket tests have already taken place in Scotland, where rocket launches have taken place since the 1930s. In 2016, a rocket fired from the Hebrides Rocket Range, a military missile test site in the Western Isles, becamethe first vehicle to be launched into space from UK soil. Three years later, a balloon designed for delivering small satellites into orbit was tested from SaxaVord Spaceport. The launch -described as the UK's first commercial spaceflight-related activity- saw the balloon soar 37km (23 miles) to the edge of Earth's atmosphere. SaxaVord Spaceport's balloon launch in 2019 Last year saw the UK's first complete ground rocket test to be carried out in 50 years. The 11m (36ft) tall Skylark-L rocket was tested at Kildermorie Estate, near Alness in the Highlands, by Edinburgh-based space technologies firm Skyrora. The rocket performed all the actions of a launch while restrained to the ground to prevent it from taking off. And last month, a ""flight test vehicle"" called ADA was launched by East Anglian firm Gravitilab Aerospace Services from Benbecula Airport as part of work to open Spaceport 1 at Scolpaig, North Uist, in 2022. Backers of these projects include Western Isles local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, public agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Melness Crofters' Estate. The estate's chairwoman Dorothy Pritchard expects a spaceport in Sutherland to create much-needed skilled jobs for young people in the Highlands. She says the proposal is to create the world's first working croft land and carbon-neutral space hub - and that the priority has always been that ""the close-knit crofting community, its stunning landscape, and native wildlife are protected"". Last month's Benbecula test was part of work to develop a space port on North Uist While Scotland will never see big Nasa-style rocket launches, even small-scale operations involving rockets only a few metres long can still pose environmental challenges. The key issues are fuel and what do to about spent rockets and redundant satellites. Rocket fuels can include potentially harmful and corrosive materials such as hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide or nuclear materials. Rocket engines can also produce large amounts of sulphur, along with greenhouse gases and leave soot in the atmosphere. ""Space debris is probably the most topical problem,"" says Daniel Smith. The debris - also known as space junk - includes hundreds of millions of pieces of broken satellites and fragments of rockets whizzing around in Earth's orbit at speeds of up to 17,500 mph (28,163 km/h). This creates the risk of collisions with working satellites - as well as the International Space Station, and the astronauts that crew it. Forres-headquartered Orbex says its rockets will use a ""completely renewable biofuel"" The Scottish Space Leadership Council, through its Sustainable Space Task Force, has brought together Scottish manufacturers, data firms and others in a campaign to make getting to space less damaging to the planet. The industry has been asked to solve challenges which include finding a way of measuring the ""true impact"" of the international space sector on the environment. Scotland's first sustainable space summit was held in June, and featured a message from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The campaign has also asked public body NatureScot and environmental group Friends of the Earth Scotland about what changes they want to see. Daniel Smith says involving potential critics of the space industry makes the campaign unique. He says the industry wants to play a part in tackling climate change, adding: ""It's the right thing to do."" Edinburgh-based Skyrora, which carried out a launch test last year, is developing a method for making fuel from unrecyclable plastics Individual companies say they are trying to make a difference. Orbex says its rockets are designed to be reusable and will use bio-propane, which the company describes as a ""completely renewable biofuel"". It says the fuel has 90% less CO2 emissions than kerosene-based rocket fuels, and leaves no soot in the atmosphere. Orbex also says construction and operation of its launch site - Space Hub Sutherland - will be carbon neutral and that peat lifted during the building work will be laid over ""scars"" left by the harvesting of peat in the local area. Skyrora has been carrying out tests using Ecosene, a fuel made from waste plastic. The Scottish company is developing its own method to make the fuel from non-recyclable, or least recycled, plastics such as polystyrene and types of plastics used in making polytunnel sheets and toys. Skyrora said emissions tests had shown the fuel resulted in a vast reduction in sulphur and greenhouse gases. Daniel Smith says Scotland's space industry has also sought to help address the problem of space junk. ""Smaller satellites reduce the chance of collisions,"" he says. ""There is also work being done to make satellites burn up when they are no longer needed."" Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, says conservation and environmental groups rely on satellite data for their work, but they also want to see the industry operate in a sustainable way. He says: ""From measuring shrinking forests to telling us who is most affected by climate change, the space industry makes a great contribution in highlighting environmental threats to our natural systems. ""Of course there is a cost to getting this data and the industry needs to look at the propellants it uses, the distances its many components travel and even the tourist traffic launches generate. ""The satellite and launch industry is growing rapidly but there is a lively and welcome discussion about creating a environmental strategy for the space industry in Scotland to drive change and both minimise environmental impact and maximise the value of data from space to the environment."" An artist's impression of Spaceport 1 in North Uist Yes, with strong criticism of those planned for the Highlands and North Uist. The planning application for Space Hub Sutherland sparked 457 objections, many on environmental grounds, compared with 118 representations in support of the proposals. It has also faced opposition from the Protect The Mhoine (PTM) pressure group, while billionaires Anders and Anne Holch Povlsen went to court to challenge the project. The couple own land near the proposed site and have concerns about its impact on protected habitats. Their company, Wildland Ltd, raised the legal action against Highland Council's decision to give planning approval, arguing that it failed to take into account the risks to the local environment and wildlife. But last montha judge said he was ""not persuaded""that the local authority had erred in law, and rejected the legal challenge. Meanwhile, the Povlsens haveinvested almost Â£1.5m in SaxaVord Spaceport. The Shetland site is a former RAF station, while the one in Sutherland is undeveloped peatland. A spokesman for the Povlsens said the Unst project would still need to cross a ""high environmental bar"". The Western Isles' Spaceport 1 has encountered opposition from the North Uist Conservation Group. The campaigners said the land would be lost to concrete structures and raised concerns about the potential impact on St Kilda, a Unseco World Heritage site. St Kilda lies about 40 miles (64km) west of North Uist, the nearest inhabited place to the archipelago.

Migrant boats could be turned back in new UK moveBorder Force officials would be able to use the new tactic but only in limited circumstances.UKThe BBCâs Lyse Doucet witnesses the birth of a new Taliban order,"A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, aboard a Border Force vessel Boats carrying migrants across the English Channel could be turned back from the UK, if personally approved by Home Secretary Priti Patel. The government has authorised Border Force officials to use the new tactic - but only in limited circumstances. However France is strongly against the plan, saying it breaks maritime law and accusing the UK of blackmail. But Boris Johnson's spokesman said any plans would be ""safe and legal"" and would comply with the law. Rising numbers of migrants have been crossing the English Channel in recent months - and so far this week more than 1,500 people have crossed by boat. The Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world. Many migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities. What happens to migrants found in the Channel? Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? What happens when they reach the UK? Government sources have confirmed to the BBC that a Border Force team has been training for months to begin the operation. It is understood that the final training may take place within days, subject to the weather - meaning the tactic would then be ready to be used whenever is it practical and safe to do so. But France says the move flouts international maritime law, which says people at risk of losing their lives at sea must be rescued. France's interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin - who met Ms Patel on Wednesday for talks on the migrant crisis - also accused the UK of financial blackmail. He was referring to a deal the UK and France struck over money earlier this year, when the UK promised to pay France Â£54.2m for extra action such as doubling the number of coast patrols. Since then, Ms Patel has warned that Britain could withhold the money, unless more boats are intercepted. ""UK's commitment must be kept,"" said Mr Darmanin. ""I clearly said it to my counterpart Priti Patel. The friendship between our two countries deserves better than posturing which undermines the cooperation between our ministries"". The government's lawyers say turning boats back would be legal in limited and specific circumstances - although they have not confirmed what these will be. Because the legal and safety risks are so high, it is also understood that Border Force chiefs have asked Ms Patel to personally support decisions to use the tactic, meaning she would have to be available to take a call from a Border Force vessel if and when they believe the tactic can be used safely. The UK has a legal right to intercept people at sea where necessary to prevent crime or to protect borders. But whatever the legal advice the UK government has received on migrant boats, it's questionable whether such an operation could continue once there is a clear sign of danger. Border Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible. So their window of opportunity to run a push-back operation could be very tight. But more importantlyâ¦ is this really ever going to happen? The intervention from the French interior minister may have just sunk the operation before a single Border Force ship has set sail. There are no international waters in the Dover Strait - so any operation would need French cooperation. And Gerald Darmanin's statement makes clear France's opposition to any confrontation of dinghies in one of the world's most dangerous shipping lanes. The tactic has never been used before in the English Channel, but it has been in the Mediterranean, said the Immigration Services Union (ISU) which represents borders, immigration and customs staff. Lucy Moreton from the ISU said she would be ""very surprised"" if it ends up being used at all - calling it ""dead in the water"". ""There are understandably a lot of constraints around it, and you cannot do this with a vessel which is in any way vulnerable. ""But more importantly, you also need the consent of the French to do it. Because as you turn the vessel back towards France, when it crosses the median line it has to be intercepted and rescued by the French, and it appears the French will simply not engage in this."" If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port If they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them Each country has search-and-rescue zones An EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it Ms Patel met Mr Darmanin, on Wednesday for talks on the migrant crisis - but the two sides failed to agree any new measures. More than 12,600 migrants have made the journey across the English Channel so far this year. Charities urged the Home Office to take a ""more humane and responsible approach"" towards asylum seekers. Amnesty International UK has said people have the right to seek asylum in the UK and ""only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them"". And the head of the Refugee Council said: ""Rather than spending time, resource and immense effort on pushing these very vulnerable people away, this government must give people options for safe routes to stop such perilous journeys in the first place. ""Refugee family reunion is one such safe route that has saved thousands of lives. Resettlement is another. We urge this government to rethink its brutal policy and think about the individual lives at the heart of these desperate journeys."" Labour also said the tactic risks lives, adding: ""That the home secretary is even considering these dangerous proposals shows how badly she has lost control of this situation."" The Home Office said it continues to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options to find ways of stopping small boats making the journey. The prime minister's spokesman said the same, and that the UK's activities ""comply with international and domestic law"". And the government added that it needs to use every possible tactic at itsÂ disposal to tackle people smuggling. Ms Patel has repeatedlyspoken out about organised crime gangs,externalwho smuggle people to the UK for profit - and thatthe new Nationality and Borders Billaims to ""break their business model"". She will host the final day of the G7 interior ministers meeting on Thursday, with illegal migration anticipated to be the focus.

"Long waits for ambulances continue in EnglandIt took an average of more than eight minutes to respond to urgent call-outs, NHS figures show.Health","Patients needing ambulances for life-threatening calls are often waiting longer than they should, latest NHS England figures show. The average response time was around eight and a half minutes in August - the target for urgent calls is seven minutes. Data also reveals the number waiting for routine operations rose to a record high of 5.6 million in July. The NHS in England is set to receive an extra Â£5.4bn over the next six months. The money has been allocated to help the health service respond to Covid-19, and to tackle the backlog caused by the pandemic. Since it began, hospitals in England have treated more than 450,000 patients with coronavirus. MPs this week also voted for alonger term plan for a new tax to fund health and social care. Will Boris Johnsonâs plan for the NHS work? MPs approve NHS and social care tax rise Mandatory Covid jabs for health staff considered NHS England figures show that waiting times for ambulances were slightly shorter, on average, in August than in July. But they were still more than one minute longer than the seven-minute target for responding to the most urgent calls. These are for people who are struggling to breathe or have had a cardiac arrest. The average response time for an ambulance that can take a patient to hospital - rather than a paramedic coming by bike or car - for this category in August was close to the worst on record - 11 minutes 10 seconds.

Dr Aseem Malhotra said the ambulance for his father, Prof Kailash Chand, should have arrived more quickly Heart specialist Dr Aseem Malhotra believes his father's death in July could have been prevented if an ambulance had arrived more quickly. His father, Prof Kailash Chand, had complained of chest discomfort before asking for help from neighbours, who were also doctors. They called an ambulance because they believed Prof Chand had had a cardiac arrest, and tried to resuscitate him. Dr Malhotra was on the phone to them at the time. ""I stayed on the line - 10 minutes passed, 15 minutes passed, 20 minutes passed. ""It took over 30 minutes before the ambulance arrived,"" he said. Dr Malhotra then saw his father being attached to a heart monitor via a videocall. ""It was the flat line. There was nothing to shock. ""We had missed that window. My father was gone."" Dr Malhotra said if he'd known the ambulance would take so long, he would have asked the neighbour to take him straight to hospital. North West Ambulance says it is investigating the incident. The figure of 5.6 million people waiting to start routine NHS hospital treatment is the highest since records began in August 2007, and up from 5.45m in July. Nearly 1.8 million have been waiting longer than 18 weeks, while more than 293,000 have been waiting for more than a year. That number has fallen - a sign of efforts to tackle the backlog caused by Covid. NHS England said staff had contended with one of the busiest summers on record in A&E, and hospitals were currently treating more than 6,000 patients with Covid. A total of around half a million Covid patients have been treated to date in English hospitals. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said: ""NHS staff have pulled out all the stops to deliver millions more tests, checks, treatments and operations than they did last summer despite caring for many more Covid patients. ""We do not know how many of those who held back from accessing care during the pandemic still need treatment, but we expect more to come forward in the coming months, and I urge anyone who needs the NHS to come forward."" Mr Tim Mitchell, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said the waiting times figures showed new funding for planned surgery was ""sorely needed"". ""Behind these eye-watering statistics are patients waiting in pain for hip and knee replacements and for heart, brain and other operations,"" he said. The new surgical hubs planned by the NHS to keep surgery going if there are further outbreaks of Covid would need additional doctors, nurses and surgeons to staff them, Mr Mitchell said. Data shows there are long waiting times for ambulances across the three other UK nations, but these waits are measured differently and can't be directly compared.

LiveLiveRio Ferdinand tells MPs about online hate and racism12 minutes ago,"A joint committee of MPs and Peers is examining the government's Online Safety Bill Former England captain Rio Ferdinand gave evidence to MPs and Peers about the government's draft Online Safety Bill The ex-Manchester United player told MPs abuse online is ""normalising"" racist behaviour with ""no repercussions"" And he described how he had to explain to his children why people use the monkey emoji The government's proposed new laws would set up new rules to tackle harmful online content Other witnesses who gave evidence were Imran Ahmed, from Centre for Countering Digital Hate, chair of Kick It Out Sanjay Bhandari, and Edleen John from the FA Nancy Kelley the CEO of Stonewall and Danny Stone MBE, the Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust are also gave evidence Paul Seddon, Richard Morris and Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Thanks for following along with us today. Goodbye. This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand: 'I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids' In response to suggestions earlier from Imran Ahmed that Facebook ""doesn't want to look for harm on their site to avoid then having to become responsible for it"", a spokesperson for the company said: âFacebook
has long called for new rules to set high standards across the internet. ""We
already have strict policies against harmful content on our platforms, but
regulations are needed so that private companies arenât making so many
important decisions alone. ""While we know we have more to do, our
industry-leading transparency reports show we are removing more harmful content
before anyone reports it to us.â The penultimate question comes from Suzanne Webb who asks the panel if they think online platforms understand the scale of the work they need to do once the bill comes in to law. Nancy Kelley replies: ""I think they know the scale of the problem better than anyone sitting in this room. Whether they know the scale of the work required for them to address the problem, I'm not sure."" Danny Stone says: ""I think they are having a bit of an internal debate about it. I think some probably understand and know what's coming"" But he adds: ""I think that, in some cases they are going to get a bit of a shock"" He ends by saying he thinks that the government's Online Safety Bill is a ""great piece of legislation trying to set an international standard - that has to be welcomed."" Baroness Kidron asks what Danny Stone's views are on offensive material and rules from different social media providers. Danny Stone says sometimes the BBFC - which classifies films and video content - may ban a film in the UK, but it is most likely still available somewhere online and in dark corners of the internet, but it is about limiting the audience to a harmful film. This, he says, is how he views trying to regulate abuse on popular social media websites, that there should be a minimum standard which he says should be set by Parliament, ""not Mark Zuckerberg"". John The SNP's John Nicolson asks the panel how seriously social media platforms take the issue of online abuse. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says she thinks platforms are genuinely concerned at a ""generalised level"" - but this isn't always reflected in how they regulate content on their sites. Mr Nicolson introduces a story of his own - saying that as a gay man he was once called a ""greasy bender"" on Twitter. ""Most people would accept it crosses a line"" he says. But he adds that when he reported the abuse, the firm told him the post did not breach its community guidelines. He says he went back and forward ""two or three times"" with the company ""but absolutely nothing happened"". ""They know I am a Member of Parliament, they know I sit on this committee.  If they are prepared to behave with such utter disdain to somebody with a wee bit of influence, can you imagine the disdain for the average LGBT person."" Nancy Kelley says: ""We don't have to imagine it - we can see it."" Conservative Dean Russell asks if organisations see removing anonymity as the easiest way to tackle ""cross-pollination"" of hatred from different groups. Danny Stone says ""this isn't really addressed"" in the bill at the moment. He says social media platforms should be legally liable where data to identify a social media user cannot be used. There are ""various reasons"" why people might want to keep anonymity, he says, but there should be an appropriate middle measure to allow some people to keep anonymous accounts where it is necessary. Nancy Kelley says these platforms can identify anonymous abusive accounts and delete them - they just don't. She says Stonewall has ""deep concerns"" for LGBT people around the world if social media companies insist on people using real names. ""Even in very liberal, accepting environments, [publishing names] increases the danger to our community"", she tells MPs. 90% of LGBT social media users in Egypt, Lebanon and Iran are reluctant to share their names even on social media private messages for fear of legal repercussions. She says in Egypt in particular, authorities are known to use online sting operations where they try to find gay men using social media so they can arrest them. Conservative MP Dean Russell asks the panel whether social media firms are reflecting an increase in abuse within society, or contributing to it. Danny Stone, director at the Antisemitism Policy Trust, says platforms ""facilitate the spread"" of hatred. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says it is important not to ""confuse"" the situation online with wider attitudes towards LGBT people, which she says have improved over the last 50 years. But she says social media can ""radicalise"" people's views, and ""enables"" a minority of people to spread abuse. The panel is asked about the issue of getting information about the scale of abuse from social media firms. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says there is an ""absence of high-quality studies"" - although some studies do exist. She says the regulator should be able to require firms to hand over relevant data. Danny Stone from the Antisemitism Policy Trust says there is ""some data out there"" - and points to some data collected by the European Union. He adds though that he has been trying to persuade one social media firm to give him a PowerPoint slide they use in training sessions for ten years, but although it has been promised he is yet to receive it. Nancy Kelly, the CEO of Stonewall Nancy Kelly, chief executive of Stonewall, says that existing legislation does not really account for abuse online, she says much legislation against homophobic and transphobic abuse are made for workplaces and face-to-face interactions. She says introducing duties of care for social media companies is something Stonewall is fully behind. She adds that the LGBT community suffers direct insults, forced outing and identifying where people live (otherwise known as ""doxing""). Some people may have to move house or change jobs as a result of these instances. Danny Stone MBE, director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust says offline and online abuse is ""similarly connected"". He says there have been anti-Semitic murders and anti-Semitic manifestoes shared by extremists shared online. He adds that he does not post any pictures of his children online as there is a chance someone might want to hurt his children because of the work he does. Smaller social platforms can disseminate false information about LGBT people in the same way they can share anti-Semitic misinformation, Ms Kelly adds. Danny Stone MBE, Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust The committee is now taking evidence from the final panel. Nancy Kelley, is the chief executive of Stonewall, and Danny Stone MBE, is director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust. Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Sanjay Bhandari, the chair
of Kick It Out, suggested that one of the key things the government can do
to to force tech firms to deal with racist abuse on their platforms is to set
up a code of practice around the reach of anonymous accounts. The bill currently deals primarily with content
moderation - how the tech platforms deal with hate speech after it has been
posted. But MPs also ask if they need to consider ways to make those
behind abuse more accountable a key part of the legislation. There was consensus that there is a lack of data
about who the hateful posters are, and that is something that the regulator
needs to audit, all panellists agreed. But Mr Bhandari also raised on the biggest
issues facing regulators when he told MPs if that ""if I was being
continuously punched in the face, then arresting someone is good but I also want
them to stop them punching me in the first place."" How to stop people
posting hateful comments is sadly probably a job both beyond the reach of Ofcom
or the tech firms. Edleen John says the international football community is ""looking at us, and the opportunity we have to put in place the first piece of legislation that can become a blueprint for other organisations and other countries as well. Chair of the committee Damian Collins ends this section of the hearing by asking Ms John what discussions are being held an executive level with football's governing bodies such as Uefa and Fifa. She says: ""We absolutely have conversations right to the top of the organisations around discrimination, around online abuse, around sanctions and around what we can do as a collective to make it clear that this isn't something that we want in our game, and our game is for all."" Conservative peer Lord Gilbert goes back to the issue of the responsibility in the bill on social media companies to remove content that is not legal but ""harmful"". He asks whether ""harmful"" should be defined in the bill, or whether the definition of what is illegal should simply be widened instead. Sanjay Bhandari, chair at anti-racism group Kick it Out, says he doesn't favour either approach. He says if what is ""harmful"" is defined in the bill, then it will have to be continually updated with new legislation to reflect new forms of abuse. He says instead, a regulator - in this case, Ofcom - should be given powers to make the decision, reflecting contemporary social views on morals. John Nicolson asks about homophobia in football. Rio Ferdinand says he recently met a footballer who had come out as gay, and his lawyer had advised him not to because of the pressure and emotional toll it could take on him. Mr Nicolson asks what message it sends to young gay disadvantaged teenagers if a wealthy footballer cannot come out as gay. Rio Ferdinand says ""the amount of eyeballs"" and press attention ""is so much bigger"" than in other sports. Rio Ferdinand continue saying that previously racism had ""got better"" but had never ""gone away"". But now racists are ""empowered"" by seeing others do the same online. Sanjay Bhandari says that social media companies need to be compelled to share all data that they have available on an account. Edleen John says that quite often, data shared by social media companies is not complete, and their own investigations will point to a completely different type of person sharing the abuse. SNP MP John Nicolson asks who the panel who would throw a banana or send money emojis to footballers. Rio Ferdinand replies: ""Sometimes it's young school boys ranging ages 13, 14 years old, sometimes younger. Or maybe an estate agent or a banker. ""Really it is from all different types. You can't just pinpoint one type of person from a certain particular background and say that is the actual stereotypical racist who's putting this abuse online or at stadiums or wherever. It's a very varied demographic demographic of people. John Nicolson asks what lessons can be learned how to tackle it. Ferdinand says the landscape is very different now. ""I think with social media, we've never been in this in this area, this time is very different. He says anonymity online is ""the big difference"". ""The fact that you can be anonymous online, gives you a certain amount of power - it enables you to puff your chest out, and be able to really say what you really feel, especially compounded with the fact that there's no repercussions, at the moment"". In 2018, Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a banana skin thrown in his direction as he celebrated scoring in front of Tottenham fans at the Emirates Stadium. Edleen
John says she backs one of the key elements in the bill - that firms should not just be responsible for taking down posts that are illegal, but also ""harmful"". She says she recognises ""how difficult it is"" to define precisely what content this should cover. But she adds that Parliament is a ""better place to define this"" than in the boardrooms of social media companies. Labour peer Lord Knight asks the panel whether the bill should ""do more"" on education. Edleen John from the Football Association says education is ""absolutely one part of it"" and will be important in trying to combat racism in the younger generations. But she says the ""responsibility at the moment"" should be on holding social media firms to account. She says this includes making sure the platforms do not ""amplify"" the racism present online - and that education is not used as an excuse to deviate from this aim. Â© 2025 BBC.

Rio Ferdinand says he recently met a footballer who had come out as gay, and his lawyer had advised him not to because of the pressure and emotional toll it could take on him. Mr Nicolson asks what message it sends to young gay disadvantaged teenagers if a wealthy footballer cannot come out as gay. Rio Ferdinand says ""the amount of eyeballs"" and press attention ""is so much bigger"" than in other sports. Rio Ferdinand continue saying that previously racism had ""got better"" but had never ""gone away"". But now racists are ""empowered"" by seeing others do the same online. Sanjay Bhandari says that social media companies need to be compelled to share all data that they have available on an account. Edleen John says that quite often, data shared by social media companies is not complete, and their own investigations will point to a completely different type of person sharing the abuse. SNP MP John Nicolson asks who the panel who would throw a banana or send money emojis to footballers. Rio Ferdinand replies: ""Sometimes it's young school boys ranging ages 13, 14 years old, sometimes younger. Or maybe an estate agent or a banker. ""Really it is from all different types. You can't just pinpoint one type of person from a certain particular background and say that is the actual stereotypical racist who's putting this abuse online or at stadiums or wherever. It's a very varied demographic demographic of people. John Nicolson asks what lessons can be learned how to tackle it. Ferdinand says the landscape is very different now. ""I think with social media, we've never been in this in this area, this time is very different. He says anonymity online is ""the big difference"". ""The fact that you can be anonymous online, gives you a certain amount of power - it enables you to puff your chest out, and be able to really say what you really feel, especially compounded with the fact that there's no repercussions, at the moment"". In 2018, Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a banana skin thrown in his direction as he celebrated scoring in front of Tottenham fans at the Emirates Stadium. Edleen
John says she backs one of the key elements in the bill - that firms should not just be responsible for taking down posts that are illegal, but also ""harmful"". She says she recognises ""how difficult it is"" to define precisely what content this should cover. But she adds that Parliament is a ""better place to define this"" than in the boardrooms of social media companies. Labour peer Lord Knight asks the panel whether the bill should ""do more"" on education. Edleen John from the Football Association says education is ""absolutely one part of it"" and will be important in trying to combat racism in the younger generations. But she says the ""responsibility at the moment"" should be on holding social media firms to account. She says this includes making sure the platforms do not ""amplify"" the racism present online - and that education is not used as an excuse to deviate from this aim. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveRio Ferdinand tells MPs about online hate and racismThe former England is on a panel giving evidence to MPs and Peers about the government's draft Online Safety Bill.UK Politics,"A joint committee of MPs and Peers is examining the government's Online Safety Bill Former England captain Rio Ferdinand gave evidence to MPs and Peers about the government's draft Online Safety Bill The ex-Manchester United player told MPs abuse online is ""normalising"" racist behaviour with ""no repercussions"" And he described how he had to explain to his children why people use the monkey emoji The government's proposed new laws would set up new rules to tackle harmful online content Other witnesses who gave evidence were Imran Ahmed, from Centre for Countering Digital Hate, chair of Kick It Out Sanjay Bhandari, and Edleen John from the FA Nancy Kelley the CEO of Stonewall and Danny Stone MBE, the Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust are also gave evidence Paul Seddon, Richard Morris and Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Thanks for following along with us today. Goodbye. This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand: 'I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids' In response to suggestions earlier from Imran Ahmed that Facebook ""doesn't want to look for harm on their site to avoid then having to become responsible for it"", a spokesperson for the company said: âFacebook
has long called for new rules to set high standards across the internet. ""We
already have strict policies against harmful content on our platforms, but
regulations are needed so that private companies arenât making so many
important decisions alone. ""While we know we have more to do, our
industry-leading transparency reports show we are removing more harmful content
before anyone reports it to us.â The penultimate question comes from Suzanne Webb who asks the panel if they think online platforms understand the scale of the work they need to do once the bill comes in to law. Nancy Kelley replies: ""I think they know the scale of the problem better than anyone sitting in this room. Whether they know the scale of the work required for them to address the problem, I'm not sure."" Danny Stone says: ""I think they are having a bit of an internal debate about it. I think some probably understand and know what's coming"" But he adds: ""I think that, in some cases they are going to get a bit of a shock"" He ends by saying he thinks that the government's Online Safety Bill is a ""great piece of legislation trying to set an international standard - that has to be welcomed."" Baroness Kidron asks what Danny Stone's views are on offensive material and rules from different social media providers. Danny Stone says sometimes the BBFC - which classifies films and video content - may ban a film in the UK, but it is most likely still available somewhere online and in dark corners of the internet, but it is about limiting the audience to a harmful film. This, he says, is how he views trying to regulate abuse on popular social media websites, that there should be a minimum standard which he says should be set by Parliament, ""not Mark Zuckerberg"". John The SNP's John Nicolson asks the panel how seriously social media platforms take the issue of online abuse. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says she thinks platforms are genuinely concerned at a ""generalised level"" - but this isn't always reflected in how they regulate content on their sites. Mr Nicolson introduces a story of his own - saying that as a gay man he was once called a ""greasy bender"" on Twitter. ""Most people would accept it crosses a line"" he says. But he adds that when he reported the abuse, the firm told him the post did not breach its community guidelines. He says he went back and forward ""two or three times"" with the company ""but absolutely nothing happened"". ""They know I am a Member of Parliament, they know I sit on this committee.  If they are prepared to behave with such utter disdain to somebody with a wee bit of influence, can you imagine the disdain for the average LGBT person."" Nancy Kelley says: ""We don't have to imagine it - we can see it."" Conservative Dean Russell asks if organisations see removing anonymity as the easiest way to tackle ""cross-pollination"" of hatred from different groups. Danny Stone says ""this isn't really addressed"" in the bill at the moment. He says social media platforms should be legally liable where data to identify a social media user cannot be used. There are ""various reasons"" why people might want to keep anonymity, he says, but there should be an appropriate middle measure to allow some people to keep anonymous accounts where it is necessary. Nancy Kelley says these platforms can identify anonymous abusive accounts and delete them - they just don't. She says Stonewall has ""deep concerns"" for LGBT people around the world if social media companies insist on people using real names. ""Even in very liberal, accepting environments, [publishing names] increases the danger to our community"", she tells MPs. 90% of LGBT social media users in Egypt, Lebanon and Iran are reluctant to share their names even on social media private messages for fear of legal repercussions. She says in Egypt in particular, authorities are known to use online sting operations where they try to find gay men using social media so they can arrest them. Conservative MP Dean Russell asks the panel whether social media firms are reflecting an increase in abuse within society, or contributing to it. Danny Stone, director at the Antisemitism Policy Trust, says platforms ""facilitate the spread"" of hatred. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says it is important not to ""confuse"" the situation online with wider attitudes towards LGBT people, which she says have improved over the last 50 years. But she says social media can ""radicalise"" people's views, and ""enables"" a minority of people to spread abuse. The panel is asked about the issue of getting information about the scale of abuse from social media firms. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says there is an ""absence of high-quality studies"" - although some studies do exist. She says the regulator should be able to require firms to hand over relevant data. Danny Stone from the Antisemitism Policy Trust says there is ""some data out there"" - and points to some data collected by the European Union. He adds though that he has been trying to persuade one social media firm to give him a PowerPoint slide they use in training sessions for ten years, but although it has been promised he is yet to receive it. Nancy Kelly, the CEO of Stonewall Nancy Kelly, chief executive of Stonewall, says that existing legislation does not really account for abuse online, she says much legislation against homophobic and transphobic abuse are made for workplaces and face-to-face interactions. She says introducing duties of care for social media companies is something Stonewall is fully behind. She adds that the LGBT community suffers direct insults, forced outing and identifying where people live (otherwise known as ""doxing""). Some people may have to move house or change jobs as a result of these instances. Danny Stone MBE, director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust says offline and online abuse is ""similarly connected"". He says there have been anti-Semitic murders and anti-Semitic manifestoes shared by extremists shared online. He adds that he does not post any pictures of his children online as there is a chance someone might want to hurt his children because of the work he does. Smaller social platforms can disseminate false information about LGBT people in the same way they can share anti-Semitic misinformation, Ms Kelly adds. Danny Stone MBE, Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust The committee is now taking evidence from the final panel. Nancy Kelley, is the chief executive of Stonewall, and Danny Stone MBE, is director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust. Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Sanjay Bhandari, the chair
of Kick It Out, suggested that one of the key things the government can do
to to force tech firms to deal with racist abuse on their platforms is to set
up a code of practice around the reach of anonymous accounts. The bill currently deals primarily with content
moderation - how the tech platforms deal with hate speech after it has been
posted. But MPs also ask if they need to consider ways to make those
behind abuse more accountable a key part of the legislation. There was consensus that there is a lack of data
about who the hateful posters are, and that is something that the regulator
needs to audit, all panellists agreed. But Mr Bhandari also raised on the biggest
issues facing regulators when he told MPs if that ""if I was being
continuously punched in the face, then arresting someone is good but I also want
them to stop them punching me in the first place."" How to stop people
posting hateful comments is sadly probably a job both beyond the reach of Ofcom
or the tech firms. Edleen John says the international football community is ""looking at us, and the opportunity we have to put in place the first piece of legislation that can become a blueprint for other organisations and other countries as well. Chair of the committee Damian Collins ends this section of the hearing by asking Ms John what discussions are being held an executive level with football's governing bodies such as Uefa and Fifa. She says: ""We absolutely have conversations right to the top of the organisations around discrimination, around online abuse, around sanctions and around what we can do as a collective to make it clear that this isn't something that we want in our game, and our game is for all."" Conservative peer Lord Gilbert goes back to the issue of the responsibility in the bill on social media companies to remove content that is not legal but ""harmful"". He asks whether ""harmful"" should be defined in the bill, or whether the definition of what is illegal should simply be widened instead. Sanjay Bhandari, chair at anti-racism group Kick it Out, says he doesn't favour either approach. He says if what is ""harmful"" is defined in the bill, then it will have to be continually updated with new legislation to reflect new forms of abuse. He says instead, a regulator - in this case, Ofcom - should be given powers to make the decision, reflecting contemporary social views on morals. John Nicolson asks about homophobia in football.

Victims call for Met Police commissioner to goPaul Gambaccini and the brother of murdered reporter Daniel Jones are among those demanding change.,"Dame Cressida Dick became the first woman to lead the Metropolitan Police when she was appointed in 2017 Victims of police injustice are calling for the prime minister to replace Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick when her contract comes to an end in April. In an open letter, they accuse her of ""presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover-up"". The BBC understands Dame Cressida, 60, has been offered a two-year extension and that negotiations are ongoing. Since her appointment in 2017, she has been involved in several controversies. Two of the seven who signed the letter,published in the Daily Mail,external, are Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephenwas murdered in a racist attack,external, and Lady Brittan, whose home was raided when her husband Lord Brittanwas falsely accused of child abuse. PM 'has complete confidence' in Met Police boss Met Police chief: 'I'm a bit different' The others include Alastair Morgan, whose brother Daniel was murdered in 1987 - the killer remains unidentified and a report into the caseaccused the force of institutional corruptionand sparked denials from the Met's leadership - and the son of D-Day Army officer Lord Bramall,who was falsely accusedof child sexual abuse by thepaedophile and fantasist Carl Beech. BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini,who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, and the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor -another victim of Beech's false allegations- are also signatories, as is Sir Edward Heath's biographer Michael McManus. The former prime minister was another public figuresmeared by Beech. This video can not be played Paul Gambaccini: ""The Metropolitan Police have obfuscated the truth from the people of this country"" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Mr Proctor said it was ""utterly extraordinary"" the government should contemplate extending Dame Cressida's tenure ""even for a day, let alone two years"". He said the letter's signatories were linked by their common experiences of police malpractice over a number of years, and they had come up with no reason why the chief commissioner ""who has failed and failed and failed"" should be given an extension. ""There must be other chief commissioners outside of London who'd be prepared to do the job and do it a great deal better, with integrity and without cover-up after cover-up. ""I personally believe she should have resigned months ago. I'm not fighting for myself, I'm fighting for the future so that it won't happen to anyone else. ""And it could happen to someone else if changes are not made at the top of the Metropolitan Police. No-one has been held responsible for the problems Operation Midland [the Carl Beech allegations investigation] created. ""The commissioner even got a damehood - quite outrageous."" Harvey Proctor said Dame Cressida should have resigned months ago Mr Proctor said he received an apology in person from Lord Hogan-Howe, Dame Cressida's predecessor, who was the Met's chief commissioner while Beech's allegations were treated as ""credible and true"", but he rejected an apology from Dame Cressida because ""her words and actions did not go hand in hand"". ""I call on the prime minister and the home secretary to meet with all seven of us to hear our experiences - and I would defy them then to continue with any extension of her remit."" Mr Gambaccini, who sued the Met over the way it dealt with accusations against him, said Dame Cressida postponed the case for as long as possible in what he described as ""three and a half years of non-honesty"". Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, he also said that he and his fellow signatories ""all found that the leadership of the Metropolitan Police is breathtakingly corrupt"". He accused both the chief commissioner and the force of misleading the public. Lady Brittan, the widow of Lord Brittan, is among those calling for Dame Cressida's tenure to end As the first female Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick was bound to be well received when she was appointed in 2017. It was the job she had always wanted and it meant a return to the force where she had spent most of her career and where she was popular with the rank and file. Some of the criticism now being levelled at her relates to her time at Scotland Yard before she was in the top job. In 2014 as an assistant commissioner she was in charge of the team involved in Operation Midland - the disastrous long-running inquiry into an alleged VIP paedophile ring. When Midland collapsed and the complainant, Carl Beech, was exposed as a serial liar, criticism was levelled at a number of officers including one detective who had initially described Beech's story as ""credible and true"". Cressida Dick admitted that she had heard the officer say this on the radio and had done nothing to correct it. The former MP Harvey Proctor, who lost his job and his home as a result of being falsely accused by Carl Beech, is one of the seven signatories to the letter saying that Dame Cressida must not have her contract extended. He, like the others, does not believe that over the past four years she has displayed the right characteristics to remain in the role. Doreen, now Baroness, Lawrence is the first name on the letter. She says she is unhappy that the commissioner has closed her son's murder inquiry and, as a lifelong race campaigner, she is also concerned about the Met's use of stop and search. The signatories were brought together by the Daily Mail, which has been calling for Cressida Dick to go. The commissioner recently described herself as an honourable person. The question now is whether she will want to accept a two-year extension. Mr Gambaccini also criticised the BBC for its reporting of his case, accusing it of being on the ""side of wrongdoers"". He has previously described the corporation as ""the worst employer in the world"", alleging that no senior managers were in touch with him during his time under investigation by the Met Police. The BBC said it had no comment to make. In February 2017, Dame Cressida became the first woman to lead London's force since its inception in 1829. Her appointment wascriticised at the time by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly shot dead during an operation she led in 2005. Now Dame Cressida is coming to the end of a five-year contract, Home Secretary Priti Patel has consulted with London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Downing Street over the decision to ask her to stay on for two more years, according to media reports. Protesters demonstrate outside Scotland Yard over the treatment of people by police at the Sarah Everard vigil The Met commissioner resisted pressure on her to resign in March when the force came under scrutiny over thehandling of a vigil held in memory of Sarah Everard,the marketing executive murdered by then-Met Police constable Wayne Couzens. The force has faced repeated accusations of racial bias in its use of stop-and-search powers and was hit with criticism over the security of Wembley stadium during the final of the Euro 2020 championships. Since the start of the year, both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the home secretary havepublicly backed Dame Cressida. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The appointment of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service is a formal process which will be confirmed in the proper way."" The mayor of London and Met Police have declined to comment.

Morrisons warns driver shortage will raise prices,"Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it expects the UK's lorry driver shortage to push up prices this year. It said the lack of drivers, plus higher freight charges and commodity prices, could lead to higher prices. However, it said it would seek to mitigate those and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred in maintaining good product availability. Transport secretary Grant Shapps said the UK must ""stand on its own two feet"" and not rely on EU drivers. Speaking after Morrisons reported its latest trading figures, Mr Shapps rejected calls for more immigration to resolve the problem. ""We have to stand on our own two feet as the United Kingdom. There are a lot of people coming off furlough. I look forward to them getting jobs."" Lorry driver shortages have have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000. Mr Shapps said: ""To say this is an issue of Brexit is completely untrue. What it is about - is coronavirus."" He pointed to the global driver shortage in the US, Poland and Germany and said the UK was not alone in having supply chain problems. The transport secretary confirmed that someHGV driver tests would be fast-tracked. Morrisons and its rivals have seen gaps on shelves due to the driver shortage. Last month, it joined a growing chorus in the food and drink industry calling for government help to recruit lorry drivers. Chief executive David Potts indicated HGV drivers should be eligible forSkilled Worker visas,external, allowing them to work in the UK. The firm's latest comments came as it reported first-half results, showing a profit before tax and exceptional items of Â£105m in the six months to 1 August, down from Â£167m in the same period last year. Morrisons calls for action on lorry driver dearth Morrisons backs US firm's improved takeover offer Morrisons is currently at the centre of a takeover battle between two US private equity firms. In its results statement, it reiterated that it had received offers for the company from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) and Fortress and was recommending CD&R's offer of 285p per share. Shareholders will be asked to approve this offer at a meeting to be held in or around the week beginning 18 October, it added. However, as neither bidder has said their offer is final, Morrisons said on Wednesday that it was in talks with CD&R, Fortress and the Takeover Panel about an auction to decide its future. It said any auction would take place before the planned shareholder meetings, on a date to be announced by the Takeover Panel. Morrisons said the whole British food industry was facing continued challenges from Covid-19 and sustained supply chain cost increases, which were largely outside its control. However, it added that it was working to address those challenges and that second-half profit was expected to be considerably higher than in the first half. We expect some industry-wide retail price inflation during the second half, driven by sustained recent commodity price increases and freight inflation, and the current shortage of HGV drivers,"" it said. ""We will seek to mitigate these and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred to maintain good on-shelf availability."" Chairman Andrew Higginson said the whole Morrisons team had shown ""commendable resilience facing into a variety of continuing challenges during the first half, including the ongoing pandemic, disruption at some of our partner suppliers and the impact on our supply chain of HGV driver shortages"". ""As we approach our busiest time of year, I'm confident the team will continue to rise to all challenges and keep up all the good work to improve the shopping trip for customers,"" he added. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Morrisons, like all supermarkets, had faced the challenge of maintaining customer interest and sales as non-essential retail reopened after the pandemic and life returned to some kind of normality. ""But those roadblocks haven't stopped the retailer from shining,"" she added. ""The ongoing bidding war for the UK's fourth-largest grocer has proved that a growing online presence often satisfies the appetite of hungry investors. ""Having cemented an important relationship as a key supplier and partner to Amazon, and to McColl's convenience stores, Morrisons has triggered a bidding war among private equity firms in the US, who are more concerned with the lucrative property portfolio which the store network possesses than what's on the shelves.""

EasyJet rejects bid and seeks to raise more money,"EasyJet has rejected a takeover approach and announced plans to raise Â£1.2bn from shareholders to help its recovery from the pandemic. The airline said the unsolicited bid undervalued the company and the unnamed suitor was now no longer interested. Bloomberg reported,externalthat the bidder was rival Wizz Air, although it declined to comment. EasyJet's boss said the fundraising would allow the firm ""to accelerate our postâCovidâ19 recovery plan"" instead. The carrier has alreadyraised emergency funds during the crisis, having been affected by Covid-related travel restrictions. EasyJet also plans to raise $400m (Â£290m) in debt. The company said on Thursday it was ""well-placed to emerge from the pandemic"", but the additional cash would provide a buffer should further coronavirus-related lockdowns delay the airline's recovery. It has lost more than Â£2bn as many flights were grounded during the coronavirus crisis and it slumped to its first-ever loss in its 25-year history as a result. Amber list travel is legal, says EasyJet boss Ryanair predicts rapid rebound in airline travel BA warns of serious cost problems as furlough ends EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren has spoken out in favour of reducing the costs of Covid tests required for travel, in order to get customers booking again and the aviation industry back on its feet. On Thursday, he said the funds raised through the share sale would strengthen the airline's balance sheet. He added it would also position the firm for growth as the aviation industry in Europe emerges from the pandemic, saying that the airline had seen a spike in customer demand where restrictions have been lifted. EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren has previously spoken out about expensive PCR tests Looking ahead, the company plans to fly 57% of its 2019 capacity between July and September, ""with a continued focus on profitable flying"". It also said it would try to grow its sales through the launch of new products such as EasyJet Holidays, as well as a ""standard plus"" fare. The airline is in the midst of a huge cost-cutting programme, which it said was set to deliver about Â£500m of savings in the financial year to 30 September. Despite this, the carrier took the decision to review and reject the takeover approach from an unnamed potential buyer. The board said that the all-share offer ""fundamentally undervalued"" the business and was ""highly conditional"". EasyJet shares sank in early trade on the London Stock Exchange on the news,down nearly 8% at 728p. However, Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There is some potential upside to consider. ""Legacy carriers may pare down some of their routes indefinitely, leaving space for EasyJet to up its presence at major airports. The group couldn't do this without an injection of cash and promised shareholders that at least some of the funds are earmarked for this purpose. She said that although the move was ""risky"", it could pay off if EasyJet was able to expand its presence into more profitable travel routes. Mr Lundgren said during a call with journalists on Thursday that the firm was in a good position to buy more landing slots as other rival airlines rein in their short-haul operations. ""I believe this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" he said. All airline bosses have fretted over one issue since the start of the pandemic - do they have sufficient financial reserves to carry them through to when passengers finally return? It was an almost impossible question to answer, as no-one knew how long the pandemic would last. EasyJet thought it had done enough last June, when it boosted its bank lending facilities and in addition asked shareholders to stump up Â£450m. Now, like Oliver Twist, the company is asking for more, tapping investors for Â£1.2bn. It is not only about making good the losses racked up in the past year; it is also, the company says, about positioning it to take advantage of what it believes will be a shake-out of the aviation industry in the coming months. It wants to have sufficient firepower to take advantage of ""a range of long-term strategic and investment opportunities"" that it expects to arise. Some may regard EasyJet itself as the investment opportunity. The company also disclosed this morning that it had received an unsolicited takeover approach, which the board had rejected.

LiveLiveRio Ferdinand tells MPs about online hate and racism2 minutes ago,"A joint committee of MPs and Peers is examining the government's Online Safety Bill Former England captain Rio Ferdinand gave evidence to MPs and Peers about the government's draft Online Safety Bill The ex-Manchester United player told MPs abuse online is ""normalising"" racist behaviour with ""no repercussions"" And he described how he had to explain to his children why people use the monkey emoji The government's proposed new laws would set up new rules to tackle harmful online content Other witnesses who gave evidence were Imran Ahmed, from Centre for Countering Digital Hate, chair of Kick It Out Sanjay Bhandari, and Edleen John from the FA Nancy Kelley the CEO of Stonewall and Danny Stone MBE, the Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust are also gave evidence Paul Seddon, Richard Morris and Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Thanks for following along with us today. Goodbye. This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand: 'I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids' In response to suggestions earlier from Imran Ahmed that Facebook ""doesn't want to look for harm on their site to avoid then having to become responsible for it"", a spokesperson for the company said: âFacebook
has long called for new rules to set high standards across the internet. ""We
already have strict policies against harmful content on our platforms, but
regulations are needed so that private companies arenât making so many
important decisions alone. ""While we know we have more to do, our
industry-leading transparency reports show we are removing more harmful content
before anyone reports it to us.â The penultimate question comes from Suzanne Webb who asks the panel if they think online platforms understand the scale of the work they need to do once the bill comes in to law. Nancy Kelley replies: ""I think they know the scale of the problem better than anyone sitting in this room. Whether they know the scale of the work required for them to address the problem, I'm not sure."" Danny Stone says: ""I think they are having a bit of an internal debate about it. I think some probably understand and know what's coming"" But he adds: ""I think that, in some cases they are going to get a bit of a shock"" He ends by saying he thinks that the government's Online Safety Bill is a ""great piece of legislation trying to set an international standard - that has to be welcomed."" Baroness Kidron asks what Danny Stone's views are on offensive material and rules from different social media providers. Danny Stone says sometimes the BBFC - which classifies films and video content - may ban a film in the UK, but it is most likely still available somewhere online and in dark corners of the internet, but it is about limiting the audience to a harmful film. This, he says, is how he views trying to regulate abuse on popular social media websites, that there should be a minimum standard which he says should be set by Parliament, ""not Mark Zuckerberg"". John The SNP's John Nicolson asks the panel how seriously social media platforms take the issue of online abuse. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says she thinks platforms are genuinely concerned at a ""generalised level"" - but this isn't always reflected in how they regulate content on their sites. Mr Nicolson introduces a story of his own - saying that as a gay man he was once called a ""greasy bender"" on Twitter. ""Most people would accept it crosses a line"" he says. But he adds that when he reported the abuse, the firm told him the post did not breach its community guidelines. He says he went back and forward ""two or three times"" with the company ""but absolutely nothing happened"". ""They know I am a Member of Parliament, they know I sit on this committee.  If they are prepared to behave with such utter disdain to somebody with a wee bit of influence, can you imagine the disdain for the average LGBT person."" Nancy Kelley says: ""We don't have to imagine it - we can see it."" Conservative Dean Russell asks if organisations see removing anonymity as the easiest way to tackle ""cross-pollination"" of hatred from different groups. Danny Stone says ""this isn't really addressed"" in the bill at the moment. He says social media platforms should be legally liable where data to identify a social media user cannot be used. There are ""various reasons"" why people might want to keep anonymity, he says, but there should be an appropriate middle measure to allow some people to keep anonymous accounts where it is necessary. Nancy Kelley says these platforms can identify anonymous abusive accounts and delete them - they just don't. She says Stonewall has ""deep concerns"" for LGBT people around the world if social media companies insist on people using real names. ""Even in very liberal, accepting environments, [publishing names] increases the danger to our community"", she tells MPs. 90% of LGBT social media users in Egypt, Lebanon and Iran are reluctant to share their names even on social media private messages for fear of legal repercussions. She says in Egypt in particular, authorities are known to use online sting operations where they try to find gay men using social media so they can arrest them. Conservative MP Dean Russell asks the panel whether social media firms are reflecting an increase in abuse within society, or contributing to it. Danny Stone, director at the Antisemitism Policy Trust, says platforms ""facilitate the spread"" of hatred. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says it is important not to ""confuse"" the situation online with wider attitudes towards LGBT people, which she says have improved over the last 50 years. But she says social media can ""radicalise"" people's views, and ""enables"" a minority of people to spread abuse. The panel is asked about the issue of getting information about the scale of abuse from social media firms. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says there is an ""absence of high-quality studies"" - although some studies do exist. She says the regulator should be able to require firms to hand over relevant data. Danny Stone from the Antisemitism Policy Trust says there is ""some data out there"" - and points to some data collected by the European Union. He adds though that he has been trying to persuade one social media firm to give him a PowerPoint slide they use in training sessions for ten years, but although it has been promised he is yet to receive it. Nancy Kelly, the CEO of Stonewall Nancy Kelly, chief executive of Stonewall, says that existing legislation does not really account for abuse online, she says much legislation against homophobic and transphobic abuse are made for workplaces and face-to-face interactions. She says introducing duties of care for social media companies is something Stonewall is fully behind. She adds that the LGBT community suffers direct insults, forced outing and identifying where people live (otherwise known as ""doxing""). Some people may have to move house or change jobs as a result of these instances. Danny Stone MBE, director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust says offline and online abuse is ""similarly connected"". He says there have been anti-Semitic murders and anti-Semitic manifestoes shared by extremists shared online. He adds that he does not post any pictures of his children online as there is a chance someone might want to hurt his children because of the work he does. Smaller social platforms can disseminate false information about LGBT people in the same way they can share anti-Semitic misinformation, Ms Kelly adds. Danny Stone MBE, Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust The committee is now taking evidence from the final panel. Nancy Kelley, is the chief executive of Stonewall, and Danny Stone MBE, is director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust. Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Sanjay Bhandari, the chair
of Kick It Out, suggested that one of the key things the government can do
to to force tech firms to deal with racist abuse on their platforms is to set
up a code of practice around the reach of anonymous accounts. The bill currently deals primarily with content
moderation - how the tech platforms deal with hate speech after it has been
posted. But MPs also ask if they need to consider ways to make those
behind abuse more accountable a key part of the legislation. There was consensus that there is a lack of data
about who the hateful posters are, and that is something that the regulator
needs to audit, all panellists agreed. But Mr Bhandari also raised on the biggest
issues facing regulators when he told MPs if that ""if I was being
continuously punched in the face, then arresting someone is good but I also want
them to stop them punching me in the first place."" How to stop people
posting hateful comments is sadly probably a job both beyond the reach of Ofcom
or the tech firms. Edleen John says the international football community is ""looking at us, and the opportunity we have to put in place the first piece of legislation that can become a blueprint for other organisations and other countries as well. Chair of the committee Damian Collins ends this section of the hearing by asking Ms John what discussions are being held an executive level with football's governing bodies such as Uefa and Fifa. She says: ""We absolutely have conversations right to the top of the organisations around discrimination, around online abuse, around sanctions and around what we can do as a collective to make it clear that this isn't something that we want in our game, and our game is for all."" Conservative peer Lord Gilbert goes back to the issue of the responsibility in the bill on social media companies to remove content that is not legal but ""harmful"". He asks whether ""harmful"" should be defined in the bill, or whether the definition of what is illegal should simply be widened instead. Sanjay Bhandari, chair at anti-racism group Kick it Out, says he doesn't favour either approach. He says if what is ""harmful"" is defined in the bill, then it will have to be continually updated with new legislation to reflect new forms of abuse. He says instead, a regulator - in this case, Ofcom - should be given powers to make the decision, reflecting contemporary social views on morals. John Nicolson asks about homophobia in football. Rio Ferdinand says he recently met a footballer who had come out as gay, and his lawyer had advised him not to because of the pressure and emotional toll it could take on him. Mr Nicolson asks what message it sends to young gay disadvantaged teenagers if a wealthy footballer cannot come out as gay. Rio Ferdinand says ""the amount of eyeballs"" and press attention ""is so much bigger"" than in other sports. Rio Ferdinand continue saying that previously racism had ""got better"" but had never ""gone away"". But now racists are ""empowered"" by seeing others do the same online. Sanjay Bhandari says that social media companies need to be compelled to share all data that they have available on an account. Edleen John says that quite often, data shared by social media companies is not complete, and their own investigations will point to a completely different type of person sharing the abuse. SNP MP John Nicolson asks who the panel who would throw a banana or send money emojis to footballers. Rio Ferdinand replies: ""Sometimes it's young school boys ranging ages 13, 14 years old, sometimes younger. Or maybe an estate agent or a banker. ""Really it is from all different types. You can't just pinpoint one type of person from a certain particular background and say that is the actual stereotypical racist who's putting this abuse online or at stadiums or wherever. It's a very varied demographic demographic of people. John Nicolson asks what lessons can be learned how to tackle it. Ferdinand says the landscape is very different now. ""I think with social media, we've never been in this in this area, this time is very different. He says anonymity online is ""the big difference"". ""The fact that you can be anonymous online, gives you a certain amount of power - it enables you to puff your chest out, and be able to really say what you really feel, especially compounded with the fact that there's no repercussions, at the moment"". In 2018, Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a banana skin thrown in his direction as he celebrated scoring in front of Tottenham fans at the Emirates Stadium. Edleen
John says she backs one of the key elements in the bill - that firms should not just be responsible for taking down posts that are illegal, but also ""harmful"". She says she recognises ""how difficult it is"" to define precisely what content this should cover. But she adds that Parliament is a ""better place to define this"" than in the boardrooms of social media companies. Labour peer Lord Knight asks the panel whether the bill should ""do more"" on education. Edleen John from the Football Association says education is ""absolutely one part of it"" and will be important in trying to combat racism in the younger generations. But she says the ""responsibility at the moment"" should be on holding social media firms to account. She says this includes making sure the platforms do not ""amplify"" the racism present online - and that education is not used as an excuse to deviate from this aim. Â© 2025 BBC.

Critics urge PM to replace Met Police commissioner,"Dame Cressida Dick became the first woman to lead the Metropolitan Police when she was appointed in 2017 Victims of police injustice are calling for the prime minister to replace Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick when her contract comes to an end in April. In an open letter, they accuse her of ""presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover-up"". The BBC understands Dame Cressida, 60, has been offered a two-year extension and that negotiations are ongoing. Since her appointment in 2017, she has been involved in several controversies. Two of the seven who signed the letter,published in the Daily Mail,external, are Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephenwas murdered in a racist attack,external, and Lady Brittan, whose home was raided when her husband Lord Brittanwas falsely accused of child abuse. PM 'has complete confidence' in Met Police boss Met Police chief: 'I'm a bit different' The others include Alastair Morgan, whose brother Daniel was murdered in 1987 - the killer remains unidentified and a report into the caseaccused the force of institutional corruptionand sparked denials from the Met's leadership - and the son of D-Day Army officer Lord Bramall,who was falsely accusedof child sexual abuse by thepaedophile and fantasist Carl Beech. BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini,who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, and the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor -another victim of Beech's false allegations- are also signatories, as is Sir Edward Heath's biographer Michael McManus. The former prime minister was another public figuresmeared by Beech. This video can not be played Paul Gambaccini: ""The Metropolitan Police have obfuscated the truth from the people of this country"" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Mr Proctor said it was ""utterly extraordinary"" the government should contemplate extending Dame Cressida's tenure ""even for a day, let alone two years"". He said the letter's signatories were linked by their common experiences of police malpractice over a number of years, and they had come up with no reason why the chief commissioner ""who has failed and failed and failed"" should be given an extension. ""There must be other chief commissioners outside of London who'd be prepared to do the job and do it a great deal better, with integrity and without cover-up after cover-up. ""I personally believe she should have resigned months ago. I'm not fighting for myself, I'm fighting for the future so that it won't happen to anyone else. ""And it could happen to someone else if changes are not made at the top of the Metropolitan Police. No-one has been held responsible for the problems Operation Midland [the Carl Beech allegations investigation] created. ""The commissioner even got a damehood - quite outrageous."" Harvey Proctor said Dame Cressida should have resigned months ago Mr Proctor said he received an apology in person from Lord Hogan-Howe, Dame Cressida's predecessor, who was the Met's chief commissioner while Beech's allegations were treated as ""credible and true"", but he rejected an apology from Dame Cressida because ""her words and actions did not go hand in hand"". ""I call on the prime minister and the home secretary to meet with all seven of us to hear our experiences - and I would defy them then to continue with any extension of her remit."" Mr Gambaccini, who sued the Met over the way it dealt with accusations against him, said Dame Cressida postponed the case for as long as possible in what he described as ""three and a half years of non-honesty"". Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire, he also said that he and his fellow signatories ""all found that the leadership of the Metropolitan Police is breathtakingly corrupt"". He accused both the chief commissioner and the force of misleading the public. Lady Brittan, the widow of Lord Brittan, is among those calling for Dame Cressida's tenure to end As the first female Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick was bound to be well received when she was appointed in 2017. It was the job she had always wanted and it meant a return to the force where she had spent most of her career and where she was popular with the rank and file. Some of the criticism now being levelled at her relates to her time at Scotland Yard before she was in the top job. In 2014 as an assistant commissioner she was in charge of the team involved in Operation Midland - the disastrous long-running inquiry into an alleged VIP paedophile ring. When Midland collapsed and the complainant, Carl Beech, was exposed as a serial liar, criticism was levelled at a number of officers including one detective who had initially described Beech's story as ""credible and true"". Cressida Dick admitted that she had heard the officer say this on the radio and had done nothing to correct it. The former MP Harvey Proctor, who lost his job and his home as a result of being falsely accused by Carl Beech, is one of the seven signatories to the letter saying that Dame Cressida must not have her contract extended. He, like the others, does not believe that over the past four years she has displayed the right characteristics to remain in the role. Doreen, now Baroness, Lawrence is the first name on the letter. She says she is unhappy that the commissioner has closed her son's murder inquiry and, as a lifelong race campaigner, she is also concerned about the Met's use of stop and search. The signatories were brought together by the Daily Mail, which has been calling for Cressida Dick to go. The commissioner recently described herself as an honourable person. The question now is whether she will want to accept a two-year extension. Mr Gambaccini also criticised the BBC for its reporting of his case, accusing it of being on the ""side of wrongdoers"". He has previously described the corporation as ""the worst employer in the world"", alleging that no senior managers were in touch with him during his time under investigation by the Met Police. The BBC said it had no comment to make. In February 2017, Dame Cressida became the first woman to lead London's force since its inception in 1829. Her appointment wascriticised at the time by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly shot dead during an operation she led in 2005. Now Dame Cressida is coming to the end of a five-year contract, Home Secretary Priti Patel has consulted with London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Downing Street over the decision to ask her to stay on for two more years, according to media reports. Protesters demonstrate outside Scotland Yard over the treatment of people by police at the Sarah Everard vigil The Met commissioner resisted pressure on her to resign in March when the force came under scrutiny over thehandling of a vigil held in memory of Sarah Everard,the marketing executive murdered by then-Met Police constable Wayne Couzens. The force has faced repeated accusations of racial bias in its use of stop-and-search powers and was hit with criticism over the security of Wembley stadium during the final of the Euro 2020 championships. Since the start of the year, both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the home secretary havepublicly backed Dame Cressida. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The appointment of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service is a formal process which will be confirmed in the proper way."" The mayor of London and Met Police have declined to comment.

LiveLiveCampaigners share experience of online hate and racism7 minutes ago,"A joint committee of MPs and Peers is examining the government's Online Safety Bill Former England captain Rio Ferdinand gave evidence to MPs and Peers about the government's draft Online Safety Bill The ex-Manchester United player told MPs abuse online is ""normalising"" racist behaviour with ""no repercussions"" And he described how he had to explain to his children why people use the monkey emoji The government's proposed new laws would set up new rules to tackle harmful online content Other witnesses who gave evidence were Imran Ahmed, from Centre for Countering Digital Hate, chair of Kick It Out Sanjay Bhandari, and Edleen John from the FA Nancy Kelley the CEO of Stonewall and Danny Stone MBE, the Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust are also gave evidence Paul Seddon, Richard Morris and Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Thanks for following along with us today. Goodbye. This video can not be played Rio Ferdinand: 'I have to explain the monkey emoji to my kids' In response to suggestions earlier from Imran Ahmed that Facebook ""doesn't want to look for harm on their site to avoid then having to become responsible for it"", a spokesperson for the company said: âFacebook
has long called for new rules to set high standards across the internet. ""We
already have strict policies against harmful content on our platforms, but
regulations are needed so that private companies arenât making so many
important decisions alone. ""While we know we have more to do, our
industry-leading transparency reports show we are removing more harmful content
before anyone reports it to us.â The penultimate question comes from Suzanne Webb who asks the panel if they think online platforms understand the scale of the work they need to do once the bill comes in to law. Nancy Kelley replies: ""I think they know the scale of the problem better than anyone sitting in this room. Whether they know the scale of the work required for them to address the problem, I'm not sure."" Danny Stone says: ""I think they are having a bit of an internal debate about it. I think some probably understand and know what's coming"" But he adds: ""I think that, in some cases they are going to get a bit of a shock"" He ends by saying he thinks that the government's Online Safety Bill is a ""great piece of legislation trying to set an international standard - that has to be welcomed."" Baroness Kidron asks what Danny Stone's views are on offensive material and rules from different social media providers. Danny Stone says sometimes the BBFC - which classifies films and video content - may ban a film in the UK, but it is most likely still available somewhere online and in dark corners of the internet, but it is about limiting the audience to a harmful film. This, he says, is how he views trying to regulate abuse on popular social media websites, that there should be a minimum standard which he says should be set by Parliament, ""not Mark Zuckerberg"". John The SNP's John Nicolson asks the panel how seriously social media platforms take the issue of online abuse. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says she thinks platforms are genuinely concerned at a ""generalised level"" - but this isn't always reflected in how they regulate content on their sites. Mr Nicolson introduces a story of his own - saying that as a gay man he was once called a ""greasy bender"" on Twitter. ""Most people would accept it crosses a line"" he says. But he adds that when he reported the abuse, the firm told him the post did not breach its community guidelines. He says he went back and forward ""two or three times"" with the company ""but absolutely nothing happened"". ""They know I am a Member of Parliament, they know I sit on this committee.  If they are prepared to behave with such utter disdain to somebody with a wee bit of influence, can you imagine the disdain for the average LGBT person."" Nancy Kelley says: ""We don't have to imagine it - we can see it."" Conservative Dean Russell asks if organisations see removing anonymity as the easiest way to tackle ""cross-pollination"" of hatred from different groups. Danny Stone says ""this isn't really addressed"" in the bill at the moment. He says social media platforms should be legally liable where data to identify a social media user cannot be used. There are ""various reasons"" why people might want to keep anonymity, he says, but there should be an appropriate middle measure to allow some people to keep anonymous accounts where it is necessary. Nancy Kelley says these platforms can identify anonymous abusive accounts and delete them - they just don't. She says Stonewall has ""deep concerns"" for LGBT people around the world if social media companies insist on people using real names. ""Even in very liberal, accepting environments, [publishing names] increases the danger to our community"", she tells MPs. 90% of LGBT social media users in Egypt, Lebanon and Iran are reluctant to share their names even on social media private messages for fear of legal repercussions. She says in Egypt in particular, authorities are known to use online sting operations where they try to find gay men using social media so they can arrest them. Conservative MP Dean Russell asks the panel whether social media firms are reflecting an increase in abuse within society, or contributing to it. Danny Stone, director at the Antisemitism Policy Trust, says platforms ""facilitate the spread"" of hatred. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says it is important not to ""confuse"" the situation online with wider attitudes towards LGBT people, which she says have improved over the last 50 years. But she says social media can ""radicalise"" people's views, and ""enables"" a minority of people to spread abuse. The panel is asked about the issue of getting information about the scale of abuse from social media firms. Nancy Kelley from Stonewall says there is an ""absence of high-quality studies"" - although some studies do exist. She says the regulator should be able to require firms to hand over relevant data. Danny Stone from the Antisemitism Policy Trust says there is ""some data out there"" - and points to some data collected by the European Union. He adds though that he has been trying to persuade one social media firm to give him a PowerPoint slide they use in training sessions for ten years, but although it has been promised he is yet to receive it. Nancy Kelly, the CEO of Stonewall Nancy Kelly, chief executive of Stonewall, says that existing legislation does not really account for abuse online, she says much legislation against homophobic and transphobic abuse are made for workplaces and face-to-face interactions. She says introducing duties of care for social media companies is something Stonewall is fully behind. She adds that the LGBT community suffers direct insults, forced outing and identifying where people live (otherwise known as ""doxing""). Some people may have to move house or change jobs as a result of these instances. Danny Stone MBE, director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust says offline and online abuse is ""similarly connected"". He says there have been anti-Semitic murders and anti-Semitic manifestoes shared by extremists shared online. He adds that he does not post any pictures of his children online as there is a chance someone might want to hurt his children because of the work he does. Smaller social platforms can disseminate false information about LGBT people in the same way they can share anti-Semitic misinformation, Ms Kelly adds. Danny Stone MBE, Director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust The committee is now taking evidence from the final panel. Nancy Kelley, is the chief executive of Stonewall, and Danny Stone MBE, is director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust. Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Sanjay Bhandari, the chair
of Kick It Out, suggested that one of the key things the government can do
to to force tech firms to deal with racist abuse on their platforms is to set
up a code of practice around the reach of anonymous accounts. The bill currently deals primarily with content
moderation - how the tech platforms deal with hate speech after it has been
posted. But MPs also ask if they need to consider ways to make those
behind abuse more accountable a key part of the legislation. There was consensus that there is a lack of data
about who the hateful posters are, and that is something that the regulator
needs to audit, all panellists agreed. But Mr Bhandari also raised on the biggest
issues facing regulators when he told MPs if that ""if I was being
continuously punched in the face, then arresting someone is good but I also want
them to stop them punching me in the first place."" How to stop people
posting hateful comments is sadly probably a job both beyond the reach of Ofcom
or the tech firms. Edleen John says the international football community is ""looking at us, and the opportunity we have to put in place the first piece of legislation that can become a blueprint for other organisations and other countries as well. Chair of the committee Damian Collins ends this section of the hearing by asking Ms John what discussions are being held an executive level with football's governing bodies such as Uefa and Fifa. She says: ""We absolutely have conversations right to the top of the organisations around discrimination, around online abuse, around sanctions and around what we can do as a collective to make it clear that this isn't something that we want in our game, and our game is for all."" Conservative peer Lord Gilbert goes back to the issue of the responsibility in the bill on social media companies to remove content that is not legal but ""harmful"". He asks whether ""harmful"" should be defined in the bill, or whether the definition of what is illegal should simply be widened instead. Sanjay Bhandari, chair at anti-racism group Kick it Out, says he doesn't favour either approach. He says if what is ""harmful"" is defined in the bill, then it will have to be continually updated with new legislation to reflect new forms of abuse. He says instead, a regulator - in this case, Ofcom - should be given powers to make the decision, reflecting contemporary social views on morals. John Nicolson asks about homophobia in football. Rio Ferdinand says he recently met a footballer who had come out as gay, and his lawyer had advised him not to because of the pressure and emotional toll it could take on him. Mr Nicolson asks what message it sends to young gay disadvantaged teenagers if a wealthy footballer cannot come out as gay. Rio Ferdinand says ""the amount of eyeballs"" and press attention ""is so much bigger"" than in other sports. Rio Ferdinand continue saying that previously racism had ""got better"" but had never ""gone away"". But now racists are ""empowered"" by seeing others do the same online. Sanjay Bhandari says that social media companies need to be compelled to share all data that they have available on an account. Edleen John says that quite often, data shared by social media companies is not complete, and their own investigations will point to a completely different type of person sharing the abuse. SNP MP John Nicolson asks who the panel who would throw a banana or send money emojis to footballers. Rio Ferdinand replies: ""Sometimes it's young school boys ranging ages 13, 14 years old, sometimes younger. Or maybe an estate agent or a banker. ""Really it is from all different types. You can't just pinpoint one type of person from a certain particular background and say that is the actual stereotypical racist who's putting this abuse online or at stadiums or wherever. It's a very varied demographic demographic of people. John Nicolson asks what lessons can be learned how to tackle it. Ferdinand says the landscape is very different now. ""I think with social media, we've never been in this in this area, this time is very different. He says anonymity online is ""the big difference"". ""The fact that you can be anonymous online, gives you a certain amount of power - it enables you to puff your chest out, and be able to really say what you really feel, especially compounded with the fact that there's no repercussions, at the moment"". In 2018, Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a banana skin thrown in his direction as he celebrated scoring in front of Tottenham fans at the Emirates Stadium. Edleen
John says she backs one of the key elements in the bill - that firms should not just be responsible for taking down posts that are illegal, but also ""harmful"". She says she recognises ""how difficult it is"" to define precisely what content this should cover. But she adds that Parliament is a ""better place to define this"" than in the boardrooms of social media companies. Labour peer Lord Knight asks the panel whether the bill should ""do more"" on education. Edleen John from the Football Association says education is ""absolutely one part of it"" and will be important in trying to combat racism in the younger generations. But she says the ""responsibility at the moment"" should be on holding social media firms to account. She says this includes making sure the platforms do not ""amplify"" the racism present online - and that education is not used as an excuse to deviate from this aim. Â© 2025 BBC.

DUP leader Donaldson to issue NI Protocol warning,"This video can not be played ""A choice between the political institutions and Protocol"" The Democratic Unionist Party may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its demands over the Northern Ireland Protocol are not met, its leader has suggested. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson also said he feared a returnto the loyalist street violence seen earlier in the yearunless the issue was resolved. He said his party would also now boycott most north-south ministerial meetings. He said relations could not be ""business as usual"". Most Stormont parties criticised the speech while theEU's Brexit negotiator called for calm. During his speech in Belfast, Sir Jeffrey said it would be clear ""within weeks"" if there was a basis for the assembly and executive to continue, or if an election was needed. ""I say not as a threat, but as a matter of political reality, that our political institutions will not survive a failure to resolve the problems that the protocol has created,"" Sir Jeffrey said. ""Neither will they survive an indefinite 'stand still' period; urgent action is needed."" He also said DUP ministers would resign from their posts rather than implement further border checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. ""If in the final analysis those who are democratically elected by the people of Northern Ireland lack the power to prevent such checks, and the protocol issues remain, then the position in office of DUP Ministers would become untenable,"" Sir Jeffrey added. The protocol is part of the UK government's Brexit deal with the European Union. It keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods to ensure free trade across the Irish border. However, it has led to additional checks on goods being traded across the Irish Sea, which has drawn criticism and protests from unionists. Not all the checks have been implemented due to what are known as grace periods. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson laid it out pretty clearly today. His message for the government was blunt -  you can either have the political institutions or the protocol - you can't have both. In terms of the mechanics of how you bring down government in Northern Ireland, essentially what has to happen is that the first minister or deputy first minister needs to resign. There then is a period of seven days, and if the positions are not filled within that period, it's over to the secretary of state who has to set a date within a reasonable period of time for an election. However, we know from James Brokenshire's time as secretary of state, that a reasonable period can last for months and months on end. There's no guarantee that if the DUP walk away from government that we will end up in an election within a matter of weeks. The smart money would suggest that Brandon Lewis may well take the view that there is no point in calling an election when we have one already scheduled for next May. Earlier this week theUK government indefinitely extended the grace periodswhich it said was necessary to create space for further talks with the EU. Sir Jeffrey's speech came as theEuropean Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic began a two-day visit to Northern Irelandfor talks with business and political leaders. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, said he believed in devolution and wanted to return to the assembly as an assembly member (MLA). He said he wanted to provide a ""window of opportunity"" to find a solution and expressed concern there could be a return to disorder on Northern Ireland's streets ""unless we grapple with this issue"". EU's Sefcovic to discuss protocol on NI visit The DUP leader outlined four steps his party would take, including an end to its engagement with north-south bodies, except for co-operation on health matters. The north-south arrangements, provisioned for by the Good Friday Agreement, feature six all-Ireland bodies, with responsibility for matters such as waterways and food standards, which operate under the policy direction of the North-South Ministerial Council. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin (left) and Tanaiste Leo Varadkar attended a meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in July It is comprised of ministers from both sides of the border. Ministers from Northern Ireland are required to attend under the Ministerial Code of office. The DUP attended the last meeting of the council in July. Sir Jeffrey said this was done ""as an act of good faith"" but issues remain unresolved. ""Therefore, as the protocol issues remain unresolved, the DUP will immediately withdraw from the structures of Strand Two of the Belfast Agreement relating to north south arrangements, while we will ensure important health related matters continue to be addressed on a cooperative basis,"" he said. Sir Jeffrey also outlined that DUP ministers would ""seek to block additional checks at the ports"" and would examine the legality of the current checks and ""whether they should have required executive approval"". The DUP leader also explained his executive team would ""seek to frustrate and prevent"" alignment between NI Assembly legislation and laws passed by the EU. What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Further delays confirmed for Irish Sea border checks ""Let me be clear if the choice is ultimately between remaining in office or implementing the protocol in its present form, then the only option for any unionist minister would be to cease to hold such office,"" he said. ""Time is short and consequences will follow. ""The prize of a successful outcome is not just for unionism, but for all of Northern Ireland and it is not just for the UK, but for the EU as well."" Sir Jeffery said he feared a return to street violence in loyalist areas witnessed in April. ""Since the start of July, the streets have been quieter in terms of violence, but I fear that unless we grapple with this issue, this will prove to be merely a pause, rather than an end to the disorder,"" he said. He echoed this view in an interview later with the BBC's Political Thinking podcast with Nick Robinson. ""If politics fails ... then I fear there will be others who may decide to step into the gap,"" he said. He went on to say that he and other community leaders had ""been saying to the boys on the streets please don't be on the streets"" and that as a result, Northern Ireland had been peaceful ""all summer"". A DUP withdrawal from its executive roles, including first minister, would not automatically trigger an assembly election, however, it would begin the process. Given the joint nature of the office, First Minister Paul Givan's departure would also remove Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill as Deputy First Minister. This would then start a seven-day process for the parties to agree to fresh nominations.. If this did not happen, NI Secretary Brandon Lewis would be responsible for calling an election within a ""reasonable"" timeframe. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said the speech had ""created new challenges"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said it was a ""reckless, irresponsible and short-sighted election stunt"". She said the DUP was ""clearly in panic mode, driven by poor opinion polls"" and are ""focused on their own narrow self-interest"". UUP leader Doug Beattie said his party shared the DUP's concerns about the protocol but it would be a ""bad idea"" to collapse Stormont SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""naive in the extreme"" and that the DUP leader had ""offered no solutions"". ""I think it is very dangerous when people are languishing on waiting lists and we're dealing with a global pandemic, we have people playing indulgent games that are more about polls than protocols,"" he told BBC NI's The Nolan Show. Alliance Party leader and Stormont Justice Minister Naomi Long said there was a need for ""pragmatic solutions"" to protocol matters rather than for ""people to escalate this into a constitutional crisis"". Naomi Long said Sir Jeffrey should offer solutions for the parties to debate Mrs Long described Sir Jeffrey's address as ""cynical party posturing to try and recover perceived electoral losses because of polling"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said his party shared the DUP's concerns about the protocol, but that it would be a ""bad idea"" to collapse Stormont. ""The problem is we do need to have some sort of a treaty which deals with the issues between the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he said. On Tuesday, the UUPpublished a paper detailing its recommendations,external""for a common-sense solution to the problems created by the protocol"". It included provisions for a new criminal offence ""to knowingly export goods designed for the UK internal market into the EU single market"". Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said Sir Jeffrey's speech included ""some fine words"", but ""it is actions that count"". Simon Coveney, the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, said unionist concerns about the protocol had been ""taken seriously"", but ""no positive agenda is served by blocking practical north-south co-operation or by the breakdown of the other institutions of the Good Friday Agreement"". ""The EU is already listening closely to concerns in Northern Ireland and is ready to work in good faith to minimise friction,"" he continued.

Mandatory Covid jabs for health staff considered,"Compulsory Covid and flu jabs for frontline NHS and care workers in England are being considered in a government consultation. Plans are already in place to make it mandatory for care home workers in England to be fully vaccinated. But some unions and care organisations have warned that making the jabs mandatory will lead to staff shortages. Health Secretary Sajid Javid is urging all health service workers to get both jabs to protect vulnerable patients. About 88% of NHS trust staff have received two Covid doses, but in some trusts that falls to 78%, figures show. In the UK, more than 30,000 new daily cases have been reported for nine days in a row and the number of people in hospital with the disease is rising. Will I get a booster jab this autumn? Doctors urge MPs to take action on flu jab delay MPs back compulsory vaccines for care home staff What did the government do about care homes and coronavirus? The six-week consultation process will take views on whether vaccine requirements should apply for health and wider social care workers - those in contact with patients and people receiving care. Those working in care homes in Englandregulated by the Care Quality Commission need to be double jabbed, unless medically exempt, from November. These latest proposals, if agreed, would extend that to all health service workers and would mean that only those who are fully vaccinated - unless exempt - would be able to be deployed to deliver health and care services. Care organisations have warned compulsory vaccinations could cause difficulties in a sector that already struggles with recruitment. Social care minister Helen Whately said about 90% of care home staff have already been vaccinated and the government was working with care homes to support staff who were hesitant about getting the jab. Asked if they would be sacked if they did not get vaccinated, she told BBC's Breakfast alterative roles would be sought for them outside the care home, adding: ""This is really difficult."" She said she had spoken to care home residents and their families who said they wanted workers double vaccinated to give them the most protection against Covid. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We want the NHS backlogs to be cleared as fast as possible"" Views from government advisory bodies on the plans are mixed. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) Social Care Working Group advises a similar approach to vaccination across social care and health sectors, because the network of residents, patients and workers are so close and often overlap. While Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said if the proposals did go ahead, it would be ""like an admission of failure"" and imply that messaging was not effective enough. ""It's like saying you can't either find the time or find the ability to explain to people why it makes sense and create the culture in which everybody does it because they understand why it's important,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The consultation is expected to focus on the proposals, their scope, and any impact on staffing and safety such as reducing staff sickness absence. Staff, healthcare providers, patients and their families are all being urged to share their view with the government, with a final decision expected this winter. OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COVID IN SCHOOL:What are the risks? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? Mr Javid said it was clear to see the impact vaccines had against respiratory viruses which could be fatal to the vulnerable. ""We will consider the responses to the consultation carefully but, whatever happens, I urge the small minority of NHS staff who have not yet been jabbed to consider getting vaccinated - for their own health as well as those around them,"" he said. The government said there was a longstanding precedent for vaccination in NHS roles - some surgeons already have to have Hepatitis B jabs if they are likely to be exposed to the virus. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have not made Covid vaccines compulsory for care home staff. Flu vaccination has been recommended to vulnerable groups in the UK since the 1960s. National flu jab rates in the health service have increased over the last decade, from 14% in 2002 to 76% last year. Experts are warning of a possible surge in flu cases this year as coronavirus lockdowns meant flu levels were very low last winter.

What happens when migrants reach the UK?,"The government says ""stopping the boats"" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority. As part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. Since the Supreme Court ruling,the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As well as the Rwanda plan, theIllegal Migration Actincludes a number of new provisions: the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally either to Rwanda, or another ""safe"" third country migrants will not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention under-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed, will be able to delay departure the number of refugees the UK settles through ""safe and legal routes"" is capped. The government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay Â£500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. Commercial documents published by the Home Office suggest thatthe government plans to spend at least Â£700m to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Is migration to the UK slowing and other claims Why record numbers are suddenly being given asylum At the end of September 2023 there weremore than 56,000 asylum seekers living in hotels,externalacross the UK. The government hopes to save money by using other types of accommodation instead. There are currently about 300 asylum seekers housed on a barge called the Bibby Stockholm in Dorset, which has capacity for 500. In aletter to the Home Affairs Committee of MPs,external, the Home Office confirmed the contract to provide accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm is worth Â£22.5m. In August 2023, all of the 39 asylum seekers then on board were removed afterLegionella bacteria was found in the water system. On 12 December 2023,one of the migrants living on the barge died.The man is believed to have taken his own life. What is it like on the UK's first migrant barge? Why is Bibby Stockholm barge so controversial? No asylum seekers have yet been housed at RAF Scampton The government has alsosaid that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussexwill house several thousand migrants: Wethersfield in Essex is due to hold up to 1,700 people Scampton in Lincolnshire is due to hold up to 2,000 Bexhill in East Sussex is due to hold up to 1,200 Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to hold an unspecified number of people. The BBC understands about 600 asylum seekers are being housed at Wethersfield. In July 2023, some residentstested positive for tuberculosis(TB). The first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this was delayed until further notice. The Home Office says it is still ""exploring proposals"" to use the Bexhill site. In December 2023,the High Court ruled that asylum seekers could be housed at Wethersfield and Scampton, following legal action by the relevant local councils. They have applied for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal. The Home Office commercial documents also show the government is looking for a partner to run two migrant reception centres in Kent until at least 2030 - and potentially to 2034. The Home Office insists there are a number of""safe and legal"",externalroutes to the UK. However, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan andUkraine,external, while other routes only accept limited numbers.Figures shown,externalare for the year to September 2023: Refugee Family Reunion- for partners and children under 18 of those already granted protection in the UK (6,114 grants) UK Resettlement Scheme- prioritises those from regions in conflict (525 grants) Community Sponsorship Scheme- for local community groups to provide accommodation and support for refugees (162 grants) Mandate Resettlement Scheme- to resettle refugees who have a close family member in the UK who can offer a home (13 grants) In April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. He said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted""there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK"". Critics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. The main principle of the1951 Refugee Convention,externalstates that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. Home Secretary James Cleverly said the new treaty with Rwanda addresses the UK Supreme Court's concerns The government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processedcomplies with international law. But the Supreme Court ruled in November 2023that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawfulbecause of the risk they could be moved on to countries where they could face harm, known as ""refoulement"". In response, the governmentsigned a new treaty with Rwandawhich it says will prevent refoulement. It has also publishednew legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country. No easy way forward for PM after win as Rwanda bill splits party Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

Why are migrants crossing the Channel?,"Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024, figures released on New Year's Day show. Last year was the deadliest on record for people trying to make the crossing, according to a United Nations agency. In 2024, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. That's higher than in 2023, when29,437 people arrived. However, the highest recorded figures are for 2022, when 45,755 people made the crossing. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than23,000 did so after Labour won the July general election. Sir Keir said the UK's new Border Security Command would trace suspected people smugglers and shut down their bank accounts. They will also facetravel bans, social media blackouts and phone restrictionsunder new laws, the government has announced. Net migration hit record 906,000 last year Immigration cuts: Why prime ministers keep failing to meet their targets The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency,tracks the number of people who die crossing the Channel,external. It estimates that at least 78 migrants died trying to cross the Channel in 2024. The Refugee Council said that government enforcement efforts have increased the dangers of crossings, withmore people crammed into less seaworthy boats,external. The IOM says,externalthat 241 migrants are missing or have died attempting to cross the English Channel since 2018. Its figures include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or as a result of medical issues. âDeath trapâ Channel boats traded by smugglers in German city 'Merchants of death' trial steps up fight against Channel smugglers In the year to September 2024, almost 5,000 Afghans crossed the Channel. Iranians were the second largest group, followed by people from Syria, Vietnam and Eritrea. Where recorded, more than 80% were male. About 40% were between 25 and 39 years old. Smuggler reveals operation to help Vietnamese reach UK People smuggler advertised Channel boat crossings on Facebook More than99,700 people claimed asylum in the UK,externalin the year ending September 2024, Home Office figures show. Applications peaked at about 103,000 in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. Claims then fell sharply, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria. Asylum applications have risen again in recent years, more than doubling from 45,318 in the year to September 2021 to 92,776 just one year later, followed by smaller increases since then. In the year to September 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 9,500 applications. Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, and India were among the other countries with most applications. Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in the figures. As of 26 November 2024,266,300 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees,external, who came through legal routes set up by the UK government. There are separate arrangements for a few other specific groups, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens. Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered. At the end of September 2024, there were 97,170 cases relating to 133,409 people awaiting an initial decision. Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to clear older claims by the end of 2023. However, 4,500 ""complex cases"" were still awaiting a decision at the end of December that year. There were 1,669 of these cases remaining at the end of September 2024. The Home Office can remove people with no legal right to stay in the UK, or refuse to let them enter. In the year to the end of September 2024,8,519 people who were not granted asylum were returned to their home country.,external This is up 52% on the same period in 2023, mainly because of a rise in people being returned to Albania. Between 2018 and September 2024, there were 4,420 returns of people who came to the UK in small boats - about 3% of arrivals. There weremore than 180,000 arrivals by sea in Europe,externalduring 2024, with Italy receiving more than a third. Greece and Spain also received large numbers. In 2023, there were 263,000 arrivals by sea in Europe. The UK had the fifth highest number of people claiming asylum in the EU and European Economic Area in the year ending June 2024. Germany received the largest number, with 319,710 applicants. Spain had the second highest number (163,755) followed by France (163,190) and Italy (158,560). In 2023, the UK government made initial decisions on 93,303 asylum applications - including people attached to them such as children or other dependents - and granted more than two thirds of them (67%). In the same period, Germany made 217,430 asylum decisions, and granted 62%. France - a country with a similar-sized population to the UK - made 132,695 decisions, and granted 31% of them.

EasyJet rejects bid and plans Â£1.2bn share sale,"EasyJet has rejected a takeover approach and announced plans to raise Â£1.2bn from shareholders to help its recovery from the pandemic. The airline said the unsolicited bid undervalued the company and the unnamed suitor was now no longer interested. Bloomberg reported,externalthat the bidder was rival Wizz Air, although it declined to comment. EasyJet's boss said the fundraising would allow the firm ""to accelerate our postâCovidâ19 recovery plan"" instead. The carrier has alreadyraised emergency funds during the crisis, having been affected by Covid-related travel restrictions. EasyJet also plans to raise $400m (Â£290m) in debt. The company said on Thursday it was ""well-placed to emerge from the pandemic"", but the additional cash would provide a buffer should further coronavirus-related lockdowns delay the airline's recovery. It has lost more than Â£2bn as many flights were grounded during the coronavirus crisis and it slumped to its first-ever loss in its 25-year history as a result. Amber list travel is legal, says EasyJet boss Ryanair predicts rapid rebound in airline travel BA warns of serious cost problems as furlough ends EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren has spoken out in favour of reducing the costs of Covid tests required for travel, in order to get customers booking again and the aviation industry back on its feet. On Thursday, he said the funds raised through the share sale would strengthen the airline's balance sheet. He added it would also position the firm for growth as the aviation industry in Europe emerges from the pandemic, saying that the airline had seen a spike in customer demand where restrictions have been lifted. EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren has previously spoken out about expensive PCR tests Looking ahead, the company plans to fly 57% of its 2019 capacity between July and September, ""with a continued focus on profitable flying"". It also said it would try to grow its sales through the launch of new products such as EasyJet Holidays, as well as a ""standard plus"" fare. The airline is in the midst of a huge cost-cutting programme, which it said was set to deliver about Â£500m of savings in the financial year to 30 September. Despite this, the carrier took the decision to review and reject the takeover approach from an unnamed potential buyer. The board said that the all-share offer ""fundamentally undervalued"" the business and was ""highly conditional"". EasyJet shares sank in early trade on the London Stock Exchange on the news,down nearly 8% at 728p. However, Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There is some potential upside to consider. ""Legacy carriers may pare down some of their routes indefinitely, leaving space for EasyJet to up its presence at major airports. The group couldn't do this without an injection of cash and promised shareholders that at least some of the funds are earmarked for this purpose. She said that although the move was ""risky"", it could pay off if EasyJet was able to expand its presence into more profitable travel routes. Mr Lundgren said during a call with journalists on Thursday that the firm was in a good position to buy more landing slots as other rival airlines rein in their short-haul operations. ""I believe this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" he said. All airline bosses have fretted over one issue since the start of the pandemic - do they have sufficient financial reserves to carry them through to when passengers finally return? It was an almost impossible question to answer, as no-one knew how long the pandemic would last. EasyJet thought it had done enough last June, when it boosted its bank lending facilities and in addition asked shareholders to stump up Â£450m. Now, like Oliver Twist, the company is asking for more, tapping investors for Â£1.2bn. It is not only about making good the losses racked up in the past year; it is also, the company says, about positioning it to take advantage of what it believes will be a shake-out of the aviation industry in the coming months. It wants to have sufficient firepower to take advantage of ""a range of long-term strategic and investment opportunities"" that it expects to arise. Some may regard EasyJet itself as the investment opportunity. The company also disclosed this morning that it had received an unsolicited takeover approach, which the board had rejected. It is not hard to see why the airline is attracting the attention of suitors - the shares were Â£18 just three years ago. By making the approach public, the company is sending a coded message to City investors. If you don't want to see another British company fall to an opportunistic bid, it might be a good idea to support our cash call.

"Driver shortage will raise prices, warns Morrisons","Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it expects the UK's lorry driver shortage to push up prices this year. It said the lack of drivers, plus higher freight charges and commodity prices, could lead to higher prices. However, it said it would seek to mitigate those and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred in maintaining good product availability. Transport secretary Grant Shapps said the UK must ""stand on its own two feet"" and not rely on EU drivers. Speaking after Morrisons reported its latest trading figures, Mr Shapps rejected calls for more immigration to resolve the problem. ""We have to stand on our own two feet as the United Kingdom. There are a lot of people coming off furlough. I look forward to them getting jobs."" Lorry driver shortages have have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000. Mr Shapps said: ""To say this is an issue of Brexit is completely untrue. What it is about - is coronavirus."" He pointed to the global driver shortage in the US, Poland and Germany and said the UK was not alone in having supply chain problems. The transport secretary confirmed that someHGV driver tests would be fast-tracked. Morrisons and its rivals have seen gaps on shelves due to the driver shortage. Last month, it joined a growing chorus in the food and drink industry calling for government help to recruit lorry drivers. Chief executive David Potts indicated HGV drivers should be eligible forSkilled Worker visas,external, allowing them to work in the UK. The firm's latest comments came as it reported first-half results, showing a profit before tax and exceptional items of Â£105m in the six months to 1 August, down from Â£167m in the same period last year. Morrisons calls for action on lorry driver dearth Morrisons backs US firm's improved takeover offer Morrisons is currently at the centre of a takeover battle between two US private equity firms. In its results statement, it reiterated that it had received offers for the company from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) and Fortress and was recommending CD&R's offer of 285p per share. Shareholders will be asked to approve this offer at a meeting to be held in or around the week beginning 18 October, it added. However, as neither bidder has said their offer is final, Morrisons said on Wednesday that it was in talks with CD&R, Fortress and the Takeover Panel about an auction to decide its future. It said any auction would take place before the planned shareholder meetings, on a date to be announced by the Takeover Panel. Morrisons said the whole British food industry was facing continued challenges from Covid-19 and sustained supply chain cost increases, which were largely outside its control. However, it added that it was working to address those challenges and that second-half profit was expected to be considerably higher than in the first half. We expect some industry-wide retail price inflation during the second half, driven by sustained recent commodity price increases and freight inflation, and the current shortage of HGV drivers,"" it said. ""We will seek to mitigate these and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred to maintain good on-shelf availability."" Chairman Andrew Higginson said the whole Morrisons team had shown ""commendable resilience facing into a variety of continuing challenges during the first half, including the ongoing pandemic, disruption at some of our partner suppliers and the impact on our supply chain of HGV driver shortages"". ""As we approach our busiest time of year, I'm confident the team will continue to rise to all challenges and keep up all the good work to improve the shopping trip for customers,"" he added. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said Morrisons, like all supermarkets, had faced the challenge of maintaining customer interest and sales as non-essential retail reopened after the pandemic and life returned to some kind of normality. ""But those roadblocks haven't stopped the retailer from shining,"" she added. ""The ongoing bidding war for the UK's fourth-largest grocer has proved that a growing online presence often satisfies the appetite of hungry investors. ""Having cemented an important relationship as a key supplier and partner to Amazon, and to McColl's convenience stores, Morrisons has triggered a bidding war among private equity firms in the US, who are more concerned with the lucrative property portfolio which the store network possesses than what's on the shelves.""

Donaldson to warn about future of NI power-sharing,"This video can not be played ""A choice between the political institutions and Protocol"" The Democratic Unionist Party may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its demands over the Northern Ireland Protocol are not met, its leader has suggested. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson also said he feared a returnto the loyalist street violence seen earlier in the yearunless the issue was resolved. He said his party would also now boycott most north-south ministerial meetings. He said relations could not be ""business as usual"". Most Stormont parties criticised the speech while theEU's Brexit negotiator called for calm. During his speech in Belfast, Sir Jeffrey said it would be clear ""within weeks"" if there was a basis for the assembly and executive to continue, or if an election was needed. ""I say not as a threat, but as a matter of political reality, that our political institutions will not survive a failure to resolve the problems that the protocol has created,"" Sir Jeffrey said. ""Neither will they survive an indefinite 'stand still' period; urgent action is needed."" He also said DUP ministers would resign from their posts rather than implement further border checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. ""If in the final analysis those who are democratically elected by the people of Northern Ireland lack the power to prevent such checks, and the protocol issues remain, then the position in office of DUP Ministers would become untenable,"" Sir Jeffrey added. The protocol is part of the UK government's Brexit deal with the European Union. It keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods to ensure free trade across the Irish border. However, it has led to additional checks on goods being traded across the Irish Sea, which has drawn criticism and protests from unionists. Not all the checks have been implemented due to what are known as grace periods. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson laid it out pretty clearly today. His message for the government was blunt -  you can either have the political institutions or the protocol - you can't have both. In terms of the mechanics of how you bring down government in Northern Ireland, essentially what has to happen is that the first minister or deputy first minister needs to resign. There then is a period of seven days, and if the positions are not filled within that period, it's over to the secretary of state who has to set a date within a reasonable period of time for an election. However, we know from James Brokenshire's time as secretary of state, that a reasonable period can last for months and months on end. There's no guarantee that if the DUP walk away from government that we will end up in an election within a matter of weeks. The smart money would suggest that Brandon Lewis may well take the view that there is no point in calling an election when we have one already scheduled for next May. Earlier this week theUK government indefinitely extended the grace periodswhich it said was necessary to create space for further talks with the EU. Sir Jeffrey's speech came as theEuropean Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic began a two-day visit to Northern Irelandfor talks with business and political leaders. Sir Jeffrey, the MP for Lagan Valley, said he believed in devolution and wanted to return to the assembly as an assembly member (MLA). He said he wanted to provide a ""window of opportunity"" to find a solution and expressed concern there could be a return to disorder on Northern Ireland's streets ""unless we grapple with this issue"". EU's Sefcovic to discuss protocol on NI visit The DUP leader outlined four steps his party would take, including an end to its engagement with north-south bodies, except for co-operation on health matters. The north-south arrangements, provisioned for by the Good Friday Agreement, feature six all-Ireland bodies, with responsibility for matters such as waterways and food standards, which operate under the policy direction of the North-South Ministerial Council. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin (left) and Tanaiste Leo Varadkar attended a meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in July It is comprised of ministers from both sides of the border. Ministers from Northern Ireland are required to attend under the Ministerial Code of office. The DUP attended the last meeting of the council in July. Sir Jeffrey said this was done ""as an act of good faith"" but issues remain unresolved. ""Therefore, as the protocol issues remain unresolved, the DUP will immediately withdraw from the structures of Strand Two of the Belfast Agreement relating to north south arrangements, while we will ensure important health related matters continue to be addressed on a cooperative basis,"" he said. Sir Jeffrey also outlined that DUP ministers would ""seek to block additional checks at the ports"" and would examine the legality of the current checks and ""whether they should have required executive approval"". The DUP leader also explained his executive team would ""seek to frustrate and prevent"" alignment between NI Assembly legislation and laws passed by the EU. What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Further delays confirmed for Irish Sea border checks ""Let me be clear if the choice is ultimately between remaining in office or implementing the protocol in its present form, then the only option for any unionist minister would be to cease to hold such office,"" he said. ""Time is short and consequences will follow. ""The prize of a successful outcome is not just for unionism, but for all of Northern Ireland and it is not just for the UK, but for the EU as well."" Sir Jeffery said he feared a return to street violence in loyalist areas witnessed in April. ""Since the start of July, the streets have been quieter in terms of violence, but I fear that unless we grapple with this issue, this will prove to be merely a pause, rather than an end to the disorder,"" he said. He echoed this view in an interview later with the BBC's Political Thinking podcast with Nick Robinson. ""If politics fails ... then I fear there will be others who may decide to step into the gap,"" he said. He went on to say that he and other community leaders had ""been saying to the boys on the streets please don't be on the streets"" and that as a result, Northern Ireland had been peaceful ""all summer"". A DUP withdrawal from its executive roles, including first minister, would not automatically trigger an assembly election, however, it would begin the process. Given the joint nature of the office, First Minister Paul Givan's departure would also remove Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill as Deputy First Minister. This would then start a seven-day process for the parties to agree to fresh nominations.. If this did not happen, NI Secretary Brandon Lewis would be responsible for calling an election within a ""reasonable"" timeframe. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said the speech had ""created new challenges"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said it was a ""reckless, irresponsible and short-sighted election stunt"". She said the DUP was ""clearly in panic mode, driven by poor opinion polls"" and are ""focused on their own narrow self-interest"". UUP leader Doug Beattie said his party shared the DUP's concerns about the protocol but it would be a ""bad idea"" to collapse Stormont SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""naive in the extreme"" and that the DUP leader had ""offered no solutions"". ""I think it is very dangerous when people are languishing on waiting lists and we're dealing with a global pandemic, we have people playing indulgent games that are more about polls than protocols,"" he told BBC NI's The Nolan Show. Alliance Party leader and Stormont Justice Minister Naomi Long said there was a need for ""pragmatic solutions"" to protocol matters rather than for ""people to escalate this into a constitutional crisis"". Naomi Long said Sir Jeffrey should offer solutions for the parties to debate Mrs Long described Sir Jeffrey's address as ""cynical party posturing to try and recover perceived electoral losses because of polling"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said his party shared the DUP's concerns about the protocol, but that it would be a ""bad idea"" to collapse Stormont. ""The problem is we do need to have some sort of a treaty which deals with the issues between the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he said. On Tuesday, the UUPpublished a paper detailing its recommendations,external""for a common-sense solution to the problems created by the protocol"". It included provisions for a new criminal offence ""to knowingly export goods designed for the UK internal market into the EU single market"". Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said Sir Jeffrey's speech included ""some fine words"", but ""it is actions that count"". Simon Coveney, the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, said unionist concerns about the protocol had been ""taken seriously"", but ""no positive agenda is served by blocking practical north-south co-operation or by the breakdown of the other institutions of the Good Friday Agreement"". ""The EU is already listening closely to concerns in Northern Ireland and is ready to work in good faith to minimise friction,"" he continued.

EU's Sefcovic to discuss protocol on NI visit,"Maros Sefcovic is in Northern Ireland to meet political, business and civic leaders European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic has urged politicians to ""dial down the rhetoric"" on the Northern Ireland Protocol. He was responding to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's warning that his partymay quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands are not met. Mr Sefcovic is in Northern Ireland to meet political, business and civic leaders. The UK wants the protocol,which puts a trade border in the Irish Sea, changed. Unionists believe it undermines their place in the United Kingdom and want it to be scrapped. Mr Sefcovic said he had already spoken to Sir Jeffrey ""a couple of weeks ago"". ""I will see him this afternoon as I will see also the other political leaders,"" he said on Thursday. ""We will have the opportunity to discuss this face to face and my message will be 'let's work on the concrete problems'. ""Let's focus on the issues which are the most important for the people of Northern Ireland, let's be constructive, let's dial down the political rhetoric, let's bring calm and focus on what is our task to accomplish."" Mr Sefcovic, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, described Sir Jeffrey as a ""very experienced politician"" who wants the best for Northern Ireland. ""I can assure him that is my intention as well,"" Mr Sefcovic added. Mr Sefcovic (centre) met First Minister Paul Givan (left) and Declan Kearney, junior minister at the Executive Office during a visit to Stormont Mr Sefcovic said the purpose of his trip to Northern Ireland was to find out ""face-to-face"" what the problems were with the implementation of the protocol.

""I came here to listen, to learn what are the concrete problems that the people of Northern Ireland are facing with the implementation of the protocol. ""But I am also here to talk about opportunities the protocol is bringing, especially to the economy and of course the people of Northern Ireland, and I am starting with the business representatives."" On Monday,the UK delayed new checks on goods from Great Britain entering Northern Irelandas required by the protocol. Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, said the move was necessary to ""provide space for further potential discussions"" with the EU. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had taken note of the decision. ""We are talking over the last few weeks constructively on solving the issues linked with the protocol and I hope that also the way that we handled Monday's announcement coming from London just proves that we are ready to do our utmost to look for every possible solution within the protocol to resolve the problems."" However the EU has repeatedly said the sort of fundamental renegotiation Lord Frost wants is not on offer. Further delays confirmed for Irish Sea border checks What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Technical discussions between the UK and EU on an agri-food agreement have reached a stalemate. The EU has offered the UK a Swiss-style deal which would involve the UK following EU rules. The UK has rejected that and instead asked for a deal in which the EU would recognise UK standards as equivalent to its own. An EU official has suggested that the issue could be unlocked with a bespoke arrangement which recognises Northern Ireland's unique circumstances. It is not yet clear what such an arrangement might involve and the EU is wary that the UK would demand the same deal for GB-EU agri-food trade. What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol?

Fire at Covid hospital kills 10 in North Macedonia,"The clinic in Tetovo was constructed last year to care for people suffering serious effects of Covid-19 At least 14 people have been killed in a fire at a makeshift hospital treating Covid-19 patients in North Macedonia. Footage shared on social media showed a building in flames and a thick cloud of black smoke billowing into the air near a main road in the city of Tetovo. Firefighters put out the blaze in less than an hour. It broke out about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. The authorities suspect that oxygen cylinders used to treat coronavirus patients exploded. Public prosecutors said they were investigating whether there were more victims, as reported locally. ""This is a very sad day,"" Health Minister Venko Filipce wrote on Twitter, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims. Of the 26 patients in the coronavirus treatment facility at the time of the fire, 12 were being treated in hospital and were ""out of danger"", Mr Filipce said. He described the fire as a ""terrible accident"" but provided no further details. This video can not be played Oxygen cylinders used to treat patients are thought to have exploded at the hospital Tetovo's deputy fire chief Saso Trajcevski said the fire had spread rapidly inside the building after oxygen cylinders exploded. Footage showed flames bursting through the windows in the portable buildings that made up the modular hospital. Although his team reached the building quickly, he said the large amount of plastic meant that the fire was intense. ""This is a truly tragic event,"" said Prime Minister Zoran Zaev in a statement posted to Facebook, adding: ""The cause of the fire will be determined."" Local media said Mr Zaev had been booed when he arrived at the site of the accident on Thursday. North Macedonia's government has declared three days of national mourning for the victims. The temporary facility was reportedly constructed last year to care for people made seriously ill from the coronavirus. Oxygen cylinders have been blamed for a number of fires at hospitals treating coronavirus patients since the pandemic began.Ten people died in a fire at Gaziantepin Turkey last December, and a similar fire claimed 10 lives in Peatra Niamt in Romania in November 2020. Covid map: Where are cases being reported? Coronavirus vaccine progress around the world Romania hospital blaze kills Covid patients North Macedonia has a population of about two million people and, with Covid vaccination rates below 30%, it has seen a recent surge in cases and deaths. Tetovo is one of the most affected areas, as many expat Macedonians are said to have visited friends and relatives there during the summer months. Some injured patients were transported to receive care in the capital Skopje Mayor Teuta Arifi spoke of her regret that the victims had been in the hospital for coronavirus treatment. The Republika website said most of the patients were in a moderate condition as the most serious cases had been transferred to the capital Skopje for treatment. One infectious diseases specialist, Zaklina Sopova, complained that makeshift hospital facilities had been set up without proper safety standards. North Macedonia has reported more than 180,000 cases of Covid-19 and 6,153 coronavirus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. A further 24 deaths were reported over the past day on Wednesday.

Ex-Afghan President Ghani apologises for fleeing,"Mr Ghani said he was forced to leave Kabul by his security team in a live Facebook post last month Former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has apologised to the people of Afghanistan after fleeing to take refuge in the United Arab Emirates. ""Leaving Kabul was the most difficult decision of my life,"" he said, adding that he was sorry he ""could not make it end differently"". Mr Ghani abruptly left Afghanistan as Taliban militants advanced on the capital on 15 August. He said he had not intended to abandon his people but ""it was the only way"". He also again denied the ""baseless"" allegations that he had travelled to the UAE with about $169m (Â£123m). In a statement shared on Twitter on Wednesday, Mr Ghani said he had no choice but to leave the country in order to avoid widespread violence. ""I left at the urging of the palace security, who advised me that to stay risked setting off the same street-to-street fighting the city had suffered during the civil war of the 1990s,"" he wrote, adding that he did so to ""save Kabul and her six million citizens"". He said he had devoted 20 years to helping Afghanistan become a ""democratic, prosperous and sovereign state"". Mr Ghani added that he had ""deep and profound regret that my own chapter ended in similar tragedy to my predecessors"". Who is Ashraf Ghani? The frenzied final hours of the Afghan government The 72-year-old former president, who has faced intense criticism from other Afghan politicians for leaving the country, said he would address the ""events leading up to my departure"" in the near future. In a live Facebook address on 18 August, Mr Ghani said he was ""forced"" to leave Afghanistan by his security team because ""there was a real chance that I would be captured and killed"". He said that when the Taliban entered the presidential palace in Kabul, ""they started looking for me from room to room"". Denying claims that he had taken a large amount of money with him when he left the country, Mr Ghani said he was ""not even allowed to take my sandals off and put my shoes on"". Earlier this week the Taliban, which seized control of Afghanistan in a sweeping offensive more than three weeks ago, announced  the formation of an all-male interim government to rule the country. Who's who in the Taliban leadership On Wednesday, dozens of women in Kabul and the north-eastern Afghan province of Badakhshan protested against the new cabinet, saying they would not accept a government with no women ministers.

Consultation on mandatory jabs for health staff,"Compulsory Covid and flu jabs for frontline NHS and care workers in England are being considered in a government consultation. Plans are already in place to make it mandatory for care home workers in England to be fully vaccinated. But some unions and care organisations have warned that making the jabs mandatory will lead to staff shortages. Health Secretary Sajid Javid is urging all health service workers to get both jabs to protect vulnerable patients. About 88% of NHS trust staff have received two Covid doses, but in some trusts that falls to 78%, figures show. In the UK, more than 30,000 new daily cases have been reported for nine days in a row and the number of people in hospital with the disease is rising. Will I get a booster jab this autumn? Doctors urge MPs to take action on flu jab delay MPs back compulsory vaccines for care home staff What did the government do about care homes and coronavirus? The six-week consultation process will take views on whether vaccine requirements should apply for health and wider social care workers - those in contact with patients and people receiving care. Those working in care homes in Englandregulated by the Care Quality Commission need to be double jabbed, unless medically exempt, from November. These latest proposals, if agreed, would extend that to all health service workers and would mean that only those who are fully vaccinated - unless exempt - would be able to be deployed to deliver health and care services. Care organisations have warned compulsory vaccinations could cause difficulties in a sector that already struggles with recruitment. Social care minister Helen Whately said about 90% of care home staff have already been vaccinated and the government was working with care homes to support staff who were hesitant about getting the jab. Asked if they would be sacked if they did not get vaccinated, she told BBC's Breakfast alterative roles would be sought for them outside the care home, adding: ""This is really difficult."" She said she had spoken to care home residents and their families who said they wanted workers double vaccinated to give them the most protection against Covid. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We want the NHS backlogs to be cleared as fast as possible"" Views from government advisory bodies on the plans are mixed. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) Social Care Working Group advises a similar approach to vaccination across social care and health sectors, because the network of residents, patients and workers are so close and often overlap. While Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said if the proposals did go ahead, it would be ""like an admission of failure"" and imply that messaging was not effective enough. ""It's like saying you can't either find the time or find the ability to explain to people why it makes sense and create the culture in which everybody does it because they understand why it's important,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The consultation is expected to focus on the proposals, their scope, and any impact on staffing and safety such as reducing staff sickness absence. Staff, healthcare providers, patients and their families are all being urged to share their view with the government, with a final decision expected this winter. OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COVID IN SCHOOL:What are the risks? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? Mr Javid said it was clear to see the impact vaccines had against respiratory viruses which could be fatal to the vulnerable. ""We will consider the responses to the consultation carefully but, whatever happens, I urge the small minority of NHS staff who have not yet been jabbed to consider getting vaccinated - for their own health as well as those around them,"" he said. The government said there was a longstanding precedent for vaccination in NHS roles - some surgeons already have to have Hepatitis B jabs if they are likely to be exposed to the virus. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have not made Covid vaccines compulsory for care home staff. Flu vaccination has been recommended to vulnerable groups in the UK since the 1960s. National flu jab rates in the health service have increased over the last decade, from 14% in 2002 to 76% last year. Experts are warning of a possible surge in flu cases this year as coronavirus lockdowns meant flu levels were very low last winter.

"Theranos founder 'lied and cheated', trial hears","Elizabeth Holmes is charged with 12 counts of fraud Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes ""lied and cheated"" for money and fame, prosecutors alleged on the first day of the former Silicon Valley star's trial. Ms Holmes faces 12 fraud charges over her role at the now-defunct blood-testing firm which was once worth $9bn. She is accused of deceiving investors and patients by claiming Theranos could detect common illnesses using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick. Her lawyers said she was simply a naive businesswoman whose firm failed. ""Failure is not a crime. Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime,"" Lance Wade, a lawyer for the defence said in his opening statement on Wednesday. In what will be a closely watched trial in San Jose, California, Ms Holmes denies all the charges against her but could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Former Theranos executive Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani - who was romantically involved with Ms Holmes for years - faces the same charges but will be tried separately next year. He has also pleaded not guilty. Ms Holmes, who founded Theranos in 2003 aged 19, was dubbed the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and the ""next Steve Jobs"" thanks to her technology. However, she fell from grace in 2015 when it emerged her blood-testing devices did not work and Theranos was doing most of its testing on commercially available machines made by other manufacturers. Elizabeth Holmes: The boss accused of duping Silicon Valley On Wednesday, prosecutor Robert Leach said Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani turned to fraud in 2009 after big pharmaceutical firms declined to back Theranos and they ran out of cash. They lied about the tests and exaggerated the firm's performance to secure millions of dollars of investment between 2010 and 2015. This included falsely claiming the tests had been vetted by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and that the technology was being used by the US military in the field, Mr Leach said. Ms Holmes came into the court surrounded by her legal team. There's huge interest in the case here. Journalists had been queuing up since 5am to try and get into court. Many didn't get in. Eschewing the black turtleneck she had become famous for, Ms Holmes wore a grey suit and blue mask. In court, she sat bolt upright, poised, attentive, as she listened to the case against her. The prosecution didn't mince its words. The word ""lies"" was mentioned liberally. Ms Holmes watched on passively. The case will probably take months and at some point it's possible that Ms Holmes herself will take the stand. If she does it will be a huge risk for her defence. But with so much evidence that the tech she flaunted didn't work she may feel it's a risk worth taking. Ms Holmes also ""dazzled"" firms such as Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, into agreeing testing partnerships, despite being fully aware the tests were ""plagued by issues and repeatedly failing quality control"", he said. It brought her fame and adoration, Mr Leach added. ""She had become, as she sought, one of the most celebrated CEOs in Silicon Valley and the world. But under the facade of Theranos' success there were significant problems brewing."" Ms Holmes claims Mr Balwani controlled and abused her. He denies the claims However, the defence's Mr Wade said Ms Holmes did not intend to defraud, but instead ""naively underestimated"" the challenges her business faced. ""In the end, Theranos failed and Ms Holmes walked away with nothing,"" he told the jurors in San Jose. He added that the former executive was motivated by Theranos's mission, not money, and ""committed to that mission until that very last day"". ""By the time this trial is over, you will see that the villain the government just presented is actually a living, breathing human being who did her very best each and every day. And she is innocent."" According to court filings unsealed last month, Ms Holmes has alleged Mr Balwani abused her emotionally and psychologically for years. Mr Balwani has denied the allegations. Her lawyers have said she is ""highly likely"" to take the witness stand and testify about how the relationship affected her mental state. As boss of Theranos Ms Holmes is alleged to have duped a host of powerful people who invested around $700m in the company. Henry Kissinger and four star general James Mattis sat on the company's board while Rupert Murdoch invested Â£120m. Her story has become the subject of documentaries, podcasts and books. A TV miniseries and a Hollywood film based her life are in the works. The defence and prosecution have identified more than 140 potential witnesses in the case, including investors and former Theranos employees.

Patel authorises turning back of migrant boats,"A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, aboard a Border Force vessel Boats carrying migrants across the English Channel could be turned back from the UK, if personally approved by Home Secretary Priti Patel. The government has authorised Border Force officials to use the new tactic - but only in limited circumstances. However France is strongly against the plan, saying it breaks maritime law and accusing the UK of blackmail. But Boris Johnson's spokesman said any plans would be ""safe and legal"" and would comply with the law. Rising numbers of migrants have been crossing the English Channel in recent months - and so far this week more than 1,500 people have crossed by boat. The Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world. Many migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities. What happens to migrants found in the Channel? Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? What happens when they reach the UK? Government sources have confirmed to the BBC that a Border Force team has been training for months to begin the operation. It is understood that the final training may take place within days, subject to the weather - meaning the tactic would then be ready to be used whenever is it practical and safe to do so. But France says the move flouts international maritime law, which says people at risk of losing their lives at sea must be rescued. France's interior minister GÃ©rald Darmanin - who met Ms Patel on Wednesday for talks on the migrant crisis - also accused the UK of financial blackmail. He was referring to a deal the UK and France struck over money earlier this year, when the UK promised to pay France Â£54.2m for extra action such as doubling the number of coast patrols. Since then, Ms Patel has warned that Britain could withhold the money, unless more boats are intercepted. ""UK's commitment must be kept,"" said Mr Darmanin. ""I clearly said it to my counterpart Priti Patel. The friendship between our two countries deserves better than posturing which undermines the cooperation between our ministries"". The government's lawyers say turning boats back would be legal in limited and specific circumstances - although they have not confirmed what these will be. Because the legal and safety risks are so high, it is also understood that Border Force chiefs have asked Ms Patel to personally support decisions to use the tactic, meaning she would have to be available to take a call from a Border Force vessel if and when they believe the tactic can be used safely. The UK has a legal right to intercept people at sea where necessary to prevent crime or to protect borders. But whatever the legal advice the UK government has received on migrant boats, it's questionable whether such an operation could continue once there is a clear sign of danger. Border Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible. So their window of opportunity to run a push-back operation could be very tight. But more importantlyâ¦ is this really ever going to happen? The intervention from the French interior minister may have just sunk the operation before a single Border Force ship has set sail. There are no international waters in the Dover Strait - so any operation would need French cooperation. And Gerald Darmanin's statement makes clear France's opposition to any confrontation of dinghies in one of the world's most dangerous shipping lanes. The tactic has never been used before in the English Channel, but it has been in the Mediterranean, said the Immigration Services Union (ISU) which represents borders, immigration and customs staff. Lucy Moreton from the ISU said she would be ""very surprised"" if it ends up being used at all - calling it ""dead in the water"". ""There are understandably a lot of constraints around it, and you cannot do this with a vessel which is in any way vulnerable. ""But more importantly, you also need the consent of the French to do it. Because as you turn the vessel back towards France, when it crosses the median line it has to be intercepted and rescued by the French, and it appears the French will simply not engage in this."" If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port If they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them Each country has search-and-rescue zones An EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it Ms Patel met Mr Darmanin, on Wednesday for talks on the migrant crisis - but the two sides failed to agree any new measures. More than 12,600 migrants have made the journey across the English Channel so far this year. Charities urged the Home Office to take a ""more humane and responsible approach"" towards asylum seekers. Amnesty International UK has said people have the right to seek asylum in the UK and ""only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them"". And the head of the Refugee Council said: ""Rather than spending time, resource and immense effort on pushing these very vulnerable people away, this government must give people options for safe routes to stop such perilous journeys in the first place. ""Refugee family reunion is one such safe route that has saved thousands of lives. Resettlement is another. We urge this government to rethink its brutal policy and think about the individual lives at the heart of these desperate journeys."" Labour also said the tactic risks lives, adding: ""That the home secretary is even considering these dangerous proposals shows how badly she has lost control of this situation."" The Home Office said it continues to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options to find ways of stopping small boats making the journey. The prime minister's spokesman said the same, and that the UK's activities ""comply with international and domestic law"". And the government added that it needs to use every possible tactic at itsÂ disposal to tackle people smuggling. Ms Patel has repeatedlyspoken out about organised crime gangs,externalwho smuggle people to the UK for profit - and thatthe new Nationality and Borders Billaims to ""break their business model"". She will host the final day of the G7 interior ministers meeting on Thursday, with illegal migration anticipated to be the focus.

What will the tax cost me?,"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.
