Louisiana hunkers down as Hurricane Ida strikes,"This video can not be played Watch: Wind gusts of up to 172mph and heavy rain pummelled Louisiana Louisiana residents may be in the dark for weeks as officials take stock of the damage from Hurricane Ida. Ida made landfall on Sunday with 150mph (240km/h) winds, the fifth strongest to ever hit the US mainland. About one million locals remain without power. ""It's going to be a difficult life for quite some time,"" said one local leader in the Greater New Orleans area. About 5,000 National Guard members have been deployed to aid search and rescue. In addition, more than 25,000 workers from around the country have mobilised to support power restoration in the state, according to CNN. At least one person is dead after a tree fell on their home in Ascension Parish, in Louisiana's Baton Rouge area. State and local officials have conceded that number is likely to grow as search and rescue efforts continue, but argued the city had largely ""held the line"". ""The systems we depended on to save lives and protect our city did just that and we are grateful, but there is so much more work to be done,"" said New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Monday. She urged residents who had already evacuated their homes to stay put and not return until power and communications have been restored. As the slow-moving Ida continues to move inland, it has weakened to a tropical storm - but the National Hurricane Centre warned that heavy rain could still bring flooding to parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Ida was previously deemed ""life-threatening"", drawing comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, a 2005 storm that had a path similar to Ida and killed 1,800 people. But it seemed that New Orleans' flood defences, strengthened in Katrina's aftermath, have done their job. Governor John Bel Edwards said the levee systems had ""performed magnificently"" and none have thus far been breached. ""But the damage is still catastrophic,"" he acknowledged on Monday. ""We are still in a life saving mode."" In pictures: Hurricane Ida lashes Gulf Coast President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state, releasing extra funds for rescue and recovery efforts. On Monday, he pledged that the federal government would ""stand with the people of the Gulf [Coast] for as long as it takes for you to recover"". Entergy, the largest power company in Louisiana, warned that it would take days - and likely weeks in the hardest hit areas - to restore electricity to the more than one million homes without power across the state. This video can not be played Watch Hurricane Ida blow the roof off a Louisiana hospital Ida gathered strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico during the weekend. More than 90% of oil production there has been shut down as a result of the storm. On Sunday, Ida made landfall south of New Orleans as a category four hurricane - meaning it would cause severe damage to buildings, trees and power lines.As it moves inland, Ida's winds have dropped to 95mph (153km/h),external, meaning it is now a category one storm. There are still fears of storm surges along the coast - which could be as high as 16ft (4.8m), potentially submerging parts of the low-lying coastline. By Nada Tawfik, BBC News In New Orleans, the sun is now shining. While that might sound lovely, sweltering conditions are less than ideal when residents and businesses lack power and water. With a lengthy wait to restore utilities many residents are now scrambling to make a post-storm evacuation. There has been significant property damage as well. Jazz icon Louis Armstrong's second home, a small brick structure, is now just a pile of bricks. Still, residents talk about how they got lucky after Hurricane Katrina's disastrous death toll. The picture changes once you head to low lying areas outside of New Orleans's hurricane protection system. The situation there is more desperate as people wait atop their roofs and inside their attics to be saved from the water. Some of the roads are impassable and unsafe due to downed power lines and flooding. Reaching the most vulnerable in these conditions will be challenging but resources are now pouring in. In Jefferson Parish, I met Clarence Sinceno, an older man who has lived in his home there for 50 years. He says Ida was the worst storm he's lived through. Throughout the night, he and his family kept moving to different parts of the house as leaks turned into holes. The intense winds tore off sections of his roof and the sheet rock and insulation completely collapsed. Covid-19 has also further complicated efforts to keep people safe. Louisiana hospitals are already under pressure from Covid-19, as the state has the third-highest rate of infections in the US. Normally, hospitals in the predicted path of the hurricane would be evacuated, but this time there are few beds available, even at facilities further inland. ""We don't have any place to bring those patients. Not in state, not out of state,"" Mr Edwards said. Ida came ashore on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a category three storm when it made landfall. This video can not be played Storm Ida to bring further heavy rain and strong winds Since then, billions of dollars have been spent on flood defences, known as levees. So far, the levees have held, though a flash flood warning is in place for New Orleans. High winds tore part of the roof off a hospital in the town of Cut Off, Louisiana, just inland from the Gulf of Mexico. The hospital said it had suffered ""significant damage"" but that its patients were safe. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms."" The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above, making more energy available to drive hurricanes. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. How has Hurricane Ida affected you?

Affordable uniforms law will miss new school year,"The average primary school uniform costs Â£315, according to the Children's Society A new law aimed at making school uniforms cheaper in England will not be in place in time for the start of this school year. Headteachers are waiting for the new statutory guidance on uniforms, which will make schools place affordability at the centre of their uniform policy. The government says schools should expect full details in the autumn. But that means parents will not benefit from the changes, as schools go back this September. According to The Children's Society, the average uniform costs Â£315 per primary school pupil and Â£337 per secondary pupil. Mike Amesbury, the Labour MP who first introduced the legislation, said he would be ""incredibly disappointed"" if any further delays to the guidance meant that the changes weren't fully in force for the start of the next academic year, beginning in September 2022. He added that hundreds of thousands of children, parents and campaigners would be equally upset. Food bank sees big demand for school uniform Parents demand uniform choice after stock delays It is expected that the rules will limit the number of logos on uniforms, allowing parents to buy more items from supermarkets and shops other than a school's main supplier. When this new law eventually comes into force, it will save families a big sum of cash. At the moment, some schools require trousers or skirts to have the school badge on, alongside jumpers, cardigans, polo shirts, blazers - and that's before you even get started on sports kits. Each item that's specific to the school costs more, so only having to buy one or two would mean big savings. In the meantime some local sewing services have pattern school logos and might be able to embroider a badge onto a generic top to save some cash. For years many, schools have had a link to a local uniform shop, where all pupils must go to get kitted out. Although many parents see this as a way of supporting local business, for plenty of other families it just limits their chances of getting something cheaper elsewhere. This new law is aiming to open up the way those deals with supply shops are signed, so it's not done on a nod-and-a-wink, and will now have price as the central factor. Parents will now have to wait and hope that the law is finalised before the next academic year begins to see the reality of those cash savings. Azmina Siddique, policy manager at the Children's Society, told the BBC it was disappointing parents won't see a financial benefit this September. But she added: ""We appreciate that these [changes] can take a bit of time and it's really important to get the guidance right."" Schools will now have more time to review their policies, she said, adding: ""Teachers have also told us that, while they would be very happy for the law to have been passed, in year they have had - adjusting to home learning and the impact of the pandemic -  that one more thing before the summer term may have been difficult."" Schools are also expecting a new tendering process, which will mean they can get the best value for money when selecting who makes and sells their uniforms. Additionally there's expected to be a process for parents and carers to complain if they feel that's not happening effectively at their children's schools. Emma Ball started the Uniform Exchange in Winsford While they wait for legislation to cut costs, many parents have taken matters into their own hands by forming groups and swap shops, often online, to offer others items that no longer fit and to find new kit for their own children. Emma Ball started the Uniform Exchange in Winsford, Cheshire, three years ago when her two eldest children left school and she was left with clothes she no longer had use for. She now collects items from parents across the area and helps get them to families who need anything from a new blazer for high school to a pinafore for winter term. Since starting the exchange, she has helped more than 1,000 families and said that this year demand has doubled. Emma says the issue of incorrect uniforms affects secondary school pupils in particular, with some schools sanctioning them or even sending them home if they arrive without wearing the right clothes. ""Children shouldn't ever be punished for not having a school uniform,"" she said, adding that people shouldn't worry about going to a swap shop for school wear as they're keeping it out of landfill. Parents Corinna Baker-Sinclair and Rebecca Benson say the exchange makes sense and saves money Parents Corinna Baker-Sinclair and Rebecca Benson have both used the swap shop in the town. With three children in primary and another in secondary, Corinna said she would have to pay out well over Â£1,000 if she were to buy everything new each year. For Rebecca, it's not just the financial cost of new uniforms that led her to use the uniform exchange. ""When you look around and see how much there actually is that can be put to good use rather than going to landfill it makes sense to reuse,"" she said. ""You'd much rather spend that money making memories than just to buy a school uniform."" When the law requiring government to introduce the new guidelines came into force earlier this year, school standards minister Nick Gibb said they would help families to save money and ensure that cost was never a barrier to accessing the best possible education. However, with the new term starting imminently for most pupils in England, it's likely to be a year at least before parents see any change in the amount they're spending to kit out their children for school.

"Give UK workers four more bank holidays, says TUC","Workers in England and Wales are being fobbed off with a ""stingy"" number of bank holidays, say trades unions. They get eight public holidays a year, which is four fewer than the EU average and half the number in Japan. The umbrella body for unions, the TUC, is calling for a new public holiday between September and Christmas. It would be ""a great way to thank working Britain for getting us through these tough times,"" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said. ""The August Bank Holiday will be a welcome break for everyone working hard to get us through the pandemic - especially those on the front line,"" said Ms O'Grady. ""But after August, there's no national holiday until Christmas. And that's because the number of holidays we get is so stingy compared to other nations."" Urgent tourism rethink call amid staycation boom Even in Scotland,with nine bank holidays,external, and Northern Irelandwhich has 10 public holidays,external, the situation is only slightly better. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said: ""The current pattern of public and bank holidays is well established and whilst an additional bank holiday may benefit some communities and sectors, the cost to the economy of an additional bank holiday is considerable."" According to the TUC every EU-member is more generous than the UK when it comes to public holidays. Several countries including Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Finland give 15 days off. The EU average is 12.8 days a year, the TUC said. Japan's workers enjoy 17 days off a year but New Zealanders only get 11. However, in many countries if a bank holiday falls at the weekend, workers are not entitled to an additional day off. So in practice workers don't always enjoy as many holidays as the officially listed days suggest. The TUC says all UK workers should get at least 12 public holidays and is calling for a wider debate on the issue. ""It's time for a national conversation - when should our new holidays be? What might they celebrate?"" added Ms O'Grady. ""An autumn holiday to break the long stretch to Christmas would be a good start."" Those who have to work on bank holidays are entitled to be paid a premium or receive time off in lieu, the TUC said. Bank holidays are created under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, or are created by royal proclamation - that is, by the Queen, who acts on government advice. The department responsible for bank holidays is the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Bank holidays are not actually statutory holidays, although most workers do get the day off.

Soul of reggae Lee 'Scratch' Perry dies aged 85,"Perry is known for his pioneering work in dub Tributes have been paid to the legendary Jamaican singer and music producer Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, who has died at the age of 85. He died in hospital in Lucea, north-west Jamaica, local media reported. Perry is known for his pioneering experiments in dub, which revolutionised not only reggae, but also hip hop, dance and other genres. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called him ""unforgettable"" and praised his ""sterling contribution"" to music. The Beastie Boys, who first worked with Perry when he opened for them in Japan in 1996 before they joined forces on the track Dr Lee PhD as party of 1998's Hello Nasty album, hailed the musician's ""pioneering spirit"". ""We are truly grateful to have been inspired by and collaborated with this true legend,""the group said in a tweet,external. Flying Lotus, whose real name is Steven Ellison,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Blessed journey into the infinite. RIP Lee 'Scratch' Perry."" Rapper Lupe Fiasco also remembered Perry,tweeting,external: ""African blood is flowing through I veins so I and I shall never fade away."" Glastonbury Festival's Emily Eavis hailed the singer as a ""musical genius"". Eavis tweeted,external: ""RIP the almighty Lee 'Scratch' Perry, musical genius, free spirit and a regular Glastonbury performer. We shall miss him."" Perry was born in rural Jamaica in 1936 and moved to the capital Kingston in the early 1960s. In a 1984 interview with NME magazine, he said: ""My father worked on the road, my mother in the fields. We were very poor. I went to schoolâ¦ I learned nothing at all. Everything I have learned has come from nature."" He started his music career in the 1950s as an assistant at a reggae music label, before moving up to become a recording artist with the same label. Over the next seven decades Perry went on to work with a number of fellow music legends, including Bob Marley and the Beastie Boys. Perry, pictured in 1984, said everything he learned had ""come from nature"" He also won a Grammy in 2002, was nominated four other times - in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014 - and received a Jamaican national honour, the Order of Distinction. In a 2010 interview with Rolling Stone, Keith Richards described Perry as ""the Salvador Dali of music"". ""He's a mystery. The world is his instrument. You just have to listen,"" Richards said. ""More than a producer, he knows how to inspire the artist's soul."" Electronic group The Prodigy shared a photo of Perry on Twitter showing him at a mixing desk. Allow Twitter content?

If Bob Marley was the face and voice of reggae, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry was its soul. He was a towering figure despite his diminutive stature and eccentric appearance, but his influence was much deeper than most reggae fans realise. Much like Nile Rodgers, he was the producer and brains behind many songs more famously sung by other people. And it was his spirit that converted Marley's band - The Wailers - from a rocksteady and ska trio to a much more bass-fuelled, political and spiritual group, a process later accelerated by Chris Blackwell. Shamanistic and reliably stoned, ""Scratch"" nevertheless had a remarkable work ethic. He fell out with many of his collaborators, including the great Studio One boss Coxsone Dodd, and indeed The Wailers, though he and Marley would later reconcile. But by coming to the height of his powers in late 1960s and 1970s Jamaica, he was a charismatic engineer and catalyst for the group of artists who produced much of the best music of the 20th Century.

GPs warn of hard choices amid blood test shortage,"GPs are having to make difficult choices about which patients get blood tests because of the ongoing shortage of test tubes, doctors are warning. The vials used for blood tests are currently in short supply - and the NHS in England and Wales is temporarily stopping all non-urgent testing. Doctors say they are in a ""perilous"" situation and want more clarity about how long the shortage will last. The government says it is working flat out with the supplier. There are currently global shortages of blood tube products and company Becton Dickinson - which makes vials for the health service - is among those facing serious supply chain issues. Becton Dickinson said it had seen record demand for its blood collection tubes in recent months, partly driven by the need for tests for Covid patients. It also said it was facing issues transporting the tubes, for example, challenges at the UK border. Because of the shortage, the NHS in England and Wales has told surgeries and hospitals to temporarily stop some blood testing - with patients told they will only be able to get tests if they are urgent. The tests put on hold include those for fertility, allergies and pre-diabetes - and the shortage will likely worsen over the next few weeks and last until mid-September,NHS England said. Charities 'concerned' over blood test postponements NHS blood test tube shortage set to worsen Geraldine Gray, 65, from Nottingham, told the BBC the problems had been going on for several weeks. She had a blood test booked two weeks ago to diagnose a potential blood disorder, but it was cancelled. ""The day before I was due to have it, a receptionist rang up and said they were having to cancel certain blood tests... and the doctors had been through the lists looking at the ones that they thought were non-urgent."" ""It's annoying,"" she said, of not being able to have the diagnostic test. ""It's not a cancer blood test, it's not diabetes. But it's something it would be good to know I haven't got."" Another woman, Alison Webb, told the BBC earlier this week that she cannot have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the shortages - and her tests are already overdue by four months. ""Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,"" she said. Alison Webb's blood tests have been delayed by four months due to the shortages But doctors have said the guidance issued to them is vague, and it is not always easy to decide what tests are essential. ""No doctor knowingly undertakes unnecessary blood tests and to now have to ration all those we are doing, as well as cancel hundreds more, goes against everything we stand for as clinicians,"" said Dr David Wrigley from the British Medical Association, which represents doctors. ""However, if we don't try to follow the NHS guidance, it's clear we will get to the point where even the most clinically urgent of blood tests may not be able to be done as we simply won't have the tubes for the blood to go into."" He said doctors and their patients had been put in a ""terrible, unenviable position"" and he thought it was "" surprising that NHS England hasn't declared a critical incident"". Another GP, Dr Farah Jameel, from north London, said: ""There will be some patients who absolutely must have blood tests, and I have got to make that decision and seek understanding from patients who perhaps could wait a bit longer."" Becton Dickinson said the supply disruption was also affecting other companies. It said it took its responsibility to provide consistent supply ""very seriously"" and that it was taking steps to boost supply and divert products from other regions to help the UK. On Thursday, the NHS warned supply was ""forecasted to become even more constrained over the coming weeks"". ""While it is anticipated that the position will improve from the middle of September, overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period,"" it said in a letter to doctors. Alternative products are being sought, it said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said patient safety was a ""top priority"" and it was working closely with the NHS and devolved administrations to minimise any impact on patient care.

Reggae icon Lee 'Scratch' Perry dies aged 85,"Perry is known for his pioneering work in dub Tributes have been paid to the legendary Jamaican singer and music producer Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, who has died at the age of 85. He died in hospital in Lucea, north-west Jamaica, local media reported. Perry is known for his pioneering experiments in dub, which revolutionised not only reggae, but also hip hop, dance and other genres. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called him ""unforgettable"" and praised his ""sterling contribution"" to music. The Beastie Boys, who first worked with Perry when he opened for them in Japan in 1996 before they joined forces on the track Dr Lee PhD as party of 1998's Hello Nasty album, hailed the musician's ""pioneering spirit"". ""We are truly grateful to have been inspired by and collaborated with this true legend,""the group said in a tweet,external. Flying Lotus, whose real name is Steven Ellison,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Blessed journey into the infinite. RIP Lee 'Scratch' Perry."" Rapper Lupe Fiasco also remembered Perry,tweeting,external: ""African blood is flowing through I veins so I and I shall never fade away."" Glastonbury Festival's Emily Eavis hailed the singer as a ""musical genius"". Eavis tweeted,external: ""RIP the almighty Lee 'Scratch' Perry, musical genius, free spirit and a regular Glastonbury performer. We shall miss him."" Perry was born in rural Jamaica in 1936 and moved to the capital Kingston in the early 1960s. In a 1984 interview with NME magazine, he said: ""My father worked on the road, my mother in the fields. We were very poor. I went to schoolâ¦ I learned nothing at all. Everything I have learned has come from nature."" He started his music career in the 1950s as an assistant at a reggae music label, before moving up to become a recording artist with the same label. Over the next seven decades Perry went on to work with a number of fellow music legends, including Bob Marley and the Beastie Boys. Perry, pictured in 1984, said everything he learned had ""come from nature"" He also won a Grammy in 2002, was nominated four other times - in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014 - and received a Jamaican national honour, the Order of Distinction. In a 2010 interview with Rolling Stone, Keith Richards described Perry as ""the Salvador Dali of music"". ""He's a mystery. The world is his instrument. You just have to listen,"" Richards said. ""More than a producer, he knows how to inspire the artist's soul."" Electronic group The Prodigy shared a photo of Perry on Twitter showing him at a mixing desk. Allow Twitter content?

If Bob Marley was the face and voice of reggae, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry was its soul. He was a towering figure despite his diminutive stature and eccentric appearance, but his influence was much deeper than most reggae fans realise. Much like Nile Rodgers, he was the producer and brains behind many songs more famously sung by other people. And it was his spirit that converted Marley's band - The Wailers - from a rocksteady and ska trio to a much more bass-fuelled, political and spiritual group, a process later accelerated by Chris Blackwell. Shamanistic and reliably stoned, ""Scratch"" nevertheless had a remarkable work ethic. He fell out with many of his collaborators, including the great Studio One boss Coxsone Dodd, and indeed The Wailers, though he and Marley would later reconcile. But by coming to the height of his powers in late 1960s and 1970s Jamaica, he was a charismatic engineer and catalyst for the group of artists who produced much of the best music of the 20th Century.

Suit you sir? Not anymore at some M&S stores,"M&S made suits for England's football team, including Jordan Henderson and Jack Grealish, ahead of the Euro 2020 tournament Marks & Spencer no longer sells men's suits at more than half of its 254 bigger stores as the pandemic hit ""fast forward"" on the trend for casual wear. It said men's preferences were already shifting to ""smart separates"" such as chinos and shirts before coronavirus. But Wes Taylor, director of menswear at M&S, said: ""Covid hit fast forward on the trend to more casual dressing that was already in train."" Now the retailer only sells men's suits at 110 large shops. In total, sales of them in the UK have fallen by 2.3 million over five years, according to the market research firm Kantar Group. It said men purchased two million of them in the year to July compared to 4.3 million for the same period in 2017. The decline in M&S stores selling men's suits, which wasfirst reported in The Sunday Times,external, was already being seen in 2019 when the retailer said sales fell by seven per cent. However, in the first two months of the Covid pandemic, when millions of people were forced to work from home, M&S said it sold just 7,500 suits - a fall of 80% compared to the same period in the previous year. In contrast, it said, ""shorts and jogger sales were up"". Mr Taylor said: ""During the pandemic we worked hard to adapt our product offer to be more relevant to customers' rapidly changing needs."" M&S says the casual wear trend was growing before the pandemic While M&S says it has seen some increase in demand following theeasing of Covid restrictionsand weddings now being allowed to take place, Mr Taylor said: ""Our Smartwear is now more focused on smart separates - easy to wear, stylish smart clothing that can be worn in lots of different ways"". The average spend on men's suits has also declined over the past decade, according to Kantar, from a high of Â£534m in 2011. Some five years ago, spending on men's suits hit Â£469m but fell to just Â£159m in the 12 months to July. Kantar said that although there has also been a fall in sales of women's suits over five years, it is less pronounced than men's professional wear. In the year to July, women bought 500,000 of them compared to 600,000 in 2017. M&S said it continues to sell ties and shirts at its 254 larger stores which offer clothing as well as food. M&S has around 700 stores in total, the majority of which are food-only but people who buy suits online can have them delivered to any of its shops. The retailer also launched an online video consultation service during the pandemic for men seeking advice on buying suits.

Sunday's events as they happened,"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control.

Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

Hurricane Ida makes landfall in Louisiana,"This video can not be played Watch: Wind gusts of up to 172mph and heavy rain pummelled Louisiana Louisiana residents may be in the dark for weeks as officials take stock of the damage from Hurricane Ida. Ida made landfall on Sunday with 150mph (240km/h) winds, the fifth strongest to ever hit the US mainland. About one million locals remain without power. ""It's going to be a difficult life for quite some time,"" said one local leader in the Greater New Orleans area. About 5,000 National Guard members have been deployed to aid search and rescue. In addition, more than 25,000 workers from around the country have mobilised to support power restoration in the state, according to CNN. At least one person is dead after a tree fell on their home in Ascension Parish, in Louisiana's Baton Rouge area. State and local officials have conceded that number is likely to grow as search and rescue efforts continue, but argued the city had largely ""held the line"". ""The systems we depended on to save lives and protect our city did just that and we are grateful, but there is so much more work to be done,"" said New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Monday. She urged residents who had already evacuated their homes to stay put and not return until power and communications have been restored. As the slow-moving Ida continues to move inland, it has weakened to a tropical storm - but the National Hurricane Centre warned that heavy rain could still bring flooding to parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Ida was previously deemed ""life-threatening"", drawing comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, a 2005 storm that had a path similar to Ida and killed 1,800 people. But it seemed that New Orleans' flood defences, strengthened in Katrina's aftermath, have done their job. Governor John Bel Edwards said the levee systems had ""performed magnificently"" and none have thus far been breached. ""But the damage is still catastrophic,"" he acknowledged on Monday. ""We are still in a life saving mode."" In pictures: Hurricane Ida lashes Gulf Coast President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state, releasing extra funds for rescue and recovery efforts. On Monday, he pledged that the federal government would ""stand with the people of the Gulf [Coast] for as long as it takes for you to recover"". Entergy, the largest power company in Louisiana, warned that it would take days - and likely weeks in the hardest hit areas - to restore electricity to the more than one million homes without power across the state. This video can not be played Watch Hurricane Ida blow the roof off a Louisiana hospital Ida gathered strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico during the weekend. More than 90% of oil production there has been shut down as a result of the storm. On Sunday, Ida made landfall south of New Orleans as a category four hurricane - meaning it would cause severe damage to buildings, trees and power lines.As it moves inland, Ida's winds have dropped to 95mph (153km/h),external, meaning it is now a category one storm. There are still fears of storm surges along the coast - which could be as high as 16ft (4.8m), potentially submerging parts of the low-lying coastline. By Nada Tawfik, BBC News In New Orleans, the sun is now shining. While that might sound lovely, sweltering conditions are less than ideal when residents and businesses lack power and water. With a lengthy wait to restore utilities many residents are now scrambling to make a post-storm evacuation. There has been significant property damage as well. Jazz icon Louis Armstrong's second home, a small brick structure, is now just a pile of bricks. Still, residents talk about how they got lucky after Hurricane Katrina's disastrous death toll. The picture changes once you head to low lying areas outside of New Orleans's hurricane protection system. The situation there is more desperate as people wait atop their roofs and inside their attics to be saved from the water. Some of the roads are impassable and unsafe due to downed power lines and flooding. Reaching the most vulnerable in these conditions will be challenging but resources are now pouring in. In Jefferson Parish, I met Clarence Sinceno, an older man who has lived in his home there for 50 years. He says Ida was the worst storm he's lived through. Throughout the night, he and his family kept moving to different parts of the house as leaks turned into holes. The intense winds tore off sections of his roof and the sheet rock and insulation completely collapsed. Covid-19 has also further complicated efforts to keep people safe. Louisiana hospitals are already under pressure from Covid-19, as the state has the third-highest rate of infections in the US. Normally, hospitals in the predicted path of the hurricane would be evacuated, but this time there are few beds available, even at facilities further inland. ""We don't have any place to bring those patients. Not in state, not out of state,"" Mr Edwards said. Ida came ashore on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a category three storm when it made landfall. This video can not be played Storm Ida to bring further heavy rain and strong winds Since then, billions of dollars have been spent on flood defences, known as levees. So far, the levees have held, though a flash flood warning is in place for New Orleans. High winds tore part of the roof off a hospital in the town of Cut Off, Louisiana, just inland from the Gulf of Mexico. The hospital said it had suffered ""significant damage"" but that its patients were safe. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms."" The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above, making more energy available to drive hurricanes. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. How has Hurricane Ida affected you?

Three injured in festival fairground ride incident,"Emergency crews were called to the scene on Saturday evening A woman has been critically injured and two others were seriously hurt after an incident involving a fairground ride at a festival in Cumbria. It happened at Fudstock, which was being held at Cavendish Park, Barrow, on Saturday at around 20:30 BST. Two of those injured were said to have been on the ride at the time, and two women and a man were taken to hospital. Cumbria Police and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are conducting a joint investigation into what happened. All three people who were injured were taken to Furness General Hospital and the critically-injured woman was later transferred to Royal Preston Hospital. A second woman and a man who sustained serious injuries have been discharged. No further details about those who have been injured have been released. Festival organisers praised the ""amazing"" efforts of security staff who organised a mass evacuation of the site, which had around 3,000 people there, as well as the emergency teams who attended. The community event was launched in memory of Richard Thorne, who was known as Fud ""Unfortunately there was a serious incident at the end of the night involving three people on one of the fairground rides,""they wrote on Facebook.,external ""Our thoughts and best wishes are with those involved, as we await further news. ""We appreciate this is upsetting and we'd ask people to be kind and not speculate out of respect to the families and friends."" Police, ambulance, fire and air ambulance teams attended the scene, and a cordon has been put in place at the site. A spokeswoman for the HSE said it was aware of the incident and was making inquiries. Fudstock, which is a community event, launched in 2018 in memory of Barrow man Richard Thorne - known as Fud - who died from bowel cancer aged just 38, and whose dream it was to create a festival in his hometown.

Suits you sir? Not anymore at some M&S stores,"M&S made suits for England's football team, including Jordan Henderson and Jack Grealish, ahead of the Euro 2020 tournament Marks & Spencer no longer sells men's suits at more than half of its 254 bigger stores as the pandemic hit ""fast forward"" on the trend for casual wear. It said men's preferences were already shifting to ""smart separates"" such as chinos and shirts before coronavirus. But Wes Taylor, director of menswear at M&S, said: ""Covid hit fast forward on the trend to more casual dressing that was already in train."" Now the retailer only sells men's suits at 110 large shops. In total, sales of them in the UK have fallen by 2.3 million over five years, according to the market research firm Kantar Group. It said men purchased two million of them in the year to July compared to 4.3 million for the same period in 2017. The decline in M&S stores selling men's suits, which wasfirst reported in The Sunday Times,external, was already being seen in 2019 when the retailer said sales fell by seven per cent. However, in the first two months of the Covid pandemic, when millions of people were forced to work from home, M&S said it sold just 7,500 suits - a fall of 80% compared to the same period in the previous year. In contrast, it said, ""shorts and jogger sales were up"". Mr Taylor said: ""During the pandemic we worked hard to adapt our product offer to be more relevant to customers' rapidly changing needs."" M&S says the casual wear trend was growing before the pandemic While M&S says it has seen some increase in demand following theeasing of Covid restrictionsand weddings now being allowed to take place, Mr Taylor said: ""Our Smartwear is now more focused on smart separates - easy to wear, stylish smart clothing that can be worn in lots of different ways"". The average spend on men's suits has also declined over the past decade, according to Kantar, from a high of Â£534m in 2011. Some five years ago, spending on men's suits hit Â£469m but fell to just Â£159m in the 12 months to July. Kantar said that although there has also been a fall in sales of women's suits over five years, it is less pronounced than men's professional wear. In the year to July, women bought 500,000 of them compared to 600,000 in 2017. M&S said it continues to sell ties and shirts at its 254 larger stores which offer clothing as well as food. M&S has around 700 stores in total, the majority of which are food-only but people who buy suits online can have them delivered to any of its shops. The retailer also launched an online video consultation service during the pandemic for men seeking advice on buying suits.

LiveLiveAttack warning as Kabul airlift enters final days1 minute ago,"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned.

A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule.

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

LiveLiveAttack warning as Kabul airlift enters final days7 minutes ago,"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction.

Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said.

""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Another Kabul airport attack likely, Biden warnsThe US president says commanders have told him another attack could happen within the next 36 hours.","These evacuees made it on the last flight to Italy Another attack on Kabul airport is highly likely, US President Joe Biden has warned, saying commanders have told him it could come as early as Sunday. The state department has urged all US citizens to leave the area,externalnear the airport because of a ""specific, credible threat"". The US is continuing evacuations but the final UK troops, diplomats and officials have now left Kabul. A suicide bombing near the airport on Thursday resulted in some 170 deaths. A local branch of the Islamic State group - Islamic State in Khorasan Province (IS-K) - claimed the attack. In retaliation, the US carried out a drone strike on eastern Afghanistan late on Friday, saying it had killed two ""high-profile"" IS-K members. The two are described as a planner and a facilitator. It is unclear whether they were directly involved in planning the Kabul airport attack. ""This strike was not the last. We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack and make them pay,"" Mr Biden said in a statement released on Saturday. IS-K is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan and has major differences with the Taliban, who now control most of the country. It accuses them of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement with the Americans. The Taliban condemned the air strike, saying the Americans should have consulted them first, a spokesman told Reuters news agency. This video can not be played âI helped the US, now my family is at riskâ The next few days of the US evacuation operation are likely to be the most dangerous since it began, White House officials say. US troops have begun their withdrawal from the airport - their numbers are now down to 4,000, from a peak of 5,800 in the past week. One Western security official told Reuters that US forces were in the final phase, although a time for the end of the operation had yet to be decided. Just over 1,000 civilians remain to be airlifted, the official said. A Taliban official told Reuters their technical experts and engineers were ready to take over the airport when they were given the ""final nod from the Americans"". The Taliban have set up further layers of checkpoints around the airport and are not allowing most Afghans through, the Associated Press adds. In all, more than 110,000 people - both Afghans and foreign nationals - have been evacuated from Kabul airport since the airlift began two weeks ago. US Marine Sgt Nicole Gee, 23, was one of 13 US service personnel killed On Saturday, Italy's final flight from Afghanistan arrived in Rome. Italy said it had evacuated almost 5,000 Afghan citizens from Kabul - the highest number of any EU country. France said it had flown out more than 2,800 since 17 August, while Germany said it had taken about 4,000 Afghans. The head of the UK's armed forces, General Sir Nick Carter, said it was ""heartbreaking"" that they had not been able to rescue everyone. Final UK troops leave Afghanistan Saturday's events as they unfolded Where will all the Afghan refugees go? France and Britain will urge the UN to create a ""safe zone"" in Kabul to help evacuation efforts, French President Emmanuel Macron said. He said it would allow the international community to carry out humanitarian work and ""maintain pressure on the Taliban"". Crowds have gathered outside banks as people try to withdraw cash Since the Taliban took Kabul on 15 August, the Afghan economy has been in freefall as aid donors freeze funds and panicked depositors seek to withdraw their money from banks. On Saturday crowds of protesters gathered outside banks in the Afghan capital. ""If the situation continues and employees of the government don't get their salaries and a businessman cannot get his money from the bank for trading, the result of this is very horrible, and there will be poverty in the society as well, and no-one can solve that issue,"" one man told Reuters.

GPs warn of hard choices amid blood test shortageDoctors call for more guidance after the NHS in England and Wales stops all non-urgent blood tests.Health,"GPs are having to make difficult choices about which patients get blood tests because of the ongoing shortage of test tubes, doctors are warning. The vials used for blood tests are currently in short supply - and the NHS in England and Wales is temporarily stopping all non-urgent testing. Doctors say they are in a ""perilous"" situation and want more clarity about how long the shortage will last. The government says it is working flat out with the supplier. There are currently global shortages of blood tube products and company Becton Dickinson - which makes vials for the health service - is among those facing serious supply chain issues. Becton Dickinson said it had seen record demand for its blood collection tubes in recent months, partly driven by the need for tests for Covid patients. It also said it was facing issues transporting the tubes, for example, challenges at the UK border. Because of the shortage, the NHS in England and Wales has told surgeries and hospitals to temporarily stop some blood testing - with patients told they will only be able to get tests if they are urgent. The tests put on hold include those for fertility, allergies and pre-diabetes - and the shortage will likely worsen over the next few weeks and last until mid-September,NHS England said. Charities 'concerned' over blood test postponements NHS blood test tube shortage set to worsen Geraldine Gray, 65, from Nottingham, told the BBC the problems had been going on for several weeks. She had a blood test booked two weeks ago to diagnose a potential blood disorder, but it was cancelled. ""The day before I was due to have it, a receptionist rang up and said they were having to cancel certain blood tests... and the doctors had been through the lists looking at the ones that they thought were non-urgent."" ""It's annoying,"" she said, of not being able to have the diagnostic test. ""It's not a cancer blood test, it's not diabetes. But it's something it would be good to know I haven't got."" Another woman, Alison Webb, told the BBC earlier this week that she cannot have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the shortages - and her tests are already overdue by four months. ""Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,"" she said. Alison Webb's blood tests have been delayed by four months due to the shortages But doctors have said the guidance issued to them is vague, and it is not always easy to decide what tests are essential. ""No doctor knowingly undertakes unnecessary blood tests and to now have to ration all those we are doing, as well as cancel hundreds more, goes against everything we stand for as clinicians,"" said Dr David Wrigley from the British Medical Association, which represents doctors. ""However, if we don't try to follow the NHS guidance, it's clear we will get to the point where even the most clinically urgent of blood tests may not be able to be done as we simply won't have the tubes for the blood to go into."" He said doctors and their patients had been put in a ""terrible, unenviable position"" and he thought it was "" surprising that NHS England hasn't declared a critical incident"". Another GP, Dr Farah Jameel, from north London, said: ""There will be some patients who absolutely must have blood tests, and I have got to make that decision and seek understanding from patients who perhaps could wait a bit longer."" Becton Dickinson said the supply disruption was also affecting other companies. It said it took its responsibility to provide consistent supply ""very seriously"" and that it was taking steps to boost supply and divert products from other regions to help the UK. On Thursday, the NHS warned supply was ""forecasted to become even more constrained over the coming weeks"". ""While it is anticipated that the position will improve from the middle of September, overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period,"" it said in a letter to doctors. Alternative products are being sought, it said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said patient safety was a ""top priority"" and it was working closely with the NHS and devolved administrations to minimise any impact on patient care. ""The health and care system continues to work flat out with the supplier and stakeholders to put mitigations in place, and restore normal supply, and there continues to be stock in place.""
