US jails begin releasing prisoners amid pandemicHigh profile inmates like ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen are among those who have asked for early release.US & Canada,"New York is to release prisoners who are most vulnerable to coronavirus infection US jails are to let out inmates as cases of coronavirus infections are being reported in prisons. New York City is releasing ""vulnerable"" prisoners, the mayor said on Wednesday, days after Los Angeles and Cleveland freed hundreds of inmates. Prison reform advocates say those in jail are at higher risk of catching and passing on Covid-19. There have been more than 9,400 cases of Covid-19 and 152 deaths in the US so far, according to estimates. Globally there are some 220,000 confirmed cases and over 8,800 deaths. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday that city officials will this week identify individuals for release, including people who were arrested for minor crimes and those most vulnerable to infection due to underlying health problems. His announcement came hours after a guard and a prisoner tested positive for coronavirus at Rikers Island prison, where disgraced former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, 68, is a high-profile inmate. Weinstein will be moved to a different state prison, an official said on Wednesday. Other New York prisons, such as Sing Sing, have had inmates test positive for coronavirus andone employee for the state's corrections department has died from it,external. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reduced its inmate population by 600 in the last two weeks, officials said on Tuesday. ""Our population within our jails is a vulnerable population just by who they are, where they are located, so we're protecting that population from potential exposure,"" Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters earlier this week. The LA County jail system is the largest prison system in the world with an average population of around 22,000 prisoners. Mr Villaneuva disclosed that arrests in the county are also down, from an average of 300 per weekend to only 60 in mid-March. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

DOING GOOD:Kind Canadians start 'caremongering' trend Cuyahoga County, Ohio, where the city of Cleveland is located, has also released hundreds of prisoners due to coronavirus concerns. Judges held emergency hearings through the weekend to work out plea deals and other agreements to allow prisoners to be released early or without serving time. Several states from New York to California are now banning in-person visitors. A ban on visits led to a deadly prison riot in Italy last week. Federal agencies will postpone most arrests and deportations during the coronavirus crisis.

Iran has already released 85,000 people, including political prisoners, in an effort to combat the pandemic. The US locks up more of its citizens per capita than any other country, with an estimated 2.3 million people behind bars in federal, state and local prisons. Some high profile convicts have argued for early release over coronavirus fears.

UK interest rates slashed to lowest level ever,"The Bank of England has cut interest rates again in an emergency move as it tries to support the UK economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the second cut in interest rates in just over a week, bringing them down to 0.1% from 0.25%. Interest rates are now at the lowest ever in the Bank's 325-year history. The Bank said it would also increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by Â£200bn with an effort to lower the cost of borrowing. It's a dramatic move by Andrew Bailey, who only took over from Mark Carney as Bank of England governor on Monday. Last week, the Bank announced a 0.5% cut in rates to 0.25% and a package of measures to help businesses and individuals cope with the economic damage caused by the virus. The move coincided with additional measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Budget. Coronavirus: How the Bank rate cuts affect you Bank of England boss: Don't fire people UK interest rates cut in emergency move However, the Bank said the measures it had taken so far were not going to be enough, and believed ""a further package of measures was warranted"". ""The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but should be temporary,"" it added. The move comes as international investors are trying to secure more cash, in particular dollars. This means they're ditching assets such as UK government gilts, which are the ""IOU"" notes the government hands over to private investors willing to lend it money. As the gilts are sold, the price drops and the yield - the effective interest rate compared to the price - rises. What that means is the cost of borrowing to private investors as well as to the government rises - just when the Bank of England wants it to fall and the government is about to borrow huge sums. The Bank of England's plan to buy Â£200bn more bonds is aimed at fighting that effect. The fresh rate cut takes interest rates to the lowest they can feasibly go, said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group. ""Lower rates and additional quantitative easing can keep markets satisfied and borrowing costs for both businesses and the government down but unless money is forced into the hands of small businesses soon, then it will be for nothing; they are the ones laying off staff due to a liquidity shock,"" he added. Karen Ward, chief European market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: The support to the economy and health system will require vastly higher government borrowing. The central bank showing willing to buy government debt will ensure the market can absorb this additional issuance without undue stress."" The Bank of England Governor has said today's second emergency rate cut in just over a week occurred after financial markets became ""borderline disorderly"", with fears about coronavirus leading to a rush into the US dollar away from sterling and lending to the UK government. ""We've seen very sharp moves in financial markets in the last few days, which is the pace of which frankly, was increasing very rapidly. And we were moving into conditions that were if not disorderly, frankly, bordering on disorderly let me put it that way,"" Andrew Bailey told journalists. The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee had an emergency call this morning so that rate cuts and further ""quantitative easing"" could be agreed and announced, with the Bank needing to be ""on the offensive"" because: ""We can't wait for the hard economic data it will be too late by then"", he said. He said he had seen a range of private forecasts about the economic impact of the current crisis: ""We don't have a precise forecast - every picture we look at has a very sharp V in it"". The governor also partly blamed rumours that appeared to emerge from Westminster of a shutdown to London for adding to the volatility in markets that saw sterling fall 5% against the dollar. Such a shutdown would be likely to impact on the functioning of the City. He said: ""I do have to say that, you know, there were rumours going on the market this time yesterday that there was going to be a lockdown in London. And I'd observe that did cause market prices to start moving around at that point. But I think the government has been clear, and it's clear that that is not the intention at the moment."" The governor also said that he had already intervened to try to get loans to businesses to keep people in employment, and he said the Bank had its thinking cap on as regards further monetary boosts it can make. He reiterated his lack of enthusiasm for zero or negative interest rates because of their impact on the banking system's capacity to lend, and suggested that was the reason for limiting the cut to an unusual 0.15% (rather than the usual 0.25% or 0.5%) to a record low of 0.1%.

PM: We can 'turn the tide' on coronavirus crisis,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""This is going to be finite - we will turn the tide around and see how to do it, within the next 12 weeks"" The UK can ""turn the tide"" on the coronavirus crisis within 12 weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. But pressed on what he meant by the three-month timescale, he said he did not know how long it would go on for. He said trials on a vaccine were expected to begin within a month and warned he would ""enforce"" Londoners to be kept apart ""if necessary"". Earlier, in a message to the nation, theQueen urged people to come together for the common good. Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I believe that a combination of the measures that we're asking the public to take and better testing, scientific progress, will enable us to get on top of it within the next 12 weeks and turn the tide. ""I cannot stand here and tell you that by the end of June that we will be on the downward slope. ""It's possible but I simply can't say that that's for certain,"" he added. ""We don't know how long this thing will go on for. But what I can say is that this is going to be finite."" Kuenssberg: UK's already huge changes may just be the start When will the coronavirus outbreak end? Earlier Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific officer, was also asked how long it would go on for. ""We are dealing with a brand new virus.  We are dealing with learning as we go on and I think now to put absolute timelines on things is not possible."" In the press conference on Thursday evening, Mr Johnson  ruled out closing down public transport in London but pointed out people in some parts of London were not following government guidance on social distancing and would be ""enforced"" to do so if necessary. ""I know how difficult it may be or it may seem right now, but if we do this together, we will save many, many thousands of lives,"" he added. He also urged businesses to stand by their employees ""because we will stand by you"", adding that his chancellor would be making further announcements on Friday. Later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to rush protective personal equipment (PPE) to frontline NHS staff and social care providers,following concern workers were being put at risk by shortages. Speaking on BBC1's Question Time, Mr Hancock said the UK had shipped 2.6 million masks and 10,000 bottles of hand sanitiser in the last 24 hours. He promised that ""overnight 150 hospitals will get the next pack of protective equipment they needâ¦ every single hospital will get their next batch of equipment before Sunday night"". He also confirmed social care providers would get a package of personal protective equipment by the end of next week. In response to a government appeal for more ventilator makers, 1,400 companies had offered to switch their operations to help manufacturer them, including Formula One, he said. He added that officials would work with leading companies to radically increase the number of coronavirus tests, after the government pledged25,000 tests per day within four weeks. He also said the government has bought a test which can detect whether someone has had coronavirus - and their immunity to it. The press conference came as Italy's death toll rose by 427 to 3,405, overtaking China's toll. In the UK, 144 people with coronavirus have died, and 3,269 people have tested positive for it. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Speaking alongside the PM, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, warned there would be a ""lag"" before the public's efforts to stem the spread of the virus would slow down case numbers. He said there would be a ""global issue"" in the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), saying NHS workers were right to complain about the shortages. In other developments across the globe: The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tests positive for the virus France and Italy could extend lockdowns Asian countries are seeing a second wave of infectionsfrom people returning home UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said a number of British nationals - estimated at about 400, were trapped in Peru because of restrictions imposed in the country Confirmed cases worldwide have passed 220,000, while almost 9,000 people have died The Cannes Film Festival, due to be held in May, is postponed The Queen, who is now in Windsor Castle with the Duke of Edinburgh, said in her statement that the world was ""entering a period of great uncertainty"" and every individual had ""a vitally important part to play"". ""Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe - I am certain we are up to that challenge,"" she added. ""You can be assured that my family and I stand ready to play our part."" Even if the tide starts to turn in 12 weeks and the number of cases starts to fall, then we will still be far from the end. It can take a long time for the tide to go out. It is clear the current strategy of shutting down large parts of society is not sustainable in the long-term. But the coronavirus is not going to disappear. For as long as large numbers of people in the UK have no immunity then cases will soar as soon as restrictions are lifted. A vaccine would help, but that could be 18 months away. If enough people are exposed and become immune then that would help too, however, this is likely to take even longer than a vaccine. Efforts to rigorously test and then isolate anyone infected can help suppress the numbers of people infected. But this is what we were doing just a few weeks ago. We may enter a period of restrictions being lifted and then re-imposed until a long-term solution is found. From Friday, all schools in the UK will close their doors to nearly all pupils, except vulnerable ones and the children of key workers. A full list of key workers, likely to include NHS workers, school staff and delivery drivers, is expected later. In Wales, parents were told by education minister Kirsty Williams thatschools may not reopen until September. All summer exams in England, Wales andScotland have been cancelled. A level and GCSE exams in Northern Ireland will not go ahead this summerbut pupils will get results, the education minister Peter Weir said.

Netflix to lower streaming quality in Europe,"Netflix will slightly reduce the video quality on its service in Europe for the next 30 days, to reduce the strain on internet service providers. Demand for streaming has increased because large parts of Europe are self-isolating at home due to the coronavirus outbreak. The video-streaming provider said lowering the picture quality would reduce Netflix data consumption by 25%. But movies will still be high-definition or ultra-high definition 4K. The change will apply to the UK as well as other European countries. Several factors influence how much data is used when streaming a movie online. One of them is video resolution, including whether a video is high-definition (HD) or ultra-high definition 4K. Another is bitrate, which influences how clear and smooth videos look when streamed online. Videos with a higher bitrate tend to look less ""blocky"" or pixelated, but use more data. Out of these two, Netflix says it will cut its streaming bitrates. Customers who pay for ultra-high definition 4K movies as part of their subscription will still be able to watch 4K films. The announcement came after a phone call with European officials. This video can not be played WATCH: How to safely clean your smartphone Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, had earlier said people should ""switch to standard definition when HD [high-definition] is not necessary"". An hour of standard definition video uses about 1GB of data, while HD can use up to 3GB an hour. Netflix also offers ultra-high definition 4K video for some of its programmes. Netflix's decision to reduce video bitrate by a quarter appears to be a compromise. ""Following the discussions between Commissioner Thierry Breton and [Netflix chief executive] Reed Hastings, and given the extraordinary challenges raised by the coronavirus, Netflix has decided to begin reducing bitrates across all our streams in Europe for 30 days,"" the company said. Commissioner Breton praised the  ""very prompt action"" Netflix took just hours after the phone call, saying it would ""preserve the smooth functioning of the internet during the Covid-19 crisis"". Netflix has not yet said whether the bitrate reduction will be applied to other areas such as North America. Internet usage has been heightened in the last few weeks as more people work from home and avoid going out. Telecoms giant Vodafone reported a 50% rise in internet use in Europe earlier this week. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that the platform was seeing ""big surges"" as users tried to stay connected with friends. The social media boss said the company typically saw its largest surge in use on New Year's Eve, but that recent demand had outpaced that.

EasyJet staff may no longer be given food on shifts,"Budget airline EasyJet has asked pilots and cabin crew to agree to sweeping changes in their terms and conditions, as part of its response to coronavirus. Among the proposed changes are a freeze on planned pay rises and a requirement to take three months of unpaid leave. The airline would also no longer provide food for crew during their shifts, only water. Unions told members they had failed to reach agreement with the airline and were working on counter-proposals. However, there remains a willingness to make concessions in order to avoid redundancies. Further talks between EasyJet and unions representing pilots and cabin crew are expected today. Meanwhile, EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren has defended the payment of Â£170m in dividends to shareholders, at a time when the company is seeking financial help from the government. EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren defended the dividend payments to shareholders (pictured in 2018) On Wednesday, EasyJet's recently-appointed chief operating officer Peter Bellew met delegates from the pilots' union Balpa and Unite, which represents cabin crew. Under discussion was a proposed ""coronavirus cooperation agreement"" setting out changes to employees' terms and conditions. It would be in force from 23 March 2020 until 15 November 2021. Both sides acknowledge that action is needed. Travel restrictions across Europe have forced it to cancel many of its flights and ground more than a third of its fleet. The airline needs to save cash, and the unions want to preserve jobs. However, sources say the proposals themselves provoked an angry response. The four-page document would allow the airline to cancel pay rises until 2021, make significant changes to working patterns, and allow it to defer pay rises for newly-promoted captains for six months. Pilots in particular seem aggrieved by the plan. According to messages seen by the BBC, negotiators agreed to reject it on the principle that there was ""no evidence that the current crisis warrants such an extensive change in terms and conditions for such a long period, particularly when so many of them are so critically linked to flight safety and fatigue"". Balpa has refused to comment, as the talks are ongoing. Unite, meanwhile, has taken a softer tone. The union denied reports it had told the airline that compulsory redundancies were preferable to the deal on the table. ""Unite is very much still in talks with EasyJet and it is totally untrue to suggest the union has rejected all the company's proposals"", it said in a statement. However, insiders told the BBC they shared concerns that the airline might be using the current crisis as an excuse to change working practices, and erode employees' pay and benefits in the long term. In a statement, the company said: ""EasyJet has met with its employee representatives in the UK to discuss how they can help the airline navigate through these unprecedented timesâ¦ ""Like all airlines we are taking every action to remove cost and non-critical expenditure from the business at every level to help mitigate the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic."" Airlines warn they may not survive without bailout Edinburgh Airport to cut 100 jobs over passenger number warnings Meanwhile, EasyJet's chief executive has told the BBC the company is asking for government loans to help it weather the crisis. He said the company was ""first and foremost"" trying to save cash. But he added: ""Since we don't know how long this thing will last we also think it's appropriate that we're also looking for financing being supported as well from the government."" Such support, he said, would take the form of ""loans on a commercial basis"". He defended a Â£170m dividend to shareholders, due to be made tomorrow, saying it had already been signed off - and the company was legally obliged to make the payment. EasyJet says Mr Lundgren, Mr Bellew and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Findlay have all elected to take a 20% cut in their monthly salary from April to June.

Free broadband call resisted by net providers,"Children are expected to use online educational resources while their schools are suspended Broadband providers are resisting calls to provide a free service to help people during the coronavirus outbreak. One head teacher had suggested that the government require the step to ensure children get access to online classes after schools are suspended. Such action could also encourage people over 70 without connections to sign up, so that they can video-chat with relatives during isolation periods. But a trade body warned the move might threaten delivery of a smooth service. The Internet Service Providers' Association (Ispa) said it was in ""very early"" talks with the government to help customers who become unable to continue paying their bills. ""Things are naturally developing extremely quickly at the moment, and Ispa plans to seek further guidance from government on these issues so that customers can remain connected to the internet during these unprecedented times,"" a spokesman added. Schools in Northern Ireland closed on Thursday, andthe same measure comes into effect across the rest of the UK from Friday. Many teachers have already set up ways to continue study via the net, and the BBC, among others, is working on other internet materials. ""Lots of companies have done really well in making their online resources free,"" Julie Greer, head teacher of Cherbourg primary school, in Eastleigh, Hampshire, told the Today Programme.Â ""Is now the time to offer free broadband to families across the country, so that actually all these online learning opportunities that schools are talking about can be accessible?"" ""Because if you've lost your job, the first thing you're going to need to cut is, potentially, your internet."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Until now, some people with no home connection have used public facilities to go online.But libraries and museums are also closing.Â In the US, some broadband providers - including Spectrum, Charter, and Comcast - are providing a free service to students and low-income families for 60 days amid the outbreak. In the UK, the Labour Partypledged free basic broadband in its last general election manifesto. But the Conservative government opted instead to commit money to improving fibre infrastructure,which customers would continue to pay for. About 80% of the UK population have a fixed-line broadband connection, a number that has held steady for years. Adding in mobile internet, 90% of people have access. Ispa has said that connecting millions more people at this point could potentially lead to slowdowns. However, TechUK - a body that represents the UK's wider technology industry - cast doubt on the idea that making broadband free would lead to a rush of new subscribers. ""There is no silver bullet to connecting the 10% of the population that don't use the internet on a day-to-day basis,"" said director Matthew Evans. ""Free broadband may seem like it will, but the far bigger challenges are in digital skills, attitude to the internet and physical ability to use digital devices."" He said the industry was already working on plans to help those ""unable to pay their bills to ensure they stay connected."" There is also already a low-cost schemeavailable to people claiming certain types of benefits,external, in the form of BT Basic and Broadband. However, it is limited to 15 gigabytes of data a month - which BT says would typically enable a user to do all the following each day: browse the internet for up to half an hour a day stream enough video to watch one standard definition film upload 100 photos to Instagram or Facebook listen to 100 music tracks (or 10 albums) play online games for an hour a week Twitter bans 'unsafe' coronavirus outbreak advice Coronavirus: Networks report surge in internet use Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Supermarkets 'drastically' cutting product ranges,"Supermarkets and their supply chains are beginning to buckle under the strain of customer behaviour in the face of coronavirus. Several chains are ""drastically cutting"" the product ranges in store. They also said they were telling their manufacturers to ignore making some products to focus on those for which there is greatest demand. Meanwhile, competition laws are being relaxed so shops can discuss stock levels and pool staff and resources. ""We currently sell 60 types of sausages - we are moving to a fraction of that,"" said one supermarket. Another said: ""We need to make food manufacture as efficient as possible - it makes no sense to pause to change packet sizes or change from one type of pasta to another. ""We have 20 different sizes and styles of pasta, we are moving that to six."" Morrisons have reduced their bakery lines from 17 to seven. While executives insisted there was no shortage of food, they were struggling to restock shelves fast enough. Meanwhile, online delivery services are running at ""maximum capacity"". Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Coronavirus: Will I be paid when I'm at home with the kids? Coronavirus: 'There isn't time. Firms are closing now' Meanwhile, the government has announced competition laws will be temporarily relaxed to allow supermarkets to pool resources and data. This means they can share distribution depots and delivery vans and discuss stock levels. They will also be able to pool staff to meet demand. Rules around drivers' hours have also been loosened to help shops can deliver more food to stores, while the 5p plastic bag charge is being waived for online orders to speed up deliveries.

Home Office 'ignorant of race' over Windrush,"The Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948 The Home Office showed âignorance and thoughtlessnessâ on the issue of race, a review of the Windrush scandal says. The long-awaited review comes after some of those who came to the UK from Commonwealth countries were wrongly told they were in Britain illegally. There was a âprofound institutional failureâ which turned thousands of peopleâs lives upside down, it said. Warnings about the âhostile environmentâ policy were ânot heededâ, the review concludes. Report writer Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, called on the government to provide an âunqualified apologyâ to those affected and the wider black African-Caribbean community. Speaking in the House of Commons Home Secretary Priti Patel said there was ""nothing I can say to undo the pain"" but added ""on behalf of this and successive governments I am truly sorry for the actions that span decades"". Ms Patel said people from the Windrush generation were subject to ""insensitive treatment by the very country they called home"". ""I am sorry that people's trust has been betrayed."" She added that those who were eligible would receive compensation. Who are the Windrush generation?,external In pictures: The pioneering Windrush generation,external Windrush: Call to review deportation of foreign-born offenders Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the home secretary that: ""People will believe her apology when they see her genuinely seek to implement the recommendations in the review."" Ms Abbott, whose mother was a member of the Windrush generation, said for those affected ""it isn't necessarily the money, the inconvenience or the tragedy of being deported, it is the insult to people who always believed they were British."" Theresa May, who was prime minister when the scandal came to light, added her own apology to the home secretary's. ""They [the Windrush generation] should not have been treated in this way,"" she said. The 275-page report says the âroot causeâ of the scandal can be traced back to legislation of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, some of which had âracial motivationsâ. âRace clearly played a part in what occurredâ, said Ms Williams, adding that some failings could be indicators of âindirect discriminationâ. âThe factors that I identified demonstrate an institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation. âThese aspects were among those included in the elements of the definition of institutional racism considered in the Macpherson inquiry [which looked into the murder of Stephen Lawrence]. âOperational and organisational failingsâ at the Home Office had a âcausative impactâ on the âdetrimentalâ way Windrush migrants were treated. They were âcaught up in measures designed for people who have no right to be in the UKâ. Protests against deportation flights were held outside the Jamaican embassy in London this year She also found: The Home Office was fragmented and decision-making was ""siloed"" A target-dominated work environment within visas and immigration enforcement sections A lack of empathy in some cases along with dehumanising jargon and cliches Some senior civil servants and former ministers showed ignorance, lack of understanding and acceptance of the full extent of the injustice Changes to legal aid contributed to the scandal A history of prejudice towards black people and wider society also a factor Ms Williams says she spoke to former Home Secretaries Amber Rudd - who resigned over the affair in 2018 - Theresa May, Alan Johnson and Jacqui Smith. Commenting on speculation that the document has been watered down, with a finding that the Home Office is institutionally racist removed, she said: âIf anyone thinks Iâve pulled my punches Iâd be very surprised indeed.â Among 30 recommendations, the review says the Home Office should set up a full review of the hostile environment policy, appoint a Migrants Commissioner, develop a programme of cultural change for the department and establish a race advisory board. David Isaac, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the Windrush scandal had exposed ""deep flaws"" in the UK's immigration system. He added: ""This independent review underlines many of our serious and long-standing concerns about the impact of the government's hostile environment policies on some groups. These are highly significant findings and we will be using our legal powers so this does not happen again."" by Adina Campbell, BBC community affairs correspondent Todayâs review is a damning indictment of Home Office immigration policy which goes as far back as the 1960s, with race being a significant factor. This comprehensive report attempts to draw a line under the governmentâs woeful action but many Caribbean migrants have lost faith and fear the UK immigration system. Theyâve been put through years and in some cases decades of misery. Broken families, shattered careers and being denied NHS healthcare wonât be forgotten anytime soon. Meanwhile those who were wrongly deported or detained say the way theyâve been mistreated is unforgivable. The governmentâs compensation scheme has also been heavily criticised with victims claiming itâs taking too long to access the financial support theyâve been promised. Many of these communities have lost complete trust in the government and the chances of restoring it are slim. The Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948 An estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries have been called the Windrush generation, a reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents. Changes to immigration law in 2012 meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or even to remain in the UK. Some were held in detention or removed despite living in the country for decades, resulting in a furious backlash over their treatment. The scandal prompted criticism of ""hostile environment"" measures introduced to tackle illegal immigration.

"Four found guilty of neo-Nazi group membershipA ""Miss Hitler"" contest entrant is among four people convicted of being members of National Action.","Alice Cutter and Mark Jones were found guilty after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court A ""Miss Hitler"" contest entrant and her ex-partner have been convicted of being members of the banned far-right terrorist group National Action. Alice Cutter, 23, and Mark Jones, 25, were found guilty of being members of the neo-Nazi organisation after a retrial at Birmingham Crown Court. Garry Jack, 24, and 19-year-old Connor Scothern were also found guilty of being members of the group. All four will be sentenced at a later date. National Action, founded in 2013, was outlawed under anti-terror legislation three years later after it celebratedthe murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. Jones and Cutter were described as key members of National Action During their trial Cutter, from Sowerby Bridge, near Halifax, was described by prosecutors as a ""central spoke"" among the organisation's hardcore members, while Jones, also from Sowerby Bridge, was a ""leader and strategist"". Jurors heard how Cutter had entered the Miss Hitler beauty pageant under the name Miss Buchenwald - a reference to the Second World War death camp. They were also told how she had exchanged hundreds of messages, many racist and anti-Semitic, and was still meeting other members months after the ban. In an exchange with another National Action member a day after MP Mrs Cox was gunned down, Cutter wrote: ""Rot in hell, bitch."" She claimed not to have considered herself a member, even before the ban, despite attending meetings with group leaders and posing for a Nazi-style salute on the steps of Leeds Town Hall in 2016. Cutter also attended a demo in York in May 2016. Mr Jones had an ""original wedding edition"" of Mein Kampf Jones, a former member of the British National Party's youth wing, told jurors of his ""feelings of admiration"" for Hitler, while the court heard he had a special wedding edition of Mein Kampf. He also accepted that he posed for a photograph while holding a National Action flag and giving a Nazi-style salute in Buchenwald's execution chamber on a trip to Germany in 2016. Cutter and Jones embraced in the dock before being taken down to the cells. Garry Jack, Connor Scothern and Daniel Ward were also convicted or pleaded guilty to being National Action members Also convicted of the same offence were two other men; Garry Jack, 24, of Shard End, Birmingham, and 19-year-old Connor Scothern, from Nottingham. Self-confessed Nazi Jack was described as a foot soldier in the group, having joined six months before the ban. Scothern, who was a one-time practising Muslim, and an Antifa - anti-fascist activist - before eventually joining National Action, did not give evidence at trial. But in messages he sent following the ban in August 2017, he talked of setting up ""a clear and openly fascist youth movement"". A fifth man, Daniel Ward, 28 from Bartley Green, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to being a member of National Action last year and was jailed for three years. Det Ch Supt Kenny Bell, of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said: ""Being convicted of membership of this extreme right terrorist group is the same as belonging to other terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda or Daesh. ""They share a real toxic extreme ideology which is a danger to the public, the same ideology that we have seen manifested in the tragic attack in New Zealand, the murder of Jo Cox MP and the attack at Finsbury Park mosque in 2017. ""This group was amassing weapons and recipes for bomb-making. They communicated through secret channels to recruit others to their cause. Left unchecked they presented a real threat to the public.""

Europe looking to extend virus lockdowns,"Passers-by at the La Paz hospital in Madrid, as Spain experiences its fifth day of lockdown European nations are examining extending the lockdowns put in place to try to stem the coronavirus outbreak. A lockdown imposed on 12 March in Italy, where the number of deaths may soon overtake China, will now extend beyond the original 25 March end date. France said its 15-day lockdown might also be extended, with European leaders reluctant to give any deadline for an end to crisis measures. There have been 207,000 cases worldwide with more than 8,600 deaths. The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched an emergency â¬750bn ($820bn; Â£700bn) package to ease the impact of the pandemic, with boss Christine Lagarde tweeting ""there are no limits"" to its commitment to the euro. Europe's markets stabilised on opening, moving into positive territory, although Asian markets remained volatile with the Nikkei closing down 1%. LIVE:Latest updates from around the world EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW MEASURES:What is the UK advice? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? The EU has introduced strict border controls. Travellers from outside are being turned away from airports and borders after the 27-country bloc imposed a 30-day ban to halt the spread of coronavirus. But EU leaders also agreed that internal borders that have been erected in recent days should come down. Separately, the EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had tested positive for coronavirus. He said on Twitter: ""I am doing well and in good spirits."" It is unclear how the pandemic will affect Brexit talks. The latest round was delayed on Wednesday but the UK government said it would look at different ways to continue discussions. This video can not be played Dutch minister Bruno Bruins collapsed during a coronavirus debate, later blaming exhaustion Italy shut down most businesses and banned public gatherings nationwide on 12 March. But Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday: ""The measures we have taken... must be extended beyond their original deadline."" He said the measures had meant ""we have avoided the collapse of the system"". But he told Corriere della Sera that ""we will not be able to return immediately to life as it was before"" even when the measures ended. On Wednesday, Italy reported that 475 more people had died in just one day. Any similar figure on Thursday would see it pass China's official death toll of 3,130,according to an ongoing list supplied by Johns Hopkins,external. A report by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita into the deaths in Italy of 2,003 people confirmed to be positive for coronavirus found that three regions, all in the north, were by far the worst hit. Lombardy accounted for 71%, Emilia-Romagna 17% and Veneto 3.9%. None of 13 other regions had more than 2% of the total, and 10 of them had less than 1%. Some studies point to the large number of elderly in the affected regions, and that a large proportion of 18-34s live at home with them. Different demographics in other nations may help to keep the death toll lower. France began its lockdown on Tuesday morning, requiring citizens to carry official paperwork stating why they were not at home. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told Europe 1 radio on Thursday: ""The 15-day period may be extended. If necessary, the government will renew it."" This video can not be played The cruise ship cancellations have led to cleaner canals in Venice He said that 4,095 fines had been handed out to transgressors and 70,000 control checks made since Wednesday morning. The fine is â¬135 ($150; Â£123). ""Some people think they're some kind of modern-day hero when they break the rules - but they're imbeciles, and a danger to themselves,"" Mr Castaner said. Spain announced on Thursday its coronavirus deaths had risen by 169 to 767 in the past 24 hours, an increase of 28%. Its number of infected people rose by 3,431, reaching 17,147. Spain is the world's fourth-worst affected country and is under nationwide lockdown. German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed the nation on television on Wednesday, which she has previously only done for her annual New Year message. ""The situation is serious. Take it seriously. Not since German reunification, no, not since World War Two has our country faced a challenge that depends so much on our collective solidarity,"" she said. Germany has not imposed stringent measures, although it has closed schools and many businesses and public spaces. People can still go out and socialise but German media said her speech appeared to be a final warning to avoid mandatory lockdowns. Mrs Merkel did not announce new measures but said that could change at any time. On Thursday Germany reported that its number of coronavirus cases had increased to 10,999. The number of deaths there remains low but has risen to 20, the Robert Koch Institute said. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? The UK has also not imposed stringent lockdown measures as yetbut has announced schools will close. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he could not give any date for when they might reopen. London is the worst-affected area in the UK andhas now begun to slim down transport services. But the prime minister's spokesman said the government had no plans to bring in blanket travel restrictions for London or shut down the city's transport system. ""There is zero prospect of any restriction being placed on travelling in or out of London,"" he told reporters. He added that the police would maintain law and order, and there were no plans to use the military for this. Wednesday saw Russia report its first coronavirus-related death, a 79-year-old woman who died from pneumonia in Moscow. The country, which has reported only 147 cases, has temporarily barred entry to foreigners. It insists it has been transparent with its figures after some analysts questioned the low number.

"'We will save thousands of lives' if we act together, says PM","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""This is going to be finite - we will turn the tide around and see how to do it, within the next 12 weeks"" The UK can ""turn the tide"" on the coronavirus crisis within 12 weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. But pressed on what he meant by the three-month timescale, he said he did not know how long it would go on for. He said trials on a vaccine were expected to begin within a month and warned he would ""enforce"" Londoners to be kept apart ""if necessary"". Earlier, in a message to the nation, theQueen urged people to come together for the common good. Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I believe that a combination of the measures that we're asking the public to take and better testing, scientific progress, will enable us to get on top of it within the next 12 weeks and turn the tide. ""I cannot stand here and tell you that by the end of June that we will be on the downward slope. ""It's possible but I simply can't say that that's for certain,"" he added. ""We don't know how long this thing will go on for. But what I can say is that this is going to be finite."" Kuenssberg: UK's already huge changes may just be the start When will the coronavirus outbreak end? Earlier Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific officer, was also asked how long it would go on for. ""We are dealing with a brand new virus.  We are dealing with learning as we go on and I think now to put absolute timelines on things is not possible."" In the press conference on Thursday evening, Mr Johnson  ruled out closing down public transport in London but pointed out people in some parts of London were not following government guidance on social distancing and would be ""enforced"" to do so if necessary. ""I know how difficult it may be or it may seem right now, but if we do this together, we will save many, many thousands of lives,"" he added. He also urged businesses to stand by their employees ""because we will stand by you"", adding that his chancellor would be making further announcements on Friday. Later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to rush protective personal equipment (PPE) to frontline NHS staff and social care providers,following concern workers were being put at risk by shortages. Speaking on BBC1's Question Time, Mr Hancock said the UK had shipped 2.6 million masks and 10,000 bottles of hand sanitiser in the last 24 hours. He promised that ""overnight 150 hospitals will get the next pack of protective equipment they needâ¦ every single hospital will get their next batch of equipment before Sunday night"". He also confirmed social care providers would get a package of personal protective equipment by the end of next week. In response to a government appeal for more ventilator makers, 1,400 companies had offered to switch their operations to help manufacturer them, including Formula One, he said. He added that officials would work with leading companies to radically increase the number of coronavirus tests, after the government pledged25,000 tests per day within four weeks. He also said the government has bought a test which can detect whether someone has had coronavirus - and their immunity to it. The press conference came as Italy's death toll rose by 427 to 3,405, overtaking China's toll. In the UK, 144 people with coronavirus have died, and 3,269 people have tested positive for it. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Speaking alongside the PM, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, warned there would be a ""lag"" before the public's efforts to stem the spread of the virus would slow down case numbers. He said there would be a ""global issue"" in the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), saying NHS workers were right to complain about the shortages.

""Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe - I am certain we are up to that challenge,"" she added. ""You can be assured that my family and I stand ready to play our part."" Even if the tide starts to turn in 12 weeks and the number of cases starts to fall, then we will still be far from the end. It can take a long time for the tide to go out. It is clear the current strategy of shutting down large parts of society is not sustainable in the long-term. But the coronavirus is not going to disappear. For as long as large numbers of people in the UK have no immunity then cases will soar as soon as restrictions are lifted. A vaccine would help, but that could be 18 months away. If enough people are exposed and become immune then that would help too, however, this is likely to take even longer than a vaccine. Efforts to rigorously test and then isolate anyone infected can help suppress the numbers of people infected. But this is what we were doing just a few weeks ago. We may enter a period of restrictions being lifted and then re-imposed until a long-term solution is found. From Friday, all schools in the UK will close their doors to nearly all pupils, except vulnerable ones and the children of key workers. A full list of key workers, likely to include NHS workers, school staff and delivery drivers, is expected later.

On Friday, more details are expected on how pupils would be awarded grades after some exams were cancelled. It comes after the Scottish education secretary said exams would not take place in Scotland this summer.

GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? On Wednesday it was announced that schools in the UK would close their doors on Friday - except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast the Cabinet Office would release the full list of key workers later and parents not on the list would be ""immediately aware"" their child wouldn't be offered a place in school. The list would include NHS workers, school staff and delivery drivers, he said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was not expecting schools to open again before September. He said: ""The peak of the virus is expected to be at exams time after which most schools start to wind down, so it was very unlikely that they would reopen in the summer term."" Schools supporting key workers' children will be expected to remain open during the Easter holidays, while officials are considering who is classed under this category. Mr Williamson said the government was aiming to provide an ""education setting"" for 10% of the children who usually attend schools. Will I be paid when I'm at home with kids? School closures: What will happen now? What is the UK's plan and what could happen next? On the cancellation of exams, Mr Williamson said the aim was to issue children in England with grades in August under a ""different process and a different system"". However, he said he could not ""with total guarantee"" say they would be released that month as ""we don't how the spread of the virus will affect the examining boards and those who issue the grades"". It is possible schools in Wales will not reopen until September, Wales education minister Kirsty Williams has said. Universities UK said pupils should not lose the chance to go to university this year because of exam cancellations. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said if an appropriate way to assess students could be found - such as a combination of teacher assessments and previous assignments - then awards could be granted this summer. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This would allow students to get their grades and the university admission process to go ahead this summer."" The decision to close schools was welcomed by teachers' unions but many called for more detail from the government. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said there were ""many complicated issues to address"" and ""we have more questions than answers at the moment"". Parents contacting the BBC expressed concern that predicted grades might be used for results at GCSE and A-level, if pupils did not sit exams.

Prof Whitty, speaking at a science briefing, said the UK death rate would look ""quite high"" until testing was increased. He said the measures being introduced across the UK were to reduce the demand on the NHS and build up capacity to cope with the outbreak. He added that there were ""significant health and social downsides"" to the social distancing measures, such as loneliness and not getting exercise. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said it was important young people also followed the advice on social distancing. ""The mixing in pubs and restaurants needs to stop and it needs to stop among young people as well as older,"" he said. Parents - keep it simple, tell kids what they can control How families can cope with self-isolating together Meanwhile, the Army said it was ""pausing"" basic training, which would involve hundreds of recruits at Harrogate, Pirbright, Catterick and Winchester being sent home. However, a spokesman said it would not affect the Army's ability to support public services as part of the ""Covid support force"" - which only involves troops who have already gone through basic training. As part of the support the Army will provide during the pandemic, the number of troops at a heightened state of readiness will be doubled to 20,000 and Reserves will be placed on standby. Emergency laws to provide new powers to deal with the outbreak have been introduced in Parliament. The wide-ranging billincludes provisions for border controls, ways of boosting the NHS workforce and making it easier to register a death. The government says the measures contained within the Coronavirus Bill, which will be considered by MPs on Monday, are proportionate, will only be used when necessary and have a time limit of two years. But Labour is calling for a fresh vote on the legislation every six months - describing the plans as ""far-reaching"". Elsewhere, Environment Secretary George Eustice has ruled out enforcing social distancing measures in supermarkets. He told the House of Commons: ""It was something that was done in Italy, with a restriction on the number of people in stores and what they found was they just had hundreds of people huddled together at the entrance to the store and it's counterproductive.""

But pressed on what he meant by the three-month timescale, he said he did not know how long it would go on for. He said trials on a vaccine were expected to begin within a month and warned he would ""enforce"" Londoners to be kept apart ""if necessary"". Earlier, in a message to the nation, theQueen urged people to come together for the common good. Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I believe that a combination of the measures that we're asking the public to take and better testing, scientific progress, will enable us to get on top of it within the next 12 weeks and turn the tide.

In the press conference on Thursday evening, Mr Johnson  ruled out closing down public transport in London but pointed out people in some parts of London were not following government guidance on social distancing and would be ""enforced"" to do so if necessary.

Supermarkets 'drastically' cutting product rangesRetailers feel the strain with delivery services at full capacity and extra security hired at stores.,"Supermarkets and their supply chains are beginning to buckle under the strain of customer behaviour in the face of coronavirus. Several chains are ""drastically cutting"" the product ranges in store. They also said they were telling their manufacturers to ignore making some products to focus on those for which there is greatest demand. Meanwhile, competition laws are being relaxed so shops can discuss stock levels and pool staff and resources. ""We currently sell 60 types of sausages - we are moving to a fraction of that,"" said one supermarket. Another said: ""We need to make food manufacture as efficient as possible - it makes no sense to pause to change packet sizes or change from one type of pasta to another. ""We have 20 different sizes and styles of pasta, we are moving that to six."" Morrisons have reduced their bakery lines from 17 to seven. While executives insisted there was no shortage of food, they were struggling to restock shelves fast enough. Meanwhile, online delivery services are running at ""maximum capacity"". Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Coronavirus: Will I be paid when I'm at home with the kids? Coronavirus: 'There isn't time. Firms are closing now' Meanwhile, the government has announced competition laws will be temporarily relaxed to allow supermarkets to pool resources and data. This means they can share distribution depots and delivery vans and discuss stock levels. They will also be able to pool staff to meet demand. Rules around drivers' hours have also been loosened to help shops can deliver more food to stores, while the 5p plastic bag charge is being waived for online orders to speed up deliveries. However, there were warnings that the next potential weak link in the chain is at food manufacturers themselves. If production gets hit by staff absences that will mark the beginning of a new and potentially serious supply chain problem. ""We are not there yet but that is the next big worry."" Supermarkets also said they were having to use additional security staff in store to ensure customer behaviour did not get out of hand. ""Most people are sensible but some aren't."" They said that there had been no discussions as yet with the government about a police presence in store but it was a ""subject that was being discussed internally"".

EasyJet staff asked to take three months unpaid leave,"Budget airline EasyJet has asked pilots and cabin crew to agree to sweeping changes in their terms and conditions, as part of its response to coronavirus. Among the proposed changes are a freeze on planned pay rises and a requirement to take three months of unpaid leave. The airline would also no longer provide food for crew during their shifts, only water. Unions told members they had failed to reach agreement with the airline and were working on counter-proposals. However, there remains a willingness to make concessions in order to avoid redundancies. Further talks between EasyJet and unions representing pilots and cabin crew are expected today. Meanwhile, EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren has defended the payment of Â£170m in dividends to shareholders, at a time when the company is seeking financial help from the government. EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren defended the dividend payments to shareholders (pictured in 2018) On Wednesday, EasyJet's recently-appointed chief operating officer Peter Bellew met delegates from the pilots' union Balpa and Unite, which represents cabin crew. Under discussion was a proposed ""coronavirus cooperation agreement"" setting out changes to employees' terms and conditions. It would be in force from 23 March 2020 until 15 November 2021. Both sides acknowledge that action is needed. Travel restrictions across Europe have forced it to cancel many of its flights and ground more than a third of its fleet. The airline needs to save cash, and the unions want to preserve jobs. However, sources say the proposals themselves provoked an angry response. The four-page document would allow the airline to cancel pay rises until 2021, make significant changes to working patterns, and allow it to defer pay rises for newly-promoted captains for six months. Pilots in particular seem aggrieved by the plan. According to messages seen by the BBC, negotiators agreed to reject it on the principle that there was ""no evidence that the current crisis warrants such an extensive change in terms and conditions for such a long period, particularly when so many of them are so critically linked to flight safety and fatigue"". Balpa has refused to comment, as the talks are ongoing. Unite, meanwhile, has taken a softer tone. The union denied reports it had told the airline that compulsory redundancies were preferable to the deal on the table. ""Unite is very much still in talks with EasyJet and it is totally untrue to suggest the union has rejected all the company's proposals"", it said in a statement. However, insiders told the BBC they shared concerns that the airline might be using the current crisis as an excuse to change working practices, and erode employees' pay and benefits in the long term. In a statement, the company said: ""EasyJet has met with its employee representatives in the UK to discuss how they can help the airline navigate through these unprecedented timesâ¦ ""Like all airlines we are taking every action to remove cost and non-critical expenditure from the business at every level to help mitigate the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic."" Airlines warn they may not survive without bailout Edinburgh Airport to cut 100 jobs over passenger number warnings Meanwhile, EasyJet's chief executive has told the BBC the company is asking for government loans to help it weather the crisis. He said the company was ""first and foremost"" trying to save cash. But he added: ""Since we don't know how long this thing will last we also think it's appropriate that we're also looking for financing being supported as well from the government."" Such support, he said, would take the form of ""loans on a commercial basis"". He defended a Â£170m dividend to shareholders, due to be made tomorrow, saying it had already been signed off - and the company was legally obliged to make the payment. EasyJet says Mr Lundgren, Mr Bellew and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Findlay have all elected to take a 20% cut in their monthly salary from April to June.

Free broadband call resisted by industry body,"Children are expected to use online educational resources while their schools are suspended Broadband providers are resisting calls to provide a free service to help people during the coronavirus outbreak. One head teacher had suggested that the government require the step to ensure children get access to online classes after schools are suspended. Such action could also encourage people over 70 without connections to sign up, so that they can video-chat with relatives during isolation periods. But a trade body warned the move might threaten delivery of a smooth service. The Internet Service Providers' Association (Ispa) said it was in ""very early"" talks with the government to help customers who become unable to continue paying their bills. ""Things are naturally developing extremely quickly at the moment, and Ispa plans to seek further guidance from government on these issues so that customers can remain connected to the internet during these unprecedented times,"" a spokesman added. Schools in Northern Ireland closed on Thursday, andthe same measure comes into effect across the rest of the UK from Friday. Many teachers have already set up ways to continue study via the net, and the BBC, among others, is working on other internet materials. ""Lots of companies have done really well in making their online resources free,"" Julie Greer, head teacher of Cherbourg primary school, in Eastleigh, Hampshire, told the Today Programme.Â ""Is now the time to offer free broadband to families across the country, so that actually all these online learning opportunities that schools are talking about can be accessible?"" ""Because if you've lost your job, the first thing you're going to need to cut is, potentially, your internet."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Until now, some people with no home connection have used public facilities to go online.But libraries and museums are also closing.Â In the US, some broadband providers - including Spectrum, Charter, and Comcast - are providing a free service to students and low-income families for 60 days amid the outbreak. In the UK, the Labour Partypledged free basic broadband in its last general election manifesto. But the Conservative government opted instead to commit money to improving fibre infrastructure,which customers would continue to pay for. About 80% of the UK population have a fixed-line broadband connection, a number that has held steady for years. Adding in mobile internet, 90% of people have access. Ispa has said that connecting millions more people at this point could potentially lead to slowdowns. However, TechUK - a body that represents the UK's wider technology industry - cast doubt on the idea that making broadband free would lead to a rush of new subscribers. ""There is no silver bullet to connecting the 10% of the population that don't use the internet on a day-to-day basis,"" said director Matthew Evans. ""Free broadband may seem like it will, but the far bigger challenges are in digital skills, attitude to the internet and physical ability to use digital devices."" He said the industry was already working on plans to help those ""unable to pay their bills to ensure they stay connected."" There is also already a low-cost schemeavailable to people claiming certain types of benefits,external, in the form of BT Basic and Broadband.

Online 'checker' to target fake coronavirus aids,"An online tool has been updated to pick up fake testing kits, illicit homemade sanitiser and ""miracle"" coronavirus cures on sale on eBay. The free checker is designed to warn online shoppers of potential high-risk purchases before they buy. It has already been embedded on the websites ofTrading Standards Scotland,externaland national consumer advice serviceconsumeradvice.scot,external. It aims to stop illicit sellers from ""taking advantage"" of consumers. The checker, created by Edinburgh-based Vistalworks, allows users to paste in an eBay listing URL in order to get an indication of whether a product is legitimate or not. Vistalworks said its consumer protection software was developed in conjunction with Police Scotland, HMRC and Trading Standards Scotland. It has also developed a Chrome browser plugin which allows online shoppers to hover over any eBay UK listing to see if it is a potential high-risk purchase. Vistalworks said information from its own analysts and Trading Standards Scotland was being used to create ""coronavirus-specific"" updates to its software. The checker is currently restricted to eBay, but Vistalworks plans to extend it to other platforms, including Amazon and Facebook. Vistalworks boss Vicky Brock says she expects more illicit sellers will try to take advantage of worried consumers Vistalworks chief executive Vicky Brock said: ""With consumers' anxiety about the seriousness of coronavirus growing, and mainstream retailers' supply chains taking unprecedented stress, we know there will be a significant rise in the number of illicit sellers trying to take advantage of worried consumers. ""We've already seen this in the online marketplace listings we monitor. ""To tackle these emerging threats, we've updated our eBay checker to pick up fake testing kits, illicit homemade sanitiser, and a whole array of 'miracle' cures, including specific items which our analysts and Trading Standards Scotland have become aware of in the last weeks.""

Pupils 'scared and anxious' about closures,"Laila and Jack are having to adjust to life without school ""They're quite scared at the moment, if I'm honest,"" says Lucy of her children, Laila, 11, and Jack, 10. ""They're worried they're going to catch it, they're wondering when they'll see their friends again."" Jack is already at home - the closure of his special-needs school was announced on Wednesday evening. He has autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and his behaviour ""can be very challenging when he hasn't got a routine"", says Lucy, from Harefield, in outer London. And she is worried about him and his school friends. ""It will be a nightmare to get them back to school if they've had a long time off,"" she says. Laila, who will also be home for the foreseeable future when her school closes, on Friday, is disappointed not to be sitting her Year 6 national curriculum tests, often known as Sats. ""She's worked hard to get herself up from being an underachiever to being on target,"" Lucy says. ""It all feels like such a waste."" And Lucy is also worried about her own job security, having just started work as a receptionist in a special-needs high school. Alice, a nurse in a doctors' surgery, is hoping her job will allow her 11-year-old son one of the few school places allocated to the children of key workers. ""Although my boy would much prefer to stay off school, I would like him to continue,"" she says. But Tanya, a GP married to a hospital doctor, is worried about the risk of contagion to her two children if they remain at school. ""My children are already exposed to my husband and myself and now they will be exposed at school to other children and teachers, she says. ""I didn't sign up to do a job to put my children at risk. ""There's just been an assumption that we will just do this. ""More testing of front-line staff would help. ""At least then there could be more staff, because at the moment they have to self-isolate without knowing whether they have it or not."" A-level student Caitlin Smith is hoping for a place at Durham University A-level student Caitlin Smith, 18, from Leeds, says the uncertainty is ""driving me absolutely nuts"". ""Our lives revolve around education,"" she tells BBC News. ""I get up I go to sixth-form and then I stay at the library. ""By the time I finish, I've done a 12 hour day ""We've been working for these exams for so long and been told to be revising since December. ""Now, I don't really know what to do with myself.

""I applied for them, thinking I'd be able to get the right grades and show my full potential in the exams,"" she says. ""I know I've worked hard over the last two years. ""But for other people who have maybe gone through that time thinking that it'd be the exams that really count - for some, it won't be an accurate representation of their abilities. ""Some people need that adrenaline that comes to you in the exams. ""I think my results from my mock exams would have gone up a grade or so."" Caitlin is ""trying not to be so critical"" of the government, however, ""because I couldn't do a better job"". She adds: ""Obviously if we move these exams back a year, that's going to push everything back for the next year. ""So, realistically, we need to get our year group through."" Mary, a mother of teenagers in Scarborough, says her younger daughter is very sporty and will feel the loss of her clubs and competitions acutely. She is also concerned that some of her children's more vulnerable classmates who come from difficult backgrounds will be hit particularly badly once schools and youth clubs close their doors. ""School offers children with difficult lives some sort of stability. ""This loss of infrastructure will have an immediate impact. ""How are we going to keep them onside without it?"" For workers not regarded as key, trying to hold down a job while looking after young children is another concern - and there are financial worries, too. In Essex, Marta, an accountant, says she pays Â£400 for after-school clubs for her children, aged four and seven, and she doesn't want to stop the direct debt for fear of losing their places. ""Now that my kids will be at home full-time I'm expecting my grocery bill to rise. ""I will have to keep them occupied and entertained while at the same time working."" Marta with Michael (7) and James (4) Meanwhile in north London, Victoria says her daughter's school has already shut down all classes apart from the exam years because of staff shortages. And being at school had become ""increasingly odd"" for both her children. ""Initially they were quite excited at getting time off school,"" she says. But now the announcement has come, ""they're quite anxious, not joyous"", because there is so much uncertainty about how long the closures will be and when they will see their friends again. ""I'm trying to keep them calm - telling them they're fit and probably won't get it and it will pass,"" Victoria says. ""But they're concerned about friends with underlying health issues and have lots of questions."" Some names have been changed.

Will I be paid when I'm at home?,"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare.

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash If you are an employee, any sick pay you may receive will depend on where you work. Some workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill - albeit for a limited time. If that time runs out, or if you don't get paid sick leave in the first place,you should receive SSP.,external The money - set at Â£95.85 a week - is paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. So if you are self-employed, you will not be eligible - but if you are a casual or agency worker, you will be. To receive SSP you need to be earning at least Â£120 a week.The ONS estimates,externalthere are 1,766,000 adult jobs in the UK that pay less than that amount - although some people will earn money from several jobs over the course of a week. SSP can now be claimed from a person's first day away from work, rather than the fourth day as before. Anyone claiming should be able to get a sick note from the NHS's 111 service rather than their GP. There have been concerns aboutwhether SSP is sufficient, especially for those who must self-isolate more than once following the introduction of the various test and trace systems.

A list of the""key workers"" during the coronavirus crisis,external, whose children can still go to school or nursery, has been published. The Queen, who is now in Windsor Castle with the Duke of Edinburgh, said the world was ""entering a period of great uncertainty"" and every individual had ""a vitally important part to play"". ""Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe - I am certain we are up to that challenge,"" she added. ""You can be assured that my family and I stand ready to play our part."" Meanwhile, the Bank of England has cut interest rates from 0.25% to 0.1%- the lowest level in their history. On Friday, more details are expected on how pupils would be awarded grades after some exams were cancelled. It comes after the Scottish education secretary said exams would not take place in Scotland this summer. John Swinneysaid the ""unprecedented"" move was a measure of the ""gravity"" of the situation caused by the pandemic. It is the first time the exams have been cancelled since the system was put in place in 1888. This video can not be played Public reacts to announcement that schools will close in response to the coronavirus pandemic The UK government has already said GCSEs and A-levels in England will be cancelled, and the Welsh government has cancelled them in Wales. Exams in Scotland and Northern Ireland have also been cancelled by their governments. Meanwhile, Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a travel ban in London. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""There are no plans to close down the transport network in London and there is zero prospect of any restrictions being placed on travelling in and out of London."" Elsewhere, the government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said the track of the UK epidemic had followed the path ""we thought likely"". It comes as Northern Irelandannounced its first virus-related death,and three more deaths wereconfirmed in Scotland.

GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? On Wednesday it was announced that schools in the UK would close their doors on Friday - except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast the Cabinet Office would release the full list of key workers later and parents not on the list would be ""immediately aware"" their child wouldn't be offered a place in school. The list would include NHS workers, school staff and delivery drivers, he said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was not expecting schools to open again before September. He said: ""The peak of the virus is expected to be at exams time after which most schools start to wind down, so it was very unlikely that they would reopen in the summer term."" Schools supporting key workers' children will be expected to remain open during the Easter holidays, while officials are considering who is classed under this category. Mr Williamson said the government was aiming to provide an ""education setting"" for 10% of the children who usually attend schools. Will I be paid when I'm at home with kids? School closures: What will happen now? What is the UK's plan and what could happen next? On the cancellation of exams, Mr Williamson said the aim was to issue children in England with grades in August under a ""different process and a different system"". However, he said he could not ""with total guarantee"" say they would be released that month as ""we don't how the spread of the virus will affect the examining boards and those who issue the grades"". It is possible schools in Wales will not reopen until September, Wales education minister Kirsty Williams has said. Universities UK said pupils should not lose the chance to go to university this year because of exam cancellations. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said if an appropriate way to assess students could be found - such as a combination of teacher assessments and previous assignments - then awards could be granted this summer. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This would allow students to get their grades and the university admission process to go ahead this summer."" The decision to close schools was welcomed by teachers' unions but many called for more detail from the government. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said there were ""many complicated issues to address"" and ""we have more questions than answers at the moment"". Parents contacting the BBC expressed concern that predicted grades might be used for results at GCSE and A-level, if pupils did not sit exams.

Prof Whitty, speaking at a science briefing, said the UK death rate would look ""quite high"" until testing was increased. He said the measures being introduced across the UK were to reduce the demand on the NHS and build up capacity to cope with the outbreak. He added that there were ""significant health and social downsides"" to the social distancing measures, such as loneliness and not getting exercise. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said it was important young people also followed the advice on social distancing. ""The mixing in pubs and restaurants needs to stop and it needs to stop among young people as well as older,"" he said. Parents - keep it simple, tell kids what they can control How families can cope with self-isolating together Meanwhile, the Army said it was ""pausing"" basic training, which would involve hundreds of recruits at Harrogate, Pirbright, Catterick and Winchester being sent home. However, a spokesman said it would not affect the Army's ability to support public services as part of the ""Covid support force"" - which only involves troops who have already gone through basic training. As part of the support the Army will provide during the pandemic, the number of troops at a heightened state of readiness will be doubled to 20,000 and Reserves will be placed on standby. Emergency laws to provide new powers to deal with the outbreak have been introduced in Parliament. The wide-ranging billincludes provisions for border controls, ways of boosting the NHS workforce and making it easier to register a death. The government says the measures contained within the Coronavirus Bill, which will be considered by MPs on Monday, are proportionate, will only be used when necessary and have a time limit of two years. But Labour is calling for a fresh vote on the legislation every six months - describing the plans as ""far-reaching"". Elsewhere, Environment Secretary George Eustice has ruled out enforcing social distancing measures in supermarkets. He told the House of Commons: ""It was something that was done in Italy, with a restriction on the number of people in stores and what they found was they just had hundreds of people huddled together at the entrance to the store and it's counterproductive.""

Asian nations face second wave of virus cases,"It comes as these countries had been successful in controlling its domestic cases South Korea, China and Singapore are among the Asian countries facing a second coronavirus wave, fuelled by people importing it from outside. China, where the virus first emerged, confirmed it had no new domestic cases on Wednesday for the first time since the outbreak began, a major milestone. But it reported 34 new cases among people who recently returned to China. Singapore also reported 47 new cases, of which 33 were imported - 30 of them returned Singapore residents. South Korea saw a jump in new cases on Thursday with 152, though it is not clear how many were imported.

"Home Office 'ignorant of race' over WindrushThe Windrush scandal review adds there was a ""profound institutional failure"" affecting thousands of people.UK Politics","The Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948 The Home Office showed âignorance and thoughtlessnessâ on the issue of race, a review of the Windrush scandal says. The long-awaited review comes after some of those who came to the UK from Commonwealth countries were wrongly told they were in Britain illegally. There was a âprofound institutional failureâ which turned thousands of peopleâs lives upside down, it said. Warnings about the âhostile environmentâ policy were ânot heededâ, the review concludes. Report writer Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, called on the government to provide an âunqualified apologyâ to those affected and the wider black African-Caribbean community. Speaking in the House of Commons Home Secretary Priti Patel said there was ""nothing I can say to undo the pain"" but added ""on behalf of this and successive governments I am truly sorry for the actions that span decades"". Ms Patel said people from the Windrush generation were subject to ""insensitive treatment by the very country they called home"". ""I am sorry that people's trust has been betrayed."" She added that those who were eligible would receive compensation. Who are the Windrush generation?,external In pictures: The pioneering Windrush generation,external Windrush: Call to review deportation of foreign-born offenders Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the home secretary that: ""People will believe her apology when they see her genuinely seek to implement the recommendations in the review."" Ms Abbott, whose mother was a member of the Windrush generation, said for those affected ""it isn't necessarily the money, the inconvenience or the tragedy of being deported, it is the insult to people who always believed they were British."" Theresa May, who was prime minister when the scandal came to light, added her own apology to the home secretary's. ""They [the Windrush generation] should not have been treated in this way,"" she said. The 275-page report says the âroot causeâ of the scandal can be traced back to legislation of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, some of which had âracial motivationsâ. âRace clearly played a part in what occurredâ, said Ms Williams, adding that some failings could be indicators of âindirect discriminationâ. âThe factors that I identified demonstrate an institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation. âThese aspects were among those included in the elements of the definition of institutional racism considered in the Macpherson inquiry [which looked into the murder of Stephen Lawrence]. âOperational and organisational failingsâ at the Home Office had a âcausative impactâ on the âdetrimentalâ way Windrush migrants were treated. They were âcaught up in measures designed for people who have no right to be in the UKâ. Protests against deportation flights were held outside the Jamaican embassy in London this year She also found: The Home Office was fragmented and decision-making was ""siloed"" A target-dominated work environment within visas and immigration enforcement sections A lack of empathy in some cases along with dehumanising jargon and cliches Some senior civil servants and former ministers showed ignorance, lack of understanding and acceptance of the full extent of the injustice Changes to legal aid contributed to the scandal A history of prejudice towards black people and wider society also a factor Ms Williams says she spoke to former Home Secretaries Amber Rudd - who resigned over the affair in 2018 - Theresa May, Alan Johnson and Jacqui Smith. Commenting on speculation that the document has been watered down, with a finding that the Home Office is institutionally racist removed, she said: âIf anyone thinks Iâve pulled my punches Iâd be very surprised indeed.â Among 30 recommendations, the review says the Home Office should set up a full review of the hostile environment policy, appoint a Migrants Commissioner, develop a programme of cultural change for the department and establish a race advisory board. David Isaac, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the Windrush scandal had exposed ""deep flaws"" in the UK's immigration system. He added: ""This independent review underlines many of our serious and long-standing concerns about the impact of the government's hostile environment policies on some groups. These are highly significant findings and we will be using our legal powers so this does not happen again."" by Adina Campbell, BBC community affairs correspondent Todayâs review is a damning indictment of Home Office immigration policy which goes as far back as the 1960s, with race being a significant factor. This comprehensive report attempts to draw a line under the governmentâs woeful action but many Caribbean migrants have lost faith and fear the UK immigration system. Theyâve been put through years and in some cases decades of misery. Broken families, shattered careers and being denied NHS healthcare wonât be forgotten anytime soon. Meanwhile those who were wrongly deported or detained say the way theyâve been mistreated is unforgivable. The governmentâs compensation scheme has also been heavily criticised with victims claiming itâs taking too long to access the financial support theyâve been promised. Many of these communities have lost complete trust in the government and the chances of restoring it are slim. The Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948 An estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries have been called the Windrush generation, a reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents. Changes to immigration law in 2012 meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or even to remain in the UK. Some were held in detention or removed despite living in the country for decades, resulting in a furious backlash over their treatment. The scandal prompted criticism of ""hostile environment"" measures introduced to tackle illegal immigration.

English football suspended until 30 April,"The last Premier League fixture to take place was on 9 March English football will be suspended until at least 30 April because of the continued spread of coronavirus. All games in England's Premier League, EFL, Women's Super League and Women's Championship, and all fixtures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, are currently postponed. The Football Association has also agreed that the current season can be ""extended indefinitely"". Under current rules the season had been scheduled to end on 1 June. A joint statement issued by the FA, Premier League and EFL expressed ""a commitment to finding ways of resuming the 2019-20 season"" and completing all domestic and European matches ""as soon as it is safe and possible to do so"". Q&A: What does extension mean for English football? Man Utd to pay casual matchday staff even if season is cancelled Last week, West Ham vice-chair Karren Brady said the current season should be declarednull and void.,external FA chairman Greg Clarke also expressed his concern that it might prove impossible for the season to be concluded. However Brighton chief executive Paul Barber told the BBC thatit would be ""unjust""if runaway leaders Liverpool were denied the title, and suggested increasing the league to 22 teams for 2020-21. Fifa has also established aworking groupto tackle the issues facing football as a result of the pandemic. The group will look at the international fixture calendar, and issues around player contracts. Player contracts typically expire on 30 June but many leagues, if resumed, look likely to continue beyond that date. BBC sports editor Dan Roan Thepostponement of Euro 2020has opened up a window for domestic league fixtures to take place in June. However, the UK government has effectively banned sports events for the time being by advising against mass gatherings. If that restriction is not lifted, some clubs are understood to be open to playing matches behind closed doors in order to get the season completed. And, with broadcast rights-holders Sky and BT reportedly entitled to claim a total of Â£750m in refunds if the campaign does not resume, the Premier League is determined to do everything possible to honour its commercial contracts. It is not yet clear, however, when the season may start again or finish, and whether it has a knock-on effect on next year's campaign. This video can not be played 'We've got to finish season' - Deeney Forest Green Rovers owner Dale Vince said suspending all professional matches on 13 March was a ""mistake"" because the virus had ""barely impacted the country"" by that stage. ""I think cancelling all games until 3 April was a mistake,"" Dale told BBC Sport. ""I think it was an error of judgment - there were a few cases in the Premier League of self-isolation. ""In that three to four week period we could have virtually finished our season playing Saturday to Tuesday. ""Instead of shutting down I would have doubled down and said let's play our way to the end of the season as soon as possible because the virus and the rate of infection across the county is not going to get better in two, three or four months."" Forest Green are 11th in League Two, nine points outside the play-offs, and Dale has welcomed the EFL's financial effort to supports its clubs as ""all good positive stuff"". ""My appreciation is not purely personal at all. It is for the whole of the league, the whole of the EFL. It is a good thing,"" he added. ""They have done the right thing for all of us."" Premier League Arsenal support the decision to further postpone play until 30 April, after their manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for coronavirus. Since the confirmation of Arteta's illness, the club say their ""training centres in London Colney and Hale End were closed for deep cleaning"". ""We have now reopened with a small workforce to maintain the facilities and training pitches, while a number of staff, including Mikel and the men's first team squad, are currently isolating at home,â¯"" said a club statement. ""We're pleased to say that Mikel is feeling much better. He's in good spirits, doing detailed planning with the coaches and speaking to the players regularly.""

Energy bill help for vulnerable amid outbreak,"Gas and electricity suppliers have agreed an emergency package of measures to ensure vulnerable people do not get cut off amid a virus outbreak. More than four million people who are on prepayment meters will receive help if they cannot get out to top up. This may include credit being sent in the post or funds automatically added to their meter. Those struggling to pay bills will receive support and no credit meter disconnections will take place. Debt repayments and bill payments could be reassessed, paused or reduced where needed, if energy customers are finding it difficult. Firms could also send somebody out on a customer's behalf to top up a prepayment meter. ""While friends and family will play a role in helping people impacted by the coronavirus, we recognise there will be many customers who will need additional support and reassurance, particularly those who are financially impacted or in vulnerable circumstances,"" said Business and Energy Secretary Alok Sharma. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic In a letter to customers, the Energy Networks Association said there were 36,000 people working to keep homes powered. It said: ""We look after your gas and electricity networks, and have well-practised contingency plans in place so we can keep your energy flowing. We want to reassure you that we are prepared."" Dame Gillian Guy, the head of Citizens Advice, said: ""Keeping people on supply, making sure they have warm homes and don't face additional financial or other stresses about their energy supply will be essential."" Energy bills set to fall for millions of households What do you know about saving energy at home? Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Experts say that people working from home may see a fairly swift rise in energy use, and therefore their bill, although the energy price cap will be lowered in April. Anna Moss, at Cornwall Insight, said: ""Self-isolating or working from home may mean consumers are using more energy, which for some consumers will pass through quickly to their energy bills. For those customers that fall into the vulnerable bracket, this can be daunting and difficult to manage."" However, experts add that Britain's gas and electricity grids should be able to keep the lights running during the crisis without much problem. Having people stuck at home might even out the peaks in the evening when people usually come back from work, when the strain on the energy system is at its highest. Meanwhile, as offices and factories shut down, daytime energy use is likely to fall slightly, even as more energy is used in British homes.

"'People do not buy a new outfit to stay at home'Next says both online and store sales will suffer ""significant losses"" as a result of coronavirus.BusinessComments","The boss of Next has warned that the retailer faces a ""very significant drop in sales"" as a result of the effect of coronavirus on the business. Lord Wolfson said online sales were ""likely to fare better"" than the shops, but would also suffer ""significant losses"". ""People do not buy a new outfit to stay at home,"" he added. The risk to demand is by far the greatest challenge posed by coronavirus, said Lord Wolfson. ""We need to prepare for a significant downturn in sales for the duration of the pandemic,"" he said. When coronavirus first appeared in China, Lord Wolfson said Next assumed that the threat was to its supply chain. The warnings were contained in Next's annual results statement, which showed that in the year to January 2020 total group sales rose by 3.3% to Â£4.36bn, while profit edged up by 0.8% to Â£728.5m. Online sales performed strongly, rising by 11.9% to Â£2.14bn, but retail sales fell by 5.3% to Â£1.85bn. However, in the week beginning 8 March sales fell by 8.8% and declined by 30% between 15-17 March. Laura Ashley nears collapse as firms demand help Online shopping website Ocado suspends service Lord Wolfson said since it had no experience of a similar crisis there was no way of predicting the impact that coronavirus would have on its business. LIVE COVERAGE:Latest from the BBC EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? He added that the company had carried out a detailed stress test looking at the likely impact on cash and profits of different levels of sales decline. These range from a fall in sales of Â£445m, or 10% of annual turnover, up to a loss of Â£1bn, the equivalent of 25% of annual turnover. The stress test concluded that the business could ""comfortably sustain the loss of more than Â£1bn (25%) of annual full price sales, without exceeding our current bond and bank facilities"". The retailer added that some products were likely to do better than others. So far homeware and childrenswear sales have not been as badly hit as adult clothing, it said. Ocado temporarily closed its app on Wednesday Elsewhere, other businesses have revealed details of how the pandemic is affecting them. Supermarket chain Waitrose said from Friday it would reserve its first hour of opening for elderly and vulnerable customers and those who look after them. It also said it would close all its cafes and rotisseries and stop making coffees to free up staff to restock shelves. And from Thursday it has imposed limits on how many toilet rolls and certain other grocery items any one customer can buy in store. Aldi said it would reduce its weekday and Saturday opening by an hour a day from Friday to allow for restocking. Fashion firm Burberry warned that thenegative effect of the coronavirus on demand for luxury goodshad intensified. It said that sales in its stores have fallen by up to 50% over the past six weeks. Sales in China have started to pick up, but that has been offset by falls in sales in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the US. Burberry expects store sales to fall by between 70% and 80% in the final weeks of the year, and fourth quarter sales to drop by a third. Fashion retailer Joules said the decline in the number of people visiting its shops had ""significantly accelerated"". Online sales have also declined, but to a lesser extent, as people start to be more careful with their money. The company has cancelled its dividend. Ocado said first quarter sales revenue was up by more than 10%, but that increased demand had placed it under ""unprecedented strain"".Ocado temporarily closed its app on Wednesday, blaming higher demand than it could meet. Travel firm National Express said it had seen a significant decline in passenger numbers in recent weeks. However, it has contractual protections in place and as a result it thinks it will get in a little more money than it spends in the coming months. It has reduced its outgoings such as cutting spending on adverts and other discretionary spending. Brewer Shepherd Neame cancelled its dividend and said that following government advice for the public to avoid pubs, theatres and other hospitality venues it was ""inevitable that trading will deteriorate rapidly"". It called fortaxation to be cancelled immediately and for the government to give support with staff costs. Sushi restaurant chain Yo! said that it had taken the decision to close 54 of its restaurants ""for the time being"". The remaining 16 will remain open ""while this is in our control"", but will offer restricted hours and a reduced menu. Italian restaurant chain Prezzo announced it would temporarily close its restaurants. The move came after the government said people should avoid restaurants. ""It was always going to be question of when, not if, we would need to close our doors for a time,"" the company said.

Breaking|Breaking newsUK interest rates slashed again in emergency moveThe Bank bumps up its measures to support the UK in its efforts to support the UK economyBusiness,"The Bank of England has cut interest rates again in an emergency move as it tries to support the UK economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the second cut in interest rates in just over a week, bringing them down to 0.1% from 0.25%. Interest rates are now at the lowest ever in the Bank's 325-year history. The Bank said it would also increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by Â£200bn with an effort to lower the cost of borrowing. It's a dramatic move by Andrew Bailey, who only took over from Mark Carney as Bank of England governor on Monday. Last week, the Bank announced a 0.5% cut in rates to 0.25% and a package of measures to help businesses and individuals cope with the economic damage caused by the virus. The move coincided with additional measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Budget. Coronavirus: How the Bank rate cuts affect you Bank of England boss: Don't fire people UK interest rates cut in emergency move However, the Bank said the measures it had taken so far were not going to be enough, and believed ""a further package of measures was warranted"". ""The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but should be temporary,"" it added. The move comes as international investors are trying to secure more cash, in particular dollars. This means they're ditching assets such as UK government gilts, which are the ""IOU"" notes the government hands over to private investors willing to lend it money. As the gilts are sold, the price drops and the yield - the effective interest rate compared to the price - rises. What that means is the cost of borrowing to private investors as well as to the government rises - just when the Bank of England wants it to fall and the government is about to borrow huge sums. The Bank of England's plan to buy Â£200bn more bonds is aimed at fighting that effect. The fresh rate cut takes interest rates to the lowest they can feasibly go, said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group. ""Lower rates and additional quantitative easing can keep markets satisfied and borrowing costs for both businesses and the government down but unless money is forced into the hands of small businesses soon, then it will be for nothing; they are the ones laying off staff due to a liquidity shock,"" he added. Karen Ward, chief European market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: The support to the economy and health system will require vastly higher government borrowing. The central bank showing willing to buy government debt will ensure the market can absorb this additional issuance without undue stress."" The Bank of England Governor has said today's second emergency rate cut in just over a week occurred after financial markets became ""borderline disorderly"", with fears about coronavirus leading to a rush into the US dollar away from sterling and lending to the UK government. ""We've seen very sharp moves in financial markets in the last few days, which is the pace of which frankly, was increasing very rapidly. And we were moving into conditions that were if not disorderly, frankly, bordering on disorderly let me put it that way,"" Andrew Bailey told journalists. The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee had an emergency call this morning so that rate cuts and further ""quantitative easing"" could be agreed and announced, with the Bank needing to be ""on the offensive"" because: ""We can't wait for the hard economic data it will be too late by then"", he said. He said he had seen a range of private forecasts about the economic impact of the current crisis: ""We don't have a precise forecast - every picture we look at has a very sharp V in it"". The governor also partly blamed rumours that appeared to emerge from Westminster of a shutdown to London for adding to the volatility in markets that saw sterling fall 5% against the dollar. Such a shutdown would be likely to impact on the functioning of the City. He said: ""I do have to say that, you know, there were rumours going on the market this time yesterday that there was going to be a lockdown in London. And I'd observe that did cause market prices to start moving around at that point. But I think the government has been clear, and it's clear that that is not the intention at the moment."" The governor also said that he had already intervened to try to get loans to businesses to keep people in employment, and he said the Bank had its thinking cap on as regards further monetary boosts it can make. He reiterated his lack of enthusiasm for zero or negative interest rates because of their impact on the banking system's capacity to lend, and suggested that was the reason for limiting the cut to an unusual 0.15% (rather than the usual 0.25% or 0.5%) to a record low of 0.1%.

LiveCoronavirus in Scotland,"Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney says this year's exams will not take place because of the coronavirus pandemic He announced the move to MSPs shortly after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed three more deaths in Scotland - taking the total to six Mr Swinney added that some schools could remain open to assist those NHS workers who have school-aged children During her weekly Q&A, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the pandemic planning was not meant to scare people but ""that this was not a drill"" BBC Scotland News Coronavirus information posters you can download and stick around the office or community. Boris Johnson says he believes the UK can ""send it packing"" if people follow government advice. Join us for more live coverage of all the latest coronavirus news from tomorrow morning. Three oil and gas workers with suspected cases of coronavirus have been airlifted from North Sea platforms. Specially-configured
former search and rescue aircraft, featuring protective curtains and airflow systems, were used for the flights. Operator Bristow Helicopters said: âThe safety, health and welfare of our
workforce, customers and the public we support around the world is of the
utmost importance to Bristow, which is why we moved quickly to develop a
solution for transporting those suspected of contracting the virus.â John Swinney says universities and employers can have full confidence in this year's certification system. He told Reporting Scotland: ""Universities Scotland will work very closely with us to
ensure that young people are not in any way disadvantaged."" He said students' previous work would be their ""passport"" to certification. ""We are having to do this because we have absolutely
no alternative given the gravity of the situation we face as a consequence of coronavirus."" This video can not be played What happens if you've bombed in your Prelims? Mr Swinney said: âI understand the distress that young people around the country will feel, but no-one will lose out as a consequence of the arrangements we have put in place. ""The chief examiner has assured me that we can put in place a robust and credible methodology that will enable her to certificated the examination system this year. ""I know itâs different but it has to pass the standard that our independent qualification authority sets for the performance of young people."" Education Secretary John Swinney has told the BBCâs Reporting
Scotland that âno young person will lose outâ as a consequence of scrapping
exams for school pupils this year It is the first time the exams have been cancelled since the
system was introduced in 1888. Students will now be graded based on course work, their
prelim results, prior attainment and teacher assessment. Dr Fiona Henderson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, told Drivetime on Radio Scotland she was concerned there was not a single hand sanitiser in the atrium at the entrance to the hospital. ""There are hundreds, if not thousands of people, walking through that area every day then proceeding to lifts, stairwells, doors without any hand gels available whatsoever,"" she said. Dr Henderson said that when people cross the threshold of the hospital every single person should be made to clean their hands in some way. ""It is so vitally important that I can't emphasis enough,"" she said. Glasgow health board says hand sanitisers are available at the entrance. Dr Henderson says she has not seen them  and people should be forced to use them. ""At the moment, anyone coming in could be carrying the coronavirus,"" she said. All schools in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will close. It's the latest in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Broomhill Primary School in Glasgow will remain open with a skeleton staff as one of the schools for the children of key workers. Headteacher Wendy Cameron told Drivetime with John Beattie: ""We are keeping the building open next week. We've sent out a form to parents to identify who needs support."" She said many of the families had parents who worked at the nearby hospitals or were GPs. ""We've got a rotation of staff and we'll work on skeleton service and we'll be open from 9am to 3pm,"" Ms Cameron said. ""We might be able to extend that to breakfast club and after-school provision."" She said she thought it might operate for about 40 pupils out of 450. The NHS Golden Jubilee Hospital is to scale down non-urgent outpatient appointments and planned
procedures. Bosses at the hospital in Clydebank said staff would be prioritising urgent and
emergency heart and lung patients (including lung cancer procedures) as well as
urgent diagnostic services. They said the move was aimed at supporting NHS Scotland. Earlier today we posted Laura's video of her kids playing social distancing football in Motherwell.

The UN's secretary general has issued a stark warning to world leaders about working together to stem the spread of the coronavirus. ""If we let the virus spread like wildfire - especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world - it would kill millions of people. Global solidarity is not only a moral imperative, it is in everyone's interests,"" Antonio Guterres said. ""The health catastrophe makes it clear that we are only as strong as the weakest health system."" Mr Guterres also urged governments and international bodies to better support the most financially vulnerable - low-wage workers, and small and medium-sized businesses. A global recession, he added, is now ""a near certainty"". Earlier, NHS England confirmed that another 29 people have died. Northern Ireland announced its first virus-related death today and three more deaths were confirmed in Scotland. The death toll in the country now stands at 137. Drivetime presenter John Beattie asks the education secretary about experts saying the outbreak could last 18 months. Mr Swinney says he is not planning for that yet but he cannot say how long the measures being taken will last. Will there be exams next year? The education secretary said: ""I think we will take one step at a time. At this stage it is best that we focus on the period ahead."" Boris Johnson also says the UK is in negotiations to buy an antibody test that is ""as simple as a pregnancy test"" to tell people if they have the disease. ""It is early days but if it works we will buy hundreds and thousands as soon as practicable,"" the PM adds. He also implores the public to follow the advice the government has given, saying it is ""absolutely vital"". He asks for businesses to ""stand by employees, stand by workers, as we will stand by you"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson says UK scientists are ""rapidly becoming so much better at understanding"" the disease and how to tackle it. He reveals that today, the first corona patient has been put into randomised trial on drugs that may treat the disease. Mr Johnson also says the country is getting better at testing. He adds: ""The enemy is invisible and the answer is to remove cloak of invisibility to know which of us is carrying it"". Drivetime presenter John Beattie asks the education secretary if teachers might be tempted to mark students favourably. Mr Swinney said: ""Teachers are professionals and we have to rely upon teacher professional judgement. ""The SQA will be able to moderate the judgements that are made by teachers."" He said teacher judgement was only one part of the analysis undertaken by the SQA. Mr Swinney said he'd asked the chief examiner, who is independent of government, to develop a model that would demonstrate performance by young people and robust analysis by the SQA. He said: ""She has assured me that can be done."" In Downing Streetâs latest daily televised press conference he thanked the country for its ""huge efforts"" to comply with the government's advice. Mr Johnson said ""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"", adding: ""I'm absolutely confident we can send the virus packing in this country."" He has been joined once again by the UKâs chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, and chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Weâll be bringing you all the latest updates from the briefing. Mr Swinney told John Beattie: ""We are going to ask the Scottish Qualifications Authority to develop an alternative means of certifying the learning that has been undertaken by young people over the course of the last year."" He said this would be a combination of coursework they've done, results from prelim exams and also looking at the teacher judgement information about the estimated performance of candidates. The education secretary said: ""The SQA will apply the robust analysis of that information that is required for any examination system."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Polluting gases fall rapidly as coronavirus spreads,"Traffic has been much-reduced on the streets of New York Levels of air pollutants and warming gases over some cities and regions are showing significant drops as coronavirus impacts work and travel. Researchers in New York told the BBC their early results showed carbon monoxide mainly from cars had been reduced by nearly 50% compared with last year. Emissions of the planet-heating gas CO2 have also fallen sharply. But there are warnings levels could rise rapidly after the pandemic. A really simple guide to climate change Climate-related words and phrases explained With global economic activity ramping down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, it is hardly surprising that emissions of a variety of gases related to energy and transport would be reduced. Scientists say that by May, when CO2 emissions are at their peak thanks to the decomposition of leaves, the levels recorded might be the lowest since the financial crisis over a decade ago. While it is early days, data collected in New York this week suggests that instructions to curb unnecessary travel are having a significant impact. Traffic levels in the city wereestimated,externalto be down 35% compared with a year ago. Emissions of carbon monoxide, mainly due to cars and trucks, have fallen by around 50% for a couple of days this week according toresearchers at Columbia University,external. They have also found that there was a 5-10% drop in CO2 over New York and a solid drop in methane as well. ""New York has had exceptionally high carbon monoxide numbers for the last year and a half,"" said Prof RÃ³isÃ­n Commane, from Columbia University, who carried out the New York air monitoring work. ""And this is the cleanest I have ever seen it. It's is less than half of what we normally see in March."" Eurovision Song Contest cancelled over coronavirus Upgrade for popular UK nature sanctuary 'The rich are to blame for climate change' Although there are a number of caveats to these findings, they echo the environmental impacts connected to the virus outbreaks in China and in Italy. Ananalysis carried out for the climate website Carbon Brief,externalsuggested there had been a 25% drop in energy use and emissions in China over a two week period. This is likely to lead to an overall fall of about 1% in China's carbon emissions this year, experts believe. Both China and Northern Italy have also recordedsignificant falls in nitrogen dioxide, which is related to reduced car journeys and industrial activity. The gas is a serious air pollutant and also indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet. A European Space Agency satellite image showing levels of nitrogen dioxide over Italy With aviation grinding to a halt and millions of people working from home, a range of emissions across many countries are likely following the same downward path. While people working from home will likely increase the use of home heating and electricity, the curbing of commuting and the general slowdown in economies will likely have an impact on overall emissions. ""I expect we will have the smallest increase in May to May peak CO2 that we've had in the northern hemisphere since 2009, or even before,"" said Prof Commane. This view is echoed by others in the field, who believe that the shutdown will impact CO2 levels for the whole of this year. ""It will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, and how widespread the slowdown is in the economy particularly in the US. But most likely I think we will see something in the global emissions this year,"" said Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia. ""If it lasts another three of four months, certainly we could see some reduction."" What's likely to make a major difference to the scale of carbon emissions and air pollution is how governments decide to re-stimulate their economies once the pandemic eases. Back in the 2008-09, after the global financial crash, carbon emissions shot up by 5% as a result of stimulus spending that boosted fossil fuel use. EASY STEPS:What should I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? SYMPTOMS:Should I self-isolate? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In the coming months, governments will have a chance to alter that outcome. They could insist, for instance, that any bailout of airlines would be tied to far more stringent reductions in aviation emissions. ""Governments now have to be really cautious on how they re-stimulate their economies, mindful of not locking in fossil fuels again,"" said Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ©. ""They should focus those things that are ready to go that would lower emissions, like renovating buildings, putting in heat pumps and electric chargers. These are not complicated and can be done straight away, they are just waiting for financial incentives."" However, some argue that if the pandemic goes on a long time, any stimulus would more likely focus on promoting any economic growth regardless of the impact on the environment. ""I certainly think climate could go on the back burner, and in this case, I don't think there is much hope that stimulus goes to clean energy,"" said Prof Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate Research. ""Any stimulus will help those with job losses such as tourism and services. I think this is very different to the global financial crisis. The only silver linings could be to learning new practices to work remotely, and buying a few years of lower growth allowing solar and wind to catch up a bit, though, these may be rather small silver linings.""

"Europe looking to extend virus lockdownsStringent measures could be long-lasting, with France and Italy talking tough on transgressors.Europe","Passers-by at the La Paz hospital in Madrid, as Spain experiences its fifth day of lockdown European nations are examining extending the lockdowns put in place to try to stem the coronavirus outbreak. A lockdown imposed on 12 March in Italy, where the number of deaths may soon overtake China, will now extend beyond the original 25 March end date. France said its 15-day lockdown might also be extended, with European leaders reluctant to give any deadline for an end to crisis measures. There have been 207,000 cases worldwide with more than 8,600 deaths. The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched an emergency â¬750bn ($820bn; Â£700bn) package to ease the impact of the pandemic, with boss Christine Lagarde tweeting ""there are no limits"" to its commitment to the euro. Europe's markets stabilised on opening, moving into positive territory, although Asian markets remained volatile with the Nikkei closing down 1%. LIVE:Latest updates from around the world EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW MEASURES:What is the UK advice? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? The EU has introduced strict border controls. Travellers from outside are being turned away from airports and borders after the 27-country bloc imposed a 30-day ban to halt the spread of coronavirus. But EU leaders also agreed that internal borders that have been erected in recent days should come down. Separately, the EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had tested positive for coronavirus. He said on Twitter: ""I am doing well and in good spirits."" It is unclear how the pandemic will affect Brexit talks. The latest round was delayed on Wednesday but the UK government said it would look at different ways to continue discussions. This video can not be played Dutch minister Bruno Bruins collapsed during a coronavirus debate, later blaming exhaustion Italy shut down most businesses and banned public gatherings nationwide on 12 March. But Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday: ""The measures we have taken... must be extended beyond their original deadline."" He said the measures had meant ""we have avoided the collapse of the system"". But he told Corriere della Sera that ""we will not be able to return immediately to life as it was before"" even when the measures ended. On Wednesday, Italy reported that 475 more people had died in just one day. Any similar figure on Thursday would see it pass China's official death toll of 3,130,according to an ongoing list supplied by Johns Hopkins,external. A report by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita into the deaths in Italy of 2,003 people confirmed to be positive for coronavirus found that three regions, all in the north, were by far the worst hit. Lombardy accounted for 71%, Emilia-Romagna 17% and Veneto 3.9%. None of 13 other regions had more than 2% of the total, and 10 of them had less than 1%. Some studies point to the large number of elderly in the affected regions, and that a large proportion of 18-34s live at home with them. Different demographics in other nations may help to keep the death toll lower. France began its lockdown on Tuesday morning, requiring citizens to carry official paperwork stating why they were not at home. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told Europe 1 radio on Thursday: ""The 15-day period may be extended. If necessary, the government will renew it.""

The fine is â¬135 ($150; Â£123). ""Some people think they're some kind of modern-day hero when they break the rules - but they're imbeciles, and a danger to themselves,"" Mr Castaner said. Spain announced on Thursday its coronavirus deaths had risen by 169 to 767 in the past 24 hours, an increase of 28%. Its number of infected people rose by 3,431, reaching 17,147. Spain is the world's fourth-worst affected country and is under nationwide lockdown. German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed the nation on television on Wednesday, which she has previously only done for her annual New Year message. ""The situation is serious. Take it seriously. Not since German reunification, no, not since World War Two has our country faced a challenge that depends so much on our collective solidarity,"" she said. Germany has not imposed stringent measures, although it has closed schools and many businesses and public spaces. People can still go out and socialise but German media said her speech appeared to be a final warning to avoid mandatory lockdowns. Mrs Merkel did not announce new measures but said that could change at any time. On Thursday Germany reported that its number of coronavirus cases had increased to 10,999. The number of deaths there remains low but has risen to 20, the Robert Koch Institute said. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? The UK has also not imposed stringent lockdown measures as yetbut has announced schools will close. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he could not give any date for when they might reopen. London is the worst-affected area in the UK andhas now begun to slim down transport services. But the prime minister's spokesman said the government had no plans to bring in blanket travel restrictions for London or shut down the city's transport system. ""There is zero prospect of any restriction being placed on travelling in or out of London,"" he told reporters. He added that the police would maintain law and order, and there were no plans to use the military for this. Wednesday saw Russia report its first coronavirus-related death, a 79-year-old woman who died from pneumonia in Moscow. The country, which has reported only 147 cases, has temporarily barred entry to foreigners. It insists it has been transparent with its figures after some analysts questioned the low number.

Asian nations face second wave of virus casesThere is growing concern that people returning home as borders close could bring the virus with them.AsiaComments,"It comes as these countries had been successful in controlling its domestic cases South Korea, China and Singapore are among the Asian countries facing a second coronavirus wave, fuelled by people importing it from outside. China, where the virus first emerged, confirmed it had no new domestic cases on Wednesday for the first time since the outbreak began, a major milestone. But it reported 34 new cases among people who recently returned to China. Singapore also reported 47 new cases, of which 33 were imported - 30 of them returned Singapore residents. South Korea saw a jump in new cases on Thursday with 152, though it is not clear how many were imported.

But Hokkaido, the worst-affected Japanese region with 154 cases, is lifting its state of emergency - in place since late February - after officials said the spread of the virus appeared to be ending. Officials have urged people to remain cautious and stay at home, but said there had been ""no surge of infected patients that led to the collapse of the medical environment"". ""We've carried out powerful measures on refraining from going out, but from now on, we will move into a stage of reducing risks of the spread of infection while maintaining social and economic activities,"" governor Naomichi Suzuki said on Wednesday. The detectives racing to find coronavirus cases in Singapore China's National Health Commission (NHC) reported no domestically transmitted cases in China for the first time since the virus emerged in late December. It also said there were no cases at all in Wuhan, the outbreak centre which was essentially locked down earlier this year, but 34 cases arriving from abroad. Some Wuhan residents who have been shut up inside their homes for six weeks are being allowed out, as long as they do not gather in groups. Some businesses have also been allowed to resume work. Barriers have fenced people off in Wuhan to contain the viral outbreak, but restrictions are easing now In districts which have been cleared as ""epidemic-free"", small markets and convenience stores are reopening. As protection against imported infections, a hospital that used to treat Sars patients has been re-opened in the Chinese capital Beijing to quarantine suspected coronavirus cases. In Hong Kong, new arrivals will have to wear an electronic bracelet to track their movements. China's death toll stands at 3,245, however there have been ongoing questions over the reliability of China's data. All four countries had all been showing success in controlling domestic cases, but there is concern that increases elsewhere could unravel their progress. South Korea has been praised for its response to the epidemic, which has involved tracing the infection, testing large amounts of people and isolating patients quickly. The pace of daily new infections has slowed since the outbreak peaked earlier this month. Before Wednesday's increase, the number of people contracting the virus had been in double digits for the last four days. Health officials have warned there is no room for complacency and are once again urging the public to stay away from large gatherings including in churches, nursing homes, internet cafes and karaoke rooms. Three people from the national fencing team have tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a competition in Hungary. All 26 athletes and coaches are now being tested.

Malaysia's senior health official on Wednesday begged people to ""stay at home and protect yourself and your family. Please"". Malaysia has brought in a ban on public gatherings and closed schools Malaysia, which is under a partial lockdown, has tallied 710 people with the virus, the worst in South East Asia. Many of the cases are linked to one religious event in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in February. ""We have a slim chance to break the chain of Covid-19 infections,"" Noor Hisham Abdullah, director general of Health Malaysia, said on Facebook. ""Failure is not an option here. If not, we may face a third wave of this virus, which would be greater than a tsunami, if we maintain a 'so what' attitude."" According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University in the US, there are 215,955 cases and 8,749 deaths globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the vast majority - 80% - have occurred in Europe and the Western Pacific region, which includes much of Asia.

How schools and charities plan to feed children,"Charities are working to provide dinners for children on free school meals while pupils are at home School kitchens are being called on to provide dinners for children on free school meals after pupils are sent home due to thecoronavirus crisis. Charity Feeding Britain said it was working with schools to provide meals for parents to take home. Others are planning to provide food packages to leave on the doorsteps of self-isolating families. The prime minister said the government will help parents by providing vouchers to those who receive free school meals. Schools in England will close on Friday except for looking after the children of key workers and vulnerable children. It comes afterScotlandandWalessaid schools would close from the same day. Almost 1.3 million children, about 15% of those in England's state schools, receive free school meals because they come from low income families. Official data showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where more than one in four pupils were entitled to free meals. Schools and community centre kitchens are being lined up to prepare meals for children who would normally get one for free during term time. However, Andrew Forsey, of Feeding Britain, said its usual Easter holiday activities, involving crafts and games, would not go ahead. The charity is already working with a ""core group"" of schools to use their canteens to produce the meals, whereas in normal holidays they would remain closed. Its plans would see schools offer hot meals for parents to collect and take home. Others would offer ""cold but nutritious meals"" and in some cases ""particularly vulnerable"" families would have them delivered. The charity operates in parts of Yorkshire, Merseyside, Cheshire, Coventry, Bristol, Cornwall, South Shields, Derbyshire and Leicester. Mr Forsey said: ""In a school holiday it's normally a mix of food and activities for children, who have meals together but also some cooking and food-related activities, arts and crafts."" ""We'd also deliver food through community events, whereas under these plans we would have to work on the sole purpose of food."" Angie Comerford, who works atHebburn Helps,external, provides breakfast and lunches to school children during the holidays and said the charity would approach school closures like a ""long Easter holiday"". Angie Comerford from Hebburn Helps is assisting families who are self-isolating It provides hot meals and activities for children across South Tyneside, but as a result of high demand and many families self-isolating, they will only be providing packed lunches to Hebburn and Jarrow. ""We've got a couple of families who've had to self-isolate, but also kids who have got underlying health issues,"" Ms Comerford  said, adding volunteers were leaving food at doorsteps for them to collect. In a normal six-week summer holiday, they would provide 1,800 packed lunches. ""To be honest I haven't got a clue what it'll be this time,"" Ms Comerford said. ""We do have a couple of quid in the pot, but if anyone can pitch in by providing food or chuck us a couple a quid, that would be good."" Pupils on free school meals at 25 Co-op Academy schools will be given a Â£20 voucher for each week of unplanned closure to spend at Co-op supermarkets,chief executive Steve Murrells said,external. Food charity Fareshare said it was expecting to see a big demand for the services supporting children who, ""as a result of no longer having access to free school meals, will be at much greater risk of hunger and malnutrition"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said provision was being made to ""supply meals and vouchers"" to children on free school meals. ""Where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear that we will reimburse the cost,"" he said. LATEST:Live updates from around the world A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

'People do not buy a new outfit to stay at home',"The boss of Next has warned that the retailer faces a ""very significant drop in sales"" as a result of the effect of coronavirus on the business. Lord Wolfson said online sales were ""likely to fare better"" than the shops, but would also suffer ""significant losses"". ""People do not buy a new outfit to stay at home,"" he added. The risk to demand is by far the greatest challenge posed by coronavirus, said Lord Wolfson. ""We need to prepare for a significant downturn in sales for the duration of the pandemic,"" he said. When coronavirus first appeared in China, Lord Wolfson said Next assumed that the threat was to its supply chain. The warnings were contained in Next's annual results statement, which showed that in the year to January 2020 total group sales rose by 3.3% to Â£4.36bn, while profit edged up by 0.8% to Â£728.5m. Online sales performed strongly, rising by 11.9% to Â£2.14bn, but retail sales fell by 5.3% to Â£1.85bn. However, in the week beginning 8 March sales fell by 8.8% and declined by 30% between 15-17 March. Laura Ashley nears collapse as firms demand help Online shopping website Ocado suspends service Lord Wolfson said since it had no experience of a similar crisis there was no way of predicting the impact that coronavirus would have on its business. LIVE COVERAGE:Latest from the BBC EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? He added that the company had carried out a detailed stress test looking at the likely impact on cash and profits of different levels of sales decline. These range from a fall in sales of Â£445m, or 10% of annual turnover, up to a loss of Â£1bn, the equivalent of 25% of annual turnover. The stress test concluded that the business could ""comfortably sustain the loss of more than Â£1bn (25%) of annual full price sales, without exceeding our current bond and bank facilities"". The retailer added that some products were likely to do better than others. So far homeware and childrenswear sales have not been as badly hit as adult clothing, it said. Ocado temporarily closed its app on Wednesday Elsewhere, other businesses have revealed details of how the pandemic is affecting them. Supermarket chain Waitrose said from Friday it would reserve its first hour of opening for elderly and vulnerable customers and those who look after them. It also said it would close all its cafes and rotisseries and stop making coffees to free up staff to restock shelves. And from Thursday it has imposed limits on how many toilet rolls and certain other grocery items any one customer can buy in store. Aldi said it would reduce its weekday and Saturday opening by an hour a day from Friday to allow for restocking. Fashion firm Burberry warned that thenegative effect of the coronavirus on demand for luxury goodshad intensified. It said that sales in its stores have fallen by up to 50% over the past six weeks. Sales in China have started to pick up, but that has been offset by falls in sales in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the US. Burberry expects store sales to fall by between 70% and 80% in the final weeks of the year, and fourth quarter sales to drop by a third. Fashion retailer Joules said the decline in the number of people visiting its shops had ""significantly accelerated"". Online sales have also declined, but to a lesser extent, as people start to be more careful with their money. The company has cancelled its dividend. Ocado said first quarter sales revenue was up by more than 10%, but that increased demand had placed it under ""unprecedented strain"".Ocado temporarily closed its app on Wednesday, blaming higher demand than it could meet. Travel firm National Express said it had seen a significant decline in passenger numbers in recent weeks. However, it has contractual protections in place and as a result it thinks it will get in a little more money than it spends in the coming months. It has reduced its outgoings such as cutting spending on adverts and other discretionary spending. Brewer Shepherd Neame cancelled its dividend and said that following government advice for the public to avoid pubs, theatres and other hospitality venues it was ""inevitable that trading will deteriorate rapidly"". It called fortaxation to be cancelled immediately and for the government to give support with staff costs. Sushi restaurant chain Yo! said that it had taken the decision to close 54 of its restaurants ""for the time being"". The remaining 16 will remain open ""while this is in our control"", but will offer restricted hours and a reduced menu. Italian restaurant chain Prezzo announced it would temporarily close its restaurants. The move came after the government said people should avoid restaurants. ""It was always going to be question of when, not if, we would need to close our doors for a time,"" the company said.

Europe already looking to extend virus lockdowns,"Passers-by at the La Paz hospital in Madrid, as Spain experiences its fifth day of lockdown European nations are examining extending the lockdowns put in place to try to stem the coronavirus outbreak. A lockdown imposed on 12 March in Italy, where the number of deaths may soon overtake China, will now extend beyond the original 25 March end date. France said its 15-day lockdown might also be extended, with European leaders reluctant to give any deadline for an end to crisis measures. There have been 207,000 cases worldwide with more than 8,600 deaths. The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched an emergency â¬750bn ($820bn; Â£700bn) package to ease the impact of the pandemic, with boss Christine Lagarde tweeting ""there are no limits"" to its commitment to the euro. Europe's markets stabilised on opening, moving into positive territory, although Asian markets remained volatile with the Nikkei closing down 1%. LIVE:Latest updates from around the world EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW MEASURES:What is the UK advice? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? The EU has introduced strict border controls. Travellers from outside are being turned away from airports and borders after the 27-country bloc imposed a 30-day ban to halt the spread of coronavirus. But EU leaders also agreed that internal borders that have been erected in recent days should come down. Separately, the EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had tested positive for coronavirus. He said on Twitter: ""I am doing well and in good spirits."" It is unclear how the pandemic will affect Brexit talks. The latest round was delayed on Wednesday but the UK government said it would look at different ways to continue discussions. This video can not be played Dutch minister Bruno Bruins collapsed during a coronavirus debate, later blaming exhaustion Italy shut down most businesses and banned public gatherings nationwide on 12 March. But Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday: ""The measures we have taken... must be extended beyond their original deadline."" He said the measures had meant ""we have avoided the collapse of the system"". But he told Corriere della Sera that ""we will not be able to return immediately to life as it was before"" even when the measures ended. On Wednesday, Italy reported that 475 more people had died in just one day. Any similar figure on Thursday would see it pass China's official death toll of 3,130,according to an ongoing list supplied by Johns Hopkins,external. A report by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita into the deaths in Italy of 2,003 people confirmed to be positive for coronavirus found that three regions, all in the north, were by far the worst hit. Lombardy accounted for 71%, Emilia-Romagna 17% and Veneto 3.9%. None of 13 other regions had more than 2% of the total, and 10 of them had less than 1%. Some studies point to the large number of elderly in the affected regions, and that a large proportion of 18-34s live at home with them. Different demographics in other nations may help to keep the death toll lower. France began its lockdown on Tuesday morning, requiring citizens to carry official paperwork stating why they were not at home. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told Europe 1 radio on Thursday: ""The 15-day period may be extended. If necessary, the government will renew it."" This video can not be played The cruise ship cancellations have led to cleaner canals in Venice He said that 4,095 fines had been handed out to transgressors and 70,000 control checks made since Wednesday morning. The fine is â¬135 ($150; Â£123). ""Some people think they're some kind of modern-day hero when they break the rules - but they're imbeciles, and a danger to themselves,"" Mr Castaner said. Spain announced on Thursday its coronavirus deaths had risen by 169 to 767 in the past 24 hours, an increase of 28%. Its number of infected people rose by 3,431, reaching 17,147. Spain is the world's fourth-worst affected country and is under nationwide lockdown. German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed the nation on television on Wednesday, which she has previously only done for her annual New Year message. ""The situation is serious. Take it seriously. Not since German reunification, no, not since World War Two has our country faced a challenge that depends so much on our collective solidarity,"" she said. Germany has not imposed stringent measures, although it has closed schools and many businesses and public spaces. People can still go out and socialise but German media said her speech appeared to be a final warning to avoid mandatory lockdowns. Mrs Merkel did not announce new measures but said that could change at any time. On Thursday Germany reported that its number of coronavirus cases had increased to 10,999. The number of deaths there remains low but has risen to 20, the Robert Koch Institute said. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? The UK has also not imposed stringent lockdown measures as yetbut has announced schools will close. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he could not give any date for when they might reopen. London is the worst-affected area in the UK andhas now begun to slim down transport services. But the prime minister's spokesman said the government had no plans to bring in blanket travel restrictions for London or shut down the city's transport system. ""There is zero prospect of any restriction being placed on travelling in or out of London,"" he told reporters. He added that the police would maintain law and order, and there were no plans to use the military for this. Wednesday saw Russia report its first coronavirus-related death, a 79-year-old woman who died from pneumonia in Moscow. The country, which has reported only 147 cases, has temporarily barred entry to foreigners. It insists it has been transparent with its figures after some analysts questioned the low number.

Europe sets up emergency lifeline worth billions,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched an emergency â¬750bn ($820bn; Â£700bn) package to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It will buy government and company debt across the eurozone, including that of troubled Greece and Italy. ECB boss Christine Lagarde tweeted ""there are no limits"" to its commitment to the euro. In recent weeks central banks and governments around the world have announced major stimulus plans. The so-called Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme comes just six days after the ECB unveiled measures that failed to calm markets, piling pressure on it to do more to support Europe's economies.

The asset purchasing scheme will be temporary and be concluded once the ECB ""judges that the coronavirus Covid-19 crisis phase is over, but in any case not before the end of the year"", it said in statement. The announcement came after the bank's 25-member governing council held emergency talks by phone late into Wednesday evening. In recent days the ECB had been criticised for not doing enough to support the eurozone compared to the drastic action taken by the US Federal Reserve. Eurozone bank tries to ease coronavirus crisis US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Chancellor unveils Â£350bn lifeline for economy On Sunday the Fed cut interest rates to almost zero and launched a $700bn (Â£604bn) stimulus programme. It was part of co-ordinated action launched by the UK, Japan, eurozone, Canada and Switzerland. As part of that announcement, the Fed said it would work with other central banks to increase the availability of dollars for commercial banks. These so-called currency swap lines were an important tool in maintaining financial stability after the 2008 banking crisis. ""Today's coordinated action by major central banks will improve global liquidity by lowering the price and extending the maximum term of US dollar lending operations,"" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a joint statement with Andrew Bailey, who succeeded him as BoE chief on Monday.

Italy's bishops asked Catholics to say the rosary in their homes at 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT) and to put a lighted candle in their windows, as a sign of national unity. The request spread on social media after it was announced earlier this week, and many Catholics across the world joined in.

unemployment websites. We've just been told that Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have spoken by phone about the crisis. The former has welcomed the UK's decision to close schools. The Irish government said the move had brought a ""greater closeness"" between the positions in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The two men agreed on the need to ""keep in contact and align their actions"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic, ""in so far as possible"". BBC Question Time has come to an end, but it will continue in its new prime time slot next week. For more debate on the issues from tonight's show, listen into BBC Radio 5 Live now for Question Time Extra Time with Adrian Chiles. BBC Question Time The last question tonight is about how qualifications will be awarded to schoolchildren given exams have been cancelled. Union chief Frances O'Grady says a solution must be fair to pupils, noting teachers are ""desperate"" for clear guidance. She also calls on the government to make clear who will be defined as a ""key worker"" and able to carry on sending their children to school. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says guidance on qualifications will be made available ""as fast as we possibly can"". He says we'll have to wait for tomorrow for news on key workers - but NHS and social care workers, as well as those who make medical devices, will be on the list. BBC Question Time Frances O'Grady says it has been like ""survival of the fittest"" in supermarkets The topic of panic buying raises its ugly head on BBC's Question Time next. Union chief Frances O'Grady says: ""When I looked at some of those supermarket shelves, people sweeping up toilet roll and soap, it is almost like survival of the fittest. ""When we are scared, we often think of our families first, but as a community, we have to think about our neighbours, workmates, the elderly, and screw our heads on."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock praises supermarkets like Iceland who have introduced ""silver hours"" to ensure the elderly can come to shop and get supplies. But he says measures to stop mass buying ""have to be governed by supermarkets"" - not by orders through government. Instead he appeals to ""every single person who is fit and healthy"" to ""check the door on left, check the door on the right, the door over the road, and in a respectful, community way we will find help for lots of people"". He concludes: ""Everybody can play a part."" Read more on the steps shops are taking to combat stockpiling.And ourbusiness editor Simon Jack explainswhy supermarkets are drastically cutting their ranges amid the coronavirus crisis. What's happening in your part of the country?We've been tracking all the updatesto give you the clearest picture possible. Remember, though, that while a total of 3,269 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, the actual number is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. After UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock discussed efforts being made to get more essential kit to the NHS front line, we've learned that as many as 65,000 retired doctors and nurses could go back to work to help tackle the spread of coronavirus. The NHS has asked former employees who have left in the past three years to re-register with the regulatory bodies and ""boost the ranks"" of its staff. Those who return to work will be able to opt in to a register to fill a range of roles - clinical and non-clinical - based on their skills and how much time they have spent away from work. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: ""As the health service gears up to deal with the greatest global health threat in its history, my message to former colleagues is 'Your NHS Needs You'."" BBC Question Time Labour's Andy Burnham asks about help for low income workers As we said, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is being questioned about the help for businesses. He's pushed hard by Labour Mayor Andy Burnham ahead of an announcement by the chancellor tomorrow on more support. Mr Burnham says he has a lot of sympathy for the government, but they have ""taken a lot of measures that sounded good but they have not given all the answers"". The former minister accuses the government of ""doing the least for people who need help the most"" - such as those in insecure employment, the self-employed, and those already on benefits out of work. ""Those people can't follow government advice to self isolate, they have to go into work, they should have been first group to be helped,"" adds Mr Burnham. Mr Hancock says the government changed rules in the Budget just a week ago to help those people, and agrees the government must help businesses to keep people in work ""because it is the best way to be ready to bounce back"". He refuses to reveal what the Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce tomorrow when it comes to the amount people are given on statutory sick pay - around Â£94 per week - but concludes: ""Mark my words, we will do everything we can to make sure people are supported through this."" Question Time has moved on to questions around pay for workers struggling amid the crisis - including the self-employed, those on zero-hours contracts or those forced to stay off to look after family. What are your rights to pay if you're at home with your children now schools have closed?Find out the answer to that and other questions about work. Allow Twitter content?

BBC Question Time Back to Question Time and a viewer asks when frontline NHS staff will be tested after lots of complaints to the media by health workers. Dr Tom Solomon says it is critical to test NHS workers, but said Public Health England created a test ""as soon as they possibly could"". However, union chief Frances O'Grady says she is concerned by reports from staff not being able to get tested. ""Health staff and staff in social care are putting their health on the line for us, least they deserve is to get tests,"" she adds. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Labour's Andy Burnham, says services in his area also don't feel testing is happening fast enough and wonders if ""the eye was taken off the ball"" by the government. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock says tests are increasing everyday. He says he has today spent some of his department's cash today on new tests that work more like pregnancy tests - mentioned by the PM earlier - which makes it quicker to get results. He adds: ""Testing is the way to get a grip on this curve and hopefully, in time, reduce some of the incredibly draconian measures."" He also says that by next week, every social care provider will have protective equipment. A quick round-up of some of the top coronavirus news stories for you as Question Time carries on:  And some other interesting or helpful pieces you might like: For the first time in the history of Question Time there is no studio audience because of the social distancing measures currently in place - but the people of Weston-super-Mare have recorded questions to be played in via video link.

The government plan to stop you touching your faceHow Singapore stayed one step ahead of the virus,"People in the UK are being asked to improve their personal hygiene in an effort to limit and slow the spread of coronavirus. But how's the government going about it? Don't touch your face. It's something people are thought to domore than 20 times an hour on average,,externalbut the official advice is to desist so that coronavirus doesn't spread any faster. It's not easy to give up unhygienic habits picked up over a lifetime, though. So the government is using ""Nudge theory"", a branch of economics designed to get us to do the ""right thing"" by making it easier, more normal and more obvious. The Behavioural Insights Team (BIT), a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office, is advising ministers on how best to do it. It's come up with some ideas to prevent face-touching,as featured on its blog.,external How about asking friends, family or colleagues to shout ""face"" every time they see you're about to reach up for a scratch or rub? Or folding your arms in a locked position, grabbing the biceps to avoid the hands slipping free and heading upwards? Another suggestion is creating an alternative ""habitual"" action, such as drumming fingers on legs or playing with a substitute object, such a ball. ""Even if you're very concerned about coronavirus, it's very difficult to stop doing something like face-touching because it's such a habit,"" says Cynthia McVey, former head of psychology at Glasgow Caledonian University. ""There have been reports of people who are worried enough to wear masks who have still removed them so they can rub their nose."" LIVE UPDATES:Latest on coronavirus across the world EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Nudge theory, already widely used by governments, aims to instil better habits - or change social ""norms"" - rather than focusing on explicit ""top-down"" advice. If enough people do something, you feel a sense of oddness, of missing out, of guilt perhaps, if you don't do the same. ""It's more powerful than traditional methods of getting across certain advice,"" says Kelly Hunstone, chief executive of the Social Change UK agency and a former adviser on behavioural science to the government. ""We've left the age of deference and need to communicate differently. ""In some instances we don't trust the experts but the person on the street to show us how to act. It's a bit like using Tripadvisor - you'd rather take the advice of Bob in Essex than a travel operator."" Since the coronavirus crisis began, the government has recommended singing Happy Birthday to yourself twice while washing your hands. It's easier to remember than counting the full 20 seconds this equates to. We've also been advised tosneeze into our sleeves,externalif there are no tissues around. Both tips bear the signs of Nudge theory, which emphasises putting across a ""clear message"". Nudge theory also assumes people don't always act in their own best interests, or those of society - for reasons such as laziness, selfishness and ignorance. Hence the need to ease the way towards doing what a government wants us to do. It's an idea that has caught on at local and national level since the book Nudge, by US academics Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, was published in 2008. Some UK councils provide recycling bins that are larger than their normal waste bins, in an effort to get people recycle more. Tax reminders are sent out saying the ""majority"" of people in an area have already paid, putting social pressure on recipients to do the same. And there are now automatic donor cards andautomatic enrolment work pensions,external- where people have to opt out, rather than in. These have beenshown to increase take-up rates.,external What can be done, though, to deal with the effects of coronavirus on society? The government is urging people not to stockpile toilet paper, pasta and other goods, while supermarkets are putting up notices asking people not to over-purchase and leave others without. The logic is clear, but Ms Hunstone advocates a more Nudge-y, emotion-led approach. ""It would be more effective to show a picture of Doris Jones, 76, who can't get out easily to visit the supermarket, if you're trying to persuade people not to buy too many cans of baked beans or loo rolls,"" Ms Hunstone says. She argues that pictures like this, seen recently on Facebook, could be placed in shops, inducing guilt in those tempted to stuff their trolleys. Allow Facebook content?

""It's also important to use the ego when you're putting out this kind of message and people like to be seen doing what's right,"" Ms Hunstone adds. People leaving enough provisions on shelves could photograph their trolleys or baskets and share them on social media, further marginalising those who do not, she says. So, in a way, ""annoying"" virtue-signallers could encourage the spread of virtuous behaviour in others. The UK government has faced criticism for adopting a different approach to other countries towards coronavirus, focusing more so far on people following advice than creating a wider ""lockdown"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has signalled a change of approach this week, urging people to reduce social contact with others, but the measures are less severe than in many other European countries, necessitating simple advice. Staff with the Behavioural Insights Team are honing and testing messages to create the greatest impact. ""Simplicity is key,"" says Ms Hunstone. It might get boring hearing the same thing again and again. But you have to hear messages like that nine times before people really understand them and they get through. Consistency is absolutely vital."" There have been criticisms that Nudge theory infantilises people, not crediting them with the ability to think for themselves and removing effective choice. But it's very much in favour in Downing Street. Whether it can stop people touching their faces remains to be seen.

Latest virus coverage,"Italy registers 475 new deaths - the highest one-day rise since it was hit by the virus The UK is to shut schools - but they will still need to look after children of key workers Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells news conference ""we need to apply further downward pressure"" on cases Tougher restrictions in London not ruled out by PM Canada and US closing border to non-essential transit Confirmed cases worldwide pass 200,000, more than 8,000 people have died EU countries have begun turning away travellers from outside the bloc Share prices across global markets fall as stimulus packages fail to reassure markets Glastonbury festival and Eurovison Song Contest cancelled Gareth Evans, Robert Greenall, Joshua Cheetham, Kevin Ponniah, Emma Owen, Jennifer Scott, George Bowden, Patrick Jackson, Ashitha Nagesh, Claudia Allen, Mary O'Connor, Gavin Stamp, Saira Asher and Andreas Illmer Well, that was another big day, with a lot of news to digest. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. So for now, here are the latest headlines: We leave you withthis piece that explains two conceptsthat many millions will need to familiarise themselves with: social distancing and self-isolation. And, as always,you can find all of our latest coronavirus stories here. As it stands, the World Health Organisation has confirmed more than 205,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, with the pandemic now affecting over 170 countries. There are many sources for tracking cases, some more reliable than others. Here is a round-up of confirmed cases in 10 the world's hardest-hit countries. We have sourced the figures either from the ongoing tally of cases by Johns Hopkins University or directly from health authorities.  Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland, has announced a state of emergency and a mandatory quarantine on arrivals to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes other Australians and locals heading home from the mainland. The only exceptions are for health and trade workers. The nation's smallest state currently has 10 cases, while there are around 270 in New South Wales and 150 in Victoria - states which have 15 times larger populations. State premier Peter Gutwein says these are the ""toughest border measures in the country"". UK medical staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One NHS doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" due to inadequate supplies of vital equipment such as face masks. Dr Frances Mair told Newsnight her GP practice in Scotland and ""many others"" did not have the personal protective equipment needed ""to keep us safe"". ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die."" Dr Nishant Joshi, who works in A&E at Luton and Dunstable general hospital, said staff were at ""grave risk"". ""We're fighting an invisible enemy, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind our backs,"" he told Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""stockpiles"" of equipment ready to be used. Read more here.  Canada's chief public health official, Dr Theresa Tam, says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases over the last week that point to community spread of Covid-19. ""A number of provinces have reported cases with no links to travel,"" Dr Tam said. ""Our time to act is now."" There are currently 598 cases confirmed in Canada and eight deaths.  G'day from Australia, where it's Thursday. The nation has now recorded close to 600 cases including six deaths. Authorities are urging social distancing but standing by policies to keep schools, public transport and other ""essential"" services open. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday also instructed Australians to not travel abroad - that's led to an announcement from the national carrier Qantas this morning. The airline, and its sister budget carrier Jetstar are temporarily standing down two-thirds of their 30,000 employees ""to preserve as many jobs as possible longer term"". All international flights will be suspended from late March. Virgin Australia also suspended routes yesterday. Canberra announced a raft of measures on Wednesday,catch up on those key restrictions here. The nation's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia is also set to announce more economic drivers today. President Donald Trump has said the US government's housing agency will stop repossessing homes until the end of April. Evictions will be suspended over the same time frame in a moratorium protecting eight million mortgages. Two US Navy hospitals ships will also be sent to help relieve an expected shortage of sick beds. Read more here A sign above a street in Venice reads: ""Everything will be alright."" The dire news from Italy is that despite a lockdown that has been in place for 10 days across the country, the death toll from this virus has continued to rise and rise. It increased by 475 on Wednesday, the biggest in one day since the outbreak began, with 319 of these deaths occuring in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been the worst-affected. Italian doctors had hoped to see infections slowing after a week of lockdown but that hasn't happened. Some say that only after two weeks - believed to be the maximum time period it takes for symptoms to show - will they truly be able to see if the virus's spread has been slowed by the drastic measures taken. The governor of Lombardy has appealed to the public to continue to stay at home and not flout the government's orders. ""Soon we will no longer be in a position to assist those who are sick,"" Attilio Fontana said earlier today. ""We are asking you to make a sacrifice to save lives.""   The number of confirmed cases in Ireland has risen by 74, bringing the total number to 366, the Department of Health has said. The cases are made up of 29 females and 45 males, it added. On Tuesday, PM Leo Varadkar said Ireland could have 15,000 cases of coronavirus before the end of March. In a St Patrick's Day address, he warned of ""significant and lasting"" economic damage and said the emergency could last into the summer. The government has already closed pubs, schools and universities. This video can not be played Coronavirus explained in 60 seconds What actually is the coronavirus? How might it affect you? What can you do to prevent it? The BBC's Laura Foster explains everything you need to know â in just one minute. There's one major question about this pandemic that millions of people will be hoping has a positive answer: will we see a vaccine anytime soon? Well, earlier today, we heard some promising words from the world's leading public health body. The World Health Organization (WHO) hailed an ""incredible achievement"" in the effort to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus. ""The first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was shared,"" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. That trial began in the USat the Kaiser Permanente research facility in Seattle earlier this week. Four patients received the jab, which cannot cause Covid-19 but contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus. Now for the bad news. Experts warn that it will be many months before it is clear whether this vaccine, or any of the others that are also in research, will work. And even if these initial safety tests go well, it will still take time for any potential vaccine to become available to the public. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. But don't be too disheartened. Scientists around the world are fast-tracking research in an effort to mass produce a safe vaccine as soon as possible. Stephen McGrath, Romania Jim Turnbull decided to donate the sanitiser to his community Jim Turnbull owns a food production facility in the Romanian region of Transylvania and was due to return to the UK on Tuesday but decided to stay on. He has begun using the alcohol by-product from his elderflower gin distillation to make a hand sanitiser followingguidance by the World Health Organization,external. âGiven the crisis we thought to donate it to our local community - where we get our workforce from,â says Mr Turnbull, 68, who lives in the village of Saschiz, which has a population of some 2,000. Romania has so far had 260 confirmed cases of coronavirus but no deaths. However, its rural population, which makes up around 46% of the countryâs 19 million people, is ageing and could be vulnerable. Bars and restaurants have been shut but Bogdan Tanase, head of Romaniaâs Doctors' Alliance, told the BBC Romania was âill-prepared to deal with an epidemicâ. On Wednesday alone, police in France have handed out more than 4,000 fines to people violating government orders to stay at home. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told local outlet TF1 that the fine has been increased from â¬35 ($38; Â£32), and can be as much as â¬375 to try to dissuade people. Since yesterday, people in France have been banned from going outside except for exercise and essential trips. During a White House briefing today, President Trump was questioned on his repeated use of the term ""Chinese virus"" to describe Covid-19 - a term critics say has contributed to racism against Asian-Americans - as well as why top US athletes have had access to tests when most Americans haven't. ""Perhaps thatâs been the story of life,"" Trump remarked.

But other developments have been reported around the world as the virus continues to spread: Prof Sian Griffiths is asked by BBC One viewers when and how will we know if these social distancing measures are working. She says: ""You can see changes in people's behaviour, but that's not very accurate. ""We will see it by a fall in the number of positive tests, the number going into hospital and sadly by the numbers who have passed away."" There has been a rise today of nearly 700 cases in the UK, and a total of 104 deaths, so BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh is asked, what next? ""The key message is we are all in this together,"" he says. ""We have to wash our hands, we have to comply... if we don't and if we don't see the number of cases reduce in three weeks time, what is advisory could become compulsory."" But Prof Griffiths reminds viewers: ""This too will pass."" Victoria in Belfast ""I am furious over the school closures. I am a self-employed mother of twins. I have zero support.

Energy bill help for vulnerable amid outbreakPrepayment meter customers may get credit through the post or funds automatically added to their meter.Business,"Gas and electricity suppliers have agreed an emergency package of measures to ensure vulnerable people do not get cut off amid a virus outbreak. More than four million people who are on prepayment meters will receive help if they cannot get out to top up. This may include credit being sent in the post or funds automatically added to their meter. Those struggling to pay bills will receive support and no credit meter disconnections will take place. Debt repayments and bill payments could be reassessed, paused or reduced where needed, if energy customers are finding it difficult. Firms could also send somebody out on a customer's behalf to top up a prepayment meter. ""While friends and family will play a role in helping people impacted by the coronavirus, we recognise there will be many customers who will need additional support and reassurance, particularly those who are financially impacted or in vulnerable circumstances,"" said Business and Energy Secretary Alok Sharma. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic In a letter to customers, the Energy Networks Association said there were 36,000 people working to keep homes powered. It said: ""We look after your gas and electricity networks, and have well-practised contingency plans in place so we can keep your energy flowing. We want to reassure you that we are prepared."" Dame Gillian Guy, the head of Citizens Advice, said: ""Keeping people on supply, making sure they have warm homes and don't face additional financial or other stresses about their energy supply will be essential."" Energy bills set to fall for millions of households What do you know about saving energy at home? Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Experts say that people working from home may see a fairly swift rise in energy use, and therefore their bill, although the energy price cap will be lowered in April. Anna Moss, at Cornwall Insight, said: ""Self-isolating or working from home may mean consumers are using more energy, which for some consumers will pass through quickly to their energy bills. For those customers that fall into the vulnerable bracket, this can be daunting and difficult to manage."" However, experts add that Britain's gas and electricity grids should be able to keep the lights running during the crisis without much problem. Having people stuck at home might even out the peaks in the evening when people usually come back from work, when the strain on the energy system is at its highest. Meanwhile, as offices and factories shut down, daytime energy use is likely to fall slightly, even as more energy is used in British homes.

How schools and charities plan to feed childrenCharities are working to help pupils who are entitled to free school meals after they are sent home.England,"Charities are working to provide dinners for children on free school meals while pupils are at home School kitchens are being called on to provide dinners for children on free school meals after pupils are sent home due to thecoronavirus crisis. Charity Feeding Britain said it was working with schools to provide meals for parents to take home. Others are planning to provide food packages to leave on the doorsteps of self-isolating families. The prime minister said the government will help parents by providing vouchers to those who receive free school meals. Schools in England will close on Friday except for looking after the children of key workers and vulnerable children. It comes afterScotlandandWalessaid schools would close from the same day. Almost 1.3 million children, about 15% of those in England's state schools, receive free school meals because they come from low income families. Official data showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where more than one in four pupils were entitled to free meals. Schools and community centre kitchens are being lined up to prepare meals for children who would normally get one for free during term time. However, Andrew Forsey, of Feeding Britain, said its usual Easter holiday activities, involving crafts and games, would not go ahead. The charity is already working with a ""core group"" of schools to use their canteens to produce the meals, whereas in normal holidays they would remain closed. Its plans would see schools offer hot meals for parents to collect and take home. Others would offer ""cold but nutritious meals"" and in some cases ""particularly vulnerable"" families would have them delivered. The charity operates in parts of Yorkshire, Merseyside, Cheshire, Coventry, Bristol, Cornwall, South Shields, Derbyshire and Leicester. Mr Forsey said: ""In a school holiday it's normally a mix of food and activities for children, who have meals together but also some cooking and food-related activities, arts and crafts."" ""We'd also deliver food through community events, whereas under these plans we would have to work on the sole purpose of food."" Angie Comerford, who works atHebburn Helps,external, provides breakfast and lunches to school children during the holidays and said the charity would approach school closures like a ""long Easter holiday"". Angie Comerford from Hebburn Helps is assisting families who are self-isolating It provides hot meals and activities for children across South Tyneside, but as a result of high demand and many families self-isolating, they will only be providing packed lunches to Hebburn and Jarrow. ""We've got a couple of families who've had to self-isolate, but also kids who have got underlying health issues,"" Ms Comerford  said, adding volunteers were leaving food at doorsteps for them to collect. In a normal six-week summer holiday, they would provide 1,800 packed lunches. ""To be honest I haven't got a clue what it'll be this time,"" Ms Comerford said. ""We do have a couple of quid in the pot, but if anyone can pitch in by providing food or chuck us a couple a quid, that would be good."" Pupils on free school meals at 25 Co-op Academy schools will be given a Â£20 voucher for each week of unplanned closure to spend at Co-op supermarkets,chief executive Steve Murrells said,external. Food charity Fareshare said it was expecting to see a big demand for the services supporting children who, ""as a result of no longer having access to free school meals, will be at much greater risk of hunger and malnutrition"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said provision was being made to ""supply meals and vouchers"" to children on free school meals. ""Where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear that we will reimburse the cost,"" he said. LATEST:Live updates from around the world A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Canadaâs Foreign Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne has been tested for Covid-19 after experiencing âflu-like symptomsâ after returning from abroad. He will self-isolate as he awaits results âvery shortlyâ. âI will continue to work around the clock to support Canadians,â Champagne said, urging citizens to practice self distancing and âtake all necessary precautions to protect each otherâ. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus, though Trudeau himself has shown no symptoms. Froeign Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne is awaiting coronavirus test results The Czech government has pledged $40 billion (Â£35 billion) to businesses so they can pay their workers' wages. Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the money would be made up of $4bn in aid, and the rest would be loan guarantees, so firms can weather the huge losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday the Czech Republic reported 134 new cases of the illness in 24 hours, bringing its total up to 694. All countries are under pressure to try to mitigate the impact of the crisis on their economies and citizens. The UK government is set to announce further measures on Friday. From one city to another and soldiers in medical masks have now sealed off Amman from the rest of Jordan as a lockdown comes into force. Army checkpoints have been established on main entrances to the capital, as a travel ban came into force that only allows entry to essential goods or people with authorised business. Army spokesman Brigadier General Mukhles al Mufleh told state media the measures were ""to prevent the spread of the virus"". Today the number of confirmed cases in Jordan rose by 13 people to 69. More from the US... Bill
de Blasio says his city is just two to three weeks away from
running out of critical medical supplies. Three million N-95
masks, 50 million surgical masks, 15,000 ventilators, 25 million surgical gowns
and 25 million gloves are needed ""by early in April"", New York's mayor said, ""for us to ensure that our healthcare system, public and
private, can bear the brunt of the coronavirus crisis."" The cry for help comes
as New York City reports a total of 3,615 confirmed Covid-19 cases, and 22
deaths. ""This is going to
be one of the most difficult moments in New York City history,"" de Blasio
said. De Blasio
yesterday called upon the US military to intervene in the coronavirus
outbreak in his city ""I want their
medical teams, I want their logistical support... the only force in
America that can do that effectively and quickly,"" he said. Following that sad news on the death toll in Italy, Pope Francis has led a televised service from the Vatican this evening to pray for an end to the pandemic. Italy's bishops asked Catholics to say the rosary in their homes at 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT) and to put a lighted candle in their windows, as a sign of national unity. The request spread on social media after it was announced earlier this week, and many Catholics across the world joined in. In a broadcast message before the prayers, Pope Francis said: ""In this unprecedented situation, when everything seems to be vacillating, let us help each other remain steady in what really matters.""

The latest episode of the BBC's daily podcast covering the pandemic has just been released. It includes the latest from Italy, where today the death toll surpassed that in China. As the
virus continues its spread through all 50 states, plus Washington, DC, the
number of confirmed cases in the US has climbed to11,274. Across the country,157 people have died, with
concentrated clusters on the countryâs West Coast - namely Washington state and
California - and New York. The US
State Department hasissued
a Level 4 warning- the highest possible - advising US citizens to avoid all international travel
and, for those abroad, to âarrange for immediate return to the United States,
unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite periodâ. Amid
rising panic - and sustained criticism of the administration for its response
to the outbreak - President Donald Trump said on Thursdayhe would rush the
development of vaccines and treatmentsâas fast as it can possibly be doneâ for Covid-19. He announced earlier this
week that human testing on a vaccine trial had begun. US
lawmakers are moving to pass a $1 trillion - or larger - emergency aid package
sought by the White House in order to send$1,200
cheques to American taxpayers,
and $2,400 to families. As businesses are forced to shutter, first-time claims
for unemployment insurance have surged, crashing government
unemployment websites. We've just been told that Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have spoken by phone about the crisis. The former has welcomed the UK's decision to close schools. The Irish government said the move had brought a ""greater closeness"" between the positions in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The two men agreed on the need to ""keep in contact and align their actions"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic, ""in so far as possible"". BBC Question Time has come to an end, but it will continue in its new prime time slot next week. For more debate on the issues from tonight's show, listen into BBC Radio 5 Live now for Question Time Extra Time with Adrian Chiles. BBC Question Time The last question tonight is about how qualifications will be awarded to schoolchildren given exams have been cancelled. Union chief Frances O'Grady says a solution must be fair to pupils, noting teachers are ""desperate"" for clear guidance. She also calls on the government to make clear who will be defined as a ""key worker"" and able to carry on sending their children to school. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says guidance on qualifications will be made available ""as fast as we possibly can"". He says we'll have to wait for tomorrow for news on key workers - but NHS and social care workers, as well as those who make medical devices, will be on the list. BBC Question Time Frances O'Grady says it has been like ""survival of the fittest"" in supermarkets The topic of panic buying raises its ugly head on BBC's Question Time next. Union chief Frances O'Grady says: ""When I looked at some of those supermarket shelves, people sweeping up toilet roll and soap, it is almost like survival of the fittest. ""When we are scared, we often think of our families first, but as a community, we have to think about our neighbours, workmates, the elderly, and screw our heads on."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock praises supermarkets like Iceland who have introduced ""silver hours"" to ensure the elderly can come to shop and get supplies. But he says measures to stop mass buying ""have to be governed by supermarkets"" - not by orders through government. Instead he appeals to ""every single person who is fit and healthy"" to ""check the door on left, check the door on the right, the door over the road, and in a respectful, community way we will find help for lots of people"". He concludes: ""Everybody can play a part."" Read more on the steps shops are taking to combat stockpiling.And ourbusiness editor Simon Jack explainswhy supermarkets are drastically cutting their ranges amid the coronavirus crisis. What's happening in your part of the country?We've been tracking all the updatesto give you the clearest picture possible. Remember, though, that while a total of 3,269 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, the actual number is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. After UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock discussed efforts being made to get more essential kit to the NHS front line, we've learned that as many as 65,000 retired doctors and nurses could go back to work to help tackle the spread of coronavirus. The NHS has asked former employees who have left in the past three years to re-register with the regulatory bodies and ""boost the ranks"" of its staff. Those who return to work will be able to opt in to a register to fill a range of roles - clinical and non-clinical - based on their skills and how much time they have spent away from work. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: ""As the health service gears up to deal with the greatest global health threat in its history, my message to former colleagues is 'Your NHS Needs You'."" BBC Question Time Labour's Andy Burnham asks about help for low income workers As we said, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is being questioned about the help for businesses. He's pushed hard by Labour Mayor Andy Burnham ahead of an announcement by the chancellor tomorrow on more support. Mr Burnham says he has a lot of sympathy for the government, but they have ""taken a lot of measures that sounded good but they have not given all the answers"". The former minister accuses the government of ""doing the least for people who need help the most"" - such as those in insecure employment, the self-employed, and those already on benefits out of work. ""Those people can't follow government advice to self isolate, they have to go into work, they should have been first group to be helped,"" adds Mr Burnham. Mr Hancock says the government changed rules in the Budget just a week ago to help those people, and agrees the government must help businesses to keep people in work ""because it is the best way to be ready to bounce back"". He refuses to reveal what the Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce tomorrow when it comes to the amount people are given on statutory sick pay - around Â£94 per week - but concludes: ""Mark my words, we will do everything we can to make sure people are supported through this."" Question Time has moved on to questions around pay for workers struggling amid the crisis - including the self-employed, those on zero-hours contracts or those forced to stay off to look after family. What are your rights to pay if you're at home with your children now schools have closed?Find out the answer to that and other questions about work. Allow Twitter content?

BBC Question Time Back to Question Time and a viewer asks when frontline NHS staff will be tested after lots of complaints to the media by health workers. Dr Tom Solomon says it is critical to test NHS workers, but said Public Health England created a test ""as soon as they possibly could"". However, union chief Frances O'Grady says she is concerned by reports from staff not being able to get tested. ""Health staff and staff in social care are putting their health on the line for us, least they deserve is to get tests,"" she adds. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Labour's Andy Burnham, says services in his area also don't feel testing is happening fast enough and wonders if ""the eye was taken off the ball"" by the government. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock says tests are increasing everyday. He says he has today spent some of his department's cash today on new tests that work more like pregnancy tests - mentioned by the PM earlier - which makes it quicker to get results. He adds: ""Testing is the way to get a grip on this curve and hopefully, in time, reduce some of the incredibly draconian measures."" He also says that by next week, every social care provider will have protective equipment. A quick round-up of some of the top coronavirus news stories for you as Question Time carries on:  And some other interesting or helpful pieces you might like: For the first time in the history of Question Time there is no studio audience because of the social distancing measures currently in place - but the people of Weston-super-Mare have recorded questions to be played in via video link.

ECB launches emergency Â£700bn coronavirus package,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched an emergency â¬750bn ($820bn; Â£700bn) package to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It will buy government and company debt across the eurozone, including that of troubled Greece and Italy. ECB boss Christine Lagarde tweeted ""there are no limits"" to its commitment to the euro. In recent weeks central banks and governments around the world have announced major stimulus plans. The so-called Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme comes just six days after the ECB unveiled measures that failed to calm markets, piling pressure on it to do more to support Europe's economies. Announcing this latest move Ms Lagarde said the ECB will do everything in its powers to support the euro in these ""extraordinary times"". Allow Twitter content?

The asset purchasing scheme will be temporary and be concluded once the ECB ""judges that the coronavirus Covid-19 crisis phase is over, but in any case not before the end of the year"", it said in statement. The announcement came after the bank's 25-member governing council held emergency talks by phone late into Wednesday evening. In recent days the ECB had been criticised for not doing enough to support the eurozone compared to the drastic action taken by the US Federal Reserve. Eurozone bank tries to ease coronavirus crisis US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan Chancellor unveils Â£350bn lifeline for economy On Sunday the Fed cut interest rates to almost zero and launched a $700bn (Â£604bn) stimulus programme. It was part of co-ordinated action launched by the UK, Japan, eurozone, Canada and Switzerland. As part of that announcement, the Fed said it would work with other central banks to increase the availability of dollars for commercial banks. These so-called currency swap lines were an important tool in maintaining financial stability after the 2008 banking crisis. ""Today's coordinated action by major central banks will improve global liquidity by lowering the price and extending the maximum term of US dollar lending operations,"" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a joint statement with Andrew Bailey, who succeeded him as BoE chief on Monday. The Bank of Japan also eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions.

The government plan to stop you touching your face,"People in the UK are being asked to improve their personal hygiene in an effort to limit and slow the spread of coronavirus. But how's the government going about it? Don't touch your face. It's something people are thought to domore than 20 times an hour on average,,externalbut the official advice is to desist so that coronavirus doesn't spread any faster. It's not easy to give up unhygienic habits picked up over a lifetime, though. So the government is using ""Nudge theory"", a branch of economics designed to get us to do the ""right thing"" by making it easier, more normal and more obvious. The Behavioural Insights Team (BIT), a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office, is advising ministers on how best to do it. It's come up with some ideas to prevent face-touching,as featured on its blog.,external How about asking friends, family or colleagues to shout ""face"" every time they see you're about to reach up for a scratch or rub? Or folding your arms in a locked position, grabbing the biceps to avoid the hands slipping free and heading upwards? Another suggestion is creating an alternative ""habitual"" action, such as drumming fingers on legs or playing with a substitute object, such a ball. ""Even if you're very concerned about coronavirus, it's very difficult to stop doing something like face-touching because it's such a habit,"" says Cynthia McVey, former head of psychology at Glasgow Caledonian University. ""There have been reports of people who are worried enough to wear masks who have still removed them so they can rub their nose."" LIVE UPDATES:Latest on coronavirus across the world EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:What is the UK's 'delay' phase? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Nudge theory, already widely used by governments, aims to instil better habits - or change social ""norms"" - rather than focusing on explicit ""top-down"" advice. If enough people do something, you feel a sense of oddness, of missing out, of guilt perhaps, if you don't do the same. ""It's more powerful than traditional methods of getting across certain advice,"" says Kelly Hunstone, chief executive of the Social Change UK agency and a former adviser on behavioural science to the government. ""We've left the age of deference and need to communicate differently. ""In some instances we don't trust the experts but the person on the street to show us how to act. It's a bit like using Tripadvisor - you'd rather take the advice of Bob in Essex than a travel operator."" Since the coronavirus crisis began, the government has recommended singing Happy Birthday to yourself twice while washing your hands. It's easier to remember than counting the full 20 seconds this equates to. We've also been advised tosneeze into our sleeves,externalif there are no tissues around. Both tips bear the signs of Nudge theory, which emphasises putting across a ""clear message"". Nudge theory also assumes people don't always act in their own best interests, or those of society - for reasons such as laziness, selfishness and ignorance. Hence the need to ease the way towards doing what a government wants us to do. It's an idea that has caught on at local and national level since the book Nudge, by US academics Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, was published in 2008. Some UK councils provide recycling bins that are larger than their normal waste bins, in an effort to get people recycle more. Tax reminders are sent out saying the ""majority"" of people in an area have already paid, putting social pressure on recipients to do the same. And there are now automatic donor cards andautomatic enrolment work pensions,external- where people have to opt out, rather than in. These have beenshown to increase take-up rates.,external What can be done, though, to deal with the effects of coronavirus on society? The government is urging people not to stockpile toilet paper, pasta and other goods, while supermarkets are putting up notices asking people not to over-purchase and leave others without. The logic is clear, but Ms Hunstone advocates a more Nudge-y, emotion-led approach. ""It would be more effective to show a picture of Doris Jones, 76, who can't get out easily to visit the supermarket, if you're trying to persuade people not to buy too many cans of baked beans or loo rolls,"" Ms Hunstone says. She argues that pictures like this, seen recently on Facebook, could be placed in shops, inducing guilt in those tempted to stuff their trolleys. Allow Facebook content?

""It's also important to use the ego when you're putting out this kind of message and people like to be seen doing what's right,"" Ms Hunstone adds. People leaving enough provisions on shelves could photograph their trolleys or baskets and share them on social media, further marginalising those who do not, she says. So, in a way, ""annoying"" virtue-signallers could encourage the spread of virtuous behaviour in others. The UK government has faced criticism for adopting a different approach to other countries towards coronavirus, focusing more so far on people following advice than creating a wider ""lockdown"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has signalled a change of approach this week, urging people to reduce social contact with others, but the measures are less severe than in many other European countries, necessitating simple advice. Staff with the Behavioural Insights Team are honing and testing messages to create the greatest impact. ""Simplicity is key,"" says Ms Hunstone. It might get boring hearing the same thing again and again. But you have to hear messages like that nine times before people really understand them and they get through. Consistency is absolutely vital."" There have been criticisms that Nudge theory infantilises people, not crediting them with the ability to think for themselves and removing effective choice. But it's very much in favour in Downing Street. Whether it can stop people touching their faces remains to be seen.

UK schools to close from Friday,"This video can not be played The prime minister spoke about why the decision to close schools was taken Schools in the UK are to shut from Friday until further notice as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Schools will close except for looking after the children of keyworkers and vulnerable children, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. This academic year's exams will not go ahead in England and Wales; decisions are due to be made in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It came as UK deaths reached 104 after a further 33 people died. Thirty-two were in England and one in Scotland. Confirmed cases in the UK rose to 2,626 on Wednesday, from 1,950 on Tuesday. There have been 56,221 tests carried out in the UK for Covid-19, of which 53,595 were confirmed negative. The government says it plans to more than double the number of tests being carried out in England to 25,000 a day. Follow live updates here School closures: What will happen now? Analysis: UK changes course amid death toll fears How families can cope with self-isolating together Nurseries, private schools and sixth forms are also being told to follow the guidance to close their doors.

EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Questions had been asked about why the government had not moved to shut schools until now. On Monday, the PM announced a series ofnew key measuresto target the number of coronavirus cases afterscientific modelling,externalshowed the UK was on course for a ""catastrophic epidemic"". As school closures were announced on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: ""We think now that we must apply further downward pressure with that upward curve by closing schools."" He thanked teachers and head teachers and said that by looking after children of key workers, such as NHS staff, they ""will be a critical part of the fight back"" against coronavirus. But he added that children ""should not be left"" with grandparents or others in groups vulnerable to contracting coronavirus. Revealing the shutdown of schools in England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs assessments or exams would not go ahead this year and performance tables would not be published. But he said officials were working with exam boards ""to ensure that children get the qualifications that they need"". Schools have already been preparing for a shutdown for some time, with some creating homework packs or setting up ways of working online. But there have been concerns about the ability of frontline NHS staff and others to remain in work if their children are not in school. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told BBC One's new daily coronavirus update programme that school is ""not dangerous"" for children during the pandemic, but that the decision to close them would slow the rise of infections. He said the government and its advisers were also keen to make it possible for the children of NHS staff to go to school.

Their stance has always been that while it can suppress a peak - a 15% reduction has been put forward - some of the gain would be offset by the fact children will still mix outside of school. Parents, including health workers, may have to take time off work or grandparents may have to look after them, one of the vulnerable groups they are trying to protect. What is more, children are the age group least likely to get severe symptoms - only 0.2% of cases end up in hospital. In the end it has undoubtedly come down to two factors. Firstly, it might just do enough to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed - as suggested by the new modelling by Imperial College London published on Monday. Secondly, practicalities - increasing numbers of teachers and children are having to isolate at home and classes and exams would be seriously disrupted in the coming months regardless of what was done. What is the UK's plan and what could happen next? Parents contacting the BBC expressed their concern that predicted grades might be used for results at GCSE and A-level, if pupils did not sit exams. Lone parents and self-employed parents were also worried about coping. Sarah, from Bedfordshire, said: ""I'm worried for myself and my children. ""I'm already struggling with everyone panic-buying. My children would be in a safer, cleaner environment at school."" Victoria, in Belfast, said: ""I am a self-employed mother of twins. I have zero support. ""Now I have to stay home and look after the children. Where will the money come from?"" One student, Alice Simpson, told the BBC: ""We worked so hard and the past two years has always had that long end goal - GCSEs. And it's just got to the point where that's in sight. And now it's not any more."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson confirms the government will bring forward legislation âto protect private renters from evictionâ. The National Association of Head Teachers General Secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""The government has changed what it expects schools to do. They are to offer reduced access in order to prioritise the needs of the most vulnerable young people and the children of key workers."" He added there were many complicated issues to address as a result of the announcement and the focus would be assisting heads with ""this enormous task"" and making it work on the ground. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said many schools had already drawn up plans to support key workers and vulnerable children. ""However, this is an exceptionally demanding situation and they will need support. We will be working closely with our members and the Department for Education to this end."" By Hannah Richardson, education correspondent It was the announcement the government did not want to make - shutting down schools indefinitely. But as the virus spread its claws further into communities it became inevitable. Heads and teachers are just as at risk as anyone else, and as more and more staff called in sick - increasing numbers of schools started to fall like dominoes under the weight of this pandemic. Although the decision gives certainty for now - doors will be closed - there is even more uncertainty ahead. How long will they remain closed? How will pupils cope with learning from home? Who will look after them? And how will schools manage in their new role as the nation's babysitters for the children of key workers? Prime Minister's Questionstook place in a half-empty House of Commons earlier,after Labour and the Conservatives told MPs not scheduled to raise a query to stay away. Meanwhile, the weekly face-to-face audience between the Queen and the prime minister was carried out over the phone.

Schools shut-down prompts exam clarity calls,"This video can not be played The prime minister spoke about why the decision to close schools was taken The UK government is promising more detail on how school, nursery and childminder closures will affect students and parents. In a message to the nation, the Queen has urged people to come together for the common good. Another 29 people with coronavirus have died, bringing UK deaths to 137. A list of the""key workers"" during the coronavirus crisis,external, whose children can still go to school or nursery, has been published. The Queen, who is now in Windsor Castle with the Duke of Edinburgh, said the world was ""entering a period of great uncertainty"" and every individual had ""a vitally important part to play"". ""Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe - I am certain we are up to that challenge,"" she added. ""You can be assured that my family and I stand ready to play our part."" Meanwhile, the Bank of England has cut interest rates from 0.25% to 0.1%- the lowest level in their history. On Friday, more details are expected on how pupils would be awarded grades after some exams were cancelled. It comes after the Scottish education secretary said exams would not take place in Scotland this summer. John Swinneysaid the ""unprecedented"" move was a measure of the ""gravity"" of the situation caused by the pandemic. It is the first time the exams have been cancelled since the system was put in place in 1888. This video can not be played Public reacts to announcement that schools will close in response to the coronavirus pandemic The UK government has already said GCSEs and A-levels in England will be cancelled, and the Welsh government has cancelled them in Wales. Exams in Scotland and Northern Ireland have also been cancelled by their governments. Meanwhile, Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a travel ban in London. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""There are no plans to close down the transport network in London and there is zero prospect of any restrictions being placed on travelling in and out of London."" Elsewhere, the government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said the track of the UK epidemic had followed the path ""we thought likely"". It comes as Northern Irelandannounced its first virus-related death,and three more deaths wereconfirmed in Scotland. In other developments across the globe: Italy's death toll from coronavirus has risen to 3,405, overtaking numbers in China, Reuters News reports.

GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? On Wednesday it was announced that schools in the UK would close their doors on Friday - except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast the Cabinet Office would release the full list of key workers later and parents not on the list would be ""immediately aware"" their child wouldn't be offered a place in school. The list would include NHS workers, school staff and delivery drivers, he said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was not expecting schools to open again before September. He said: ""The peak of the virus is expected to be at exams time after which most schools start to wind down, so it was very unlikely that they would reopen in the summer term."" Schools supporting key workers' children will be expected to remain open during the Easter holidays, while officials are considering who is classed under this category. Mr Williamson said the government was aiming to provide an ""education setting"" for 10% of the children who usually attend schools. Will I be paid when I'm at home with kids? School closures: What will happen now? What is the UK's plan and what could happen next? On the cancellation of exams, Mr Williamson said the aim was to issue children in England with grades in August under a ""different process and a different system"". However, he said he could not ""with total guarantee"" say they would be released that month as ""we don't how the spread of the virus will affect the examining boards and those who issue the grades"". It is possible schools in Wales will not reopen until September, Wales education minister Kirsty Williams has said. Universities UK said pupils should not lose the chance to go to university this year because of exam cancellations. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said if an appropriate way to assess students could be found - such as a combination of teacher assessments and previous assignments - then awards could be granted this summer. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This would allow students to get their grades and the university admission process to go ahead this summer."" The decision to close schools was welcomed by teachers' unions but many called for more detail from the government. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said there were ""many complicated issues to address"" and ""we have more questions than answers at the moment"". Parents contacting the BBC expressed concern that predicted grades might be used for results at GCSE and A-level, if pupils did not sit exams. In other developments in the UK: Couples who do not postpone their church wedding because of coronavirus will be allowed only two guests, the Church of England has said. It has recommended the people attending the ceremony should be kept the legal minimum of five people: the priest, the bride and groom and two witnesses.

Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako were due to stay with the Queen at Windsor Castle Transport for London announced thatup to 40 Underground stations would be shut on Thursdayand a reduced service would run from Friday. Mayor Sadiq Khan said Londoners should avoid using the transport network ""unless absolutely necessary"" Other public transport operators, including Northern Trains, TransPennine Express, South Western Railway and National Express,have started cutting services The BBC has announced that Sunday services will be broadcast across its 39 local radio stations in England every week for Christian worshippers who cannot get to church. The first service on Sunday at 08:00 GMT will be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury Restaurants continue to announce closures, with Zizzi, Ask Italian and Prezzo among the latest to shut their sites Driving tests in Northern Ireland will be suspended for three months until 22 June, although this date will be kept under review There was a drop in passenger numbers on the London Underground after people were urged to work from home and avoid pubs and restaurants The government says it plans to more than double the number of tests being carried out in England to 25,000 a day. Prof Whitty, speaking at a science briefing, said the UK death rate would look ""quite high"" until testing was increased. He said the measures being introduced across the UK were to reduce the demand on the NHS and build up capacity to cope with the outbreak. He added that there were ""significant health and social downsides"" to the social distancing measures, such as loneliness and not getting exercise. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said it was important young people also followed the advice on social distancing. ""The mixing in pubs and restaurants needs to stop and it needs to stop among young people as well as older,"" he said. Parents - keep it simple, tell kids what they can control How families can cope with self-isolating together Meanwhile, the Army said it was ""pausing"" basic training, which would involve hundreds of recruits at Harrogate, Pirbright, Catterick and Winchester being sent home. However, a spokesman said it would not affect the Army's ability to support public services as part of the ""Covid support force"" - which only involves troops who have already gone through basic training. As part of the support the Army will provide during the pandemic, the number of troops at a heightened state of readiness will be doubled to 20,000 and Reserves will be placed on standby. Emergency laws to provide new powers to deal with the outbreak have been introduced in Parliament. The wide-ranging billincludes provisions for border controls, ways of boosting the NHS workforce and making it easier to register a death. The government says the measures contained within the Coronavirus Bill, which will be considered by MPs on Monday, are proportionate, will only be used when necessary and have a time limit of two years. But Labour is calling for a fresh vote on the legislation every six months - describing the plans as ""far-reaching"". Elsewhere, Environment Secretary George Eustice has ruled out enforcing social distancing measures in supermarkets. He told the House of Commons: ""It was something that was done in Italy, with a restriction on the number of people in stores and what they found was they just had hundreds of people huddled together at the entrance to the store and it's counterproductive.""

You can also sign up for a daily briefing on the pandemic here.It'll be emailed to you each morning. Canadaâs Foreign Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne has been tested for Covid-19 after experiencing âflu-like symptomsâ after returning from abroad. He will self-isolate as he awaits results âvery shortlyâ. âI will continue to work around the clock to support Canadians,â Champagne said, urging citizens to practice self distancing and âtake all necessary precautions to protect each otherâ. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus, though Trudeau himself has shown no symptoms. Froeign Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne is awaiting coronavirus test results The Czech government has pledged $40 billion (Â£35 billion) to businesses so they can pay their workers' wages. Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the money would be made up of $4bn in aid, and the rest would be loan guarantees, so firms can weather the huge losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday the Czech Republic reported 134 new cases of the illness in 24 hours, bringing its total up to 694. All countries are under pressure to try to mitigate the impact of the crisis on their economies and citizens. The UK government is set to announce further measures on Friday. From one city to another and soldiers in medical masks have now sealed off Amman from the rest of Jordan as a lockdown comes into force. Army checkpoints have been established on main entrances to the capital, as a travel ban came into force that only allows entry to essential goods or people with authorised business. Army spokesman Brigadier General Mukhles al Mufleh told state media the measures were ""to prevent the spread of the virus"". Today the number of confirmed cases in Jordan rose by 13 people to 69. More from the US... Bill
de Blasio says his city is just two to three weeks away from
running out of critical medical supplies. Three million N-95
masks, 50 million surgical masks, 15,000 ventilators, 25 million surgical gowns
and 25 million gloves are needed ""by early in April"", New York's mayor said, ""for us to ensure that our healthcare system, public and
private, can bear the brunt of the coronavirus crisis."" The cry for help comes
as New York City reports a total of 3,615 confirmed Covid-19 cases, and 22
deaths. ""This is going to
be one of the most difficult moments in New York City history,"" de Blasio
said. De Blasio
yesterday called upon the US military to intervene in the coronavirus
outbreak in his city ""I want their
medical teams, I want their logistical support... the only force in
America that can do that effectively and quickly,"" he said. Following that sad news on the death toll in Italy, Pope Francis has led a televised service from the Vatican this evening to pray for an end to the pandemic. Italy's bishops asked Catholics to say the rosary in their homes at 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT) and to put a lighted candle in their windows, as a sign of national unity. The request spread on social media after it was announced earlier this week, and many Catholics across the world joined in. In a broadcast message before the prayers, Pope Francis said: ""In this unprecedented situation, when everything seems to be vacillating, let us help each other remain steady in what really matters.""

The latest episode of the BBC's daily podcast covering the pandemic has just been released. It includes the latest from Italy, where today the death toll surpassed that in China. As the
virus continues its spread through all 50 states, plus Washington, DC, the
number of confirmed cases in the US has climbed to11,274. Across the country,157 people have died, with
concentrated clusters on the countryâs West Coast - namely Washington state and
California - and New York. The US
State Department hasissued
a Level 4 warning- the highest possible - advising US citizens to avoid all international travel
and, for those abroad, to âarrange for immediate return to the United States,
unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite periodâ. Amid
rising panic - and sustained criticism of the administration for its response
to the outbreak - President Donald Trump said on Thursdayhe would rush the
development of vaccines and treatmentsâas fast as it can possibly be doneâ for Covid-19. He announced earlier this
week that human testing on a vaccine trial had begun. US
lawmakers are moving to pass a $1 trillion - or larger - emergency aid package
sought by the White House in order to send$1,200
cheques to American taxpayers,
and $2,400 to families. As businesses are forced to shutter, first-time claims
for unemployment insurance have surged, crashing government
unemployment websites. We've just been told that Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have spoken by phone about the crisis. The former has welcomed the UK's decision to close schools. The Irish government said the move had brought a ""greater closeness"" between the positions in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The two men agreed on the need to ""keep in contact and align their actions"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic, ""in so far as possible"". BBC Question Time has come to an end, but it will continue in its new prime time slot next week. For more debate on the issues from tonight's show, listen into BBC Radio 5 Live now for Question Time Extra Time with Adrian Chiles. BBC Question Time The last question tonight is about how qualifications will be awarded to schoolchildren given exams have been cancelled. Union chief Frances O'Grady says a solution must be fair to pupils, noting teachers are ""desperate"" for clear guidance. She also calls on the government to make clear who will be defined as a ""key worker"" and able to carry on sending their children to school. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says guidance on qualifications will be made available ""as fast as we possibly can"". He says we'll have to wait for tomorrow for news on key workers - but NHS and social care workers, as well as those who make medical devices, will be on the list. BBC Question Time Frances O'Grady says it has been like ""survival of the fittest"" in supermarkets The topic of panic buying raises its ugly head on BBC's Question Time next. Union chief Frances O'Grady says: ""When I looked at some of those supermarket shelves, people sweeping up toilet roll and soap, it is almost like survival of the fittest. ""When we are scared, we often think of our families first, but as a community, we have to think about our neighbours, workmates, the elderly, and screw our heads on."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock praises supermarkets like Iceland who have introduced ""silver hours"" to ensure the elderly can come to shop and get supplies. But he says measures to stop mass buying ""have to be governed by supermarkets"" - not by orders through government. Instead he appeals to ""every single person who is fit and healthy"" to ""check the door on left, check the door on the right, the door over the road, and in a respectful, community way we will find help for lots of people"". He concludes: ""Everybody can play a part."" Read more on the steps shops are taking to combat stockpiling.And ourbusiness editor Simon Jack explainswhy supermarkets are drastically cutting their ranges amid the coronavirus crisis. What's happening in your part of the country?We've been tracking all the updatesto give you the clearest picture possible. Remember, though, that while a total of 3,269 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, the actual number is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. After UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock discussed efforts being made to get more essential kit to the NHS front line, we've learned that as many as 65,000 retired doctors and nurses could go back to work to help tackle the spread of coronavirus. The NHS has asked former employees who have left in the past three years to re-register with the regulatory bodies and ""boost the ranks"" of its staff. Those who return to work will be able to opt in to a register to fill a range of roles - clinical and non-clinical - based on their skills and how much time they have spent away from work. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: ""As the health service gears up to deal with the greatest global health threat in its history, my message to former colleagues is 'Your NHS Needs You'."" BBC Question Time Labour's Andy Burnham asks about help for low income workers As we said, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is being questioned about the help for businesses. He's pushed hard by Labour Mayor Andy Burnham ahead of an announcement by the chancellor tomorrow on more support. Mr Burnham says he has a lot of sympathy for the government, but they have ""taken a lot of measures that sounded good but they have not given all the answers"". The former minister accuses the government of ""doing the least for people who need help the most"" - such as those in insecure employment, the self-employed, and those already on benefits out of work. ""Those people can't follow government advice to self isolate, they have to go into work, they should have been first group to be helped,"" adds Mr Burnham. Mr Hancock says the government changed rules in the Budget just a week ago to help those people, and agrees the government must help businesses to keep people in work ""because it is the best way to be ready to bounce back"". He refuses to reveal what the Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce tomorrow when it comes to the amount people are given on statutory sick pay - around Â£94 per week - but concludes: ""Mark my words, we will do everything we can to make sure people are supported through this."" Question Time has moved on to questions around pay for workers struggling amid the crisis - including the self-employed, those on zero-hours contracts or those forced to stay off to look after family. What are your rights to pay if you're at home with your children now schools have closed?Find out the answer to that and other questions about work. Allow Twitter content?

BBC Question Time Back to Question Time and a viewer asks when frontline NHS staff will be tested after lots of complaints to the media by health workers. Dr Tom Solomon says it is critical to test NHS workers, but said Public Health England created a test ""as soon as they possibly could"". However, union chief Frances O'Grady says she is concerned by reports from staff not being able to get tested. ""Health staff and staff in social care are putting their health on the line for us, least they deserve is to get tests,"" she adds. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Labour's Andy Burnham, says services in his area also don't feel testing is happening fast enough and wonders if ""the eye was taken off the ball"" by the government. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock says tests are increasing everyday. He says he has today spent some of his department's cash today on new tests that work more like pregnancy tests - mentioned by the PM earlier - which makes it quicker to get results. He adds: ""Testing is the way to get a grip on this curve and hopefully, in time, reduce some of the incredibly draconian measures."" He also says that by next week, every social care provider will have protective equipment. A quick round-up of some of the top coronavirus news stories for you as Question Time carries on:  And some other interesting or helpful pieces you might like: For the first time in the history of Question Time there is no studio audience because of the social distancing measures currently in place - but the people of Weston-super-Mare have recorded questions to be played in via video link.

We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. So for now, here are the latest headlines: We leave you withthis piece that explains two conceptsthat many millions will need to familiarise themselves with: social distancing and self-isolation. And, as always,you can find all of our latest coronavirus stories here. As it stands, the World Health Organisation has confirmed more than 205,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, with the pandemic now affecting over 170 countries. There are many sources for tracking cases, some more reliable than others. Here is a round-up of confirmed cases in 10 the world's hardest-hit countries. We have sourced the figures either from the ongoing tally of cases by Johns Hopkins University or directly from health authorities.  Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland, has announced a state of emergency and a mandatory quarantine on arrivals to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes other Australians and locals heading home from the mainland. The only exceptions are for health and trade workers. The nation's smallest state currently has 10 cases, while there are around 270 in New South Wales and 150 in Victoria - states which have 15 times larger populations. State premier Peter Gutwein says these are the ""toughest border measures in the country"". UK medical staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One NHS doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" due to inadequate supplies of vital equipment such as face masks. Dr Frances Mair told Newsnight her GP practice in Scotland and ""many others"" did not have the personal protective equipment needed ""to keep us safe"". ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die.""

The dire news from Italy is that despite a lockdown that has been in place for 10 days across the country, the death toll from this virus has continued to rise and rise. It increased by 475 on Wednesday, the biggest in one day since the outbreak began, with 319 of these deaths occuring in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been the worst-affected. Italian doctors had hoped to see infections slowing after a week of lockdown but that hasn't happened. Some say that only after two weeks - believed to be the maximum time period it takes for symptoms to show - will they truly be able to see if the virus's spread has been slowed by the drastic measures taken. The governor of Lombardy has appealed to the public to continue to stay at home and not flout the government's orders.

What can you do to prevent it? The BBC's Laura Foster explains everything you need to know â in just one minute. There's one major question about this pandemic that millions of people will be hoping has a positive answer: will we see a vaccine anytime soon? Well, earlier today, we heard some promising words from the world's leading public health body. The World Health Organization (WHO) hailed an ""incredible achievement"" in the effort to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus. ""The first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was shared,"" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. That trial began in the USat the Kaiser Permanente research facility in Seattle earlier this week. Four patients received the jab, which cannot cause Covid-19 but contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus. Now for the bad news. Experts warn that it will be many months before it is clear whether this vaccine, or any of the others that are also in research, will work. And even if these initial safety tests go well, it will still take time for any potential vaccine to become available to the public. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. But don't be too disheartened. Scientists around the world are fast-tracking research in an effort to mass produce a safe vaccine as soon as possible. Stephen McGrath, Romania Jim Turnbull decided to donate the sanitiser to his community Jim Turnbull owns a food production facility in the Romanian region of Transylvania and was due to return to the UK on Tuesday but decided to stay on. He has begun using the alcohol by-product from his elderflower gin distillation to make a hand sanitiser followingguidance by the World Health Organization,external. âGiven the crisis we thought to donate it to our local community - where we get our workforce from,â says Mr Turnbull, 68, who lives in the village of Saschiz, which has a population of some 2,000. Romania has so far had 260 confirmed cases of coronavirus but no deaths. However, its rural population, which makes up around 46% of the countryâs 19 million people, is ageing and could be vulnerable. Bars and restaurants have been shut but Bogdan Tanase, head of Romaniaâs Doctors' Alliance, told the BBC Romania was âill-prepared to deal with an epidemicâ. On Wednesday alone, police in France have handed out more than 4,000 fines to people violating government orders to stay at home.

Since yesterday, people in France have been banned from going outside except for exercise and essential trips. During a White House briefing today, President Trump was questioned on his repeated use of the term ""Chinese virus"" to describe Covid-19 - a term critics say has contributed to racism against Asian-Americans - as well as why top US athletes have had access to tests when most Americans haven't. ""Perhaps thatâs been the story of life,"" Trump remarked.

Here some key developments from today:  Much of the world's attention has been focused on Europe, the continent that is currently the worst-affected by the coronavirus pandemic. But other developments have been reported around the world as the virus continues to spread: Prof Sian Griffiths is asked by BBC One viewers when and how will we know if these social distancing measures are working. She says: ""You can see changes in people's behaviour, but that's not very accurate. ""We will see it by a fall in the number of positive tests, the number going into hospital and sadly by the numbers who have passed away."" There has been a rise today of nearly 700 cases in the UK, and a total of 104 deaths, so BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh is asked, what next? ""The key message is we are all in this together,"" he says. ""We have to wash our hands, we have to comply... if we don't and if we don't see the number of cases reduce in three weeks time, what is advisory could become compulsory."" But Prof Griffiths reminds viewers: ""This too will pass."" Victoria in Belfast ""I am furious over the school closures. I am a self-employed mother of twins. I have zero support.
