Claire Foy and Matt Smith: A successful re-coupling?,"You can imagine the casting conversation down at the Old Vic theatre in London when they decided to reprise Duncan Macmillan's play Lungs: a two-hander featuring a right-on young couple thinking about settling down... Senior Creative [SC]: So, we're after a box office pairing the public would love (pay) to see reunited. Junior Creative [JC]: What about Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio? SC: Great idea! [pauses to think] A bit old, maybe? JC: Okay, how about Letitia Wright and Daniel Kaluuya? SC: Another awesome suggestion! But is she old enough? JC: Ooh, ooh, oohâ¦ I've got it! This is brilliant! SC: Pray tell. JC: Claire Foy and Matt Smith! SC: Perfect! You. Are. A. Genius! Book 'em! And so it came pass - probably not quite like that - the two British actors who formed a dream team double-act in The Crown for Netflix as The Queen and Prince Philip were reunited to play another young couple trying to work out their place in the world. This time around tiaras and Buckingham Palace have been traded-in for trainers and IKEA, but they are essentially dealing with the same issues of love, commitment, betrayal, duty, compromise and existential anxiety. There's none of the expensive paraphernalia that came with The Crown such as lavish sets and a large supporting cast. Claire Foy as the Queen and Matt Smith as Prince Philip received critical acclaim for their performances in The Crown In Lungs, Matt Smith and Claire Foy play an unnamed couple who wrestle with the big issues of climate change and having children in an overpopulated world In Lungs the stage is almost bare; the actors don't have a prop to call their own. It is entirely down to their talents to bring to life Duncan Macmillan's words in an 80-minute play in which they are constantly on the stage bantering to-and-fro without an interval to catch their breath. It's a tall order, made slightly easier by the sheer quality and directness of the writing and their palpable stage chemistry. Foy is superb as the doubting yet strident left-leaning intellectual with a PhD who is at once perceptive and blindly self-absorbed. Smith does what he did as Prince Philip in The Crown, which is to play Foy's foil. Here, he is a struggling musician intimidated by his partner's intelligence and rhetorical ferocity. The full force of which is evident in the opening exchange caused by his unwitting decision to wonder aloud if they should have a child together. Big mistake. She is staggered by his thoughtlessness, impudence, and lazy arrogance. ""It's like you punch me in the face and then asked me a maths question"" is one of the many ways she describes the effect of his casual conversation opener while they queued in IKEA. He tries to put the pin back in the grenade but it's too late. Before he knows it she is telling him that his predatory countenance when they are in the throes of passion freaks her out, ""Sometimes it looks like you are going to hack off my limbs and bury me in the woods."" He tries back-peddling, and then justifying, and eventually - when all else fails - agreeing. Matt Smith and Claire Foy during rehearsal It's like watching a boxing match in which one fighter is clearly stronger and more assertive while the other ducks and dives and seeks a way out by fair means or foul. Into this semi-comic world of domestic disharmony Macmillan introduces the underlying theme of his decade-old play (first professionally staged in 2011), which is the negative impact we gas-guzzling humans are having on the planet. Foy's character wants to know if she and he can still be ""good people"" if they decide to have a child, which she says will have a lifetime carbon footprint amounting to 10,000 tonnes of CO2, ""That's the weight of the Eiffel Tower. I'd be giving birth to the Eiffel Tower."" It's a great line from which you can extrapolate the bigger question being asked: can we in the wealthy West ever be ""good"" when our privilege is at the expense of others and the planet? It is a subject that deeply troubles the playwright who wrote this ""end of days"" play in a single night having put aside a more complex concept. Playwright Duncan Macmillan says since he wrote Lungs, the threat of climate change has grown, but as a parent, he ""doesn't feel as if despair is an option"" It is a good piece of work. But unlike his excellent subsequent plays like Every Brilliant Thing and People, Places, Things - which deal with depression and addiction respectively - Lungs runs out of breath about two-thirds of the way through. The witty repartee between Foy and Smith pales, the unevenness of their relationship loses credibility. That said, it is a bold and invigorating idea to focus their entire relationship on the single issue of procreation in the form of a discussion taking place over years but presented as one seamless conversation (a time-shifting exercise beautifully executed by director Matthew Warchus). The upside for Macmillan is it allows him to highlight what he considers to be the ""thing that makes drama interesting"", which is, ""present-tense decision-making."" The downside is it ends up leaving the characters boxed in and the story with nowhere to go. Foy's character gets bigger but predictable, Smith's smaller and boring. The piece eventually peters out. But not before landing some heavy blows. Lungs turns the highly personal - deciding to have a child - into the powerfully political: it lays the issue of our age at our door. And it does so with biting wit, a sense of urgency and an appropriate level of high anxiety, all expertly delivered by the two actors. More Claire Foy and Matt Smith combos please.

"'My reception was so bad even O2 couldn't call me'Mobile giants unveil plan to end rural 'not-spots', aiming to get 4G coverage to 95% of the UK by 2025.","Sian Davies and her husband Jonathan at their local pub in Rossett, Wales A promise to end rural 'not-spots' can't come too soon for Sian Davies. She moved to Rossett, north-east Wales, with her husband this year - and the lack of mobile coverage has been ""a real bugbear"". ""The signal is almost non-existent,"" she said. ""If I want to send or receive texts, I have to go upstairs in my home,"" she said. She's not alone. Currently one third of the UK has patchy or non-existent mobile phone coverage. But on Friday, a Â£1bn plan between the UK's four main mobile phone companies and the government was unveiled with the aim of banishing these signal dead zones. The proposed deal - which includes EE, O2, Three and Vodafone - promises to get 4G coverage to 95% of the UK by 2025. The operators would invest in new and existing phone masts they would all share under the proposal, which the government hopes will be formalised early next year. It is estimated that an additional 280,000 homes and businesses and 16,000km of roads will have coverage. The four main mobile networks plan to contribute a total of Â£530m for the Shared Rural Network, with the government potentially supporting it with another Â£500m once the deal is finalised. The government had threatened to force the mobile firms to allow customers to roam onto each other's networks in not-spots, a move the companies said would deter new investment. Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said ""it is not yet a done deal and I want to see industry move quickly so we can reach a final agreement early next year."" For people like Mrs Davies, lack of coverage is a huge inconvenience. She's lost online purchases, as it takes so long for confirmation texts to come through. She ended up upgrading her phone so she could receive calls over wi-fi at home: ""Rossett is only six miles from both Chester and Wrexham, yet we are lucky to even get 3G never mind 4G,"" she said. ""One day O2 (her provider) called trying to get me to upgrade, but the caller said reception was bad and they would call later."" She contacted the company when it announced it was rolling out 5G: ""I am flabbergasted that they can do this when many people cannot even get 3G!"" This deal follows years of wrangling between the government and the mobile operators with each side aware that the stakes were high. It was under David Cameron's government that poor rural mobile coverage became a live issue - the Prime Minister was reportedly maddened by the lack of a mobile signal on his Cornish holidays, and residents and businesses in the countryside were understandably angry that poor connectivity was excluding them from the digital revolution. The government repeatedly threatened to bring in so-called national roaming, forcing operators to allow customers to connect to rival networks in places where they could not provide a signal. They hated this proposal, insisting it would bring investment to a halt - why would you build a new mast only to see it used by customers of a rival who'd failed to invest? But the threat has forced them to come up with a plan to invest Â£500m in a shared network which will see one mast hosting antennas from several operators. In return they've won two concessions- the government will hand over cash to reach the really remote areas and Ofcom will drop coverage requirements from the rules for the next 5G spectrum auction. Now though the final details of the deal have to be agreed - and rural residents may still have to wait some years before they can be confident of connecting wherever they are. Vodafone's chief technology officer, Scott Petty, told the BBC the plan has been 12 months in the making. ""As an industry we really believe this is the most effective way to get the UK from the bottom end of the coverage tables in Europe to the top end,"" he said. Mark Bridgeman of the Country Land and Business Association said the news was is a big step forwards. ""We have been hugely frustrated at the lack of progress in improving mobile reception to date,"" he said. ""This announcement will be welcomed by everyone who lives or works in the countryside."" Felicity Burch, director of digital and innovation at business lobby group the CBI, said the proposal would ""unleash investment and boost productivity"". ""This is another crucial step in making the UK match-fit for the digital revolution."" 5G: Rural areas could see bigger and taller masts Firms 'hobbled' by poor mobile coverage Sian Davies says she's ""all for it, as long as the four companies can negotiate together and deliver what is promised."" She is worried though that her area will miss out: ""I fear they may concentrate on more remote areas, and places such as Rossett which are relatively close to large urban areas, will be forgotten.""

Leicester smash nine past Southampton,"Jamie Vardy's hat-trick sees him become the Premier League's top scorer, moving above Sergio Aguero and Tammy Abraham Leicester City equalled the 24-year-old record for the biggest ever Premier League victory as 10-man Southampton were dismantled at a rainswept St Mary's. The victory sees Brendan Rodgers' side climb into second place, leapfrogging Manchester City and moving five points behind leaders Liverpool. The result, which matches Manchester United's 9-0 win against Ipswich in 1995, was only confirmed in stoppage time thanks to Jamie Vardy's penalty. Both Vardy and Ayoze Perez scored hat-tricks, with the visitors aided by Ryan Bertrand's red card for a reckless challenge on Perez in the build-up to Ben Chilwell's opener. That opened the floodgates for Leicester, who turned on the style just two days before the first anniversary of the helicopter crash that killed the club's former chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four other people. Youri Tielemans also scored his third goal of the campaign and James Maddison added a superb free-kick on a miserable evening for Southampton, who drop into the bottom three. On a landmark night, Leicester also: recorded the biggest ever victory by an away side in an English top-flight league match in the 131-year history of the Football League inflicted Southampton's biggest ever defeat as an English league side in all competitions in their history became only the second team in Premier League history to establish a five-goal lead in the first half of an away game in the competition, after Manchester City against Burnley in April 2010 (also 5-0) became only the second side in Premier League history to have two players score a hat-trick in the same game (Perez and Vardy), after Arsenal in May 2003 - also against Southampton (Pennant and Pires) Leicester 'here to stay at top' - Chilwell Saints boss Hasenhuttl takes '100% responsibility' for defeat Leicester may have played a game more than Liverpool but this emphatic result means that they have now scored more goals than the league leaders and are just four behind Manchester City. And the omens look good for Rodgers' side who have now collected one point more from the opening 10 games of the current season than at the same stage of their title-winning campaign in 2015-16. With trips to Crystal Palace and Brighton on the horizon either side of hosting Arsenal, Leicester have every chance to kick on from their strong start, but given the strength and form of Liverpool and Manchester City, a title challenge appears unlikely. This video can not be played Rodgers delighted with 'ruthlessly simple' Leicester But the manner in which the Foxes ruthlessly cut through the hosts will nevertheless serve as a warning to others, with their three goals inside the opening 19 minutes the fastest they have amassed that scoreline in a Premier League match since 1998. Also working in Leicester's favour is the attacking menace still being provided by Vardy. While the forward is approaching his 33rd birthday, there are few signs, if any, that his physical capabilities are waning and he looked as sprightly as ever as he recorded his first hat-trick for almost three years. His first showed nimbleness and awareness as he cut inside Saints defender Maya Yoshida to drill a close-range effort into the bottom corner, while his second showcased smart movement as he headed past Angus Gunn from close range. His trademark blistering pace then took him clear of the Southampton defence to win and convert a late penalty. His exploits were also complemented by Perez, who opened his account for the season after finding the bottom-right corner following a neat one-two with Tielemans. The Spaniard then superbly swept home Chilwell's pinpoint cross for his second before finding the bottom corner with a left-footed shot to complete his treble. Football Daily podcast: It's raining goals... for Leicester Reaction to Leicester's record-equalling victory at Southampton At the start of the evening Southampton's focus was purely on ending a barren run of seven games without a home win dating back to April. But by half-time manager Ralph Hasenhuttl had changed tack considerably, by simply trying to avoid any further embarrassment. The Austrian, who at times appeared exasperated and spent much of the interval sitting in his technical area, introduced Kevin Danso and Jack Stephens to replace Jannik Vestergaard and Danny Ings, but it was too little to late. This video can not be played Southampton 0-9 Leicester: Hasenhuttl apologises for Saints 'disaster' With the crowd visibly thinning in the second period, Hasenhuttl must now hope the scale of this defeat has not eroded the confidence of his players too much. While the Saints are a couple of points better off than at the same time last term, they appear in danger of being dragged into another relegation fight. And their road to redemption is unlikely to be an easy one with their next two fixtures away at Manchester City in both the Carabao Cup and Premier League. Perez became the first player since Luis Suarez v Norwich City (2012) to score a hat-trick in back-to-back Premier League appearances against the same opposition, having done so for his former club Newcastle as they beat the Saints 3-1 at St James' Park in April Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""I'm very pleased to see our work rate, we scored some great goals and we were very hungry tonight. It was horrible weather but our focus was outstanding. I'm very pleased how we defended, and we were ruthless. I'm very proud to stand and be the manager of that team. ""We wanted to get the ball back quickly and attack again. A mark of the good sides is you don't let up. We wanted to show we're a good side and we certainly did that in the second half. ""We were ruthlessly simple in our game. When you're so many goals up you can easily slow but we kept focused. We want to be a top team and to be a top team you must be clinical. ""It was a very good team performance and we're pleased to keep a clean sheet. It's good for our goals for but the clean sheet is equally important."" Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""That was one of the tough ones tonight. The performance was a disaster today and I have to apologies and take 100% responsibility - I've never seen a team act like this, there was no fight for anything. ""It was horrible to watch and everyone who stayed to watch is really a fan of this football club. Leicester were in every part of the game better than us I'm a proud man but the way we play today is not the way I want to see my team play. We must get our heads up and that is my job in the next few days. ""I said we must play to the last minute but I can understand why the fans that left. We all must to do everything to pull this back. I haven't looked at the [Ryan Bertrand] red card but it doesn't make any difference in this moment."" On what was said after the game:""There is nothing I want to speak of here in front of the camera - we keep that for in the dressing room."" Southampton travel to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before returning to the Etihad in the Premier League on Saturday, 2 November (15:00 GMT).

Series of failures behind Boeing Lion Air crash,"A series of failures led to the crash of a Lion Air flight, which killed 189 people and led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, a report has found. Investigators said faults by Boeing, Lion Air and pilots caused the crash. Five months after the disaster in October last year, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 people on board, which led to the grounding of the entire 737 Max fleet. Faults with the plane's design have been linked to both crashes. On Friday, air crash investigators in Indonesia released their final report, detailing the list of events that caused the Lion Air jet to plunge into the Java Sea. ""From what we know, there are nine things that contributed to this accident,"" Indonesian air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo told reporters at a news conference. ""If one of the nine hadn't occurred, maybe the accident wouldn't have occurred."" The 353-page report found the jet should have been grounded before departing on the fatal flight because of an earlier cockpit issue. However, because the issue was not recorded properly the plane was allowed to take off without the fault being fixed, it said. Further, a crucial sensor - which had been bought from a repair shop in Florida - had not been properly tested, the report found. On Friday, the US aviation regulator revoked the company's certification. The sensor fed information to the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - or MCAS. That software, which is designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling, has been a focus for investigators trying to find the cause of both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. Indonesian investigators identified issues with the system, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control. It showed there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the ""deficiencies"" had been highlighted during training. Further, the report found that the first officer, who had performed poorly in training, struggled to run through a list of procedures that he should have had memorised. He was flying the plane just before it entered into the fatal dive, but the report said the captain had not briefed him properly when he handed over the controls as they struggled to keep the plane in the air. The report also found that 31 pages were missing from the plane's maintenance log. Indonesian investigators have previously said mechanical and design problems were key factors in the crash of the Lion Air plane. Boeing expects 737 Max to fly again by New Year What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit Boeing staff texted about 737 Max issue in 2016 Battle over blame This report describes a catalogue of failures - from poor communication to bad design to inadequate flying skills - which culminated in the deaths of 189 people. There are lots of what-ifs here. If the crew of the previous days flight had given a more detailed description of the problems they'd faced, the aircraft might never have taken off on its fatal flight. And if the captain, who'd successfully kept the plane in the air - despite the intervention of a rogue automated system he didn't understand - hadn't handed over to his less-capable first officer, disaster might still have been avoided. As Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has repeatedly stated, there was a chain of events. But at the heart of that chain was MCAS - a control system that the pilots didn't know about, and which was vulnerable to a single sensor failure. Boeing  - and regulators - allowed the system to be designed in this way and didn't change it after the Lion Air crash, leading to a further disaster. And that means that while the report clearly points to serious failures by a parts supplier and by the airline itself, it is Boeing that will bear the greatest share of responsibility. Indonesian authorities laid out some recommendations for Boeing in the report, including that it redesign MCAS and provide adequate information about it in pilot manuals and training. In a statement, Boeing said it was ""addressing"" the recommendations from Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee. The planemaker said it was ""taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again"". On Tuesday, the firm ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, making him the most senior official to leave the company since the two crashes. Boeing also said it expected the 737 Max to be re-certified for flying by the end of the year. The company said ""we look forward to continuing to work together"" with Lion Air in the future. A Lion Air spokesman said the crash was an ""unthinkable tragedy"" and it was essential to take immediate corrective actions to ensure a similar accident never occurred again. This video can not be played 'I lost my only son in the Lion Air plane crash' The pressure on Boeing to explain what it knew about the problems with the 737 Max has intensified. There wererevelations this month that employees had exchanged messagesabout issues with MCAS while the plane was being certified in 2016. In documents provided by Boeing to lawmakers, a pilot wrote that he had run into unexpected trouble during tests. He said he had ""basically lied to the regulators [unknowingly]"". Boeing said this week it had developed a training update and that it expected regulators to allow the planes to return to the skies before the beginning of 2020. The grounding of the 737 Max hastaken a tollon the planemaker. Profits more than halved to $895m (Â£687m) in the third quarter and the firm said it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliner, blaming trade uncertainties. Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg was also stripped of his title as chairman by the board earlier this month, but remains as chief executive.

US wildfire sparked minutes after power glitch,"This video can not be played Jets drop fire retardant on California blaze A fast-moving wildfire in northern California was sparked seven minutes after a nearby power line was damaged, according to a local power company. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) said damage had been reported at a high voltage tower near where the Kincade Fire started on Wednesday. About 50,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in the state by wildfires driven by powerful winds. A state of emergency has been declared in Los Angeles and Sonoma counties. The deadliest wildfire in the state's history - which killed 85 people in northern California in 2018 - was caused by PG&E power lines. Commenting on the latest fire, Governor Gavin Newsom said in a news conference on Friday that the company ""simply did not do their job"". He condemned ""years and years of greed, years and years of mismanagement in the utilities"". The company said it had not yet determined if the power glitch had sparked the Kincade Fire. ""We still, at this point, do not know what exactly happened,"" PG&E chief executive Bill Johnson told the Washington Post. The utility said it had turned off power nearby over concerns that high winds could spark blazes, but the lines were still working when the fire ignited. About 2,000 residents have been evacuated. At least 21 homes have been destroyed in the blaze, California fire officials said on Friday. The wildfires are expected to worsen in southern California over the weekend as gusty winds continue. California is still recovering fromwildfires last yearthat killed about 100 people. The Kincade Fire, which started on Wednesday, has burned through 21,900 acres (8,800 hectares) of land in Sonoma County - one of California's best-known wine regions. More than 1,300 firefighters are tackling the blaze, which remains uncontained. There are a number of other major fires: The Tick Fire in Los Angeles County has burned at least 5,000 acres in the Santa Clarita region The Old Water Fire in San Bernardino County has burned 95 acres, shutting off a major highway The Cabrillo Fire in San Mateo County, south of the town of Pescadero, has burnt about 95 acres The Sawday Fire in San Diego County, which began on Friday, has burned 70 acres, some 40 miles northeast of San Diego The ongoing Saddle Ridge Fire in Los Angeles County has burned 8,700 acres over the last 14 days According to areport filed to the California Public Utilities Commission,externalon Thursday, a ""broken jumper"" - which connects power lines to towers - was discovered at 21:20 local time on Wednesday. The fire began at 21:27, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The news sent share prices of PG&E tumbling on Friday, as investors feared the company might be held responsible for the Kincade Fire. The company is already seeking bankruptcy protection as it faces lawsuits over last year's deadly Camp Fire. It was found to have been sparked by aging equipment owned by PG&E. It spawned billions of dollars in liability claims against the company. Homes have been destroyed in the town of Geyserville, which has been evacuated High winds appear to have spread the fires - gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h) have swept much of the state. California is affected by Santa Ana winds, which are known for being dry and gusty, exacerbating wildfires. Why do Santa Ana winds make wildfires worse? California fires 'can now happen any year' Volunteers fighting fires in California's 'forgotten canyon' On Thursday morning PG&E shut off power in 15 California counties to prevent accidental fires, affecting about 180,000 homes. Power was restored to most customers on Thursday night. But officials warn of more outages over the weekend in regions experiencing high winds and dry heat. Schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District remained closed on Friday because of air quality and safety concerns.

Meghan lets Harry 'crashâ gender equality talks,"This video can not be played Thank you for letting Harry crash the party, jokes Meghan Conversations about gender equality ""can't happen without men"", the Duchess of Sussex has said at a roundtable discussion on the issue. Meghan was joined by the Duke of Sussex, and jokingly thanked delegates for ""letting him crash the party"". Harry was described as a ""surprise appearance""by co-organisers, the Queen's Commonwealth Trust,external. Young ambassadors from around the world took part in the talks, which were held at Windsor Castle. The couple arrived together in an electric Audi - driven by the duke - after they were accused of hypocrisyfor using private jets while supporting environmental campaigns. Meghan 'hopes baby will be a feminist' Becoming a mother has been 'struggle' - Meghan The participants - who represented organisations from countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Iraq, Malawi and Bangladesh - shared their personal achievements and the best practices that had helped them overcome complex challenges. Beginning the discussion, Meghan, seated next to her husband, told the group: ""In terms of gender equality, which is something I have championed for a long time, I think that conversation can't happen without men being a part of it. ""So for this reason it made complete sense to let him [Harry] join today. So thank you for letting him crash the party."" Among those to share their experiences with the royal couple was the founder of the South African organisation Motholung Network Against Women and Child Abuse, Lebogang Bogopane. ""I got married very young and experienced domestic violence,"" she said. ""My mother is a survivor and I'm also a survivor. One day I said 'I'm tired, this needs to stop.'"" Young people from countries including South Africa, Iraq and Bangladesh took part in the roundtable One participant said they were surprised by how ""genuine"" the royal couple were The roundtable was led by Queen's Commonwealth Trust chief executive Nicola Brentnall and moderated by One Young World counsellors, social media influencer Rossana Bee and Canada's first openly gay Olympic gold medallist, Mark Tewksbury. Mr Tewksbury said the duke's appearance at the event was a ""wonderful surprise"". ""I guess we should have known because there were two empty chairs there, but I just assumed that an assistant was going to come along,"" he said. The founder of the first Iraqi LGBT+ organisation, Amir Ashour, who also took part in the roundtable, said the duke's attendance was an indication of how important the issue was to the royal couple. ""They were asking questions and getting engaged,"" the 29-year-old said, adding that he was ""surprised at how genuine they were"". Meghan and her husband arrived at the roundtable in an electric car Harry and Meghan are president and vice president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust respectively. And Meghan is a long-standing supporter of One Young World, which she called ""the best think tank imaginable"". The One Young World Summit is a four-day global forum for young leaders, which aims to bring together 2,000 young people from more than 190 countries to accelerate social impact. On Tuesday, Meghan attended the summit's opening ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. She haspreviously spoken about her belief that men can also be feminists- and, while pregnant, said she wanted her baby to be a feminist, whether they were a girl or a boy. The roundtable on Friday was the couple's first public engagement since an emotional ITV documentary,when they described the pressure they had faced from intense media scrutiny.

UK payday lending giant QuickQuid to close,"The UK's biggest remaining payday loan provider is to close, with thousands of complaints about its lending still unresolved. QuickQuid's owner, US-based Enova, says it will leave the UK market ""due to regulatory uncertainty"". Compensation claims have been made from customers who said they were given loans they could not afford to repay. It is the latest firm offering short-term, high-interest loans to close after regulations were tightened. QuickQuid has been the biggest payday lender in the UK for the past few years. It was bigger than household name Wonga even before the latter folded in August last year. The Money Shop closed earlier this year. Kenneth Barker took out 11 consecutive loans in less than a year when he was a barman in Essex in 2012. ""The initial one was for Â£100. I paid back Â£160, but then needed a Â£150 loan to tide me over for the next month. It gradually worsened,"" said the 28-year-old, who now lives in Leeds. ""To be honest, I knew what I was getting myself into, but sometimes you don't have any other choice."" He submitted a complaint nine months ago, claiming he was given unaffordable loans, and was offered Â£50 in compensation by the company. He said: ""I then went to the financial ombudsman. That was accepted and I was offered Â£2,000. I was told I'd get it within 28 days. I'm hoping I will still get that money! ""I have no idea how this is going to proceed or whether I will receive this money."" Despite waiting for his compensation, he said he was pleased that a business such as QuickQuid would be closing. QuickQuid is one of the brand names of CashEuroNet UK, which also runs On Stride - a provider of longer-term, larger loans and previously known as Pounds to Pocket. ""Over the past several months, we worked with our UK regulator to agree upon a sustainable solution to the elevated complaints to the UK Financial Ombudsman, which would enable us to continue providing access to credit,"" said Enova boss David Fisher. ""While we are disappointed that we could not ultimately find a path forward, the decision to exit the UK market is the right one for Enova and our shareholders."" New rules brought in five years ago limited the interest rates and fees payday lenders can charge and introduced enhanced affordability checks. Since then there has been a wave of complaints from customers who say they were mis-sold loans they could not afford. QuickQuid has been facing as many as 10,000 or more outstanding complaints from borrowers. Such legacy loan complaints, many of which came via claims management companies, were the key reason for the demise of Wonga last year. The closure of QuickQuid might lead some to think their loan is invalid - but it is not. ""While you may be tempted to stop your repayments, it is crucial to keep to your regular schedule, because if you have entered into a loan agreement you must fulfil it,"" said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service. ""If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating."" Those who are owed money in compensation must wait to see what the next move is for the business. The Money Advice Service website hasa guide on alternatives to payday loans,external. As well as historic complaints, QuickQuid was also the subject of compensation claims for more recent loans. The UK's Financial Ombudsman Service said that it had received 3,165 cases against CashEuroNet in the first half of the year. It was the second most-complained about company in the banking and credit sector during that six months. The ombudsman upheld 59% of cases against the company during the same period, but a backlog of cases is thought to have built up. Anyone with eligible complaints who is entitled to compensation will now see the level of any payouts depend on the process of closing the company. Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said: ""I feel incredibly sorry for those people with complaints that they may have had in with the ombudsman for years. ""The current system does not give adequate protection for these borrowers.""

Two more arrests over 39 lorry deaths,"The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Two people have been arrested on suspicion of the manslaughter of 39 people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex. The man and woman, both 38, from Warrington, Cheshire, were also held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic. The BBC has spoken to the families of three Vietnamese people who are worried their relatives may have been in the trailer. The family of one woman say she sent a text saying she could not breathe. They say Pham Tra My, 26, sent the message on Tuesday night and they have not been able to contact her since. They said they had paid Â£30,000 for her to be smuggled to Britain. Two other families have also been in touch with the BBC. They are relatives of a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman. The 19-year-old's brother said she called him early on Tuesday to say she was getting in to a container and was turning off her phone to avoid detection. There has been no word from her since, he said, but a people smuggler had returned money to the family. Relatives of the 26-year-old - with whom she was said to be travelling - also received money back, according to the younger woman's brother. Month-long journey: Ms Pham's brother said that Â£30,000 had been paid to people smugglers Essex Police initially said the victims - 31 men and eight women - were believed to be Chinese. They were found at an industrial estate in Grays at 01:40 BST on Wednesday. Detectives are still questioning the lorry driver on suspicion of murder. Police have been given extra time to question driver Mo Robinson, of County Armagh in Northern Ireland, who was arrested on Wednesday. This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found in the trailer container Post-mortem examinations are due to start later after the first 11 bodies were moved from Tilbury Port to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford.

How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' Essex lorry deaths: What we know The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium at 00:30 on Wednesday. It left the port shortly after 01:05 the same day and the bodies were found in the trailer at Waterglade Industrial Park about 30 minutes later. The lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from County Armagh Police said recovering the bodies would take time and the dignity of the victims was its primary concern. The Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said he had sent a team to Essex to help verify the identity of the victims. He added that their nationality was yet to be confirmed. Essex Police believes the lorry arrived in Holyhead in north Wales on Sunday, having travelled from Dublin. Global Trailer Rentals Ltd told RTE News,externalit owned the trailer and said it had been hired on 15 October. Tracking data from the trailer shows it had travelled between cities in Belgium and France, including Dunkirk, Bruges, and Lille, in the days before the discovery, sources said.

Vietnamese families fear relatives among 39 dead,"Pham Thi Tra My's brother said the family had arranged for Â£30,000 to be paid to smugglers At least six of the 39 people found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex may have been from Vietnam. The BBC knows of six Vietnamese families who fear their relatives are among the victims. They include Pham Thi Tra My, 26, who has not been heard from since she sent text messages on Tuesday saying she could not breathe. A man was earlier arrested at Stansted Airport on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people. The 48-year-old from Northern Ireland is the fourth person to be arrested in connection with the investigation. Two people from Warrington are being held on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people and the lorry driver is in custody on suspicion of murder. Ms Tra My's brother, Pham Ngoc Tuan, said some of the Â£30,000 charge for getting his sister to the UK had been paid to people smugglers and her last-known location had been Belgium. The smugglers are understood to have returned money to some families. Meanwhile, relatives of Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, have also said they fear he is among the 39 victims. Nguyen Dinh Luong has been named by relatives as a possible victim Ms Tra My's brother told the BBC: ""My sister went missing on 23 October on the way from Vietnam to the UK and we couldn't contact her. We are concerned she may be in that trailer. ""We are asking the British police to help investigate so that my sister can be returned to the family."" Essex lorry deaths: What we know The Vietnamese risking it all to get to the UK The last message received from Ms Tra My was at 22:30 BST on Tuesday - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Her family have shared texts she sent to her parents which translated read: ""I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed. ""I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother."" The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Ms Tra My's brother told the BBC her journey to the UK had begun on 3 October. She had told the family not to contact her because ""the organisers"" did not allow her to receive calls. ""She flew to China and stayed there for a couple days, then left for France,"" he said. ""She called us when she reached each destination. The first attempt she made to cross the border to the UK was 19 October, but she got caught and turned back. I don't know for sure from which port."" The BBC has passed details of Ms Tra My, who is from Nghen town in Can Loc district of Ha Tinh province area of Vietnam, to Essex Police, along with details of other people claiming to have information. The BBC also knows of two other Vietnamese nationals who are missing - a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman. The brother of the 19-year-old said his sister called him at 07:20 Belgian local time (06:20 BST) on Tuesday, saying she was getting into a container and was turning off her phone to avoid detection. He has not heard from her since. He said a people smuggler returned money to the family overnight, and the family of the 26-year-old who she was travelling with also received money back. A spokesman from the Vietnamese Embassy in London confirmed they had been in contact with Essex police since Thursday. They said Vietnamese families had appealed to them for help finding out if their relatives were among the victims but added they had not yet received any official confirmation. This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found in the trailer container The victims of the trailer were 31 men and eight women and Essex Police initially said they were all believed to be Chinese. They were found at an industrial estate in Grays at 01:40 BST on Wednesday. At a press conference on Friday evening Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said the force was working with the National Crime Agency, the Home Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Border Force and Immigration Enforcement. She said she would not be drawn on any further detail about the nationalities of the victims until formal identification processes had taken place. ""We gave an initial steer on Thursday on nationality, however, this is now a developing picture,"" she said. How is a dead body identified? How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' Police have confirmed the scene at Waterglade Industrial Estate in Eastern Avenue was closed on Friday. Essex Police also urged anyone fearing their loved ones may have been in the lorry to get in touch. ""I can't begin to comprehend what some of you must be going through right now. You have my assurance that Essex Police will be working tirelessly to understand the whole picture to this absolute tragedy,"" said Det Ch Con Mills. She also urged anyone living illegally in the UK who may have information to come forward, without fear of criminal action being taken against them. GPS data shows the refrigerated container trailer crossed back and forth between the UK and Europe in the days before it was found. It was leased from the company Global Trailer Rentals on 15 October. The company said it was ""entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been"". Essex Police said the tractor unit (the front part of the lorry) had entered the UK via Holyhead - an Irish Sea port in Wales - on Sunday 20 October, having travelled over from Dublin. The lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from County Armagh Police believe the tractor unit collected the trailer in Purfleet on the River Thames and left the port shortly after 01:05 on Thursday. Police were called to the industrial park where the bodies were discovered about half an hour later. Temperatures in refrigerated units can be as low as -25C (-13F). The lorry now is at a secure site in Essex. A spokesman for the UN International Organization for Migration said the discovery of bodies in Essex did not necessarily indicate a major shift in migration patterns. ""These are the kind of random crimes that occur every day in the world somewhere,"" he said. ""They get huge attention when they do but they don't necessarily indicate a big shift in migration or patterns in any place in particular. It's just the condition of what happens when this many people are engaging this many criminal groups to reach a destination, which of course we deplore."" Detectives are still questioning the lorry driver, Mo Robinson, of County Armagh in Northern Ireland, on suspicion of murder. He was arrested on Wednesday. Two other people were also earlier arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. The man and woman, both 38, from Warrington, Cheshire, are also being held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people. Police officers were seen at the couple's home address in Warrington, with a police van and two squad cars parked outside. Sources say the GPS data shows it left Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland on 15 October before crossing over to Northern Ireland and then returning south to Dublin From Dublin, it crossed over to Holyhead in Wales overnight on 16 October That evening, it travelled to continental Europe from Dover to Calais in France Between 17 and 22 October, it moved between various cities in Belgium and France, including Dunkirk, Bruges and Lille On 22 October, it made its final crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet The container made its final crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet on Tuesday Do you have any information to share about the incident?

UK payday lending giant QuickQuid to closeThousands of its customers had unresolved complaints about unaffordable payday loans.,"The UK's biggest remaining payday loan provider is to close, with thousands of complaints about its lending still unresolved. QuickQuid's owner, US-based Enova, says it will leave the UK market ""due to regulatory uncertainty"". Compensation claims have been made from customers who said they were given loans they could not afford to repay. It is the latest firm offering short-term, high-interest loans to close after regulations were tightened. QuickQuid has been the biggest payday lender in the UK for the past few years. It was bigger than household name Wonga even before the latter folded in August last year. The Money Shop closed earlier this year. Kenneth Barker took out 11 consecutive loans in less than a year when he was a barman in Essex in 2012. ""The initial one was for Â£100. I paid back Â£160, but then needed a Â£150 loan to tide me over for the next month. It gradually worsened,"" said the 28-year-old, who now lives in Leeds. ""To be honest, I knew what I was getting myself into, but sometimes you don't have any other choice."" He submitted a complaint nine months ago, claiming he was given unaffordable loans, and was offered Â£50 in compensation by the company. He said: ""I then went to the financial ombudsman. That was accepted and I was offered Â£2,000. I was told I'd get it within 28 days. I'm hoping I will still get that money! ""I have no idea how this is going to proceed or whether I will receive this money."" Despite waiting for his compensation, he said he was pleased that a business such as QuickQuid would be closing. QuickQuid is one of the brand names of CashEuroNet UK, which also runs On Stride - a provider of longer-term, larger loans and previously known as Pounds to Pocket. ""Over the past several months, we worked with our UK regulator to agree upon a sustainable solution to the elevated complaints to the UK Financial Ombudsman, which would enable us to continue providing access to credit,"" said Enova boss David Fisher. ""While we are disappointed that we could not ultimately find a path forward, the decision to exit the UK market is the right one for Enova and our shareholders."" New rules brought in five years ago limited the interest rates and fees payday lenders can charge and introduced enhanced affordability checks. Since then there has been a wave of complaints from customers who say they were mis-sold loans they could not afford. QuickQuid has been facing as many as 10,000 or more outstanding complaints from borrowers. Such legacy loan complaints, many of which came via claims management companies, were the key reason for the demise of Wonga last year. The closure of QuickQuid might lead some to think their loan is invalid - but it is not. ""While you may be tempted to stop your repayments, it is crucial to keep to your regular schedule, because if you have entered into a loan agreement you must fulfil it,"" said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service. ""If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating."" Those who are owed money in compensation must wait to see what the next move is for the business. The Money Advice Service website hasa guide on alternatives to payday loans,external. As well as historic complaints, QuickQuid was also the subject of compensation claims for more recent loans. The UK's Financial Ombudsman Service said that it had received 3,165 cases against CashEuroNet in the first half of the year. It was the second most-complained about company in the banking and credit sector during that six months. The ombudsman upheld 59% of cases against the company during the same period, but a backlog of cases is thought to have built up. Anyone with eligible complaints who is entitled to compensation will now see the level of any payouts depend on the process of closing the company. Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said: ""I feel incredibly sorry for those people with complaints that they may have had in with the ombudsman for years. ""The current system does not give adequate protection for these borrowers.""

"Liverpool win legal battle over New Balance dealA High Court judge rules the kit supplier's marketing offer was ""less favourable"" than a Nike deal.","New Balance has been Liverpool's official kit supplier since 2015 Liverpool FC have won a legal battle over a multimillion-pound sponsorship deal with the US company New Balance. The European champions were taken to court over their alleged refusal to honour a reported Â£40m-a-year deal, which expires in May 2020. Under the terms, the footwear firm is entitled to renew its sponsorship if it matches any competitor's offer. But Liverpool argued that New Balance could not match Nike's five-year deal of Â£30m a year in terms of marketing. Nike said sports stars like Serena Williams could promote Liverpool products Giving his ruling in London, Mr Justice Teare ruled in Liverpool's favour, finding that ""the New Balance offer on marketing was less favourable to Liverpool FC than the Nike offer"". The judge said New Balance could not match Nike's offer to use ""three non-football global superstar athletes and influencers of the calibre of"" tennis legend Serena Williams, basketball star LeBron James and the musician Drake. New Balance has been Liverpool's official kit suppliersince the 2015-16 season,external. The sportswear firm said at the time it was ""an important step for... launching into football and reflects the global growth ambitions of the brand"". Opening the firm's case last week, Daniel Oudkerk QC said the key issue was whether New Balance had matched ""the material, measurable and matchable terms of a third-party offer"". Liverpool argued New Balance had not matched Nike's offer, which includes a commitment to sell licensed products in at least ""6,000 stores worldwide, 500 of which shall be Nike-owned"". But Mr Oudkerk said New Balance has ""approximately 40,000-odd retail doors globally"". He argued Liverpool dismissed New Balance's offer to match terms as the club was ""wedded to Nike"", and that ""it appears that the club had resolved to reject the New Balance match come what may"". New Balance was responsible for designing Liverpool's strips and training kit Guy Morpuss QC, representing the Premier League club, said New Balance's claim it could distribute the club's kit to 40,000 stores was ""a myth"", adding the company had ""grossly overstated"" the number of stores to which it could distribute. ""The idea that New Balance would even get football kit into anything close to those 40,000 stores is utterly fanciful,"" he added. Liverpool FC fails in bid to trademark city's name Nike boss to leave role after Oregon Project is closed down Champions League final giveaway ad breached rules The court also heard that Liverpool spent more than Â£555,000 on the case, with 20% to be paid by New Balance. In his ruling, Mr Justice Teare said: ""Liverpool FC is not obliged to enter into a new agreement with New Balance."" A Liverpool spokesperson said the club was pleased with the judge's decision. ""We will continue with New Balance for the current season, in combination with preparing next season's Liverpool kits with our new supplier."" A New Balance spokeswoman said the firm was disappointed, adding: ""We believe strongly that we matched the competing offer and would have delivered many more years of record-breaking kit sales.""

""I guess we should have known because there were two empty chairs there, but I just assumed that an assistant was going to come along,"" he said. The founder of the first Iraqi LGBT+ organisation, Amir Ashour, who also took part in the roundtable, said the duke's attendance was an indication of how important the issue was to the royal couple. ""They were asking questions and getting engaged,"" the 29-year-old said, adding that he was ""surprised at how genuine they were"". Meghan and her husband arrived at the roundtable in an electric car Harry and Meghan are president and vice president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust respectively.

"A million people's help urged on invasive speciesTrain citizens to stop ""outbreaks"" of non-native species in the UK, a committee urges ministers.UK PoliticsComments","The Asian hornet is one of the invasive species in the UK More than a million volunteers are needed to tackle the spread of invasive non-native species in the UK, MPs say. It is estimated that between 36 and 48 new such species will become established in the next 20 years, according toa report by the Environmental Audit Committee.,external Climate change is putting ""the future of our natural landscape at risk,"" said committee chairwoman Mary Creagh. A government spokesperson said it was ""committed"" to tackling the problem. The phrase ""invasive non-native species"" (Inns) describes those species that have been directly moved as a result of human activity. In the UK, examples include the Asian hornet and giant hogweed. The report says slowing their rate of arrival is the first priority in stopping their establishment. It cites New Zealand's plan to train 150,000 people in biosecurity by 2025 and says the government should significantly expand its approach to public engagement. Asian hornets: First UK find of 2019 Why is hogweed so dangerous? Are clothes moths on the rise? The committee wants 1.3 million people to be taught how to spot ""outbreaks"" of invasive species. It also calls for a dedicated border force to be established by 2020 to improve biosecurity at UK borders, and bans on importing problem species before they present a risk to the UK. Ash dieback in a forest in Norfolk in 2012 Ms Creagh, a Labour MP, said: ""Inns is one of the UK's top five threats to the natural environment. If we're to beat this, we need people power, with an army of volunteers trained to spot and stop an invasive species before it becomes established. ""Oak processionary moth caterpillars can strip an oak tree bare as well as posing a hazard to our own health. We face losing half of the UK's native ash trees to ash dieback within a century, costing Â£15bn. ""New regulations to halt their progress are welcome but they are too little, too late. Government funding to tackle invasive species is tiny and fails to match the scale of the threat."" The report also calls for the government to set up a rapid-response emergency fund to enable agencies to tackle a threat before it gets out of control and to increase funding for the Non-Native Species Secretariat to Â£3m per year. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""Invasive non-native species not only challenge the survival of some of our rarest species but damage our natural ecosystems as well as costing the economy more than Â£1.7bn per year. ""We are committed to being leaders in tackling invasive species, and our 25-year Environment Plan commits us to enhancing the biosecurity of the country even further.

Deja vu as France digs in heels,"The French president is fed up with how long the Brexit process is taking There's a strong sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu in the EU's Brexit extension discussions. As Westminster waits and the prime minister calls for an official EU decision to be made, France is acting as a spoke in the wheels. Much as it did back in spring when leaders debated the April Brexit extension. A consensus is forming amongst most EU countries, including powerful Germany, to grant the three-month delay outlined in Boris Johnson's letter to Brussels requesting a new Brexit extension. They hope to formally announce this on Friday. Ambassadors representing the 27 EU leaders are expected to meet mid-morning in Brussels. But France worries a 12-week extension could encourage more UK indecisiveness or a general election which may prove inconclusive on Brexit. President Emmanuel Macron favours a short, sharp Brexit delay; encouraging MPs and the UK government to concentrate on ratifying the newly-negotiated Brexit deal. Mr Macron is fed up with the more than three-year EU focus on Brexit and the ever-present threat of a no-deal scenario. He'd rather shift attention to reforming the EU itself, to the benefit (he believes) of the countries remaining in it. Boris Johnson insists the UK will leave the EU next week with or without a deal Of course, the French president knows Brexit won't be over if and when the UK leaves. Brexit Chapter Two, the negotiations on a comprehensive EU-UK trade deal will likely be lengthy and complex, but they will largely be the competence of the European Commission, landing far more rarely on EU leaders' in-trays. But will President Macron really veto the three-month extension Germany and others favour? He has already angered a number in the EU of late by putting his foot down on widening the bloc to include two new member states. Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? How soon could there be a general election? Do voters support Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? If he refuses to agree with an EU majority over the new Brexit extension, then Mr Macron will be using up exactly the kind of good will/openness to consensus decision-making that he needs if he wants to make headway on his EU reform agenda. Is the length of the Brexit extension really worth that to him? It could well be that Mr Macron is using the days before the extension decision is formally announced to stamp his feet that: a)    The UK should not take Brexit extensions for granted and b)    That the extension time should be used for something concrete. What's in UK PM's new deal? What will happen with Brexit in the next few days? A simple guide to Brexit What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? There is an active EU debate right now (as there was prior to the last Brexit extension being granted) over whether to attach specific conditions. For example, to say that the EU will only grant the extension if the UK begins a new parliamentary timetable aimed at ratifying the Brexit deal or if it holds a general election. But while it's easy for EU politicians to make assertions like that, it's far more complex to formally put these conditions into writing. It risks looking like Brussels meddling in the domestic politics of a sovereign EU country. So, as with the previous extension, there are unlikely to be formal take-it-or-leave-it conditions attached. And why are the majority of EU leaders in favour of approving the UK-requested three-month extension? Well, they believe it: a)    Prevents the EU having to agonise over two extensions in quick succession. A short one to see if the Brexit deal can be ratified in the UK parliament and, if not, then a second extension soon after, to allow the UK to hold elections or a referendum. b)    Most EU leaders think opting for the extension time asked for by UK (the three months mentioned in the PM's request letter and in the Benn Act compelling him to write that letter) is the most neutral thing Brussels can do, considering the heated political climate in the UK. Germany, for example, worries that offering more than three months could be viewed in the UK as the EU ""trying to keep the UK in as long as possible"" while opting for a shorter time could be regarded as an attempt to meddle in UK parliamentary procedure by ""forcing"" MPs hands over the ratification of the Brexit deal or even as the EU ""throwing the UK out"". That explains the EU majority preference for three months but, as with the last Brexit delay, Brussels dubs this a 'flextension'. The UK would not be compelled to remain in the EU for the full extra 12 weeks. It would leave as soon as the UK parliament and the European parliament ratified the Brexit deal. However, watching the ongoing divisions in Parliament - inside Boris Johnson's Conservative party over whether to prioritise elections vs getting the Brexit deal ratified and also the splits in the Labour party to back, or not to back calling a general election, EU figures mutter in private, that they half expect to be asked for yet another Brexit extension come January.

What happens in next few days?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"Call for action on 'survival sex link' to benefitsSome women are being driven to sex work because of problems with universal credit, MPs say.UK","Women say being left short of money by universal credit is forcing them to make desperate decisions Evidence that women are being driven to sex work because of problems with universal credit must lead to government action,MPs have said,external.

The committee said the government had previously been ""dismissive"" of the issue but had now changed its position. The government said it was taking the evidence ""very seriously"". The committee has been investigating a potential link between universal credit and ""survival sex"" - when people, overwhelmingly but not exclusively women, turn to sex work to meet their basic needs, including food, shelter and clean clothes. Universal creditmerges six benefits into one payment and was designed to simplify the benefits system and help people move into work.

A 21-year-old woman - referred to as T to protect her identity - told the committee she was abused as a child and had not been to school since the age of 11. She worked in a cafe, then became a carer - gaining a social care qualification - but had to leave her job because of mental health problems. She said she turned to sex work because her universal credit payments were not enough to cover her basic living costs. ""It is horrible to say, but it is the easiest thing to keep us girls alive,"" she said. Advances are available while people wait for their first payment, however this must then be paid back from subsequent payments so T said she continued to struggle to make ends meet.

Mobile giants unveil plan to end rural 'not-spots',"Sian Davies and her husband Jonathan at their local pub in Rossett, Wales A promise to end rural 'not-spots' can't come too soon for Sian Davies. She moved to Rossett, north-east Wales, with her husband this year - and the lack of mobile coverage has been ""a real bugbear"". ""The signal is almost non-existent,"" she said. ""If I want to send or receive texts, I have to go upstairs in my home,"" she said. She's not alone. Currently one third of the UK has patchy or non-existent mobile phone coverage. But on Friday, a Â£1bn plan between the UK's four main mobile phone companies and the government was unveiled with the aim of banishing these signal dead zones. The proposed deal - which includes EE, O2, Three and Vodafone - promises to get 4G coverage to 95% of the UK by 2025. The operators would invest in new and existing phone masts they would all share under the proposal, which the government hopes will be formalised early next year. It is estimated that an additional 280,000 homes and businesses and 16,000km of roads will have coverage. The four main mobile networks plan to contribute a total of Â£530m for the Shared Rural Network, with the government potentially supporting it with another Â£500m once the deal is finalised. The government had threatened to force the mobile firms to allow customers to roam onto each other's networks in not-spots, a move the companies said would deter new investment. Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said ""it is not yet a done deal and I want to see industry move quickly so we can reach a final agreement early next year."" For people like Mrs Davies, lack of coverage is a huge inconvenience. She's lost online purchases, as it takes so long for confirmation texts to come through. She ended up upgrading her phone so she could receive calls over wi-fi at home: ""Rossett is only six miles from both Chester and Wrexham, yet we are lucky to even get 3G never mind 4G,"" she said. ""One day O2 (her provider) called trying to get me to upgrade, but the caller said reception was bad and they would call later."" She contacted the company when it announced it was rolling out 5G: ""I am flabbergasted that they can do this when many people cannot even get 3G!"" This deal follows years of wrangling between the government and the mobile operators with each side aware that the stakes were high. It was under David Cameron's government that poor rural mobile coverage became a live issue - the Prime Minister was reportedly maddened by the lack of a mobile signal on his Cornish holidays, and residents and businesses in the countryside were understandably angry that poor connectivity was excluding them from the digital revolution. The government repeatedly threatened to bring in so-called national roaming, forcing operators to allow customers to connect to rival networks in places where they could not provide a signal. They hated this proposal, insisting it would bring investment to a halt - why would you build a new mast only to see it used by customers of a rival who'd failed to invest? But the threat has forced them to come up with a plan to invest Â£500m in a shared network which will see one mast hosting antennas from several operators. In return they've won two concessions- the government will hand over cash to reach the really remote areas and Ofcom will drop coverage requirements from the rules for the next 5G spectrum auction. Now though the final details of the deal have to be agreed - and rural residents may still have to wait some years before they can be confident of connecting wherever they are. Vodafone's chief technology officer, Scott Petty, told the BBC the plan has been 12 months in the making. ""As an industry we really believe this is the most effective way to get the UK from the bottom end of the coverage tables in Europe to the top end,"" he said. Mark Bridgeman of the Country Land and Business Association said the news was is a big step forwards. ""We have been hugely frustrated at the lack of progress in improving mobile reception to date,"" he said. ""This announcement will be welcomed by everyone who lives or works in the countryside."" Felicity Burch, director of digital and innovation at business lobby group the CBI, said the proposal would ""unleash investment and boost productivity"". ""This is another crucial step in making the UK match-fit for the digital revolution."" 5G: Rural areas could see bigger and taller masts Firms 'hobbled' by poor mobile coverage Sian Davies says she's ""all for it, as long as the four companies can negotiate together and deliver what is promised."" She is worried though that her area will miss out: ""I fear they may concentrate on more remote areas, and places such as Rossett which are relatively close to large urban areas, will be forgotten.""

Thousands evacuated as California wildfire rages,"This video can not be played Jets drop fire retardant on California blaze A fast-moving wildfire in northern California was sparked seven minutes after a nearby power line was damaged, according to a local power company. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) said damage had been reported at a high voltage tower near where the Kincade Fire started on Wednesday. About 50,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in the state by wildfires driven by powerful winds. A state of emergency has been declared in Los Angeles and Sonoma counties. The deadliest wildfire in the state's history - which killed 85 people in northern California in 2018 - was caused by PG&E power lines. Commenting on the latest fire, Governor Gavin Newsom said in a news conference on Friday that the company ""simply did not do their job"". He condemned ""years and years of greed, years and years of mismanagement in the utilities"". The company said it had not yet determined if the power glitch had sparked the Kincade Fire. ""We still, at this point, do not know what exactly happened,"" PG&E chief executive Bill Johnson told the Washington Post. The utility said it had turned off power nearby over concerns that high winds could spark blazes, but the lines were still working when the fire ignited. About 2,000 residents have been evacuated. At least 21 homes have been destroyed in the blaze, California fire officials said on Friday. The wildfires are expected to worsen in southern California over the weekend as gusty winds continue. California is still recovering fromwildfires last yearthat killed about 100 people. The Kincade Fire, which started on Wednesday, has burned through 21,900 acres (8,800 hectares) of land in Sonoma County - one of California's best-known wine regions. More than 1,300 firefighters are tackling the blaze, which remains uncontained. There are a number of other major fires: The Tick Fire in Los Angeles County has burned at least 5,000 acres in the Santa Clarita region The Old Water Fire in San Bernardino County has burned 95 acres, shutting off a major highway The Cabrillo Fire in San Mateo County, south of the town of Pescadero, has burnt about 95 acres The Sawday Fire in San Diego County, which began on Friday, has burned 70 acres, some 40 miles northeast of San Diego The ongoing Saddle Ridge Fire in Los Angeles County has burned 8,700 acres over the last 14 days According to areport filed to the California Public Utilities Commission,externalon Thursday, a ""broken jumper"" - which connects power lines to towers - was discovered at 21:20 local time on Wednesday. The fire began at 21:27, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The news sent share prices of PG&E tumbling on Friday, as investors feared the company might be held responsible for the Kincade Fire. The company is already seeking bankruptcy protection as it faces lawsuits over last year's deadly Camp Fire. It was found to have been sparked by aging equipment owned by PG&E. It spawned billions of dollars in liability claims against the company. Homes have been destroyed in the town of Geyserville, which has been evacuated High winds appear to have spread the fires - gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h) have swept much of the state. California is affected by Santa Ana winds, which are known for being dry and gusty, exacerbating wildfires. Why do Santa Ana winds make wildfires worse? California fires 'can now happen any year' Volunteers fighting fires in California's 'forgotten canyon' On Thursday morning PG&E shut off power in 15 California counties to prevent accidental fires, affecting about 180,000 homes. Power was restored to most customers on Thursday night. But officials warn of more outages over the weekend in regions experiencing high winds and dry heat. Schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District remained closed on Friday because of air quality and safety concerns. The fire has spread rapidly due to heavy winds in the area The cause of the blaze is not known This video can not be played 'I saw the flames and said we gotta go' - wildfires near Los Angeles force thousands to flee California braces for Santa Ana winds.

Transgender people treated âinhumanelyâ online,"""Tranny"" and ""shemale"" are the slurs most commonly used against trans people online, according to a study. Anti-bullying charity Ditch The Label and its analytics partner Brandwatch described the harassment as being ""inhumane"". Researchers analysed,external10 million posts on the topic of transgender identity, shared from the UK and the US over a period of three-and-a-half years. They said more than 1.5 million of them were anti-trans. Other common transphobic themes of online posts included misgendering people - purposefully labelling somebody as a gender that they do not identify as. Transgender hate crime rises by 81% Trans models: From decades of rejection to centre stage Transgender man loses challenge to be named father Video streaming sites and message boards were found to host the most transphobic abuse and the ""least constructive conversation"" about trans lives. ""This report uncovers the shocking and inhumane ways in which transgender people are targeted, harassed, and abused on digital platforms,"" said Ditch the Label's chief Liam Hackett. ""Using the largest dataset of its kind, it is easy to see how, left unchallenged, digital hate speech can and does evolve into acts of physical violence committed towards trans people."" Mr Jones said it was sad to see the scale of the problem confirmed, but he was not shocked by the findings Kenny Ethan Jones is a transgender male model and activist. ""Transphobia is something I witness every single day,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm often intentionally misgendered and I'm always on the receiving end of comments like, 'You're not a real man,' 'You're confused and you need God,' 'You don't deserve to live.' ""I wonder if people understand the effect that these abusive comments have on my mental health. ""Some days I feel hurt and hopeless."" The study compared transphobia across a range of sites, including social media, blogs, news outlets and forums. Larger sites such as Twitter and Instagram had the lowest percentage of abuse in general discussion around trans issues, at 5% and 12% respectively. Whereas on video streaming site YouTube, 78% of such discussion was abuse. Researchers said it should be noted that the volume of posts on this site was much lower than Twitter and Instagram. Comments sections on news sites made up much of its abuse total (19%), and forums featured a high percentage of abusive language (40%). Meanwhile, mentions of trans issues across most of the site categories were more hostile in the US. The BBC has approached Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for comment. The transphobic insult ""tranny"" featured more than 1.2 million times between 2015 and 2019, accounting for 80% of the insults studied. ""Shemale"" had 150,000 mentions. The researchers also found examples of dead-naming: purposefully using a transgender person's previous name from before they transitioned. In the UK, politics appeared to be a key theme associated with the abuse, with the topic appearing in 27% of all the transphobic posts. Race came a close second. It was raised in 24% of the transphobic messages, and was especially common when the abused person was black. In the US, race was found to be the main driver, appearing in 34% of the abusive comments, followed by politics, which was raised in 33%. Parenting topics were also seen to be used as triggers for transphobia, with people using their parental status - ""as a mother of two kidsâ¦"" - to justify their views. This type of abuse tended to centre around the parents' fears, for example not wanting their children to be around trans people. In addition, transphobic slurs were used by some sports fans alongside racist, sexist and homophobic abuse, even when the intended victim did not identify as transgender. For example, Serena Williams had transphobic insults directed at her because she was not deemed to look feminine enough. Jay Hulme is a 22-year-old children's poet from Leicester. He's a transgender man and he says he constantly receives harassment on social media because of his identity. Mr Hulme said online hatred would not stop him from fighting for trans rights ""It can be a full-scale hate storm with thousands of people attacking me relentlessly for days, or individual accounts sending general hate. I've been called an abuser, a sexual harasser, a sexist. I think the worst ones would have to be the times people call me a paedophile, just because I'm trans and write books for children. ""About four or five months ago I started an instant block policy when it comes to anyone who sends me harassment on Twitter. As of today, I've blocked almost 5,000 accounts who reached out and sent me transphobic messages."" He thinks social media companies should do more to prevent their platforms being used for hate speech. ""Online harassment of trans people is a really prevalent problem, and often goes a lot further than the things people say in real life. ""Social media companies should do more, but I think there's a lack of understanding of transphobia within their teams so they struggle to counter it. Also, they should do more for all kinds of hate - their moderation tactics have been proven ineffective time and again.""

"'Series of failures' behind Boeing Lion Air crashInvestigators found faults by Boeing, Lion Air and the pilots led to the crash, which killed 189 people.Business","A series of failures led to the crash of a Lion Air flight, which killed 189 people and led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, a report has found. Investigators said faults by Boeing, Lion Air and pilots caused the crash. Five months after the disaster in October last year, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 people on board, which led to the grounding of the entire 737 Max fleet. Faults with the plane's design have been linked to both crashes. On Friday, air crash investigators in Indonesia released their final report, detailing the list of events that caused the Lion Air jet to plunge into the Java Sea. ""From what we know, there are nine things that contributed to this accident,"" Indonesian air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo told reporters at a news conference. ""If one of the nine hadn't occurred, maybe the accident wouldn't have occurred."" The 353-page report found the jet should have been grounded before departing on the fatal flight because of an earlier cockpit issue. However, because the issue was not recorded properly the plane was allowed to take off without the fault being fixed, it said. Further, a crucial sensor - which had been bought from a repair shop in Florida - had not been properly tested, the report found. On Friday, the US aviation regulator revoked the company's certification. The sensor fed information to the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - or MCAS. That software, which is designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling, has been a focus for investigators trying to find the cause of both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. Indonesian investigators identified issues with the system, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control. It showed there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the ""deficiencies"" had been highlighted during training. Further, the report found that the first officer, who had performed poorly in training, struggled to run through a list of procedures that he should have had memorised. He was flying the plane just before it entered into the fatal dive, but the report said the captain had not briefed him properly when he handed over the controls as they struggled to keep the plane in the air. The report also found that 31 pages were missing from the plane's maintenance log. Indonesian investigators have previously said mechanical and design problems were key factors in the crash of the Lion Air plane. Boeing expects 737 Max to fly again by New Year What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit Boeing staff texted about 737 Max issue in 2016 Battle over blame This report describes a catalogue of failures - from poor communication to bad design to inadequate flying skills - which culminated in the deaths of 189 people. There are lots of what-ifs here. If the crew of the previous days flight had given a more detailed description of the problems they'd faced, the aircraft might never have taken off on its fatal flight. And if the captain, who'd successfully kept the plane in the air - despite the intervention of a rogue automated system he didn't understand - hadn't handed over to his less-capable first officer, disaster might still have been avoided. As Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has repeatedly stated, there was a chain of events. But at the heart of that chain was MCAS - a control system that the pilots didn't know about, and which was vulnerable to a single sensor failure. Boeing  - and regulators - allowed the system to be designed in this way and didn't change it after the Lion Air crash, leading to a further disaster. And that means that while the report clearly points to serious failures by a parts supplier and by the airline itself, it is Boeing that will bear the greatest share of responsibility. Indonesian authorities laid out some recommendations for Boeing in the report, including that it redesign MCAS and provide adequate information about it in pilot manuals and training. In a statement, Boeing said it was ""addressing"" the recommendations from Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee. The planemaker said it was ""taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again"". On Tuesday, the firm ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, making him the most senior official to leave the company since the two crashes. Boeing also said it expected the 737 Max to be re-certified for flying by the end of the year. The company said ""we look forward to continuing to work together"" with Lion Air in the future. A Lion Air spokesman said the crash was an ""unthinkable tragedy"" and it was essential to take immediate corrective actions to ensure a similar accident never occurred again. This video can not be played 'I lost my only son in the Lion Air plane crash' The pressure on Boeing to explain what it knew about the problems with the 737 Max has intensified. There wererevelations this month that employees had exchanged messagesabout issues with MCAS while the plane was being certified in 2016. In documents provided by Boeing to lawmakers, a pilot wrote that he had run into unexpected trouble during tests. He said he had ""basically lied to the regulators [unknowingly]"". Boeing said this week it had developed a training update and that it expected regulators to allow the planes to return to the skies before the beginning of 2020. The grounding of the 737 Max hastaken a tollon the planemaker. Profits more than halved to $895m (Â£687m) in the third quarter and the firm said it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliner, blaming trade uncertainties.

A million people's help urged on invasive species,"The Asian hornet is one of the invasive species in the UK More than a million volunteers are needed to tackle the spread of invasive non-native species in the UK, MPs say. It is estimated that between 36 and 48 new such species will become established in the next 20 years, according toa report by the Environmental Audit Committee.,external Climate change is putting ""the future of our natural landscape at risk,"" said committee chairwoman Mary Creagh. A government spokesperson said it was ""committed"" to tackling the problem. The phrase ""invasive non-native species"" (Inns) describes those species that have been directly moved as a result of human activity. In the UK, examples include the Asian hornet and giant hogweed. The report says slowing their rate of arrival is the first priority in stopping their establishment. It cites New Zealand's plan to train 150,000 people in biosecurity by 2025 and says the government should significantly expand its approach to public engagement. Asian hornets: First UK find of 2019 Why is hogweed so dangerous? Are clothes moths on the rise? The committee wants 1.3 million people to be taught how to spot ""outbreaks"" of invasive species. It also calls for a dedicated border force to be established by 2020 to improve biosecurity at UK borders, and bans on importing problem species before they present a risk to the UK. Ash dieback in a forest in Norfolk in 2012 Ms Creagh, a Labour MP, said: ""Inns is one of the UK's top five threats to the natural environment. If we're to beat this, we need people power, with an army of volunteers trained to spot and stop an invasive species before it becomes established. ""Oak processionary moth caterpillars can strip an oak tree bare as well as posing a hazard to our own health. We face losing half of the UK's native ash trees to ash dieback within a century, costing Â£15bn. ""New regulations to halt their progress are welcome but they are too little, too late. Government funding to tackle invasive species is tiny and fails to match the scale of the threat."" The report also calls for the government to set up a rapid-response emergency fund to enable agencies to tackle a threat before it gets out of control and to increase funding for the Non-Native Species Secretariat to Â£3m per year. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""Invasive non-native species not only challenge the survival of some of our rarest species but damage our natural ecosystems as well as costing the economy more than Â£1.7bn per year. ""We are committed to being leaders in tackling invasive species, and our 25-year Environment Plan commits us to enhancing the biosecurity of the country even further.

Labour MP Ian Murray reselected after union attack,"Mr Murray received the backing of all four member branches in his constituency Labour MP Ian Murray has been reselected as a candidate in the next general electiondespite union opposition. The Unite union accused the MP for Edinburgh South of consistently undermining the Labour leadership. Party rules could have triggered a contest to replace him if the move was backed by a third of local members or affiliated unions. However, all four constituency member branches have voted to reselect him. Mr Murray said: ""It is a huge honour to have been reselected as Labour's candidate in Edinburgh South for the forthcoming general election. ""Representing my home city of Edinburgh is a great privilege, and I have always put this constituency first and foremost."" Unite had led the calls for Mr Murray's deselection over his criticism of the Labour leadership in Scotland and at Westminster. It also claimed he had, on occasion, attacked the union. After the reselection decision was announced, Mr Murray said he was grateful for the backing of ""the overwhelming majority of trade unions"". He also thanked the ""hard-working and committed local Labour party activists"" for their continued support. Mr Murray said: ""My focus remains on standing up for the 80,000 people in my constituency, regardless of how they voted, and working tirelessly to secure a People's Vote to avoid a devastating Brexit."" Before becoming an MP, Mr Murray served for seven years as a councillor for the city's Liberton and Gilmerton ward. The Edinburgh University graduate was elected to Westminster in 2010 and, after an SNP landslide in 2015,he was Labour's only Scottish MP. In 2017, Mr Murray retained his Edinburgh South seat with 54.7% of the vote. He increased his majority to 15,514 (32%) - the largest in Scotland. He also increased his profile by leading the campaign to save Hearts Football Club from administration. In February, Mr Murray declined to joinseven Labour MPs who leftto form an independent group in protest at the party's approach to Brexit and anti-Semitism under Jeremy Corbyn. At the time Mr Murray said Mr Corbyn should ""listen and learn and decide if he wants to keep the Labour Party together"".

Pupils' years changed 'to improve school results',"Some schools may be moving pupils off their registers as an ""easy way"" to improve exam data, the watchdog Estyn has warned. The proportion of pupils who do not move from year 10 to the final year of GCSEs has nearly doubled in six years. Estyn said data suggested the majority of pupils repeating year 10 were ""not doing so for genuine reasons"". The Welsh Government said the increase in pupils not progressing to year 11 was worrying. And a head teachers' union said there were many different reasons why a pupil might be taken off a school's register. The report looks at ""off-rolling"" - pupils being moved from a school's roll without being formally excluded - and is often referred to in relation to improving exams data. Using data from the annual schools' census, the watchdog found 1,352 pupils did not progress from year 10 to year 11 in 2017-18. Pupils eligible for free school meals and those with special educational needs were far more likely not to progress up to year 11 than their peers. Around 10% of year 10 pupils eligible for free school meals did not move up to year 11 last year. Estyn looked at pupils who repeated year 10 and those who moved into other provision, known as Education Other than at School (EOTAS). ""Of the 91 pupils that repeated year 10 in 2018-2019, over half of these pupils were at a very few schools,"" it said. Pupil referral units are the main providers of EOTAS but it also covers a range of other provision by further education colleges, independent schools or tuition. Some children split their time between school and EOTAS. Estyn found the numbers transferring to EOTAS had not changed significantly. But there had been a marked increase in the percentage of these pupils whose main education provider was listed as EOTAS, rather than the school. That meant their results would not count towards their school's exam performance. Target pressures see children taken out of school - union Pupils' digital skills 'not keeping pace' Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools' Autism concern over home schooling rise in Wales The watchdog said there were inconsistencies in how well local authorities were monitoring pupil registrations, and arrangements in a few had ""not been robust enough"". The report says some council officials said schools were eager for pupils to be mainly registered with the other education setting so their results would not count. ""It is seen by schools as an easy way for a school to improve its performance data,"" the report said. It calls on local authorities to monitor how schools register pupils ""to provide assurance that schools are always acting in the best interests of individual pupils"". Because of the small numbers, the analysis is incomplete for some local authorities. But the most recent figures showed Gwynedd, Wrexham, Anglesey and Carmarthenshire had the highest percentages of pupils not moving on to year 11, while Merthyr Tydfil and Denbighshire had the highest percentage of pupils moved to EOTAS as the main provider. The Welsh Government said it was currently developing a new approach to pupil registration and school evaluation to prevent off-rolling.

Pupils' years changed 'to improve school results'The watchdog is concerned some pupils may be moved off registers to improve school exam performance.Wales,"Some schools may be moving pupils off their registers as an ""easy way"" to improve exam data, the watchdog Estyn has warned. The proportion of pupils who do not move from year 10 to the final year of GCSEs has nearly doubled in six years. Estyn said data suggested the majority of pupils repeating year 10 were ""not doing so for genuine reasons"". The Welsh Government said the increase in pupils not progressing to year 11 was worrying. And a head teachers' union said there were many different reasons why a pupil might be taken off a school's register. The report looks at ""off-rolling"" - pupils being moved from a school's roll without being formally excluded - and is often referred to in relation to improving exams data. Using data from the annual schools' census, the watchdog found 1,352 pupils did not progress from year 10 to year 11 in 2017-18. Pupils eligible for free school meals and those with special educational needs were far more likely not to progress up to year 11 than their peers. Around 10% of year 10 pupils eligible for free school meals did not move up to year 11 last year. Estyn looked at pupils who repeated year 10 and those who moved into other provision, known as Education Other than at School (EOTAS). ""Of the 91 pupils that repeated year 10 in 2018-2019, over half of these pupils were at a very few schools,"" it said. Pupil referral units are the main providers of EOTAS but it also covers a range of other provision by further education colleges, independent schools or tuition. Some children split their time between school and EOTAS. Estyn found the numbers transferring to EOTAS had not changed significantly. But there had been a marked increase in the percentage of these pupils whose main education provider was listed as EOTAS, rather than the school. That meant their results would not count towards their school's exam performance. Target pressures see children taken out of school - union Pupils' digital skills 'not keeping pace' Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools' Autism concern over home schooling rise in Wales The watchdog said there were inconsistencies in how well local authorities were monitoring pupil registrations, and arrangements in a few had ""not been robust enough"". The report says some council officials said schools were eager for pupils to be mainly registered with the other education setting so their results would not count. ""It is seen by schools as an easy way for a school to improve its performance data,"" the report said. It calls on local authorities to monitor how schools register pupils ""to provide assurance that schools are always acting in the best interests of individual pupils"". Because of the small numbers, the analysis is incomplete for some local authorities. But the most recent figures showed Gwynedd, Wrexham, Anglesey and Carmarthenshire had the highest percentages of pupils not moving on to year 11, while Merthyr Tydfil and Denbighshire had the highest percentage of pupils moved to EOTAS as the main provider. The Welsh Government said it was currently developing a new approach to pupil registration and school evaluation to prevent off-rolling. ""It is worrying that the number of children who do not progress from year 10 to year 11 has increased,"" said a spokesman. ""We will be consulting on draft regulations which will require each local authority to establish a database of all school-aged children, in order to identify those who are not on a school roll, EOTAS register or independent school roll and are not receiving a suitable education.""

"Overhaul exclusions to beat knife crime, say MPs","Excluded teens are ""easy pickings"" for criminal gangs, says a group of MPs and peers Better support for excluded pupils could help stem the rise in knife crime, a report from a cross-party group of MPs and peers has found. Too many excluded pupils get only a couple of hours teaching each day, says the report. There is evidence this leaves them at risk of being drawn into knife crime, it adds. Ministers warned that ""simple causal links between exclusions and knife crime cannot not be drawn"". However, research by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Knife Crime found only a third of councils were able to confirm they had space for newly excluded pupils in their pupil referral units (PRUs). And the report, Back to school? Breaking the Link between School Exclusions and Knife Crime, urges the government to ensure councils give all excluded pupils full-time, high quality education. The MPs and peers heard evidence that pupils who are not found places or are only taught part-time have more opportunity to get into trouble. ""Since they kicked me out, I've got time on my hands to... commit more crime in Croydon with my friends who have also been kicked out, who are also doing wrong things, who are also selling drugs who are also carrying knives,"" said one excluded pupil. Others said their schools had not been very good at supporting them when they were on the cusp of trouble, with zero-tolerance policies leading to exclusions for relatively minor offences. ""I would get excluded more often and sent home more often, for unnecessary reasons, like not wearing a blazer, my socks not coming up to my knees. Just silly things like that,"" said one. ""It is encouraging kids to go out and do what they want because you are not giving them an education."" Knife crime: Are school exclusions to blame? 'Poverty link' to youth violence, says London's mayor Excluded pupils sucked into knife crime The report includes official statistics, showing that in 2017-18, more than 17,500 boys aged 14 in England and Wales carried a knife or weapon, with a third of these having had weapons used against them. Separate statistics for the same year showed permanent exclusions from England's schools stood at 7,900, up 70% on 2012. By law, all pupils are entitled to full-time education, starting six days after their exclusion begins but ""too often this is not happening"", says the report. The researchers sent questionnaires to all of England's 150 local education authorities and received responses from 80% of them. Of these: about a third had no spaces in their state-funded alternative provision about a third did have space the rest either could not say or did not operate state-funded alternative provision in their area Croydon Central MP Sarah Jones, who chairs the parliamentary group, called the number of children excluded from school ""a travesty"". ""Often these children have literally nowhere to go,"" Ms Jones said. ""They are easy pickings for criminal gangs looking to exploit vulnerable children."" Javed Khan, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, added: ""Exclusions must be a last resort and alternative education provision must be full-time."" The report calls for a government review into the use of part-time education for excluded pupils and says school rankings and results should take account of all pupils, including those who have been excluded. Knife crime: Don't land responsibility on schools, says Ofsted 27,000 children 'identify as gang members' School exclusions 'fuel gang violence' The government said ministers would ""always back teachers and heads in delivering discipline in the classroom"". ""The issues surrounding knife crime and poor behaviour in schools are complicated and multi-faceted,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We are clear that permanent exclusion should only be used as a last resort and exclusion from school must not mean exclusion from education. ""Furthermore, we must be just as ambitious for young people in alternative provision as we are for those in mainstream schools, and we are taking a range of actions to drive up the quality of those settings."" The Local Government Association said the recent rise in knife crime by young people was of ""enormous concern"" and councils shared MPs' and peers' concerns. Judith Blake, chairwoman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said councils welcomed changes to Ofsted inspections to take exclusion numbers into account. ""We are also calling for councils to be given the powers and funding to hold all schools to account where there is evidence of unexplained pupil exits,"" said Ms Blake.

Post mortems to begin on 39 found dead in lorry,"This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found in the trailer container Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out on some of the 39 people found in a refrigerated lorry in Essex. Eleven of the victims were taken by ambulance from the Port of Tilbury to Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford on Thursday evening. Police, who are still questioning the lorry driver on suspicion of murder, believe the victims were Chinese. GPS data shows the container crossed back and forth between the UK and Europe in the days before it was found. The BBC understands that full details of the tracking data have been passed to Essex Police. The force has been given extra time to hold driver Mo Robinson, 25, who was arrested on Wednesday. The lorry driver has been named locally as Mo Robinson, from County Armagh Police said recovering the bodies of the 31 men and eight women would take time and the dignity of the victims was its primary concern. The Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said he had sent a team to Essex to help verify the identity of the victims. He added that their nationality was yet to be confirmed. Essex lorry deaths: What we know How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' Three properties in Northern Ireland have been raided and the National Crime Agency is working to establish if ""organised crime groups"" were involved. Police believe the tractor unit - the front part of the lorry - arrived at Holyhead in north Wales on Sunday, having travelled from Dublin. The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium at 00:30 BST on Wednesday. The lorry and trailer left the port at Purfleet shortly after 01:05 the same day and the bodies were found in the container at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays about 30 minutes later. Purfleet has been described as a ""magnet"" for illegal immigrants by locals. Janet Lilley, 61, said about a decade ago she started to notice people ""wandering around with suitcases and backpacks"". ""Over the last few years it's got worse,"" she said. ""People would come strolling out of the docks, get in the vans and that's it, they drive off."" Mrs Lilley described seeing pages of torn-up passports blowing into her garden. Lee Tubby, 45, who lives opposite the port, said he has seen people ""climbing out the top and out the back"" of lorries. This video can not be played CCTV shows the lorry arriving at the industrial park Global Trailer Rentals Ltd told RTE News,externalthat it owned the trailer and said it had been hired on 15 October. Sources say an outline of tracking data shows the container left GTR's yard in Carrickmacross in County Monaghan in Irelandthat day and crossed into Northern Ireland before returning to the Republic of Ireland. The data shows it then travelled to Dublin and crossed over to Wales overnight on 16 October, before going to Europe on the Dover to Calais route that evening. Once in Europe it appears the container travelled between cities in Belgium and France, including Dunkirk, Bruges, and Lille. Belgian authorities have said it is ""highly unlikely"" the victims got into the container at Zeebrugge. Dirk De Fauw, chairman of the port of Zeebrugge and mayor of Bruges, toldVRT News,external: ""Breaking the seal, putting 39 people in a trailer and resealing the trailer without anybody noticing is virtually impossible."" China's ambassador to the UK, Mr Liu,tweeted,external: ""The Chinese Embassy has sent a team led by the minister-counsellor in charge of consular affairs to Essex, England. ""They have met with the local police, who said that they are verifying the identity of the 39 deceased, whose nationality still cannot be confirmed."" Campaigners attend a vigil outside the Home Office The deaths follow warnings from the National Crime Agency and Border Force about the increased risk of people-smuggling using quieter ports such as Purfleet and routes through Belgium. It also emerged the Home Office was warned two years ago that Border Force had staffing problems at east coast ports including Purfleet, where the container containing the 39 Chinese nationals docked. An inspection report in July 2017 from David Bolt, The Chief Inspector for Borders and Immigration, said that although Border Force was coping, it was ""stretched"". In some instances, he said it was "" too thinly"" stretched. The chief inspector also criticised the lack of strategic management by Border Force of its relationships with the companies who own and run the ports, the BBC's Home Affairs Correspondent, Danny Shaw, reports.

"Smart motorways to be reviewed over safety fears""We know people are dying on smart motorways,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs.","Some smart motorways use the hard shoulder at all times while others use it during busy times Smart motorways are to be reviewed following concerns over driver safety, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps told MPs: ""We know people are dying on smart motorways"". He said recommendations are expected ""in a matter of weeks"" to ensure all motorways are ""as safe as they possibly can be"". Earlier this week, Highways England boss Jim O'Sullivanwarned""dynamic"" smart motorways are ""too complicated"" for drivers. Mr O'Sullivan said he did not think he would build any more dynamic smart motorways because too many motorists do not understand them. Smart motorways 'too confusing for drivers' 'Stop smart motorway rollout', say MPs Hard shoulder warning after smart motorway death How smart are smart motorways? There are two types of smart motorway in the UK: The first is where the hard shoulder is opened to traffic when it is busy, and the second is where the hard shoulder is open all the time. Theyalready account for about 400 miles of England's roads, including sections of major motorways like the M1, M6, and M62. They were created to ease congestion, using computers to monitor the roads and change speed limits. Critics have called for smart motorways to be scrapped over safety concerns and several deaths. Eight-year-old Dev Naranwas killed on the M6 last Maywhen a lorry struck his grandfather's Toyota while it was pulled up on the hard shoulder, which was in use. Dev Naran sustained a fatal head injury in the crash Speaking to MPs on the Commons Transport Select Committee, Mr Shapps said: ""I have asked my department to carry out at pace an evidence stock-take to gather the facts quickly and make recommendations."" He said his department would lead the review ""because some of the statistics have been difficult to understand, and we know people are dying on smart motorways"". He added: ""Understanding whether they are less safe, the same or safer - it turns out not to be as straightforward as members might imagine - I want all of those facts and recommendations that can be put into place to ensure that all of our motorways are as safe as they possibly can be. ""I will get this done in a matter of weeks."" Derek Jacobs, 83, was killed when his car was hit after it stopped on a smart motorway section of the M1 in Derbyshire. His death came six months after another woman was killed after a breakdown on the same section of road. Jason Mercer, 44, died on the M1 near Sheffield, where the hard shoulder is an active lane. He was involved in a minor collision but when he got out his car to exchange details he and the other driver were hit by a lorry. Both died at the scene.
