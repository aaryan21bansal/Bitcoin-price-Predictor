Six Nations: France 20-18 Wales,"Six Nations: France v Wales France (10) 20 Tries:Lamerat, ChoulyCons:Lopez 2Pens:Lopez 2 Wales (9) 18 Pens:Halfpenny 6 France snatched a dramatic and controversial Six Nations win over Wales in an extraordinary encounter. Trailing by five points with the clock ticking past 100 minutes, Damien Chouly drove over from close range and Camille Lopez's conversion clinched the win. Leigh Halfpenny had kicked six penalties - three from 50 metres-plus - to cancel Remi Lamerat's early try. But the match will live long in the memory for the 20-minute added-time barrage on the Wales line. Referee Wayne Barnes issued a yellow card to Samson Lee in the 82nd minute and had to deal with a claim of biting on Wales wing George North in the face of a tumultuous home crowd at the Stade de France. This video can not be played 'Did France cheat?' 'I wouldn't use that term' The television match official Peter Fitzgibbon could not find any clear footage so the game was allowed to continue. Barnes also allowed France to replace tight-head prop Uini Atonio with Rabah Slimani who had earlier been replaced, with the France team doctor insisting Atonio needed a head injury assessment. Was this the day rugby lost its head? Lee had returned to bring Wales back up to 15 men before Chouly claimed the decisive score after a series of penalties near the Wales line. It was a remarkable end to a difficult Six Nations campaign for Wales which sees them finish fifth and with three defeats for the first time since 2010. Leigh Halfpenny kicks for goal in Paris France moved onto 14 points and second place beforeIreland denied England a Grand Slamin Dublin to finish second behind the visitors. Rob Howley's Wales finished one place above winless Italy after securing two tournament triumphs - against Italy and Ireland - and following defeats by England and Scotland. The incredible finale followed what had been a low-key match until the 77th minute, with French indiscipline allowing the immaculate Halfpenny to wipe out an early 10-point deficit with a flawless display of place-kicking. But Wales rarely threatened the French line, and struggled throughout at the scrum. They were also hampered by injuries to second rows Alun Wyn Jones and Jake Ball, with Taulupe Faletau pressed into duty in the boiler house and replacement hooker Scott Baldwin playing in the back row. For their part, France's forward dominance eventually paid dividends with the immaculate Louis Picamoles and Kevin Gourdon carrying powerfully. And Wales flanker Sam Warburton will no doubt regret the rush of blood to the head which saw him kicking the ball long downfield after turning over possession during a France attack. The ball went from Wales' 10-metre line and over the French dead-ball line - allowing the home team to set up the bridgehead which eventually led to their winning score. France started brilliantly and were ahead within seven minutes when Lopez chipped the ball over the onrushing defence for Lamerat to beat his team-mate Gael Fickou to the ball and touch down. Lopez increased the lead to 10 points before referee Barnes intervened to send Virimi Vakatawa to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock on. Halfpenny's angled penalty calmed Wales nerves and by half-time the full-back had struck twice more - one from more than 50 metres - and the French were left wondering how their dominance had resulted in just a one-point interval lead. Dan Biggar closes in on Gael Fikou in Paris After the break Halfpenny drilled two long-range kicks to give Wales a five point lead, which he then restored after Lopez kicked one of his own. But that was before arguably the most thrilling, nerve-shredding, energy-sapping finish in the tournament's history.

Is North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un rational?,"Is Kim Jong-un rational? The new US ambassador to the United Nations thinks he is not. Nikki Haley said after North Korea's simultaneous launch of four ballistic missiles: ""This is not a rational person."" But is she right? Kim Jong-un may have many flaws. He is without doubt ruthless - the bereaved relatives of the victims of his regime, including within his own family, would testify to that.  He may have driven through an economic policy that keeps his people living at a standard way below that in South Korea and, increasingly, China. And he seems to have personal issues, such as eating a lot - photographs show his bulging girth - and being a fairly heavy smoker. But whatever these failings and foibles, is he actually irrational - which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as ""not logical or reasonable, not endowed with the power of reason""? Scholars who study him think he is behaving very rationally, even with the purging and terrorising of those around him. Prof Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul told the BBC: ""He is perfectly rational. He sometimes overdoes it. He sometimes tends to apply excessive force. Why kill hundreds of generals when dozens will do? Kim Jong-nam, Kim-Jong-un's half-brother, was killed while in Malaysia in February 2017 ""Most people he kills would never join a conspiracy but he feels it's better to overdo it. It's better to kill nine loyal generals and one potential conspirator than to allow a conspirator to stay alive. ""But he is rational."" Prof John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul said that even having his half-brother killed (as the allegation is - denied by Pyongyang) would be a rational act; not nice but rational. ""A sad fact of history is that young kings often kill their uncles and elder brothers. It may be cruel, but it is not 'irrational'. If you don't take my word for it, read Shakespeare."" Kim Jong-nam death: Interpol 'red notice' for North Koreans How do you solve a problem like North Korea? North Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? North Korea country profile On this assassination of Kim Jong-nam, allegedly at the hands of agents of the regime, Prof Lankov says it is similar to the Ottoman Empire, where concubines of the Sultan had countless children, any of whom had a bloodline that might one day legitimise a claim to the throne. Prof Lankov thinks that Kim Jong-nam was, accordingly, a threat, probably not that great a one but still intolerable: ""Probably he was not that dangerous but you never know. He was definitely under Chinese control."" Prof Delury said that there was nothing irrational about Kim Jong-un's drive to obtain credible nuclear weapons: ""He has no reliable allies to guarantee his safety, and he faces a hostile superpower that has, in recent memory, invaded sovereign states around the world and overthrown their governments. ""The lesson North Koreans learned from the invasion of Iraq was that if Saddam Hussein really possessed those weapons of mass destruction, he might have survived."" Could Kim Jong-un's drive to achieve a nuclear capability safeguard his regime's future? This was compounded by the lesson of Libya, according to Prof Lankov: ""Did American promises of American prosperity help Gaddafi and his family? Kim Jong-un knows perfectly well what happened to the only fool who believed Western promises and renounced the development of nuclear weapons. And he's not going to make that mistake. Once you don't have nuclear weapons you are completely unprotected. ""Did Russian or American and British promises to guarantee Ukrainian integrity help Ukraine? No. Why should he expect American, Russian or Chinese promises to help him stay alive? He is rational."" If he is rational, what does he want? On this, scholars are divided. Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan in South Korea said that Kim Jong-un wants security but also a united Korea as the only way he and the regime can survive in the long term. ""As every North Korean knows, the whole point of the military-first policy is 'final victory', or the unification of the peninsula under North Korean rule."" A credible nuclear force would give him the ability to pressure the United States to remove its troops from the peninsula. ""North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted,"" said Prof Myers. Some analysts believe North Korea's strategy aims to see the US withdraw from South Korea And once the US troops had gone, on this argument, North Korean rule would be unstoppable. Prof Lankov doesn't agree with the emphasis. He thinks survival is by far the most important motive behind Kim Jong-un's actions: ""Above all, he wants to stay alive. Second, economic prosperity and growth - but it's a distant second."" So what's to be done? Prof Lankov sees no good options: ""I don't see any solution right now."" He thinks the best option is to persuade North Korea to freeze its development of nuclear weapons at a particular size of arsenal ""but it will be very difficult and North Koreans may not keep their promises"". And money would have to be paid. ""But this deal isn't good from an American point of view because it means paying a reward to a blackmailer, and if you pay a reward to a blackmailer once, you invite more blackmail. ""The second option which might work is a military operation but that is likely to trigger a second Korean war and will permanently damage American credibility as a reliable ally and protector. ""Worldwide, a lot of people would see that it's better to have enemies than such friends."" Five years of Kim Jong-un.

The most fashionable Englishwoman in Paris,"Mary Clarke Mohl by Hilary Bonham Carter It was the place to be in 19th Century Paris - the city's most successful political and literary salon, where the great and good of French society would gather. And it was run by a remarkable Englishwoman. For 250 years Paris was renowned for its literary and political salons, and for the fashionable women - thesalonnieres- who guided discussion among the eminent figures of the age. In much of the 19th Century, one of the most influential of the salons was held at 120 Rue du Bac in the Saint-Germain district. Here gathered writers and thinkers like Victor Hugo and Alexis de Toqueville, politicians like the Adolphe Thiers, the future president, painters like Eugene Delacroix,  historians, orientalists, economists. And presiding over them all was an Englishwoman. Clarkey was her nickname. Madame de Mohl became her formal title. Mary Clarke was how she was born in 1793 in London. Over the next 90 years, Mary Clarke Mohl lived an extraordinary life at the crossroads of French and British culture and society. Nearly all of it was spent in Paris, where she saw three revolutions and was on friendly terms with so many of the great names of the day. But she never lost her attachment to Britain and in the Rue du Bac she offered a home-from-home to William Thackeray and Elizabeth Gaskell, the Brownings and the Trollopes, as well as to many aristocrats, diplomats and politicians. She was also one of Florence Nightingale's closest friends and provided vital encouragement to launch her career in nursing. Sketch of Mary Clarke Mohl by Hilary Bonham Carter (copyright Hampshire Archives) Much of what we know of Clarkey comes from other people's memoirs in English and French. But she also wrote hundreds of letters, many to her husband, the German orientalist Julius Mohl, and these were collected and published after her death. She had an unusual start in life, one which goes a long way to explaining the unconventional course it was subsequently to take. At the age of eight she left for France in the sole company of her mother and grandmother, and apart from annual trips she never lived in England again. Both her guardians were strong and independent-minded women. Her Scottish grandmother had hobnobbed with thinkers like David Hume and Adam Smith in Edinburgh and before the French Revolution lived in Dunkirk. Mary's mother Elizabeth was a progressive free thinker. Later, when they lived through the July 1830 uprising in Paris, Mary remembered scrambling through the barricades to get back home. ""Mama said: 'Tell me the news, for Heaven's sake - I have been quaking in my shoes.' I said, 'But I told you I would take care.' 'Oh,' she said, 'It was not you I was worried about; it was the common people!'"" Living in Paris under the restored Bourbon monarchy after 1815, Mary Clarke came to know Juliette Recamier, who was the greatsalonniereof the time (we know her through her famous painting by Jacques-Louis David). Through her, she met literary greats such as Stendhal, Hugo, Prosper Merimee and Chateaubriand. Chateaubriand - author of Memoirs from Beyond the Grave - was by now a grumpy old man,  but he cheered up when entertained by ""la jeune anglaise"". Portrait of Madame Recamier by Jacques-Louis David But by 1838, Recamier's rule was coming to an end. So Clarke - still with her mother - moved into the third floor apartment at 120 Rue du Bac (above Chateaubriand) and set about the task of becoming her successor. Seen from the distance of 150 years, Clarkey comes across as the most splendidly original and sympathetic of characters. Appearance was a clue to her very British eccentricity. She was small with a turned-up button nose and a mass of frizzy curls. The future prime minister Francois Guizot used to say that ""Madame Mohl and my little Scotch terrier have the same coiffeur"". In a description given by Henry James, ""Mme Mohl used to drop out of an omnibus, often into a mud-puddle, at our door,  and delight us with her originality and freshness. I can see her now, just arrived, her feet on the fender before the fire, her hair flying, and her general untidiness so marked as to be picturesque."" Her at-homes were on Friday evenings and Wednesday afternoons. Guests were welcomed into two adjoining drawing-rooms filled with sofas and arm-chairs, with two windows looking out over gardens that belonged to the Catholic Church's Foreign Missions, as they still do today. The rules were simple. According to Kathleen O'Meara, a contemporary memoirist and Paris correspondent for The Tablet: ""You were expected to contribute to the general fund either by talking or listening, but you must not be bored. Sketch of Mary Clarke Mohl's salon by Hilary Bonham Carter ""You were not allowed to sit staring at the company through an eyeglass; anyone who offended in this way was pounced upon at onceâ¦ Another unpardonable offence was making tete-a-tetes in corners or chatting about the room in duets or trios when conversation, real conversation was going on."" No opinions were barred - save, from 1850 to 1870, any mention of support for the emperor Napoleon III. Madame Mohl abhorred the man, referring to him contemptuously as ""celui-ci"" (this one) with a thumb jabbed back over her shoulder. She far preferred the bourgeois domesticity of the previous King Louis-Philippe, who was ousted in 1848. Mary Clarke Mohl saw herself as standing in a long line of great French women, starting with Madame de Rambouillet in the early 17th Century, who had wielded their intellect and charm in the service of culture, politics and reason. Often she drew comparisons with the fate of women in the UK, who she felt sorely lacked the freedom offered in France. In a letter written in 1862 she laments how in England, ""The men talk together; the lady of the house may be addressed once in a way as duty, but the men had all rather talk together and she is pretty muteâ¦ They have no notion that a lady's conversation is better than a man's."" Her own conversation - according to the memoirist Mary Simpson - was ""spontaneous, full of fun, information and grace of expression. She spoke French and English with the fluency and accent of a native, yet with the care and originality of a foreigner. And when there was no word in either language to fit her thoughts, she would coin one for the occasion"". She could also be alarmingly rude - especially about women who she thought were failing to exercise their brains correctly. According to O'Meara: ""It was a source of genuine astonishment to her that women were so addicted to idle gossip. 'Why don't they use their brains?', she would ask angrily."" Indeed, as a young girl Clarkey had been told by her grandmother that she was ""as impudent as a highwayman's horse"" - apparently a reference to the way highwaymen's horses would stick their heads into carriages as the hapless victims surrendered their purses. Paris circa 1860 Though to call her feminist would be inaccurate, she was one of a generation that laid the ground for the changes that followed in women's lives. From their letters, we know that she was a rock-like figure for Florence Nightingale, persuading her to stick with her vocation despite the horrified opposition of Florence's family. On her way to Crimea in 1854, Florence came via Paris where Mohl helped with her arrangements. Clarkey lived so long she spanned the ages. Born in the aftermath of Revolution, she died almost in the modern era. As a young woman she had been in love with the handsome historian Claude Fauriel, but that came to nothing, so in 1847 she married the charmingly donnish Julius Mohl, who was seven years her junior. Anthony Trollope's brother Thomas described Monsieur Mohl as so absolutely surrounded by books ""built up into walls around him, as to suggest almost inevitably the idea of a mouse in a cheese, eating out the hollow it lives in"". But the couple were devoted to each other, and when he died in 1876 Mary was said to be like ""a lost dog going about searching for its master"". Seven years later, Clarkey herself died and was buried next to him in the Pere Lachaise cemetery. Julius and Mary Clarke Mohl's grave ""Where she entered, dullness and ennui fled,"" said another memoirist, Grace Anne Prestwich, in an article written after her death. Conversation, said Madame Mohl,  was not the same as talk. The English talked, but the French knew that conversation was ""the mingling of mind and mind (and) the most complete exercise of the social faculty"". ""Society is a necessity to me,"" she said on another occasion. ""We all depend dreadfully on each other. We live in a world of looking-glasses, and it is the mind - not the face - which is given back to us by the reflexions."" Mary Clarke Mohl mixed English and French customs in a way that few have done before or since. She was entertaining, provocative, unpretentious, rude, generous and loving. She saw no reason why women could not hold their intellectual own. The salon tradition died out around the end of the 19th Century. Clarkey was a fitting and original last champion.

The bank boss who reached the top aged 33,"Joe Gordon likes to climb mountains. Among his conquests is Mount Teide, a 12,000ft volcano in Tenerife. ""I like to walk up hills and mountains,"" he says. ""I am a big fan of a healthy body and a healthy mind."" It is perhaps just as well that he has a head for heights. Because, just 24 months after getting his first job in banking, he is now the boss of telephone and online bank First Direct. At the age of 33 he is one of the youngest people ever to have made it to the top of the UK banking industry. It is Joe himself who greets us at the reception of First Direct's steely grey office block in Leeds. Despite having 2,900 employees in the building, he speaks to both the receptionist and a server in the cafe by name. This weekend marks the end of his first month in the job, which he got two years after joining First Direct's parent company, HSBC. While he admits he hasn't been in banking very long, he does have plenty of experience of handling customers. ""I've worked in customer service since day one. Ultimately what we're trying to achieve is great customer service. So if somebody comes in who can deliver customer service, I think that's a bit of credibility for me."" But in an era when 90% of his customers bank on the internet, personal contact has become harder. It was all so different when First Direct launched in 1989 as the UK's first telephone bank, pioneering banks without branches. Born: Leeds Age: 33 Status: Father-to-be Education: Degree in Business Management from Lancaster University Previous jobs: Sainsbury's management trainee, BT fast-track scheme Joe's formative experience was in the grocery section of Sainsbury's, where he worked as a graduate trainee. ""You step in there with bravado, and the first thing they said to me was: 'You're on the carrots, mate,' which was a great grounding. ""Some well-to-do women educated me on the difference between chicory and endive. That's where I first got involved in customer service. And that's where I first started to think: how do you improve things, how do you make it better for people?"" But the boss of a bank also needs to be good with numbers. So a later stint in the forecasting department, where he had to predict how many Easter eggs the supermarket would sell, probably helped. Lawrence Christensen, a Sainsbury's director at the time, remembers him well. ""He's very good at IT, and a very quick learner. But his ability to integrate into a team, build a team and run a team would be his greatest strength."" Joe went on to work for BT, on its fast-track programme, where he visited call centres in India no fewer than 22 times. Top of Joe's to-do list is keeping pace with technology. First Direct customers can already use a voice recognition system to log in to their accounts, or a fingerprint system on the app. ""I like fingerprint and voice ID, because it speaks to technology solving problems,"" he says. ""There is a problem with passwords - and if you forget your password, your memorable word, and your inside leg measurement when you were five. But actually technology can solve that."" To make sure it keeps up-to-date, the bank is now studying possible applications for artificial intelligence. However, there are other issues on the horizon that are harder to foresee. Last summer the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) heralded the era of so-called open banking. This will allow third-party providers - with our consent - to access our banking details, and recommend where we should go for the cheapest loan, the best mortgage or the highest savings rates. When it starts to take effect from 2019, it could turn the banking industry upside down. But Joe believes it is a positive development. ""This, for us, is a massive opportunity, and an opportunity we will relish."" However, the future of banking still has many unknowns. ""In a world where the biggest taxi firm doesn't own any cars, where the biggest accommodation provider doesn't have any real estate, and where the biggest news website doesn't own any content - we want to play a part in shaping what banking will look like in that world. ""Can you paint a wildly dystopian future? Yes, but you can also paint a reality where we've got a very real part to play."" First Direct already faces serious competition. Back when it started, it was the lean kid on the block, without the expense of branches to maintain. But put against the new internet-only banks such as Atom, Tandem and Starling, which employ a handful of people, its wages bill is considerable. Other challenger banks are also in attack mode. In 28 years, First Direct has acquired 1.35 million customers. Yet after just seven years, Metro Bank has already acquired 915,000. ""Anywhere where disruptors, or fintech, or challenger banks will come in is where they see gaps,"" says Joe. ""It's for us to make sure we don't leave those gaps."" In the meantime his personal life is also going to be busy. He and his partner have a baby on the way. And he is planning more expeditions. ""I would like to do Kilimanjaro,"" he says, adding after a pause, ""or maybe next year."" With so many mountains in Joe Gordon's future, he will certainly need his penchant for altitude. first direct Firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing multiple LA wildfires Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

'What I learned from Paul McCartney',"The singer started learning violin as a child, but decided to become a singer-songwriter Beware of Frances: She's on a one-woman mission to force all the water in your body out through your tear ducts. Nominated for the Brits critics' choice award and the BBC Sound of 2016, the singer has a knack for achingly beautiful ballads that tug at the heartstrings. Songs like Let It Out and Say It Again have earned her more than 50 million streams on Spotify - and top 10 singles around the world (although not at home, thanks to the current state of the UK singles chart). Born Sophie Frances Cooke in Berkshire, she was an aspiring violinist when her teacher sent her to see a film composer for career advice. On a whim, she played him a pop song she'd written for fun - and moved him to tears. ""It was a bit awkward,"" she recalls. ""I was like, 'Are you ok?' and he said, 'Yeah. But you need to do that. You have to do that for the rest of your life."" She took his advice - choosing to attend the pop-focussed Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts instead of her original choice, the Birmingham Conservatoire. By the time she reached her third year of studies, she'd already been signed by a record label and moved to London. Her debut album, Things I've Never Said, comes out this week. A warm and wistful collection of perfectly-crafted piano pop, it has already won the singer comparisons to Adele and Carole King. Meanwhile, her single Grow has been selected to soundtrack a new campaign by Refuge, the charity supporting female victims of domestic violence. The 23-year-old sat down to tell the BBC about that video; the perks of fame; and what it's like to get school lessons from Paul McCartney. This video can not be played Frances plays the BBC Introducing Stage at Glastonbury 2016 Hello Frances... Or should I call you Sophie? I'm Sophie to my family and friends - but I once thought, ""If I'm going to be an artist, my name's got to look good on a piece of paper"". Sophie is very curly, it looks very young, whereas Frances is a lot more angular. So it just kind of stuck. But then up until the age of 16, everyone called me Cookie. So anything goes. It's been three years since your first single - you must be relieved the album is finally out? I'm so excited. It's definitely been a while. I wrote some of these songs when I was 18 or 19, and so they've literally been with me for five years. It's unusual for people to stay fond of the songs they wrote in their teens. Actually, at the time, I didn't think much of them! But they made it through all the label cuts and slashes. They stood the test of time. What are the oldest ones on there? I wroteDrifting,externalandSublime,externalin my room at LIPA - the performing arts school up in Liverpool. That's the one that Paul McCartney founded, right? Did he ever show up? A couple of times. He'd come in to do little Q&As. He was really nice, if you saw him walking past, you could just say ""hi"" and he was always really sweet. What's the best advice you got from him? He said that when he and John [Lennon] were writing, they didn't have anything to record what they were doingâ¦ Whereas now, if I'm writing in a session, I've got my phone there recording everything. And so if I forget something I can go back and find it. But he said, ""We didn't have that luxury. So if we forgot something, it wasn't good enough and we didn't use it."" I was like, ""Oh my God, that's so true."" Because if you've written something and 10 minutes later you don't remember it, then it's not good enough. Do you stick to that advice even now? No, because my memory's terrible! This video can not be played Watch an excerpt for Frances' video for Grow One of the first songs you released was Grow... and that's now being used in a very powerful video for Refuge. It's amazing. It's about a woman called Melanie Clark, who had a terrible time, a really abusive partner, and she managed to get out of it by seeking help from Refuge. They've animated her story. It's basically about her feeling invisible until one woman, who represents Refuge, notices her for the first time. It's a campaign to encourage victims of domestic abuse to seek help. We want people to realise they are not alone. The original song isn't about domestic abuse at all. Were you surprised by how well the words and the images complement each other? It's weird how the lyrics make so much sense alongside the story. I just hope it will resonate with people all over the world. It's an amazing animation and everyone's done it for free. The singer has collaborated with Disclosure and Spice Girls writer Biff Stannard - but is keeping those songs for a later record Would it be fair to say you've always wanted to play music? Absolutely. My best friend's parents were professional violinists. When I was about eight, I went round to her house, picked one up and fell in love with it. Then her dad taught me all the way up 'til I was about 16 or 17. What grade did you get? Eight. I absolutely loved it. What was your exam piece? I did a kind of a gypsy piece calledCsardas,external. It's so fast - and it speeds up towards the end, as well. And then I started the piano when I was 10  - but I only got to grade six.  I couldn't be bothered to do scales any more. Do you remember your first stage performance? I was three, dressed as an ice cream in a production of The Hungry Caterpillar at the Royal Festival Hall! And then throughout school, I was always on stage, playing violin or piano. And I played in the Berkshire Youth Orchestra. This video can not be played Frances performs Grow at the BBC Introducing SXSW showcase in 2016. You sound like a high achiever. Were you good academically, too? I was quite lucky at school. I had this little charm - I could not do my homework and somehow get away with it. Everyone knew I worked so hard at music. I was doing stuff after school every day, so the teachers were quite lenient. And then you went to LIPA... Actually, I didn't get in the first time. They put me on their foundation course, which cost like 10 grand or something. My parents, bless them, scrambled together every penny we had and I worked at Waitrose trying to get money to go. How did you get signed? I put a song calledComing Up For Air,externalon SoundCloud in early 2014. It was quite calculated - because at the time London Grammar were really big, so I thought, ""OK, I'm going to write something like that, so all the blogs listen and pick up on it"". Eventually, a few started writing about it and then Tom Robinson from 6 Music played it which was really cool. After that, we ended up having a meeting with [boutique record label] KitsunÃ©, and released a single. Don't Worry About Me was a big breakthrough for you. How did that come about? One of my friends was quite ill - and I wrote the song to say, ""look after yourself and I'll be here for you"". I wrote it really quickly. I was just getting off the bus on Kilburn High Road when I came up with the phrase, ""I'll feel the fear for you, I'll cry the tears for you, don't worry about me."" I ran home thinking, ""I need to get to a piano quickly, I don't want to lose this."" It's a very emotional performance. I think because I wrote it so quickly. I was thinking about my friend and the lyrics just came out. The star has been compared to Adele and Carole King Don't Worry About Me has been played nine million times on Spotify. How do you wrap your head around that? I don't really. I always said that if I won the lottery, I'd be more excited by Â£100,000 than I would with Â£1m because I can't understand a million pounds. I've never seen that. I can't quantify it. Whereas a hundred grand, I can think, ""ah, that's a really nice car"". It's a weird period for music at the momentâ¦ You can have all those plays, and millions of people know your song, but it hasn't troubled the charts in the UK. It's a really weird time. In Belgium, Don't Worry About Me was in the top 20 for 10 weeks and that's mainly because in Belgium the singer-songwriter world is their Radio 1. In Australia, it hung around the chart for ages. In the UK, I've just come out at a really funny time. There's a weird limbo. But I'm so proud of my album. I know it's not going to sell 20 million copies but that's OK. I want to be an artist that's going to be around for 20 or 30 years. In a strange way, you're famous to the people who know you and nobody else. It's actually lovely because I can walk down the street and not be bothered. Apart from in John Lewis once, where the manager recognised me while I was buying a sofa. He was like, ""Excuse me, can I ask you a question?"" and I thought, ""Oh no, my card's been rejected"" but he was like, ""Can I get a picture with you?"" And I think he paid for my sofa because I took out finance and I haven't paid a penny yet. That's a proper celebrity discount! Totally. 100% off!

'The language more beautiful than words',"This week is sign language week in the UK. As debate continues about whether British Sign Language should be taught in schools, See Hear series producer William Mager reflects on what signing means to him. I'm not a native sign language user. I didn't grow up signing from an early age and I didn't have any deaf friends as a kid. I went to a mainstream school where I was the only deaf child in class but I could get by with speaking and lip-reading. But if a deaf person had met me 20 years ago, they would have been shocked at my inability to communicate with them. Learning sign language changed all that and brought many benefits to my life. In my early 20s, I took my first tentative steps into the deaf world in London. Deaf people would gather at pubs in train stations every month to chat away in sign language, knock one another's pints over and terrify the bar staff caught unawares by a sudden invasion of a seemingly alien race who communicated mostly through their hands. William hopes his son Barnaby, who is hearing, will be proud of using sign language I would go to these gatherings and try to communicate. I could use some basic gestures and spoke clearly so people could lip-read, but I wasn't a signer in any way, shape or form and I think they often just humoured me. Then one Friday evening, at one of these nights in a pub in Victoria, I saw a beautiful blonde girl chatting to a friend in sign language. I nudged him and asked who she was. He looked at her, then back at me, and shook his head. ""No chance."" But I persevered and at the third time of asking we struck up a conversation and one thing led to another. But communication was difficult. She couldn't lip-read me, and although she spoke, she also liked to sign. We spent long evenings together, her teaching me the finger-spelling alphabet, the basic signs for what, how, where, why and when and how to use facial expressions with signs. As our communication improved, so did our relationship. But I still wasn't a perfect signer. Pupils at Blanche Nevile and Highgate Primary School learn BSL together Soon after, a job came up which involved making deaf information videos for the British Deaf Association. The interview was a shambles - I sat opposite two interviewers, one deaf, one hearing, and an interpreter. The deaf interviewer would sign his questions to me and make eye contact. I replied in speech. The interpreter would start to translate my answers into sign language, and the deaf man looked away from me to the interpreter. Every time he broke eye contact with me I stopped talking. It was a long and painful interview - but I got the job. On my first day, he took me upstairs to my desk and pointed to my computer, then to my phone. I shook my head in bewilderment. He had assumed that because I didn't sign I had enough hearing to use the phone. A few days later, he signed me up for level one sign language classes.

Don't forget to subscribe to theweekly podcastand for more disability news, follow BBC Ouch onTwitter,externalandFacebook,external. I was the only deaf person in the class and the look on the deaf teacher's face when I walked in was a picture - he was used to teaching basic sign language to relatives or colleagues of deaf people, so he must have wondered what was going on. As we painstakingly finger-spelled our names to one another, I felt like an idiot. But I learned about storytelling, grammar, signs for the weather, how to hold a basic conversation and, finally, things clicked. Sign language will never be my first language, but I'm so glad I have access to it. I can watch the videos that people post on social media and I can use it to speak to hundreds of people in a crowded room. I have only one regret - that I came to sign language relatively late in life. Looking back at my childhood, interpreters would have been hugely helpful in the classroom and for socialising with other deaf people. To be able to fingerspell would have helped me with the more complicated words in geography lectures. William met his wife, Kathy, while learning sign language There is no downside to learning sign language, whether you're deaf or hearing. It enriches your life and makes you a better communicator. It has a beauty and grace that cannot be put into words. It was too late for me, but maybe it's not too late for other deaf children who are just starting out in school, surrounded by hearing children. That cute blonde that I saw in the pub 15 years ago is now my wife, and we have a beautiful boy, who is hearing. But I'd love sign language to be taught in his school.

Chuck Berry: The man who helped lay rock music's foundations,"Chuck Berry's trademark four-bar guitar introduction and quickfire lyrics reflected the rebelliousness of the youth of the 1950s. He was one of that exclusive group who took rhythm and blues from its black roots and ""crossed over"" to make it part of most teenagers' lifestyle. He influenced generations of succeeding rock stars, most notably the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys. Yet he faced major financial difficulties through mismanagement and had frequent brushes with the law. Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born into a middle-class family in St Louis, Missouri, on 18 October 1926. As a teenager he began playing concerts in his local high school but his education was curtailed after he was convicted of armed robbery and spent three years in a reformatory for young offenders. He had one of the first rock and roll hits On his release he made a living as a hairdresser, playing in a trio in the evenings with Ebby Harding on drums and Johnnie Johnson on piano. Johnson would remain with Berry throughout his career He was influenced by blues heroes such as Muddy Waters and T-Bone Walker, as well as white country and western music, though his singing style owed much to the clarity of Nat King Cole. ""My music is simple stuff,"" he once said. ""Anyone can sit down, look at a set of symbols and produce sounds the music represents."" His recording career began in 1955 with the legendary Chess label in Chicago, where his first release Maybellene became one of rock and roll's first hits. In the next few years, he scored a succession of hits, all aimed at an adolescent audience, including Roll Over Beethoven, Sweet Little Sixteen, Carol and the classic Johnny B. Goode. His music transcended the colour bar that plagued many contemporary black artists as affluent white teenagers in Eisenhower's America reached out for something new. ""I play the songs they want to hear,"" he said. ""That makes them feel they're getting what they came for."" The so-called duck walk became a trademark He appeared in several rock films including Rock, Rock, Rock and Mr Rock and Roll, both from 1957; Go Johnny Go from 1959; and Jazz on a Summer's Day in 1960. In 1962 he was charged with transporting a minor across state lines for immoral purposes. The girl in question was a 14-year-old from Texas who he claimed he had brought to Missouri to check hats at his St Louis nightclub. After he fired her, she complained to the police. In court, the judge's summing-up was blatantly racist and the trial was eventually declared null and void. His conviction at a second trial and the resulting two-year sentence left him embittered. His release coincided with the rhythm and blues revival in Britain. With his material being covered by bands like The Beatles and the Rolling Stones, his work was discovered by a new generation. ""If you tried to give rock and roll another name,"" John Lennon famously said, ""you might call it Chuck Berry."" On stage with Keith Richards at a 60th birthday tribute Successful tours followed. He scored a few more hits with No Particular Place to Go and Memphis, Tennessee. His biggest hit came later in Britain with the atypical 1972 novelty record, My Ding-a-Ling, replete with double entendres. When he wasn't churning out the hits, Chuck Berry was thrilling audiences with his live performances. His trademark became his duck walk, a crouching movement across the stage made during his guitar solos. Offstage, he could be a prickly character, exemplified in the 1987 film Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll which featured a tour with a backing band organised by devotee Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. In the same year, he published an explicit autobiography genuinely penned by himself. Berry's attitude to money was notorious. He demanded cash upfront for many of his concerts and in 1979, he served a 100-day jail term for tax evasion. There were further brushes with the law. In 1988 he settled a lawsuit from a woman he allegedly punched in the face. Two years later he was sued by a group of women after it was discovered that a hidden camera had been placed in the toilets of his restaurant in Missouri. Still on the road at the age of 87 He also received a suspended jail sentence for marijuana possession. Despite the advancing years, he continued playing one-night concerts and embarked on a European tour in 2008 at the age of 82. In January 1986, Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with a citation that summed up his contribution to popular music. ""While no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll, Chuck Berry comes the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together."" Berry himself had a simple explanation for his success. ""It amazes me when I hear people say, 'I want to go out and find out who I am.'  I always knew who I was. I was going to be famous if it killed me.""

FT: Motherwell 1-2 St Johnstone Motherwell boss Stephen Robinson: ""There
is a lot of positivity still in the dressing room. We were the better team
against a team that is pushing into the top four. ""We
created numerous opportunities and one penalty that was incredible that it
wasn't given, on Chris Cadden. It was a stonewall penalty. There was another debatable on on Scott
McDondald, which could have gone either way. ""Their
commitment to play for the shirt is not in question but we have to deal with crosses, because if you don't you're
going to lose football matches."" FT: Motherwell 1-2 St Johnstone St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""It's a
massive three points for us because it almost guarantees top six. The
performance at times could have been better, but defensively we were strong. ""We'll look to hold onto fourth place now.Two months ago you'd
probably have said it wouldn't happen but it has because we have little spells
when we don't win games but we get over that very quickly and get back to winning
games again, which has enabled us to catch Hearts. We're two points ahead, but
I'd be a lot of happier if that was after 38 games."" FT: Inverness CT 1-1 Ross County Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""Billy Mckay's hit the crossbar. Carl Tremarco had a
great chance. We dominated half an hour of the second half. ""When County scored it feels like a defeat but flip that
around. We're a point better off than we were before the game. ""It's a very, very good performance but disappointing not to
get the three points. ""There's still nine games and a lot of points up for

unfortunate not to. ""The second half gives us huge confidence. If we play like
that, we'll win most games."" @bbcsportscot & facebook.com/bbcsportscotland Graeme Wright:Build up for a half decent attempt at next season. Small steps. Still no cash remember.Â Tommy Rae Jr:Great first steps.

Â Marc Sala:Too early to say.  Runaway leaders Celtic visit Dundee tomorrow then we have a break for internationals, with Scotland taking on Canada and Slovenia. Aberdeen's win today means Celtic cannot clinch the title at Dens Park. The champagne will need to stay on ice for now. That late equaliser for Ross County in the Highland derby keeps them just out of range of bottom club Hamilton, with four points covering the bottom four in the Premiership. Accies look in trouble after conceding eight goals in their last two outings but the dogfight is likely to go right to the wire. Do Hibs want to win the Championship? Neil Lennon's men had the chance to open up a nine-point gap but struggled at home to Dumbarton and were given a helping hand with both of their goals in a 2-2 draw, an own goal and a goalkeeping blunder. Hibs also missed a penalty. Falkirk and Morton kick off in 10 minutes time and Hibs' slip will have both sides fired up. You can watch the action from the Falkirk Stadium on BBC Alba and via the BBC Sport website.

Pedro Caixinha could scarcely have asked for a more satisfactory result in his first match as Rangers manager. Goals from Emerson Hyndman, Clint Hill, Martyn Waghorn and Lee Wallace secured the Ibrox side all three points. Hamilton drop to the bottom of the table on goal difference. Waghorn scored his fifth goal in four games against Hamilton this season Inverness Caledonian Thistle 1-1 Ross County County are down to 10 men with defender Andrew Davies having been left groggy by a head knock and substitute Ryan Dow threatens to give them a late winner with a clever flick, but it drifts wide of the far post. Saints are up to fourth thanks to a Liam Craig double, with the midfielder profiting from some slipshod defending on both occasions. Motherwell wasted several good chances. Really good chances... Killie left it late to level what was an entertaining game, a third draw between the sides this season. Thistle keeper Tomas Cerny will not want to see Conor Sammon's equaliser again. One for the howler category... Motherwell 1-2 St Johnstone How has that stayed out?! Scott McDonald's cross is flicked on by Ryan Bowman, it looks for all the world to be on its way in, but catches the inside of the post and rolls agonizingly along the goal-line. It's just not happening for the Steelmen. Inverness CT 1-1 Ross County Martin DowdenBBC Sport Scotland at the Caledonian Stadium Alex Schalk has scored a few important goals in his Ross
County career but I'd wager Jim McInytre will value this one the most. They were in deep trouble until that moment and for all
the positivity Inverness CT might take form this, it'll feel like a defeat. Conor Sammon, 87 mins It's a horror moment for Partick Thistle goalkeeper Tomas Cerny, who lets an innocuous shot from Conor Sammon slip through his legs and into the net. Motherwell 1-2 St Johnstone Louis Moult flashes a header wide from the back post as Motherwell search for an equaliser. The striker really should have done better. Â© 2025 BBC.

Marine Le Pen and the struggle to be France's president," Marine Le Pen's political awakening came at the age of eight, when she survived a bombing at her family's Paris home. Five kilograms of dynamite had been placed on the landing outside the apartment at 9 Villa Poirier.  The explosion ripped open the entire front of the building.  A baby in the next-door flat fell five floors and was saved by the branches of a tree. In her autobiography, the woman who took over the leadership of France's National Front (FN) from her father describes the chaos, the smoke and debris. She and her two sisters “were on our knees shivering, holding hands, praying with the fervour of despair… when we heard the voice of our father shouting, 'Girls, girls, are you alive?'” Bomb damage at Villa Poirier,Paris, 1976(Getty Images) The mystery of who tried to kill Jean-Marie Le Pen and his family on the night of 1 November 1976 is still unsolved. At the time the FN was just four years old, a fringe party of the far right including some on the anti-Semitic extreme. For Marine Le Pen the attack changed everything.  The family home was destroyed.  She lost school-friends, whose parents were too scared now to let them near her “dangerous” father. Jean-Marie Le Pen with daughters Yann and Marine, early 1970s(Getty Images) More profoundly she came to understand that she and her family were different - they would never be treated as normal people.  Instead of sympathy, there was hostility. Acordon sanitairewas created around us - don't go near the Le Pens.” Today Marine Le Pen is often described as having a hard exterior. “After everything she went through in her youth, she built herself a shell,” says her friend and senior FN colleague Steeve Briois. Pejorative adjectives likecassant(brittle) andclivant(divisive) are commonly applied. But at heart there is that emotional toughness, a determined self-reliance whose origins surely lie in the difficult psychological conditions of her childhood. Without that toughness, she could not have pushed the FN to its current unprecedented heights. She has battled successfully through the first round of France's presidential election and will now face centrist Emmanuel Macron in the final run-off on 7 May. And without that toughness she could certainly not have achieved the act that made that success possible - the symbolic “killing” of her father. On a Friday evening in France's rural east, Marine Le Pen has taken her election campaign to a community hall in the small town of Clairvaux-les-Lacs. Before a mainly working-class, mainly middle-aged audience of 300, she develops the themes at the heart of her party's 144-point manifesto - from prioritising jobs for French nationals to “automatic” expulsion of undocumented immigrants. FN supporters gather to hear Marine Le PenClairvaux-les-Lacs, France, February 2017(Getty Images) Marine Le Pen talks with practised confidence. In a previous life she was a lawyer who defended in the Paris courts the sort of immigrants she now wants expelled. This is her sixth year as leader of a party traditionally seen as far-right. It is also her second tilt at the presidency - she won third place with nearly 18% in 2012. That bettered anything her father achieved, even in 2002, when he came second to Jacques Chirac on an anti-immigrant, law-and-order platform. Even more is expected of her now. Watching Marine in action, you can understand the appeal. There is a hint of the “everywoman” about her. People like the lived-in, authentic persona, the sense she gives of combining hard work with the aura of someone who knows how to have a good time. A political player in France for years, her message - anti-immigration, anti-EU - is consistent and unchanged. Out here in the sticks, people adore the fact that she is so hated by the establishment in Paris. Marine owes Jean-Marie. In daughter as in father there is the same pugnacity - ready for a scrap with a hostile world. There is the same plain-speaking humour - the French call itla gouaille.To cheers, she declares: There are two things I want to give back to you, the people. Your voice... and your money!” Then there is the physical resemblance, with the strong features and the blonde hair. Marine was the third and last Le Pen daughter, and her parents may well have been hoping for a boy. Today Marine's mother Pierrette says her daughter is just like Jean-Marie with long hair. Jean-Marie himself puts it more crudely: “She is me with breasts!” But today Marine and her father are entirely estranged. The rift is not a charade to help along her political career. It is a total breakdown. The pair have not spoken for more than two years. “In this family, politics is stronger than blood,” says journalist Olivier Beaumont, author of a book on the Le Pens. “Jean-Marie could not bear to see someone else, even his own daughter, taking control of the party he had created and controlled for 40 years.” It was like a Greek tragedy unfolding, and it ended like a Greek tragedy - in a symbolic parricide.” She did an honourable thing, argues Marine's close friend Jean-Lin Lacapelle. “For the sake of politics and for the sake of France, she did the hardest thing a child can do - she cut the cord with her father.” The final break came in April 2015, when in an interview on French radio Jean-Marie Le Pen did what Marine had long feared he would do. He repeatedle détail. Mentionle détailto anyone in the National Front today and their face hardens.They know exactly what it means. In September 1987 a dark moment became a turning-point in the party's history. In their biography of the man, Pierre Pean and Philippe Cohen call it “the day Le Pen became Le Pen”. He was asked in an interview about a notorious Holocaust denier. Did he share the man's ideas? In his reply, the FN chief was at his ambiguous worst: “I do not say that the gas chambers did not exist. I never personally saw them. I have never particularly studied the issue, but I believe they are a point of detail in the history of World War Two.” Marine and Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2014 before their estrangement(Getty Images) Jean-Marie Le Pen never escaped from the aftershock of that remark - downplaying the Holocaust. It was a gift to his enemies, who now had evidence that the FN was anti-Semitic. Worse, Jean-Marie reacted to the hostility by digging in further. Over the years there were further verbal provocations, and he amassed more than 15 separate convictions in the courts. Then came the 2015 interview when he saidle détailall over again. Marine Le Pen looked on with horror. She disassociated herself from the remarks. Over the years she had become increasingly convinced that her father was incapable of winning power. Worse, maybe he never wanted power. In 2002 Marine had observed with satisfaction her father's first round success in the presidential race. But what left more of an impression was his utter wipe-out in round two. With just 17.8% to Jacques Chirac's 82.2%, Jean-Marie had barely made any advance at all from his first round score. Voters had united against him. Jean-Marie Le Pen's miserable result in the 2007 election (fourth place on 10.4%) set the seal on his decline. Maybe his real raison d'etre was to be a perpetual gadfly on the back of the French body politic, irritating but irrelevant. Time and again after she was elected as FN leader in 2011, Marine Le Pen would make clear her desire to “normalise” the party and make it electable. But time and again Jean-Marie grabbed the headlines with incendiary statements. After his repeat ofledétailin 2015, he was suspended by the party and soon expelled, though technically he remains its honorary president. A family-political drama had reached its climax. The very qualities he had inculcated in Marine by example - the cussedness, the pugnacity, the refusal to back down - were turned against him. Now Marine Le Pen is everywhere, and so are her lieutenants. As the presidential election draws near, Florian Philippot, Nicolas Bay, David Rachline, her partner Louis Aliot, and a handful of others saturate the morning TV talk shows. They are practised, presentable, professional. Philippot, her close adviser, has his own YouTube channel where he appears in an office kitchen dubbed the Marine cafe, railing against the latest factory closure or European free-trade deal. For years the party's far-right views were regarded by the French media as toxic, but the boycott is history. “A few years ago when I first interviewed Marine Le Pen, I got a kind of frisson with the hairs sticking up at the back of my neck. I felt I was flirting with the untouchable,” says journalist Elisabeth Levy. So is it truly a party like any other? Ask most observers, and they will say that the process ofdédiabolisation(de-demonisation) is genuine and more or less complete. Young FN supporters, 2017(Getty Images) The older generation with nostalgia for the collaborationist wartime Vichy regime, or for France's colonial rule of Algeria, has moved on. Racist comments are outlawed and people who make them are chased from the FN. In 2010, before being elected leader, Marine Le Pen was roundly criticised after comparing Muslims praying in the street to the German occupation. Now she has softened her tone, saying she does not regard Islam as “incompatible” with French democracy. The FN has also tried to build bridges with the Jewish community. Meanwhile across the West, other nationalist parties - in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere - have emerged which make the FN much less of a French exception. Events too have worked in the FN's favour. The jihadist attacks on Paris and Nice are part of it. But just as much is the popular disillusionment with the Paris and Brussels elites, and the growing fear of what they call in Francele déclassement- the loss of economic and social status. People feel poor. “We treat the FN like we would any other politicians,” says Beatrice Houchard who covers the party for L'Opinion newspaper.“No favours - but nor do we go out of our way to find something negative to say.” And with acceptance has come electoral success. After victories in municipal, European and regional elections, Marine can arguably claim to lead the country's most popular political party. Such an idea would have been laughable just a few years ago. We are now the number one party among the youth. We are the number one party for the working class. We are the number one party for farmers.” “We are making big gains in the civil service,” continues Lacapelle - Marine Le Pen's close friend. “In the police and army, and we are not doing badly among small business-owners. We represent a cross-section of France.” But unlike nationalist parties in some other countries, the FN does not do well among the over-65s. And if normalisation of the party is complete why does a shadow still persist over the FN's name? Do the words National Front and Le Pen have a perpetual power to alienate? Its critics strenuously argue the party's ethos is unchanged. For Laurent Joffrin, editor of left-wing daily Liberation, the FN still favours the insider and scapegoats the outsider. Today the implicit accusation they direct at Muslims is exactly the same as the one they used to direct at Jews.” “That these people are in some essential way different, and therefore dangerous to national unity,” he says. The persistent accusation is that in its modern, “normalised” form the party is not being entirely frank - that in private, members are far more bigoted than they ever let on openly, and that their public discourse is in some way coded. ""Racism, xenophobia, Marine and co, clear off!""Graffiti next to FN posters in southern France, 2016(Getty Images) Veteran commentator Alain Duhamel, who has covered every presidential election since 1965, says the FN still has an indirect way of attacking Muslims. When Marine Le Pen champions the exclusion of religion from the public sphere it is “a smokescreen for anti-immigration” he says. It is Muslim veils, not Christian crosses, that she has in mind. Rejection of Muslims has wide support, especially among the working class, according to Cecile Cornudet of Les Echos newspaper. So she uses secularism, orlaïcité,and defence of women as a way of being anti-Islam. Demonstration against the FN in Tours, 2011(EPA) The FN's opponents point out that Marine still has on her staff former members of a far-right militant group called GUD. Many in the Muslim community do not trust her. Iman Mestaoui, a 25-year-old clothes designer of Moroccan parents, sees Marine Le Pen as merely a more presentable version of her father. “She's definitely a racist, but she hides it better. She hides the Islamophobia. She is totally scary,” she says. But this “just-scratch-beneath-the-surface” argument has its limits. If people insist over and again that they do not have a particular opinion, is it fair to judge them by saying that you think they do? In France they call that aprocès d'intention- putting people on trial for views you tell them that they have. People who resent the allegation that they are racist are voting FN to thumb their noses at the establishment. As for Marine herself, even her enemies - or most of them - stop short of saying she is personally racist. Montretout is a three-storey, mid-19th Century pile in a gated community on a hill above the Seine that overlooks Paris from the west.  It sits in its garden at the end of a private road next to several other houses of similar vintage. This is where the Le Pens lived from 1976, after Jean-Marie inherited the property from a cement magnate who was a political supporter. The Le Pen family mansion - MontretoutSt Cloud, near Paris It was a highly controversial gift - the late magnate's brother contested it - but in the end the house became an integral part of the Le Pen saga. “It is very symbolic. Aloof, on a hill, with this magnificent view over the capital - it is just like Jean-Marie himself, who was always looking on the system from outside,” says Olivier Beaumont, whose book on the Le Pens is called In the Hell of Montretout. It's quite scary-looking - a bit like the house in Psycho. Which fits too, because the Le Pens have always given the establishment the shivers.” Even today the house is part of the story. Marine carried on living at the Le Pen estate into her 40s, in a bungalow in the grounds. In the summer of 2014 she finally moved out. It was at the height of the row with her father. “The things I saw there you would not believe! She and her father were 100m apart but communicating via intermediaries. It was vaudeville,” says a former senior adviser to Marine, who asks not to be identified. Again, the final straw could not have been more symbolic. It came when one of Jean-Marie's dogs killed his daughter's adored cat, Artemis. For Marine, who sometimes says she wishes she could give it all up and open a cattery, it was all too much. Today Montretout is home on the second floor to Jean-Marie's second daughter Yann, mother of the rising young FN star Marion Marechal Le Pen. The eldest Le Pen daughter Marie-Caroline is, like Marine, estranged from her father and lives elsewhere.  In her case the split goes back to 2002 - they haven't talked since. Jean-Marie Le Penwith daughters Marie-Caroline, Yann and Marine in themid-1990s(Getty Images) Jean-Marie no longer lives in the house but he comes every day to his office on the first floor.  Meanwhile, in the bungalow, there now resides his former wife Pierrette, mother of the three girls. The same Pierrette who left him in 1984 swearing he was the devil incarnate, and then posed nude in Playboy as an act of revenge. Indeed it was Pierrette's sudden disappearance when Marine was 16 that formed the second trauma in the FN leader's life. Her mother left without explanation, and Marine had no contact with her for the next 15 years. Pierrette and Jean-Marie Le Penshortly before their splitin 1984(Getty Images) In her autobiographyA contre flots(Against the Waves) Marine states: “For a month and a half I vomited every day. I was incapable of feeding myself… What I suffered was the most awful, cruel, crushing of pains of the heart: my mother did not love me.” Marine Le Pen's inner toughness stems from this ultimate desertion, as much as the bombing. She learned to cope. Her father told her to “keep things in perspective. 'Remember,' he said: 'You could be naked in the snow in a war.'” It was hard living with the Le Pen name. In her book, Marine speaks of the teasing at school, and of the betrayal by teachers and even Catholic priests who made sure she knew how much they loathed her father. As she tried to make her way as a lawyer she was boycotted by many of her contemporaries who objected to her father's politics. She ended up doing business solely for the party. Marine Le Pen working as a lawyer, 1995(Getty Images) All of this created a sense of injustice. She could not see in her father the monster constantly vilified by politicians and press. So gradually she started taking up the political cudgels herself. “If you are called Le Pen, eventually politics will come and catch you,” says her niece Marion Marechal Le Pen. “With a name like that, there is nothing else you can do!” But there is another aspect of Marine Le Pen's upbringing in Montretout which bears on the politician she is today. Because far from being the pillars of bourgeois respectability that many suppose them to have been, the Le Pen parents lived back then in a state of chaos. There were parties and endless dinners for Jean-Marie's cronies. He and Pierrette were constantly travelling. More and more the girls were left to their own devices. Marine went to a local state school, and there she mixed with boys and girls born like her in that highly significant year - 1968. 1968 was the year that changed France. It was the student protests in Paris versus the intransigent President Charles de Gaulle. Politically, the regime held. But otherwise the country was transformed. For supporters it meant a more tolerant, diverse society. For opponents it was the start of the left wing's half century of cultural hegemony. Today Marine Le Pen is a nationalist. She is unabashedly opposed to immigration. But there is no hint in her of the far-right ideology that clung to members of her father's generation. According to Laurent Joffrin of Liberation,Marine's views are eclectic and opportunistic. “Nationalists are always like that - whatever is for the nation is right,” he says. Thus in her autobiography written in 2005 she argued against the 35-hour week, but now she supports it. FN ideas about fixing the retirement age at 60 are interchangeable with those of the far left. The influence of her generation is key. “I noticed working with her that when a question came up her first reflex was a reflex of the left,” says the former adviser to Marine, who does not want to be named. “She does not have right-wing reflexes. For me, right-wing people are people who value liberty over equality. And left-wing people are the opposite. Well, Marine always chose equality over liberty.” - EU renegotiation with Brussels followed by a referendum - 15,000 new police and 40,000 new prison places - 35-hour working week and retirement age fixed at 60 - Legal immigration cut to 10,000 per year - Automatic expulsion of undocumented immigrants - Priority for French nationals in social housing Most noticeably it is on social matters that Marine Le Pen is a million miles from the caricature of the far-right traditionalist. She refused to join the movement against gay marriage, which brought millions on to the streets in 2013, and she has several gay advisers, notably Florian Philippot. Then again, Jean-Marie's long-standing personal assistant is also a gay man. And if she is religious in a loose kind of way, she is scathing in her book about literalist interpreters of Catholicism. She is twice divorced and angrily defends women's right to abortion, although she regards it as a sad necessity. Contrast that with the opinions of that other denizen of Montretout - Marine's niece Marion. Marine Le Pen and Marion Marechal Le Pen in 2016(Getty Images) Marion Marechal Le Pen, one of the FN's two MPs, was born in 1990. One of her closest friends is Madeleine de Jessey, spokeswoman for the pro-Catholic family-values and anti-abortion movement Sens Commun. Though they love each other deeply - Marine was a second mother, says Marion - their politics are very different. According to Marion: “I am from the generation of the anti-May 1968. My generation is reacting against all the ideological deconstruction that happened after the student rebellion. We want principles, values, mentors - everything in fact that negates May '68. “For Marine the cultural victory of May '68 dominated her childhood and adolescence. But today things are switching over.” Marion has another big difference from her aunt. She still has a good relationship with Jean-Marie. In fact they dote on each other. Jean-Marie Le Pen will be 89 this year.  He moves more slowly than he used to, and he is a little hard of hearing.  But his voice booms as powerfully as ever, punctuated by seafaring metaphors and guffaws of laughter. “Young people on the right,” he says, “are so much more radical than their parents.” His first-floor study at Montretout is full of memorabilia from a lifetime of incident - Russian icons, a model ship, a portrait of a young Le Pen in officer's uniform and eye-patch, a massive set of binoculars trained on Paris to the east. Jean-Marie Le Pen in his study at Montretout The sea is a constant motif in Le Pen's life - one little-known fact is that he introduced the duffle coat to France. He bought it in a navy surplus store in Plymouth for £2 after a trans-Channel yacht race in the early 1950s. No-one in Paris had seen one before. He's willing to talk at length about his daughter Marine. Despite their falling out, was he nonetheless happy at her success? “But think how much better she would be doing if she had not excluded me from the party!  Right now she is on 27%. With me involved she would be on 35%,” he says. She is reaping today the benefits of all the work I carried out over 40 years of great hardship.” “Maybe by getting rid of me she wanted to make some kind of gesture to the establishment. “But I still represent something in this land. And if she brought me back into the fold, I would bring with me all the radical formations of the right and far right who are now outside her compass.” For Jean-Marie, a single person represents all that has gone wrong with the party -  Marine's close adviser Florian Philippot. Marine Le Pen with Florian Philippot(Getty Images) Philippot is - after Marine - the FN's most prominent public figure. He is anénarque.In other words he went to the ENA, the administration school that churns out members of the French establishment and, most importantly, he is a man of the nationalist left. Largely under his influence, the FN has shifted its economic policies to overt protection of the working class. Jean-Marie says: “For him to have such preponderant influence, for him to monopolise the message… that is wrong.” But Jean-Marie seems happier talking about the past. He is a rebel by nature. In his own eye he is someone who exposes establishment hypocrisy. The roots of his tempestuous career are at the end of World War Two, when Jean-Marie felt that the national story, dominated by the movement of liberation hero Charles de Gaulle, and by the Communists, was a sham. Later he fought in France's last imperial wars - Indochina, Suez, Algeria - and became its youngest member of parliament behind the shopkeeper-turned-populist leader Pierre Poujade. Jean-Marie, even now an MEP, voted against the Treaty of Rome setting up the EU in 1957. The EU - for Le Pen - was one of the great betrayals. Algeria was the other. After a brutal civil war in Algeria, De Gaulle was instrumental in accepting that France would have to give up its colony. After independence, the vast majority of the European settlers - the pieds noirs - ended up in France. Le Pen tells a story to show that he has no bigotry - how he insisted on proper burial rites for dead Egyptian soldiers during the Suez campaign in 1956. But what about the question ofle détail? “Ok. Thedétail.Thedétailwas in 1987. Then it came back in 2015. That's not exactly every day! “To my knowledge no-one has provided proof to contradict what I said.” I said the gas chambers are a detail of the history of the war. That seems to me indisputable.” But wasn't he hinting that the gas chambers were insignificant? He avoids the question. “My dear sir, if we are to judge people on the basis of what wesaythat they think - that is one of the definitions of tyranny.” And how does he feel about rifts with two daughters? “Mon cher monsieur,” he leans forward. “It is life! Life is not a smooth tranquil stream. It has cataracts, it has obstacles.” “I am accustomed to adversity. For 60 years I have rowed against the current. Never once have we had the wind at our backs! Always we have had to sail into the gale - always the spray in our faces! No indeed, one thing we never got used to was the easy life!” At this point he is laughing his head off. Marine Le Pen has not had an easy time of it either. Her title for the autobiography - Against the Waves-nods to the favourite Le Pen image of the battling sailor. Jean-Marie's father was a Breton fisherman who drowned after his boat hit a German mine. The difference is that while Jean-Marie seemed to care little about failure - relishing the thrill of the struggle - Marine has made success her watchword. The electoral system has always been an obstacle for the FN.  Only once - between 1986 and 1988 when there was a brief period of proportional representation - have they had more than one or two deputies in the National Assembly. But with Marine at the helm things are changing. National Front share of vote in French elections In addition to the two MPs, the party has 20 MEPs in Strasbourg and many hundreds of local councillors. FN or FN-affiliated mayors control 11 towns. FN bastions are concentrated in two areas - the far north and the far south. And two different political traditions are now feeding into party's electorate.

In Henin-Beaumont, a few miles south of Lille, Marine's friend Steeve Briois has been mayor since 2014. This is an ultra-depressed former mining town, whose last industries - Samsonite cases and metal production - have long since relocated abroad. The town centre is dominated by a vast modern church, currently under renovation. The only eateries are Middle Eastern grills. The beggars are locals. Like all of this region, Henin-Beaumont has always voted left. Until recently the Socialists took 60% of the vote and the Communists another 20%. In his office Briois sits beneath a bust of the early 20th Century Socialist hero Jean Jaures. The statement is clear - that in FN eyes the left has betrayed its origins and its people. The argument is often made that the FN today is taking over where the old French Communist Party (PC) left off. Back in the 1950s the PC too could claim to be the country's largest party. But it never rose above 25% in the polls, and in the end withered into irrelevance. Derelict industrial buildingHenin-Beaumont, northern France Jean-Marie Le Pen once said that “communists are good patriots who just don't know it”, and it is obvious in Henin-Beaumont that the same working-class people who once voted far left now feel the FN is their natural home. The FN's language of values, education, protection for industry and hatred of global finance all goes down very well indeed. “I am no fan of communism - but in the 1950s the PC was intensely patriotic,” says Briois. “Look at their posters from back then. It was all: Produce in France. Keep it French. That I can identify with.” Steeve Briois in Henin-Beaumont(Getty Images) The soft-spoken Briois is popular in the town. “For years we had elites in the town hall. People decked out with diplomas and all sorts of expertise. And the place was a disaster,” he says. “Then along I come with virtually no qualifications. And we are doing the job OK. It goes to show that the people may not be as stupid as you think.” In the main square, Dominique Vignon, a 53-year-old social worker, is among several people who back him up. “My first vote was for Mitterrand in 1981, and I have voted on the left in every election since. But the left has betrayed us. The Socialists are right-wing. “I concede that the FN label shocks some people. But since Briois came to power the only things that have changed are that the taxes have come down and the place is better run. There is no discrimination. The North Africans are still on their market stalls.” Almost directly due south and 600 miles away, the historic town of Beziers is another FN stronghold. Or to be more accurate, FN-affiliated. The town's mayor Robert Menard came to power with the support of the party but he is not a member. Menard is a controversial character. Originally on the far-left of French politics, he chose to run his home town of Beziers for the nationalist right because he says “the world has changed… I could not look at the reality and pretend it was otherwise”. Robert Menard, mayor of Beziers(EPA) Menard has a terrible press in France. Some of his posters are deliberately provocative, and he once drew up an ethnic list of the town's schools, revealing that two-thirds of children were Muslim. His attempt to set up a volunteer civilian militia to patrol the town's streets was struck down by the courts. But he is popular in Beziers, a town built on wine wealth from the late 19th Century. On a walkabout on the famous promenade he is buttonholed by well-wisher after well-wisher, among them an Algerian boutique owner. Robert Menard talks to voters in Beziers
, southern France(EPA) Chrystele Crouton and Florence Boucard, a couple from Paris and Brittany who run theHôtel Particuliernear the town centre, are lavish in their praise. And they are far from being natural FN voters. “It is remarkable what he has done. In a few months the place has been transformed. On the promenade, it was disgusting. There were drug-dealers and drunks. But now people are coming back. It's alive again.” Property taxes were lowered. Old buildings were restored. Bus stop in Beziers, southern France(EPA) Beziers has been transformed by immigration, with many town-centre houses now divided into flats and inhabited by people of Maghrebi (North African) origin. On the outskirts is an estate called La Deveze, which has a reputation for drugs, arms-trafficking and radical Islam. Menard, who is apied-noir- someone of European descent born in French Algeria - lived in La Deveze as a boy. “Back then La Deveze meant social progress. There were Arabs there, pieds-noirs,and metropolitan French. And we all got along. The first thing the Algerian mothers did when they arrived in France was take off their headscarves. The fathers would smack the kids if they heard them talking Arabic on the street,” he says. Now he says you couldn't force him to live there. Stairwell by stairwell, he says, North Africans, Turks and French Roma (gypsies) live in separation. For Menard, the French social model has broken down. He thinks immigration has to stop completely so that the country can do what it can to integrate those that are here. The state school system - in which large numbers of children speak more Arabic than French - needs urgent attention. Anti-migrant poster in Beziers, southern France(Getty Images) And he denies that he only gets “white” votes. “Do you think I would be mayor if Maghrebis did not vote for me? Do you know why they vote for me? One, I am anti-gay marriage, and so are they. And two, I am authoritarian, and they would like to be too.” Both Menard in Beziers and Briois in Henin-Beaumont reject the argument that there are two National Fronts. One ex-communist in the north, left-wing in inspiration. The other ex-pied noir in the south, right-wing and more focused on national identity. The emphasis may be different, but at heart they see no difference at all. Friends of Marine Le Pen say that one of her familiar gestures is what you might call the fruit-machine pull. A downward tug of the right arm, fist clenched, in imitation of a person playing a one-armed bandit. In English it might be accompanied by the word “kerching!”. She has been making the gesture a lot recently. Because the kerchings keep on coming. “At exactly the moment Marine completed her de-demonisation process, events started happening on the world stage that push voters in her direction,” says columnist Cecile Cornudet. Brexit and Donald Trump's victory are two pieces of news that FN strategists could have dreamed of only in their wildest imaginings. “The UK is our best advertisement,” says Marine's friend Jean-Lin Lacapelle. “As for Trump... if it is OK for an American president to push for protection and immigration controls, then it is OK in France as well.” Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage with Donald Trump in August 2016,Mississippi, USA(AP) But one question keeps coming back. How far-right is the National Front? In an FN-run France, walls go up. Foreigners and foreign goods are kept out. Brussels is pushed to the margin. The franc returns, and France comes first. According to veteran commentator Alain Duhamel, it is “a former party of the far right that has become a populist party with instincts that are xenophobic and authoritarian”. For the party's Steeve Briois, “far-right is not a term we accept. It makes an automatic link with Hitler, which is why our enemies use it. We prefer patriotic, protectionist, national. Not national-ist. That sounds aggressive. And populist we like too.” In its economic plan the FN has swung far to the left, with anti-austerity and protectionist policies that are a clear signal to the working class. That leftward shift prompted the resignation of the former adviser to Marine Le Pen, who says the FN is “nationalist, populist and socialist. Not national-socialist - that has certain historical connotations. But social-nationalist.” What everyone would agree on is that the FN has built its programme around the idea of the nation - “national” identity and values. Marine Le Pen casting her votein France's 2015 regional elections(EPA) Marine Le Pen says she is “not against immigrants, but against immigration” - because any nation needs first to look after the people who are its citizens. But for the FN's enemies, the nation-first answer is wrong, dangerous and a betrayal of France's mission to the world. “It is about universal values,” says Liberation's Joffrin. “Do they exist or not?  I understand that when times are bad people want to return to their roots. That is why this national ideology is returning.” But our duty is to go above that - to think of the values that matter for all human beings. The trouble is that these days, that is a very hard sell.” In the West - it seems - the nation is returning, a political idea on which the National Front has had a monopoly in France for more than a generation. For journalist Elisabeth Levy, a leading light in the “new right” philosophical movement, “it is not that France has become Le Penist, reality has become Le Penist”. “In every country we are confronted with the same question - how do you integrate millions of immigrants? And the answer is you can't - not if they keep on coming.” In other countries populist, nationalist parties have grown up, without triggering the same gasps of horror. Part of the reason for the alarm is that the FN has always had a terrible press. In France it has suited successive governments, especially on the left, to caricature the party in the worst possible light. But there is a difference in France - and that is history. The roots of the FN lie in the country's troubled past - a past in which ideology and violence have often advanced hand in hand. Outbursts of civil unrest remain a part of the French psyche. The 1871 Paris Commune was followed by the anti-Semitic Dreyfus affair in 1894. The wartime Vichy regime was followed by the fighting in Algeria. In France people take sides. They believe in ideas. And if the conditions are right they will fight for them. That is why it all feels more real here. A Marine Le Pen presidency could well spark violence on a scale far greater than the protests she currently attracts. The FN has no experience when it comes to taking on the task of government.

'Beginner's luck' brings golden glow,"Gold Cup-winning trainer Jessica Harrington joked her victory was ""beginner's luck"" One woman made headlines before the race, but it was another who celebratedvictory in the 2017 Cheltenham Gold Cup. ""Beginner's luck,"" joked Jessica Harrington, a distinguished trainer whose first runner in the famous race - 7-1 chance Sizing John - triumphed in a dramatic renewal. Lizzie Kelly,the first female jockey for 33 years to ride in jump racing's showpiece contest, was unseated at the second of 22 fences aboard Tea For Two. As the 23-year-old punched the ground in frustration, it was Harrington - more than three times her age - who watched the race unfold in her favour. Under an accomplished ride from Robbie Power, seven-year-old Sizing John held off runner-up Minella Rocco by two and three quarter lengths, with Native River third and Djakadam fourth. Popular steeplechaser Cue Card again fell at the third-last fence, just as he did 12 months ago. Listen to BBC Radio 5 live's Cheltenham podcast Lizzie Kelly, like predecessor Linda Sheedy in 1984, did not reach the finish Harrington, 70, was in shock after the decision to step the horse up in trip earlier in the year paid rich dividends and capped a record-breaking week for Irish-trained horses. ""I have never had a runner in the race so to train the winner, I don't know when I am going to come back to earth,"" said the County Kildare-based trainer, wearing a cast on her left arm after a skiing accident. ""It hasn't really sunk in yet. I can't believe it is true. I am sitting here, I am about to wake up and it hasn't happened. This is the jewel in the crown. It is amazing to win the Gold Cup - this is the one I have always wanted to win."" Harrington was enjoying her 10th Festival triumph, with previous successes including the Queen Mother Champion Chase twice with Moscow Flyer, and Jezki in the Champion Hurdle three years ago. Sizing John - What's in a name? Owner Alan Potts names his horses after the mining term 'sizing', which means to extract minerals by crushing. He invented a machine to do this and made millions from it. Sizing John had been a runner-up seven times over two miles to Douvan, and Power suggested running the horse over further. He won the three-mile Irish Gold Cup and now the Cheltenham prize over three and a quarter. ""I have not had a horse I have considered for the Gold Cup before - they have either been two-milers, handicappers or not good enough,"" said Harrington, a former Olympic eventing rider. She paid tribute to Henry de Bromhead, who trained Sizing John before owners Alan and Ann Potts decided to move their entire stock - including Fellow Festival winner Supasundae - elsewhere last year. ""I feel very sorry. Henry de Bromhead did all the hard work, on both this horse and on Supasundae, and I only inherited them in September,"" said Harrington. De Bromhead handled the Potts decision gracefully and had been asked earlier in the week how he would view victory for Sizing John. ""You'd be disappointed if a Gold Cup winner left your yard but I'd be delighted for the horse and his connections - and my wife and I who bought him. At least we'd have a Gold Cup winner,"" he said. Sizing John finished two and three quarter lengths ahead of Minella Rocco Winning jockey Power, himself a former show jumper, was celebrating 10 years after his Grand National win at Aintree on Silver Birch, but perhaps savoured this one even more. He was sidelined for a couple of weeks at the end of January with a ruptured disc in his back and wore protective goggles until recently for an eye injury he sustained last year. ""The nicest words I ever heard were 'Gold Cup-winning jockey' announced on the podium. That sounded sweet,"" said Power, who was having his first ride in the Gold Cup and saluted Harrington as ""a genius"". ""When I won the Grand National I was 25 and thought I was going to win everything - now I am 35 and realise I am not going to win everything so to win a Gold Cup is fantastic."" Key stats from the Gold Cup Sizing John is the first horse to complete the Irish Gold Cup-Cheltenham Gold Cup double since Imperial Call in 1996. Harrington is the third female trainer to win the Gold Cup after Jenny Pitman (Burrough Hill Lad 1984, Garrison Savannah 1991) and Henrietta Knight (Best Mate 2002-2004). She is the most successful female trainer at the Festival with 11 wins. Willie Mullins, five times the leading Festival trainer, is still to win the Gold Cup, with favourite Djakadam finishing fourth. Victory for Bryony Frost in the Foxhunter Chase, immediately after the Gold Cup, marked another notable achievement for women in racing. It is the first time all three races for amateur riders run at the Festival have gone to female jockeys, after Lisa O'Neill won the JT McNamara National Hunt Chase on Tiger Roll and Gina Andrews took the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase aboard Domesday Book. Riding Pacha Du Polder, on whom former Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist Victoria Pendleton finished fifth in last year's race, Frost beat Wonderful Charm (Katie Walsh) by a neck at odds of 16-1. ""It's an unbelievable feeling,"" said Frost after triumphing aboard the Paul Nicholls-trained runner. Gordon Elliott is the most successful trainer at Cheltenham this week The week was dominated by the Irish, who claimed a record 19 victories from 28 races, surpassing last year's best of 15. Gordon Elliott and Mullins had six winners apiece, but Elliott took his maiden leading trainer honour thanks to more second-place finishes. ""It is great to do. We are absolutely thrilled and it's unbelievable,"" said Elliott. Ruby Walsh's historic four-timerfor Mullins on Thursday ensured the Festival's all-time top rider was top jockey for the 11th time. From the beginning on Tuesday - with Elliott's Laiback - to the end on Friday, the Irish were in the ascendancy. Harrington's only caveat in giving post-Gold Cup interviews was to be free to watch her runner in the final race. It was little wonder as Rock The World won the Grand Annual Chase for Power and Harrington on a day the duo ruled the racing world.
