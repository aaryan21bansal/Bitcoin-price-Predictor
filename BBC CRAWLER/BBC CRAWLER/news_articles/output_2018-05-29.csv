Roseanne show dropped after racist tweet,"This video can not be played President Trump once told supporters Roseanne 'was about us' Roseanne Barr has blamed sleeping pills for her tweet likening an African-American former Obama aide to an ape. The comedian blamed the offensive post on ""ambien tweeting"" - although she has since removed the tweet. Ambien is a sedative pill used as a sleeping aid. ABC cancelled Roseanne's sitcom over the racist tweet. They also apologised to the aide, Valerie Jarrett. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke his silence on Barr, who has been one of his most outspoken supporters. ""Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr"", Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday, referring to the former White House senior adviser. ""Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Barr's tweet described Mrs Jarrett as the child of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group, and the Planet of the Apes film. The television network said on Tuesday: ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values and we have decided to cancel her show."" The reboot of her hit sitcom Roseanne had been a ratings winner, and Mr Trump had called to congratulate her personally on its first season back. Eight celebrity social media disasters Barr deleted Monday night's post and said she was leaving Twitter, but has since posted a flurry of tweets including one claiming other comedians ""have said worse"". In another tweet, the TV star tried to explain away the post as having been caused by the effects of Ambien. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A spokeswoman for Sanofi, the pharmaceutical company that makes Ambien, said in response to Barr's tweets about taking the sedative: ""While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."" Roseanne Barr's racist tweet backlash Barr's five most controversial moments Valerie Jarrett, centre, was one of President Barack Obama's longest-serving aides On Wednesday, Barr also told former fellow cast member Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner on the show: ""You throw me under the bus. nice!"" She hit back at him after he posted a statement branding her original post ""reprehensible"". Barr's racist tweet came in response to another Twitter user, who accused Mrs Jarrett of helping to conceal purported spying during the Obama administration. Mrs Jarrett was a senior adviser to US President Barack Obama, and worked with him during his early days in Chicago politics. Barr apologised, saying the remark was a ""bad joke"", but the backlash mushroomed. The verdict on Roseanne's return Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Tuesday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders deflected questions about the president's views on the Roseanne Barr controversy by saying that he had been ""extremely focused"" on other things. That seemed a bit hard to swallow. The president had taken pride in the viewership ratings of the rebooted Roseanne Show, claiming in a March rally that its success ""was about us"". He even called Barr - an outspoken supporter of the president - to offer his congratulations. On Wednesday, Mr Trump broke his silence. What he tweeted was that he had been slighted by ABC because he never received an apology for unnamed disparagements. What he didn't express was any sort of condemnation of Barr's racist tweet. Mr Trump has often been criticised for an apparent unwillingness to address episodes of racial discrimination or hostility. Following violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which one counter-protester was killed, the president assigned blame to both sides. He noted that there were ""good people"" among those chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans in a torchlight rally the night before the clashes. With his tweet, Mr Trump will face renewed pressure to explicitly denounce Barr's comments. After embracing the comedian as a voice for his movement, however, the president may find such a step difficult to manage. The 65-year-old entertainer wrote on Tuesday she was ""leaving Twitter"", but returned shortly after with a string of tweets addressing the cancellation of her sitcom. ""I will handle my sadness the way I want to,"" she said. ""I'm tired of being attacked and belittled more than other comedians who have said worse."" The return of Roseanne was as short-lived as it was spectacular Barr also said that not only had her new series been axed, but also that older reruns of the sitcom had been cancelled by other networks. A spokesman for Viacom, which owns various networks including Paramount, earlier said it would stop airing old episodes. The streaming service Hulu also said it would be removing the sitcom from its library. Roseanne cast: Where are they now? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking at a prescheduled MSNBC town hall event on racism, Mrs Jarrett said the Roseanne Barr controversy was ""a teaching moment"". She added: ""I'm fine, I'm worried about all the people out there who don't have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defence."" She said that Robert Iger, chief executive of Disney, ABC's parent company, had called her to apologise and said he had ""zero tolerance"" for Barr's tweet. Following ABC's cancellation notice, Barr's talent agency ICM Partners dropped her as a client.

Russian journalist shot dead in Kiev,"Arkady Babchenko was a prominent Russian journalist and veteran of the Chechen wars Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko has died after being shot near his home in Kiev,  Ukrainian police say. Mr Babchenko, 41, was found bleeding at the entrance to his block of flats by his wife and died in an ambulance. After writing about a crashed Russian military plane in 2016, Mr Babchenko said he received death threats and left his home country. He first moved to Prague and later to the Ukrainian capital. He was an outspoken critic of the Kremlin. A former war correspondent, he worked in Kiev as a presenter on Ukraine's channel ATR TV. Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian police spokesman Yaroslav Trakalo confirmed Mr Babchenko's death. The journalist was reportedly shot several times in the back. Kiev police chief Andriy Kryshchenko told local media they suspected Mr Babchenko was killed because of his ""professional activities"". A criminal investigation is now under way. Ukrainian police guard the entrance to Arkady Babchenko's block of flats Ukrainian lawmaker Anton Herashchenko said the journalist went out to buy some bread, and that the killer was waiting for him near his flat. Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman described Mr Babchenko as a ""true friend of Ukraine, who was telling the world about Russian aggression"". ""The killers should be punished,"" Mr Groysman said. Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""We demand that the Ukrainian authorities make every effort to promptly investigate"" the killing. The ministry also offered condolences to Mr Babchenko's family and friends. In his last Facebook post just hours before the attack, Mr Babchenko recalled how lucky he was four years ago - exactly to the day. He wrote that he had planned to fly with Ukrainian soldiers on a helicopter in the war zone in Ukraine's east. He was not allowed on board, because there was not enough space. The helicopter was shot down by pro-Russian rebels, leaving 14 people dead. ""I was lucky. A second birthday, it turns out"", Mr Babchenko wrote. A well-known Kremlin critic, he stood inunofficial elections organised by the oppositionin 2012 and denounced Russia's actions in Syria and eastern Ukraine. In December 2016,Mr Babchenko wrote a Facebook post (in Russian),externalabout a crashed Tu-154 transport plane, which fell into the Black Sea while carrying a Red Army choir to Syria. The plane crashed into the Black Sea on 25 December 2016 'All die' in Russia Black Sea plane crash Pilot error blamed in Russian air crash He claimed this Facebook post, in which he described Russia as an ""aggressor"", led to death threats and abuse from the Russian state, writing ina piece for The Guardian,externalthat this forced him to leave ""a country I no longer feel safe in"". While studying law in Moscow aged 18, Mr Babchenko was conscripted into the Russian army and served during the Chechen wars from 1994-2000. His memoir, One Soldier's War, chronicles his experiences in the conflict, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands on both sides. He then became a journalist, working for a number of different outlets. Mr Babchenko also wrote for the BBC,reporting from the sceneof a Ukrainian army helicopter shot down in the east of the country in 2014. Kiev has in recent years seen a number of deadly attacks on high-profile journalists and politicians. Most of them were vociferous critics of the Kremlin.

Roseanne's five most controversial moments,"Comedian Roseanne Barr has landed herself in hot water on several occasions US comedian Roseanne Barr, who recently made a splash with the successful reboot of her '90s TV sitcom, has landed in hot water after posting a racist tweet likening an African-American former Obama aide to an ape. Broadcaster ABC said on Tuesday the comments were ""abhorrent"" and pulled the plug on Barr's self-titled show, despite it drawing more than 18 million viewers for its first episode. It was only recently that Barr, 65, who has previously implied that she may make a second run for US president, was being congratulated by Donald Trump over her success. But Barr has been caught up in controversy several times before. Here we take a look back at five of her most notorious moments. This video can not be played President Trump once told supporters Roseanne 'was about us' Barr took to the field at a baseball game to sing the Star-Spangled Banner,external. She was booed and ridiculed for a ""screechy"" performance that was far from pitch perfect. ""I started too high. I knew about six notes in that I couldn't hit the big note,"" she later admitted. Then-President George H W Bush labelled the performance ""disgraceful"". The comedian was criticised after photos emerged of her dressed as Adolf Hitler in a shoot for the satirical Jewish magazine Heeb. It was reported that the outfit - complete with moustache and swastika armband - was her own suggestion. Barr, who is herself Jewish, said that she was ""making fun of Hitler, not his victims"".

Then Barr shared the home address of George Zimmerman on Twitter. The neighbourhood watchman was cleared over the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012 after it was determined that he acted in self-defence. Mr Zimmerman's parents filed a lawsuit against Barr,external, claiming that they felt unsafe in their own home. The comedian deleted the tweets. She had more than 100,000 followers at the time. In March this year, a tweet from Barr that featured David Hogg, a student survivor ofthe Parkland school shooting in Florida that left 17 dead, sparked another backlash for the comedian. In her post, Barr appeared to suggest that the student gave a Nazi salute at a protest rally calling for stricter gun control laws in Washington DC. Responding to a tweet featuring Mr Hogg, Barr tweeted the words ""NAZI SALUTE"". She later deleted her tweet. On 29 May, the comedian apologised over a tweet in whichshe said that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American, was the child of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Planet of the Apes. ""I apologise to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,"" Barr said in follow-up posts in which she defended her remarks as a ""joke"", admitting that it was ""in bad taste"". Mrs Jarrett was a senior adviser to former US President Barack Obama. The latest tweet follows a long line of incidents, including: a criticism of the Obama family over the signing of a deal with Netflix to produce a series of TV programmes and movies an apology to Chelsea Clinton after claiming that she was married to a relative of billionaire investor George Soros, a bogeyman to right-wing conspiracy theorists an allegation that Mr Soros, who is Jewish, was a Nazi collaborator who ""turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps"" Earlier this month she vowed to quit social media, blaming a ""toxic"" atmosphere.

The verdict on Roseanne's return,"Roseanne and Dan have to adjust to having daughter Darlene and her children come to live with them Revivals of much-loved TV series can be hit and miss. And Roseanne has been welcomed back by critics - but they say it doesn't quite match the original. Many of the sitcom's stars are back 21 years on, including Roseanne Barr and John Goodman as Roseanne's husband Dan. TheNew York Times,externalsaid the show was still ""feisty and funny"" and likened it to the ""old couch you can't throw out"". Vulture's Jen Chaney,externalwrote: ""It may not be quite as good or as groundbreaking as the original, but it holds up."" Sarah Chalke returns to play a different character this time around The show originally ran from 1988 to 1997, and the reboot finds out how the working class Connor family are faring later in life during the Trump era. Goodman's character was killed off in the last series, but somehow makes a miraculous return in series 10 and he and Roseanne are now grandparents. Roseanne cast: Where are they now? Laurie Metcalfe and Roseanne Barr in a 1989 episode Variety's critic Sonya Saraiya said,externalthe new episode, which airs in the US on Tuesday, was ""a bit rough around the edges"". She continued: ""The embrace of the past is both cosy and smothering, a musty-smelling throw intentionally full of holes that looks warmer than it is. No wonder Darlene (Sara Gilbert) fled to Chicago."" Dominic Patten, writing in Deadline,external, praised the ""indomitable"" scripts and the performances of Goodman and Gilbert. But he added that, ""with the glorious exception of Gilbert... most of the cast seem to be speed dialling in their performances"". Dan is back - despite dying of a heart attack in the series finale in 1997 He wrote: ""As if this was a Roseanne tribute and not a reunion of the original band, eyelines and attention spans are all over the place as if looking for cue cards. Additionally, the pacing misses the beat repeatedly, and jokes are launched only to land far off target."" The new series is on ABC in the US but hasn't yet been picked up for broadcast or streaming in the UK. Another critic,David Bianculli, told NPR Radio,external: ""As revived sitcoms from an earlier era go, Roseanne is a lot better than Netflix's Fuller House and a bit better than One Day At A Time. ""But that's not high praise, and it's not meant to be. When it premiered, Roseanne broke new ground. This time around, it's good, but nowhere near required viewing."" New York Times writer, James Poniewozik,external, was more generous. He wrote: ""Roseanne is a revival that's willing to grapple with the time that's passed rather than deny it. ""It's feisty and funny and a little sad. And like that old couch you can't throw out, it may just have a good year or two left in it."" Roseanne Barr and John Goodman are back together Speaking at the series premiere last week, Sarah Chalke, who played Becky from series six and now has a new role as surrogate mother Andrea, said the time was right to bring Roseanne back. She said: ""I think it is extremely relevant. I think that one of the strongest things about Roseanne in its first incarnation was Roseanne never shied away from any topic. She wanted to tackle them head-on, and that is absolutely the case in the new one. ""And I think it really looks at the challenges facing American families today - both the effect the (presidential) election had on families and it deals with surrogacy, and pill addiction and ageing and death and divorce."" Goodman said the cast reunion felt like ""putting on an old shoe and running a couple of laps,"" while Barr described it as ""same old thing"".

Italy crisis hits financial markets,"Former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli was named prime minister-designate Fears over Italy's political upheaval spread to Wall Street after Europe's financial markets closed lower. The prospect of fresh electionsand the possibility of eurosceptic parties strengthening their position has raised concern about the eurozone's stability. The Dow Jones index shed 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%, coming after Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 2.7% and Europe's other main markets shed well over 1%. A sell-off in Italian bonds saw the yield on two-year debt breach 2%. It meant that short-term Italian bonds suffered their biggest one-day jump in 26 years. Movements in bond prices are important as they affect the cost of borrowing for the government. Italy's debt currently stands at 130% of its economic output. The bond sell-off hit the share prices of European banks exposed to government debt, especially those in Italy. Banco BPM, Banco Generali, Unicredit  and BPER Banca closed down between 5% and 6.7%. On Wall Street, JP Morgan was down 3.7%, and Bank of America and Citigroup were just more than 3% lower. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3%. Falling bank shares dragged down Europe's main share markets. At the close the UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1.3%, while Germany's Dax was down 1.5% and France's Cac 1.3% lower. ""It's a market that is totally in panic"", said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, who noted ""a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances"". Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in the US, said:  ""If the political situation in Italy worsens, the longer-term spillovers would be felt in the US via a stronger dollar and lower European growth."" What is Italy's political crisis all about? Call to impeach Italian president Italy's economy in charts The turmoil was precipitated after the anti-establishment Five Star and League political parties abandoned their attempts to form a ruling coalition after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella. He had vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic economy minister, and appointed former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister with the task of trying to form a government. But his term is likely to be cut short, as he will almost certainly lose a parliamentary vote of confidence. If he does, then new elections would soon follow. How bad is the financial situation in Italy? There is no question that the political crisis has led financial market investors to judge that the risks have increased markedly. The rise in Italian government bond yields has been very sharp and tells us that there is increased nervousness about the outlook. But we are not - not yet at least - anywhere near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12. At the time there was an informal rule of thumb sometimes used, that countries were likely to need a bailout if the yield on their ten year bonds - essentially the annual cost of borrowing money for ten years - was sustained at more than 7%. Italy did hit that level briefly in that earlier episode.  But it's currently around 3%. Higher than it was - but not yet flashing red. Five Star and the League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in March's election, and could increase their combined majority in a new national poll. ""We've seen a steep sell-off in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com ""The moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the eurozone debt crisis. ""The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe."" Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans. The leftistManifestonewspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire."" The centrist dailyCorriere Della Serasuggests that Mr Cottarelli will be a ""steady hand at the wheel, in market waters that promise to be rough"", but that it will be difficult for him operate because he will be ""a prime minister without trust"".

Seventeen hurt as bus ploughs into cars,"This video can not be played CCTV shows Dartford bus collision A bus ploughed into dozens of cars stuck in traffic in a busy town centre, leaving a trail of devastation. Sixteen people suffered minor injuries in the crash which damaged 25 vehicles in Hythe Street, Dartford at about 19:00 BST on Tuesday. A man has been arrested on suspicion of careless driving and is in custody after being treated in hospital. Police are appealing for witnesses who have not yet come forward, pictures and videos of the crash. This video can not be played Emergency services worked through the night to clear the vehicles and debris The road reopened earlier, after emergency services worked through the night to clear the bus and cars. Halal Uddin, who owns the nearby Indian takeaway Raja, said: ""I was shocked, I thought somebody was shooting. ""I went inside my door. Then I thought, 'it's coming', so I looked outside and saw this bus [hitting] the cars, and heard people screaming."" Officers originally said 17 people had been injured but later amended that figure to 16 Police, fire and ambulance services were called to the aftermath and treated a number of ""walking wounded"" at the scene.

Gina Warwicker was in one of the cars shunted by the bus Jeweller Gina Warwicker, who works close to the crash scene, was in one of the cars involved. She said: ""We heard this horrendous noise, and as I turned round, I could see a bus careering through the centre of the street, which was knocking all the cars sideways and literally just pushed all the cars on to one another.

""Judging from people on the scene, the bus simply ploughed through a number of cars that were stuck in traffic waiting at the traffic lights in Hythe Street,"" he said.

North Koreans who dare to criticise 'vampire leader',"This video can not be played 'Here there are a lot of government captures' Speaking to ordinary citizens inside North Korea is almost impossible, with visitors heavily policed and communication with the outside world blocked. But two residents were willing to speak to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, despite the threat of death or imprisonment. In North Korea, where leader Kim Jong-un has almost godlike status, to question him out loud is for many unthinkable. Citizens are taught he is all-knowing, and told to inform on dissenters - including their own family members. By speaking out, market trader Sun Hui - not her real name - knows she is putting her life at risk. ""Mostly, people criticise Kim Jong-un for being a businessman,"" she says, reflecting wider discontent. ""People say that he acts the same as us, but takes away our money. ""[They say] the little man uses his head to suck up money like a little vampire."" Over many months, the programme has been using a covert communications network to put questions to ordinary North Koreans. The BBC has taken steps to conceal their identities and to ensure their continued anonymity. If the regime knew of Sun Hui's real identity, she would face severe punishment - imprisonment in one of the regime's hard labour camps or even execution. And she may not be the only one to be punished - three generations of her family could also be sent to prison. This video can not be played North Koreans dare to criticise 'vampire leader' Sun Hui lives with her husband and two daughters, eating three meals a day when business is good. When it isn't, the rice is mixed with maize. At the markets where she works, street food, clothes and smuggled electronics are just some of the things sold. More than five million people are either ""directly or indirectly"" reliant on these general markets sanctioned by the regime, according to Daily NK. The Seoul-based media organisation reports on life inside North Korea and worked with the Victoria Derbyshire programme to facilitate the report using its network inside North Korea. The market trade in North Korea directly contradicts the regime's hard-line communism, but it also allows the population to feed itself amid a largely-defunct ration system and economic sanctions against the country. The regime cannot afford another instance like the ""the arduous march"" - the name given to the mid-90s famine that left more than a million people dead. Sun Hui says the number of local people who assess Kim Jong-un positively is increasing, because he leaves the markets alone and ""doesn't crack down much, no matter what we do"". What does Kim Jong-un really want? North Korea crisis in 300 words The word Trump and Kim can't agree on North Korea's leisure time revolution The markets, sometimes containing hundreds of stalls, can also be a breeding ground for gossip and rumour. ""I've heard at the market that the president of the US is coming,"" Sun Hui says. ""People don't know much about the meeting,"" she continues, ""but everyone dislikes America. ""We say the reason for us living in poverty is because America split us and sealed us off [from South Korea]."" North Korea blew up the tunnels at its nuclear test site last week Information going into the country is strictly controlled by the North Korean regime, whose propaganda is heavily critical of the US and its southern neighbour, South Korea. ""But things are changing a little recently,"" says Sun Hui. ""They say we should get along with the South. ""Recently they say we should be living in peace with America, for everyone to have a better life."" It is a significant development. While not unprecedented, this internal softening towards the West coupled with the supposed destruction of tunnels at a nuclear test site - which was seen as a goodwill gesture by the regime - points to Kim Jong-un being much more open to reconciling with the US. Despite it being called off, there are moves which suggest a summit between the North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump may yet happen. Chol Ho, who works in North Korea's military, says his hope from life is simply ""to live well without envy - until we die - without being sick"". He hopes the same lifestyle will be afforded to his parents, and his children. Chol Ho - not his real name - has also been speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme in secret, and says there is dissent within the country, from people who ""complain about their everyday lives"". ""Sometimes people get caught by the state security department, the Bowibu, for saying the wrong things,"" he explains. ""People do suddenly disappear, but it hasn't happened here recently."" Chol Ho says he has only ever met fellow North Koreans Those Chol Ho is referring to are often sent to the country's prison camps - where it has been reported that detainees are subjected to torture, forced to dig their own graves, and rape is used as punishment. A single camp can hold as many as 20,000 inmates, according to Amnesty International. It is the ""terror"" of such camps that ""keeps society going"", according to Sun Hui. She says ""there's a lot of government captures"" where she lives. Chol Ho believes some people are sent there by the Bowibu because officials ""make up stories for their own performance"". ""They make people say that they were planning to go to China, and then report them,"" he says. Watching films and TV shows smuggled in from abroad can lead to 10 years imprisonment in the country's hard labour camps. The regime fights hard to prevent the consumption of foreign media, as it undermines its anti-Western propaganda, but many are successfully brought in through China on USB sticks or counterfeit DVDs. ""Korean things are the most popular of course,"" says Sun Hui, who admits to sometimes watching Korean dramas and foreign films at night. ""But the crackdown on them is strong. ""I've heard the cost of bribes if you're caught is huge, but people still want to watch them. ""It's easy to understand, and people are curious about how South Koreans live."" But while an increasing number of North Koreans are able to get a glimpse of life outside their country, many still do not know how they themselves are perceived. Chol Ho admits he knows nothing of how citizens like him are viewed by the outside world. He has only met North Koreans. But he insists while life ""is difficultâ¦ our people are nice"". ""We have a saying that neighbours are better than cousins. If something happens to our neighbours we visit each other,"" he says. In some parts of the country, residents defect to South Korea via China, risking their life. In recent years the number of people defecting has fallen, largely because of increased border security and a widely-criticised agreement with the Chinese to repatriate North Koreans found in the country. Where Sun Hui lives, away from the country's borders, defections ""do not happen here much"", she says. But when they do, those left behind do not refer to South Korea by its name. ""When a neighbour disappears we just say, 'He went to Lower Town',"" she explains. None of the people appearing in our videos were contributors or involved in any way.

Ex-EDL chief Robinson jailed for contempt,"This video can not be played Tommy Robinson was arrested outside Leeds Crown Court Former English Defence League (EDL) leader Tommy Robinson has been jailed for potentially prejudicing a court case, it can be reported. Robinson, who appeared in the dock under real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was arrested in Leeds on Friday. The 35-year-old was broadcasting on social media outside the city's crown court where a trial was ongoing. A ban on reporting his 13-month sentence at the same court was lifted after being challenged by the media. Robinson, from Bedfordshire, was found guilty of a charge of contempt of court. A judge told him his actions could cause the ongoing trial to be re-run, costing ""hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds"". Tommy Robinson founded the EDL in 2009 but quit the group in 2013 In footage which was played to the court on Friday, Robinson was seen filming himself and people involved in the trial. The court heard how the footage, which supposedly lasted around an hour, had been watched 250,000 times within hours of being posted online via Facebook. During Friday's hearing, Matthew Harding, defending, claimed that his client had ""deep regret"" for what he had done. ""He was mindful, having spoken to others and taken advice, not to say things that he thought would actually prejudice these proceedings,"" Mr Harding said. ""He did not try to cause difficulties for the court process."" Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: ""Not only was it a very long video, but I regard it as a serious aggravating feature that he was encouraging others to share it and it had been shared widely. ""That is the nature of the contempt."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Contempt of court is the crime of ignoring the court and its constitutional role in making sure that justice is done. Robinson was convicted of contempt for interfering with a trial in Canterbury. His attempts to film defendants on that occasion could, the judge said, have ""prejudiced"" the jury, leading to an unfair verdict - and he was warned he'd go to jail if he did anything remotely similar again. Why couldn't we initially report Robinson's arrest and jailing? Reporting restrictions are a long-standing part of the British legal system. In this case, the judge ordered a temporary media black-out because he feared reporting Robinson's conviction could influence the jury in the very case Robinson was targeting. This is not some new form of censorship directed at Robinson. These are rules that apply to us all, equally. If he is unsure about that, he's now got time on his hands to read a copy of Essential Law for Journalists. Robinson was already subject to a suspended sentence for a contempt charge related to a separate case in Canterbury. The judge had warned him then he should expect to go to prison if he committed further offences. Robinson was given 10 months in jail for contempt of court, and a further three months for breaching the previous suspended sentence. Judge Geoffrey Marson QC initially imposed restrictions for fear that reporting his arrest would prejudice an ongoing trial. Following the arrest there were protests outside Downing Street over the weekend. Robinson founded the far-right EDL in 2009. It became known for its street marches and demonstrations in towns and cities before he quit the group in 2013.

'Don't toast marshmallows on Hawaii volcano',"Kilauea in the US state of Hawaii is one of the world's most active volcanoes The US Geological Survey has responded to a social media query on whether it is safe to roast marshmallows over a volcanic vent. The answer is no. Kilauea in the US state of Hawaii is one of the world's most active volcanoes and it has been very active in recent weeks. Its red-hot rivers of lava have destroyed dozens of homes on Hawaii's Big Island, with 2,000 people being told to leave their properties. Jay Furr from Richmond, Vermont asked the US government department whether it would be safe to roast marshmallows over volcanic vents using a long stick. Allow Twitter content?

Grenfell Tower dad blames firefighters,"This video can not be played 'My Isaac would be here today' - Grenfell father A five-year-old boy ""would likely be alive"" had firefighters not told his family to stay put, the boy's father has told the Grenfell Tower inquiry. Paulos Tekle said he had to ""live with the guilt"", after the fire brigade repeatedly told his family to stay in their 13th floor flat. Mr Tekle said he was told to stay put more than an hour after the fire began. After eventually leaving the flat, his son, Isaac Paulos, died after reportedly getting lost in the smoke. Speaking on the sixth day of the Grenfell commemoration hearings, Mr Tekle told the inquiry: ""Our friends and neighbours were calling me and telling me to get out, the fire is spreading too fast up the building,"" he said. Mr Tekle called his friends to warn them of the fire, and they all lived. But he was told to stay in his flat after speaking to the fire brigade over the phone on two separate occasions. Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 6 At 02:00, firefighters reached his family's flat, but Mr Tekle said they were told again to stay where they were. It wasn't until 45 minutes later they were told to leave. ""I listened to the authority and that makes me angry,"" Mr Tekle said. ""Why we were kept inside for so long? I want answers. I want to know why I was physically stopped from leaving the flat at 2am. ""If I had not listened to the fire brigade my son would have likely be alive today."" In July,BBC Newsnight reportedthat the ""stay put"" advice lasted almost two hours after the fire was reported. The advice is based on the assumption that fire can be contained, and won't spread to other flats, which are protected by their walls and doors. Sakineh Afrasiabi and her younger sister Fatima Afrasiabi had managed to reach the higher floors of the tower, thinking they would be rescued In another tribute, the eldest daughter of Sakineh Afrasiabi, who died with her sister Fatemeh Afrasiabi, said she had lost her ""only friend and protector"". In a statement read by the family's solicitor, Shiva Aghlani said: ""Losing a mother who was your only shield from the world is something else."" The inquiry heard that, on the night of the fire, despite living on the 18th floor, Ms Afrasiabi and her sister reached the 23rd floor, where ""she believed that help was coming from above to rescue her"". Ms Aghlani said ""a tooth and a piece of her jaw bone"" was all she buried of her mother. ""I wish I could have been there that night,"" she said. ""I would have saved you and your sister, I would have helped you down the stairs."" Berkti Haftom, 29, with her son Biruk, 12, who both died in the fire The family of Berkti Haftom, 29, and her 12-year-old son Biruk also gave a series of emotional tributes. A statement read by her sisters revealed Ms Haftom was 10 weeks pregnant at the time of her death. Her only surviving son Nahom Tesfay, 18, said he now felt ""alone"". Nahom grew up in Eritrea, where he was raised by his grandmother, but would speak regularly to his mother in the UK and was due to join her in London. ""I was looking forward to living with my mum and my little brother but the fire changed everything,"" he said. Day 1: Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens Day 2: Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Day 3: Victim's son 'prays for death' to join father in heaven Day 4: Grenfell niece tribute distress for aunt Day 5: 'We will never play again' The girlfriend of Mohammad Alhajali, 23, told the inquiry how she received a message from him just before the fire took hold, saying: ""Hey, are you sleeping? I'm home now."" Mr Alhajali - a Syrian refugee - had fled his home country and had been in London for three years. His girlfriend Amal said the couple had hoped to marry. ""He liked his life here. He enjoyed it, but Syria was his home. He missed it so much,"" she said in a video tribute. ""He was a huge part of my life. He taught me to love myself. Right now when I think about my future, I don't really see anything."" Mohammad Alhajali came to London as a refugee having fled his home country of Syria Former flatmate and friend Mahmoud Al-Karad, said Mr Alhajali had spoken to him during the fire on 14 June. ""He was in there with a mother and her child. I told him to get out, that he should leave. ""His reply shows the kind of man that he was. He said: 'How can I leave? How can I leave the child?'"" This video can not be played Mariem Elgwahry 'did not reveal danger in final phone call' Ahmed Elgwahry described a final phone call with sister Mariem, 27, and mother Eslah, 64, who were both trapped on the building's highest floor. He said he stood helpless outside the tower and only disconnected the call an hour after they had fallen silent. ""On my final call with Mariem - despite her suffering, despite her gradual deterioration, despite her gradual loss of consciousness - she persisted in letting me know that she was still there,"" he said. ""She started fading away from me rather rapidly... she started to mumble, started banging the floor, and then finally no longer responsive."" He said he then heard his mother's final words: ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe."" Hamid Kani will be remembered for his smile, Masoud Shahabeddin said Hamid Kani, 61, ""will not be remembered for the way he died - but for the way he lived,"" his cousin Masoud Shahabeddin said. The two came to London in the 1970s from Iran. ""He fell in love with London and its people,"" Mr Shahabeddin said. Mr Kani worked as an actor and later a chef and spent 22 ""happy years"" living in Grenfell Tower. Mr Shahabeddin said his friend would be remembered for his sense of humour, warmth, his love of family and his compassion for others. Gloria Trevisan was a ""beautiful girl"", whose kindness and big heart ""didn't go unnoticed for anyone"" The mother of Italian architect Gloria Trevisan, who died alongside her fiance Marco Gottardi, urged families and survivors to use their anger as ""the catalyst for finding the truth, because that is what everybody really wants"". Speaking through an interpreter, Emmanuella Trevisan said she asked her daughter to come home to Italy for an anniversary on the same day as the fire, but Gloria decided to travel later. She said she hoped those ""who took the decision to put that cladding on that tower"" will ""feel it in their conscience, the pain and the grief caused to all of us"". This video can not be played Abu Baker Ibrahim was applauded at the inquiry, as were other victims' relatives A man who lost his mother, brother and sister in the fire, gave an emotional tribute to his family. Fathia Ahmed, 71, was found on the 23rd floor with her children Abufars Ibrahim, 39, and Isra Ibrahim, 33. Abu Baker Ibrahim said he missed ""everything"" about his mother. The family came to England from Sudan, after his father was killed in the 1980s. ""We enjoyed our time in England... My mother worked hard in a foreign land to keep us together... (she) was given flat 206 in Grenfell Tower in 2007."" Describing his grief, he said: ""You can sit and pretend that it's OK, but the minute you close that door and you're by yourself, it's horrible. ""I miss them. It's like having a clear vision and now it's just pure darkness."" Hassan Awadh Hassan paid tribute to his wife Rania Ibrahim and their two daughters Hassan Awadh Hassan paid a tearful tribute to his wife Rania Ibrahim and daughters Fethia, four, and Hania, three. Supported by his family and friends, Mr Hassan - who was in Egypt when the fire happened - wore a t-shirt printed with a picture of his wife and daughters and the words ""I love you"". He said the family had moved into the tower in 2015. However, even before they started living there, he said his wife expressed concerns about fire safety. Mr Hassan said: ""When I spoke to my friend I asked him my wife's question: 'If there is a fire, what do we have to do?' and he tells me 'Hassan, don't worry, this building is safe - if the flat next to you is on fire then nothing happens to your flat'."" Rania Ibrahim and her daughters Fethia, four, and Hania, three, died in the fire By Jennifer Scott, BBC News If you think about the first thing you would save in a fire, many of us would reach for the photo albums. The precious memories encapsulated in those pages mean the world to those who took them. But we all hope to never have to make that call. Hassan Adwah Hassan shared those moments today to show the Grenfell Inquiry what he had lost - his wife, Rania Ibrahim, and his two daughters, Fethia and Hania. People watched the emotional slideshow with pictures of his wedding day, the birth of his babies and the celebrations as they grew older. They smiled as the two little girls demanded papa cut the birthday cake, played in the bath or showed off their art from nursery. And they cried as they saw him embracing his girls on holidays, picnicking in the park and spending time with the family and friends they loved, knowing they could never be repeated. They are all scenarios we cherish with our own loved ones, and Hassan's life after Grenfell is one we cannot begin to imagine. This week is half-term and some of the survivors of the tragedy have brought their children with them. After such a moving tribute, they were sure to have been holding their families that little bit closer.

Brain cancer vaccine 'remarkably promising',"Kat Charles, pictured with her son Jacob and husband Jason, was told in 2014 that she had three months to live A vaccine could help to significantly extend the lives of people diagnosed with the brain cancer that killed ex-Labour cabinet minister Tessa Jowell, early trial results suggest. People with glioblastoma who took part in the study lived more than twice as long as those on standard treatments in many cases, researchers say. The vaccine works by using the body's immune cells to target the cancer. A cancer charity said preliminary results seemed ""remarkably promising"". Extra cancer funding in Tessa Jowell tribute Brain cancer vaccine trial begins The standard treatment for glioblastoma, the most aggressive of brain tumours in adults, involves removing the tumour followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. But it is difficult to treat and patients live on average for only 15 to 17 months after surgery. For this phase three trial of 331 people from the UK, the US, Canada and Germany, 232 patients were given the immunotherapy vaccine DCVax on top of standard treatments while the rest received a placebo along with normal care. The vaccine works by taking immune cells, known as dendritic cells, from the patients' bodies and then combining them with a sample of their tumours. When the vaccine is injected back into the patient, the body's entire immune system recognises the cancer to attack. Preliminary results from the 11-year study,published in the Journal of Translational Medicine,,externalfound those involved in the trial survived for more than 23 months on average after surgery, with 100 living for 40.5 months at the time of the researchers' analysis. Because the study has not concluded yet, the data does not break down who received the vaccine and who had the placebo, but this will be released when the trial concludes. The longest survivors have lived for more than seven years after surgery. The study's authors said it appears that patients on the trial who reach a certain threshold beyond diagnosis ""may continue onwards to unusually long survival times"". Kat Charles was told in 2014 that she had three months to live after NHS doctors ran out of options to treat her brain cancer. ""They said there was nothing more they could do for me,"" says Kat, now 36 from Milton Keynes. ""I was distraught."" After undergoing the standard forms of treatment, and even taking part in a clinical trial for another medicine, she and her husband Jason raised funds to pay for DCVax privately. After receiving the treatment, Kat's most recent MRI scan showed no trace of the tumour. ""DCVax has done what everyone said was impossible,"" her husband Jason says.

Gunman kills three in Belgium attack,"This video can not be played Social media footage captured the sound of gunshots A man has shot dead two female police officers and a civilian in the eastern Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge. The gunman also took a female cleaner hostage at a school before being killed by police. Four other police officers were also injured. The man's motive is not yet clear but the incident is being treated as terrorism. Police sources quoted in local media said the man was heard shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic). Belgian broadcaster RTBF said the gunman was let out from prison on temporary release on Monday where he had been serving time on drug offences. It said that he may have been radicalised while in jail. LiÃ¨ge mayor Willy Demeyer confirmed the deaths of the two female officers during a press conference and said that ""physical and psychological support"" would be provided to the families of the victims. Hearses arrived at the scene where the gunman shot dead two female officers Mr Demeyer said it was an assault on the state of Belgium, adding: ""Police were definitely the target of this attack. ""We will forever be at the side of the police officers."" A bomb squad was sent to the scene of the shooting in Liege, Belgium Mr Demeyer added that ""all flags on municipal buildings"" were to be flown at half-mast, a book of condolences would be placed in the local town hall and a service would be held at 13:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday to honour the victims. The shooting unfolded late morning on Tuesday near a cafe in the city centre. Prosecutors said the man followed and ""savagely"" attacked the officers from behind with a knife before taking a gun from them and opening fire. He also shot dead a 22-year-old man who was sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car as he walked in the direction of a nearby school, where he briefly took a member of staff hostage. ""The young man who was killed in the vehicle was a pupil of the high school in LiÃ¨ge, he was going to qualify as a primary school teacher in the next few weeks,"" Mr Demeyer said. Armed police officers with shields, helmets and bulletproof vests then arrived at the scene and ""intervened"". The attacker began firing at the officers in an attempt to escape. Two officers were shot in the leg, leaving one officer in a serious condition. Two other officers received injuries to their arms before the attacker was shot dead, prosecutors said. Footage on social media showed people running to safety as several gunshots rang out. Children at the school were moved to safety. LiÃ¨ge city authorities later tweeted: ""The children in the local schools are safe."" Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel said he was following the situation closely and expressed his support for those caught up in the shooting. Allow Twitter content?

Floods cause misery in London and Kent,"This video can not be played Properties were evacuated and roads flooded in Kent Thunderstorms and flash-flooding have brought parts of south-east England to a standstill as the region received a month's worth of rain in a few hours. Kent Fire and Rescue Service warned motorists to drive only ""if necessary"" after a lunchtime deluge left parts of the county impassable. London Fire Brigade also confirmed that it received more than 100 flood-related calls on Tuesday. Some train services were cancelled as railway lines were submerged. And some flights from Gatwick Airport were also cancelled or delayed by ""adverse weather"". Almost the entire May average of 50mm (2in) of rain fell in the region in just a few hours. Stretches of the M2 were closed while heavy floodwater was cleared Traffic was unable to switch between the M2 and M20 after a stretch of the A249 at Stockbury was closed Kent Highways had received around 280 calls related to flooding by 15:30 BST. A spokesman said: ""We have had more calls in the past few hours than we normally get in two weeks."" The worst problems were in Maidstone, Gravesham and Swale, in the north-east of the county. Stretches of the M2 - a key route from London towards the Kent coast - were closed for a while as emergency services and Highways England cleared flood water from the carriageways. Properties were evacuated and roads flooded in Kent The A249, which links the M2 and M20, was closed both ways and other routes were also badly flooded. Among the incidents that Kent Fire and Rescue Service were called to were: A man trapped in his car in Teynham, Sittingbourne Another man was rescued from his flooded home in Luton Road, Chatham A bolt of lightning set a tree and shed on fire in a garden in Rochester Firefighters were called to reports of a house blaze in north London when an external shed caught fire London was also badly hit with about 30 houses flooded by up to 25in (64cm) of water in Erith, south-east London. Four people were also rescued from their cars in Stratford, in the east of the city. Two fires in north and west London, believed to have been caused by lightning, were among more than 100 calls the fire service received during the day. BBC weather presenter Nina Ridge said the worst of the storms were believed to have passed, but she warned there was still more heavy rain on the way. ""The Met Office yellow weather warning is in place until 06:00 on Wednesday, although that is likely to be extended,"" she said. ""Through the night we don't think it will be as bad, but there could still be heavy thundery downpours in the morning and for the next few days."" The cellar of the Three Daws was flooded The Three Daws riverside pub at Gravesend was hit for the second time in three days, forcing it to close at lunchtime. Manager Lisa Bishop said the pub's flood defences were breached for the first time since they were introduced a few years ago. She said: ""They are just under 1m high but the water went over them. My cellar is still under water and I'm waiting for Southern Water to bring a pump to pump it out. ""At least 20 barrels of beer are bobbing about. I have had to rip my carpet out in the function room on the first floor."" She said the flooding had caused thousands of pounds worth of damage.

Ethiopia frees abducted Briton on death row,"A huge crowd gathered at Mr Andargachew's house to celebrate his release British citizen Andargachew ""Andy"" Tsege, who was being held on death row in Ethiopia, has been freed. He has been greeted by jubilant relatives and supporters at his family home in the capital, Addis Ababa. The Ethiopian government had accused him of plotting a coup and he was sentenced to death in absentia in 2009. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was ""pleased"" with the development and praised his department's staff for their ""tireless"" work on the case. Almost four years ago, Mr Andargachew was apprehended at an airport in Yemen while in transit and turned over to the Ethiopian authorities. He denied the charges and was pardoned on 19 May, along with 575 other inmates, as part of the Ethiopian government's current effort to promote reconciliation. More about Ethiopia Ethiopia to release political prisoners Mr Andargachew, a father of three, fled Ethiopia in the 1970s and sought political asylum in the UK. He was the secretary-general of banned Ginbot 7 (15 May) movement, named after the date of the 2005 elections that were marred by protests over alleged fraud that led to the deaths of about 200 people. ""I did not expect this much turnout,"" he told supporters at his home after his release. ""Four years in prison is not that much of a sacrifice. I'm meeting you first because I respect you; I haven't yet my father. Now, I'd like to go and greet my father."" Andy Tsege has not seen his wife or three children since his arrest in 2014 Attorney General Berhanu Tsegaye said his pardon was part of an initiative to ""widen the political space"". Maya Foa, the director of the human rights charity Reprieve, which has campaigned for Mr Andargachew's release, said the new Ethiopian government ""should be recognised for what they have done"". Mr Johnson also commended the Ethiopian government, saying its actions sent a ""positive signal"" that it remained serious about ""following through with promised reforms to increase political space"". Mr Andargachew's partner Yemi Hailemariam's has led a campaign for his release. ""I am so thankful that the pain and anguish my children have had to go through could now soon be coming to an end,"" Ms Hailemariam, who lives in Islington, north London, said last week in a statement  released by human rights group Reprieve. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's new prime minister, has pledged to carry out reforms following anti-government protests that broke out in 2015. The civil unrest led to the resignation in February of Mr Abiy's predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn,who had defended the arrest of Mr Andargachew, saying the activist had wanted to destablise Ethiopia.

'Double standard' over celebrity lust,"""We live in confusing times and I'm the first to admit to double standards,"" says the broadcaster Broadcaster Mariella Frostrup has complained of a new ""double standard"" that allows women to lust over men - but sees accusations of sexism arise when the role is reversed. The presenter of BBC Radio 4's Open Book revealed her concern when writing about the new TV series of Poldark in the Radio Times. She said she can comment on a ""shot of a shirtless, sea-soaked Aidan Turner"". But men would not be able to remark similarly on his female co-stars. ""As a woman, I can own a comment like that without too much fear of censure,"" said Frostrup. ""Indeed, there's an undeniable sense of celebration among my girlfriends at the return of this sultry, tormented character, embodied by a delectable young thespian pleasing all viewing generations. ""But we live in confusing times and I'm the first to admit to double standards - if a male colleague had penned those preceding lines about any of Turner's equally appealing female co-stars, his cries of contrition would be drowned out by Twitter's Troll Chorus."" Much comment has been made about Turner's appearance as Ross Poldark in the BBC One series The presenter said she feared that ""we are losing not only our sense of humour but our sense of proportion as we throw every act of perceived sexism into the #MeToo basket"". The #MeToo spread around the world following allegations against Harvey Weinstein and has prompted people to share their stories of abuse and harassment. What has #MeToo actually changed? BBC's Martha Kearney recalls 'humiliating' harassment Frostrup added: ""There's an enormous difference between judging a person's worth only on the basis of their physical assets and expressing admiration for a fellow human with God's gift (allegedly) of good looks. ""Admiring Aidan Turner should be an acceptable national pastime, as a thumbs-up for the glories of humanity and another for his engaging performance."" What has #MeToo actually changed?

"Hurricane Maria 'killed 4,600 in Puerto Rico'","The official death toll stands at 64 Hurricane Maria killed more than 4,600 people in Puerto Rico, 70 times the official toll, according to estimates in a Harvard University study. A third of deaths after September's hurricane were due to interruptions in medical care caused by power cuts and broken road links, researchers say. The Puerto Rico government said it ""always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported"". The official death toll stands at 64. But experts say an accurate count was complicated by the widespread devastation wreaked by the storm. Carlos Mercader from Puerto Rico's Federal Affairs Administration said he welcomed the Harvard survey. ""The magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities,"" he said. He added that the island's authorities had also commissioned George Washington University to study the number of deaths and these findings would be released soon. ""Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost,"" he said. Record year for US natural disasters Six graphics that sum up Puerto Rico disaster The Harvard researchers saidinterviews conducted in Puerto Rico suggested a 60% increase in mortality,externalin the three months after the storm. They contacted more than 3,000 randomly selected households between January and March this year and asked about displacement, infrastructure loss and causes of death. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Washington Many Puerto Ricans we spoke to felt their immense suffering after the hurricane had been trivialised and that the emergency response has been lacklustre. A relatively small number of people may have been killed by the physical impact of the storm, but six months later we met people who had lost relatives as a result of interrupted medical care and saw others struggling to pay for expensive generators on which they were running vital life support equipment. There was also reported to have been a spike in the number of suicides.  We found many still without homes and thousands who had been living without electricity since the day Hurricane Maria struck. Whatever the true number of those killed as a result of the storm, it is now certain to be many times the official figure.  The question for US authorities about Puerto Rico, an American territory, is how many of those deaths could have been prevented with a better emergency response? They then compared their results with the official mortality rates for the same period in 2016, more than a year before the hurricane struck the island. The researchers said that interrupted medical care was the ""primary cause of sustained high mortality rates in the months after the hurricane"". This video can not be played Six months after hurricanes, many on this US island still suffer in the dark Disruption to health care was a ""growing contributor to both morbidity and mortality"" in natural disasters, they said, because growing numbers of patients had chronic diseases and used sophisticated equipment that relied on electricity. On Twitter, several users noted that the death toll exceeds the nearly 3,000 Americans that were killed during the 9/11 attacks. Allow Twitter content?

Where are Roseanne cast now?,"Roseanne cast - clockwise from top left: Roseanne Barr, John Goodman, Natalie West (we don't really remember her either), Lecy Goranson, Sara Gilbert, Michael Fishman, Laurie Metcalf They were one of America's favourite families in the late 1980s and '90s - with their affectionate bickering, everyday crises, growing pains and belly laughs beamed into more than 20 million homes in the US. Nowthe Conners are coming back, more than 20 years after the last episode of Roseanne was aired. All the original cast are returning - after getting up to some successful and surprising stuff in the intervening two decades. In another reality, instead of President Trump, we might now be talking about President Barr. In 2012, the real Roseanne ran for president. She didn't get very near the White House, though - she failed to gain the presidential nomination for the Green Party and ended up running for the Peace and Freedom Party, gaining 67,000 votes. As well as that, she's had her own talk show, done stand-up comedy, judged Last Comic Standing, hosted Momsters: When Moms Go Bad and starred in the reality show Roseanne's Nuts, about her macadamia nut farm in Hawaii. And in 2015, she revealed she has macular degeneration and glaucoma, saying at the time her vision was ""closing in now"". Goodman was brilliant as Roseanne's husband Dan and he's remained one of America's best-loved actors, plying his trade in films like The Big Lebowski, The Flintstones, 10 Cloverfield Lane and Kong: Skull Island. On TV, he's starred in political comedy Alpha House and middle-age coming-out sitcom Normal, Ohio - and reunited with Barr for a pilot of a sitcom called Downwardly Mobile in 2012. But it was never made into a series. That same year he spoke about a 30-year battle with alcoholism,telling the Guardian,external: ""It was becoming more and more debilitating. It was life or death. It was time to stop."" Metcalf found fame as Roseanne's little sister Jackie, but has certainly stepped out of her on-screen big sister's shadow. She's had Emmy nominations for guest spots in 3rd Rock from the Sun, Monk and Desperate Housewives - and in 2016 got a hat-trick of Emmy nominations in a single year, for Getting On, Big Bang Theory and Horace and Pete. On stage, she's had four Tony Award nominations for her appearances on Broadway - including for Misery in 2016 and A Doll's House, Part 2 this year. Gilbert, who played sardonic younger daughter Darlene, is now a co-host and executive producer of CBS talk show The Talk. She hosts with Sharon Osbourne, Aisha Tyler (both pictured), Sheryl Underwood and Julie Chen - who shared the Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding entertainment talk show host last month. She's also had parts in The Big Bang Theory, Twins, The Class and ER and has published a book called The Imperfect Environmentalist, A Practical Guide to Clearing Your Body, Detoxing Your Home, and Saving the Earth (Without Losing Your Mind). She's married to hit songwriter and one quarter of Four Non Blondes Linda Perry, and recently got together with John Goodman to give usa taste of what a Roseanne reunion might look like,external. DJ - Roseanne and Dan's son - is all grown up. Fishman, who started out in Roseanne at the age of six, went back to high school to study performing arts and technical theatre craft. He continued to have small roles in TV shows and films, and became a co-host on Barr's talk show. His Facebook biog,externalsays: ""In recent years Michael has continued his pursuit of acting while gaining technical acclaim with an eye toward producing and directing."" Lecy Goranson played older daughter Becky for five seasons until she went to college, after which Sarah Chalke took over the role. However, Goranson returned, on and off, towards the end of the show's life. Goranson will play Becky in the reboot. However, in a nice touch, ABC says Chalke will also appear, but in ""another role"". Since Roseanne, the actress has had small parts in films like Hilary Swank's Oscar winner Boys Don't Cry and guest starred in TV shows including Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Sex and the City. Not many people have had major parts in two of the biggest sitcoms in American TV history. But Galecki, who appeared as Darlene's boyfriend-then-husband David Healy in Roseanne, went on to (and still does) play Leonard in The Big Bang Theory. In between, he played Mark Corrigan in the (terrible looking,external) pilot for an American version of British comedy Peep Show. Reports say he's expected to return to Roseanne in some way - although this hasn't been confirmed by ABC.

North Koreans dare to criticise 'vampire leader',"This video can not be played 'Here there are a lot of government captures' Speaking to ordinary citizens inside North Korea is almost impossible, with visitors heavily policed and communication with the outside world blocked. But two residents were willing to speak to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, despite the threat of death or imprisonment. In North Korea, where leader Kim Jong-un has almost godlike status, to question him out loud is for many unthinkable. Citizens are taught he is all-knowing, and told to inform on dissenters - including their own family members. By speaking out, market trader Sun Hui - not her real name - knows she is putting her life at risk. ""Mostly, people criticise Kim Jong-un for being a businessman,"" she says, reflecting wider discontent. ""People say that he acts the same as us, but takes away our money. ""[They say] the little man uses his head to suck up money like a little vampire."" Over many months, the programme has been using a covert communications network to put questions to ordinary North Koreans. The BBC has taken steps to conceal their identities and to ensure their continued anonymity. If the regime knew of Sun Hui's real identity, she would face severe punishment - imprisonment in one of the regime's hard labour camps or even execution. And she may not be the only one to be punished - three generations of her family could also be sent to prison. This video can not be played North Koreans dare to criticise 'vampire leader' Sun Hui lives with her husband and two daughters, eating three meals a day when business is good. When it isn't, the rice is mixed with maize. At the markets where she works, street food, clothes and smuggled electronics are just some of the things sold. More than five million people are either ""directly or indirectly"" reliant on these general markets sanctioned by the regime, according to Daily NK. The Seoul-based media organisation reports on life inside North Korea and worked with the Victoria Derbyshire programme to facilitate the report using its network inside North Korea. The market trade in North Korea directly contradicts the regime's hard-line communism, but it also allows the population to feed itself amid a largely-defunct ration system and economic sanctions against the country. The regime cannot afford another instance like the ""the arduous march"" - the name given to the mid-90s famine that left more than a million people dead. Sun Hui says the number of local people who assess Kim Jong-un positively is increasing, because he leaves the markets alone and ""doesn't crack down much, no matter what we do"". What does Kim Jong-un really want? North Korea crisis in 300 words The word Trump and Kim can't agree on North Korea's leisure time revolution The markets, sometimes containing hundreds of stalls, can also be a breeding ground for gossip and rumour. ""I've heard at the market that the president of the US is coming,"" Sun Hui says. ""People don't know much about the meeting,"" she continues, ""but everyone dislikes America. ""We say the reason for us living in poverty is because America split us and sealed us off [from South Korea]."" North Korea blew up the tunnels at its nuclear test site last week Information going into the country is strictly controlled by the North Korean regime, whose propaganda is heavily critical of the US and its southern neighbour, South Korea. ""But things are changing a little recently,"" says Sun Hui. ""They say we should get along with the South. ""Recently they say we should be living in peace with America, for everyone to have a better life."" It is a significant development. While not unprecedented, this internal softening towards the West coupled with the supposed destruction of tunnels at a nuclear test site - which was seen as a goodwill gesture by the regime - points to Kim Jong-un being much more open to reconciling with the US. Despite it being called off, there are moves which suggest a summit between the North Korean leader and US President Donald Trump may yet happen. Chol Ho, who works in North Korea's military, says his hope from life is simply ""to live well without envy - until we die - without being sick"". He hopes the same lifestyle will be afforded to his parents, and his children. Chol Ho - not his real name - has also been speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme in secret, and says there is dissent within the country, from people who ""complain about their everyday lives"". ""Sometimes people get caught by the state security department, the Bowibu, for saying the wrong things,"" he explains. ""People do suddenly disappear, but it hasn't happened here recently."" Chol Ho says he has only ever met fellow North Koreans Those Chol Ho is referring to are often sent to the country's prison camps - where it has been reported that detainees are subjected to torture, forced to dig their own graves, and rape is used as punishment. A single camp can hold as many as 20,000 inmates, according to Amnesty International. It is the ""terror"" of such camps that ""keeps society going"", according to Sun Hui. She says ""there's a lot of government captures"" where she lives. Chol Ho believes some people are sent there by the Bowibu because officials ""make up stories for their own performance"". ""They make people say that they were planning to go to China, and then report them,"" he says. Watching films and TV shows smuggled in from abroad can lead to 10 years imprisonment in the country's hard labour camps. The regime fights hard to prevent the consumption of foreign media, as it undermines its anti-Western propaganda, but many are successfully brought in through China on USB sticks or counterfeit DVDs. ""Korean things are the most popular of course,"" says Sun Hui, who admits to sometimes watching Korean dramas and foreign films at night. ""But the crackdown on them is strong. ""I've heard the cost of bribes if you're caught is huge, but people still want to watch them. ""It's easy to understand, and people are curious about how South Koreans live."" But while an increasing number of North Koreans are able to get a glimpse of life outside their country, many still do not know how they themselves are perceived. Chol Ho admits he knows nothing of how citizens like him are viewed by the outside world. He has only met North Koreans. But he insists while life ""is difficultâ¦ our people are nice"". ""We have a saying that neighbours are better than cousins. If something happens to our neighbours we visit each other,"" he says. In some parts of the country, residents defect to South Korea via China, risking their life. In recent years the number of people defecting has fallen, largely because of increased border security and a widely-criticised agreement with the Chinese to repatriate North Koreans found in the country. Where Sun Hui lives, away from the country's borders, defections ""do not happen here much"", she says. But when they do, those left behind do not refer to South Korea by its name. ""When a neighbour disappears we just say, 'He went to Lower Town',"" she explains. None of the people appearing in our videos were contributors or involved in any way.

"Death crash driver 'had drugs in system'A coroner says ""excessive speed"" caused the crash that killed six people in Birmingham.5h5 hours agoBirmingham & Black Country","Six people were killed when the suspected drug dealers' car ploughed into the side of the taxi A driver who died along with five others when he lost control of his Audi at 100mph had cannabis in his system, an inquest has heard. Birmingham Coroner's Court heard Kasar Jehangir's car ploughed sideways into a taxi coming the other way on Belgrave Middleway in Birmingham in December. Taxi driver Imtiaz Mohammed, 33, was killed, along with passengers Lucy Davis and her partner Lee Jenkins. A coroner concluded that the trio in the taxi died as a result of a crash. Senior coroner Louise Hunt said: ""Fundamentally, the cause of the collision was as a result of excessive speed."" She added that raised levels of chemical THC, from cannabis, found in Mr Jehangir's system ""contributed to the manner of driving, and therefore contributed to the collision"". She said: ""Before the collision occurred, it's likely the Audi was travelling between 94mph and 100mph in a 40mph limit."" Midlands Live: New M5-M6 link road plans; Floods clear-up could cost Â£10m Lee Jenkins's family said he was ""full of life"" in a statement read at the inquest PC Keith Evans told the inquest the Mr Jehangir and two of his passengers Tauqeer Hussain, 26, and Mohammed Fahsha, 30, were all thrown from the high-powered Audi S3 and suffered fatal ""catastrophic head injuries"". The only survivor from the Audi, Zakkria Khan, 18, denied that the car's occupants had been out dealing drugs, but admitted he had smoked some. However, Sgt Alan Hands told the inquest: ""Based on the movements of the vehicle, intelligence surrounding this vehicle and the occupants, it would be a reasonable grounds to suspect they were in the area, dealing drugs from that car."" Tests found Mr Mohammed had traces of cocaine and another substance in his system, though this was ""not a factor"" in the crash on 17 December according to the collision investigator. The inquest heard Mr Mohammed was not wearing his seat belt, but it would not have made a difference. He and his passengers Ms Davis, a 43-year-old mother of two, and 42-year-old nuclear physicist Mr Jenkins - who were both wearing belts - all died from multiple injuries. Imtiaz Mohammed's family said he was ""working hard to make a living and provide for his family"" Mr Jehangir's Audi had two defective tyres and no-one in the car was wearing a seat belt, the inquest heard. The coroner was told he was also found to have been carrying about Â£1,000 in cash. The inquests of the Audi's occupants are due on Wednesday. The driver and passenger of a Toyota Yaris, which was struck by the taxi, suffered only slight injuries. In a statement read at the hearing, Mr Jenkins's family said: ""It is perhaps fitting Lee would find love with Lucy, someone equally positive, full of life and who shared a love of doing things.""

Trump calls to congratulate Roseanne,"Barr (left) has declared herself to be a supporter of President Trump The ratings success of Roseanne Barr's return to her self-titled TV sitcom prompted President Donald Trump to give her a congratulatory phone call. Mr Trump confirmed at a speech in Ohio that the call had taken place. The return of Barr's 1990s sitcom after 20 years away drew an audience of more than 18 million viewers on Tuesday. The first two episodes of the revived show's nine-episode run reintroduced Barr's blue-collar heroine, Roseanne Conner, as a Trump-supporting granny. John Goodman (centre) reprises his role as Dan in the rebooted sitcom It also saw the return of John Goodman as Roseanne's husband Dan alongside such other series regulars as Laurie Metcalf and Sara Gilbert. Mr Trump celebrated the ratings success at a speech on infrastructure in Ohio on Thursday. ""Even look at Roseanne, I called her yesterday. Look at her ratings! Look at her ratings! I got a call from Mark Burnett, he did The Apprentice. He's a great guy. He said, 'Donald, I called just to say hello and to tell you did you see Roseanne's ratings?'"" Mr Trump said, referring to his reality show. ""They were unbelievable,"" Mr Trump continued, ""Over 18 million people. And it was about us."" Speaking to the Times this week, Barr - a Trump supporter herself - said she felt it was ""important"" to reflect Trump's appeal to working class Americans. ""I just wanted to have that dialogue about families torn apart by the election and their political differences of opinion and how we handle it,"" she said. Roseanne's political allegiances have been the subject of heated debate on social media this week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Roseanne cast: Where are they now?,"Roseanne cast - clockwise from top left: Roseanne Barr, John Goodman, Natalie West (we don't really remember her either), Lecy Goranson, Sara Gilbert, Michael Fishman, Laurie Metcalf They were one of America's favourite families in the late 1980s and '90s - with their affectionate bickering, everyday crises, growing pains and belly laughs beamed into more than 20 million homes in the US. Nowthe Conners are coming back, more than 20 years after the last episode of Roseanne was aired. All the original cast are returning - after getting up to some successful and surprising stuff in the intervening two decades. In another reality, instead of President Trump, we might now be talking about President Barr. In 2012, the real Roseanne ran for president. She didn't get very near the White House, though - she failed to gain the presidential nomination for the Green Party and ended up running for the Peace and Freedom Party, gaining 67,000 votes. As well as that, she's had her own talk show, done stand-up comedy, judged Last Comic Standing, hosted Momsters: When Moms Go Bad and starred in the reality show Roseanne's Nuts, about her macadamia nut farm in Hawaii. And in 2015, she revealed she has macular degeneration and glaucoma, saying at the time her vision was ""closing in now"". Goodman was brilliant as Roseanne's husband Dan and he's remained one of America's best-loved actors, plying his trade in films like The Big Lebowski, The Flintstones, 10 Cloverfield Lane and Kong: Skull Island. On TV, he's starred in political comedy Alpha House and middle-age coming-out sitcom Normal, Ohio - and reunited with Barr for a pilot of a sitcom called Downwardly Mobile in 2012. But it was never made into a series. That same year he spoke about a 30-year battle with alcoholism,telling the Guardian,external: ""It was becoming more and more debilitating. It was life or death. It was time to stop."" Metcalf found fame as Roseanne's little sister Jackie, but has certainly stepped out of her on-screen big sister's shadow. She's had Emmy nominations for guest spots in 3rd Rock from the Sun, Monk and Desperate Housewives - and in 2016 got a hat-trick of Emmy nominations in a single year, for Getting On, Big Bang Theory and Horace and Pete. On stage, she's had four Tony Award nominations for her appearances on Broadway - including for Misery in 2016 and A Doll's House, Part 2 this year. Gilbert, who played sardonic younger daughter Darlene, is now a co-host and executive producer of CBS talk show The Talk. She hosts with Sharon Osbourne, Aisha Tyler (both pictured), Sheryl Underwood and Julie Chen - who shared the Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding entertainment talk show host last month. She's also had parts in The Big Bang Theory, Twins, The Class and ER and has published a book called The Imperfect Environmentalist, A Practical Guide to Clearing Your Body, Detoxing Your Home, and Saving the Earth (Without Losing Your Mind). She's married to hit songwriter and one quarter of Four Non Blondes Linda Perry, and recently got together with John Goodman to give usa taste of what a Roseanne reunion might look like,external. DJ - Roseanne and Dan's son - is all grown up. Fishman, who started out in Roseanne at the age of six, went back to high school to study performing arts and technical theatre craft. He continued to have small roles in TV shows and films, and became a co-host on Barr's talk show. His Facebook biog,externalsays: ""In recent years Michael has continued his pursuit of acting while gaining technical acclaim with an eye toward producing and directing."" Lecy Goranson played older daughter Becky for five seasons until she went to college, after which Sarah Chalke took over the role. However, Goranson returned, on and off, towards the end of the show's life. Goranson will play Becky in the reboot. However, in a nice touch, ABC says Chalke will also appear, but in ""another role"". Since Roseanne, the actress has had small parts in films like Hilary Swank's Oscar winner Boys Don't Cry and guest starred in TV shows including Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Sex and the City. Not many people have had major parts in two of the biggest sitcoms in American TV history. But Galecki, who appeared as Darlene's boyfriend-then-husband David Healy in Roseanne, went on to (and still does) play Leonard in The Big Bang Theory. In between, he played Mark Corrigan in the (terrible looking,external) pilot for an American version of British comedy Peep Show. Reports say he's expected to return to Roseanne in some way - although this hasn't been confirmed by ABC.

Italy crisis hits financial marketsFears over political unrest in Italy spreads to Wall Street after Europe's main markets close lower.24m25 minutes agoBusiness,"Former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli was named prime minister-designate Fears over Italy's political upheaval spread to Wall Street after Europe's financial markets closed lower. The prospect of fresh electionsand the possibility of eurosceptic parties strengthening their position has raised concern about the eurozone's stability. The Dow Jones index shed 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%, coming after Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 2.7% and Europe's other main markets shed well over 1%. A sell-off in Italian bonds saw the yield on two-year debt breach 2%. It meant that short-term Italian bonds suffered their biggest one-day jump in 26 years. Movements in bond prices are important as they affect the cost of borrowing for the government. Italy's debt currently stands at 130% of its economic output. The bond sell-off hit the share prices of European banks exposed to government debt, especially those in Italy. Banco BPM, Banco Generali, Unicredit  and BPER Banca closed down between 5% and 6.7%. On Wall Street, JP Morgan was down 3.7%, and Bank of America and Citigroup were just more than 3% lower. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3%. Falling bank shares dragged down Europe's main share markets. At the close the UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1.3%, while Germany's Dax was down 1.5% and France's Cac 1.3% lower. ""It's a market that is totally in panic"", said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, who noted ""a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances"". Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in the US, said:  ""If the political situation in Italy worsens, the longer-term spillovers would be felt in the US via a stronger dollar and lower European growth."" What is Italy's political crisis all about? Call to impeach Italian president Italy's economy in charts The turmoil was precipitated after the anti-establishment Five Star and League political parties abandoned their attempts to form a ruling coalition after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella. He had vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic economy minister, and appointed former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister with the task of trying to form a government. But his term is likely to be cut short, as he will almost certainly lose a parliamentary vote of confidence. If he does, then new elections would soon follow. How bad is the financial situation in Italy? There is no question that the political crisis has led financial market investors to judge that the risks have increased markedly. The rise in Italian government bond yields has been very sharp and tells us that there is increased nervousness about the outlook. But we are not - not yet at least - anywhere near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12. At the time there was an informal rule of thumb sometimes used, that countries were likely to need a bailout if the yield on their ten year bonds - essentially the annual cost of borrowing money for ten years - was sustained at more than 7%. Italy did hit that level briefly in that earlier episode.  But it's currently around 3%. Higher than it was - but not yet flashing red. Five Star and the League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in March's election, and could increase their combined majority in a new national poll. ""We've seen a steep sell-off in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com ""The moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the eurozone debt crisis. ""The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe."" Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans. The leftistManifestonewspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire.""

Italy crisis hits financial marketsFears over political unrest in Italy spreads to Wall Street after Europe's main markets close lower.14m15 minutes agoBusiness,"Former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli was named prime minister-designate Fears over Italy's political upheaval spread to Wall Street after Europe's financial markets closed lower. The prospect of fresh electionsand the possibility of eurosceptic parties strengthening their position has raised concern about the eurozone's stability. The Dow Jones index shed 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%, coming after Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 2.7% and Europe's other main markets shed well over 1%. A sell-off in Italian bonds saw the yield on two-year debt breach 2%. It meant that short-term Italian bonds suffered their biggest one-day jump in 26 years. Movements in bond prices are important as they affect the cost of borrowing for the government. Italy's debt currently stands at 130% of its economic output. The bond sell-off hit the share prices of European banks exposed to government debt, especially those in Italy. Banco BPM, Banco Generali, Unicredit  and BPER Banca closed down between 5% and 6.7%. On Wall Street, JP Morgan was down 3.7%, and Bank of America and Citigroup were just more than 3% lower. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3%. Falling bank shares dragged down Europe's main share markets. At the close the UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1.3%, while Germany's Dax was down 1.5% and France's Cac 1.3% lower. ""It's a market that is totally in panic"", said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, who noted ""a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances"". Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in the US, said:  ""If the political situation in Italy worsens, the longer-term spillovers would be felt in the US via a stronger dollar and lower European growth."" What is Italy's political crisis all about? Call to impeach Italian president Italy's economy in charts The turmoil was precipitated after the anti-establishment Five Star and League political parties abandoned their attempts to form a ruling coalition after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella. He had vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic economy minister, and appointed former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister with the task of trying to form a government. But his term is likely to be cut short, as he will almost certainly lose a parliamentary vote of confidence. If he does, then new elections would soon follow. How bad is the financial situation in Italy? There is no question that the political crisis has led financial market investors to judge that the risks have increased markedly. The rise in Italian government bond yields has been very sharp and tells us that there is increased nervousness about the outlook. But we are not - not yet at least - anywhere near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12. At the time there was an informal rule of thumb sometimes used, that countries were likely to need a bailout if the yield on their ten year bonds - essentially the annual cost of borrowing money for ten years - was sustained at more than 7%. Italy did hit that level briefly in that earlier episode.  But it's currently around 3%. Higher than it was - but not yet flashing red. Five Star and the League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in March's election, and could increase their combined majority in a new national poll. ""We've seen a steep sell-off in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com ""The moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the eurozone debt crisis. ""The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe."" Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans. The leftistManifestonewspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire."" The centrist dailyCorriere Della Serasuggests that Mr Cottarelli will be a ""steady hand at the wheel, in market waters that promise to be rough"", but that it will be difficult for him operate because he will be ""a prime minister without trust"".

Saudi Arabia to criminalise sexual harassmentSocial media users discuss new plans to combat sexual harassment in the kingdom6h6 hours ago,"In January 2018 women in Saudi Arabia were allowed to watch football matches at stadiums The Shura Council of Saudi Arabia, the country's formal consultative body, has approved a law to criminalise sexual harassment in the kingdom. The aims of the measure are ""fighting the crime of harassment, preventing it, punishing perpetrators and protecting victims in order to preserve the privacy, dignity and individual freedoms as guaranteed by Islamic jurisprudence and regulations in place"". It was drafted by the Interior Ministry after instructions from King Salman, according to local media reports. However, with men and women barred from intermingling in the strictly conservative Islamic kingdom, Saudis on social media have, largely, responded with humour. You may be also be interested in: Bulgarians tweeting in Cyrillic confused for Russian bots Arrested Development stars slammed for downplaying harassment Teaching boys not to 'stalk for love' The law provides for penalties of up to two years in prison and fines which could amount to $26,600 (Â£19,641). In some cases, such as repeat offenders, the sentence could be increased to five years in prison and fines of up to $80,000. The bill, which preserves the anonymity of alleged victims, also criminalises incitement to sexual harassment, as well as falsely reporting an incident to the authorities. It also stipulates alleged victims cannot withdraw a complaint or fail to report an incident to the police. The document also creates an obligation for public and private institutions to make all necessary arrangements to prevent harassment. In April 2018, the country lifted its 35-year ban on cinemas Saudis took to Twitter with the Arabic hashtag ""anti-harassment law"", using it over 29,200 times over the past few hours. The tone was mostly humorous as users tweeted self-deprecating jokes with the term ""sorry girls"". ""I'm sorry girls. Do unfollow me please. Women followers are no longer welcome,""@fantasticSaeed tweeted.,external Abdulrahman tweeted:,external""When they drafted the law, I remembered I don't talk to girls in the first place."" @majed_9_4shared an animated video,externalwhich shows a SWAT team storming a man's flat after he mistakenly sends a heart emoji to a friend.

""Those who were not disciplined by their parent have a government to discipline them. The daughters of people are not toys for you to insult.""@nnawafaliissa tweeted alongside pictures,externalof the crown prince and an infographic of the proposed law. @khaledomar1996 expected,external""harassment will disappear after this deterrent regulation"". However, the jokes werelost on some users, such as @tq_turki,,externalwho warned ""mocking and making light of state affairs and regulations and spreading memes via social media falls under the offence of undermining public morals in the anti-cyber criminality law"". Some users were also quick to demand restrictions on the behaviour they blame for sexual harassment. In February, female Muslim pilgrims used the hashtag #MosqueMeTooto share their experiences of sexual harassmentduring the Hajj pilgrimage and journeys to other religious sites. Mona Elthahawy, an Egyptian-American feminist and journalist,talked about her experience,externalof sexual assault during Hajj in 2013. Last week in Saudi Arabiaat least 11 women's rights activists were reportedly arrestedin a crackdown, according to human rights groups. Most of them were women who campaigned for the right to drive.

Who was behind attacks on West?,"A series of attacks in Europe over the summer months has raised the number of people killed in the West by jihadists during the past three years to more than 420, writes Dr Lorenzo Vidino. The deaths of 16 people in Barcelona and Cambrils earlier this month highlighted the continued threat posed by Islamist militants. The summer months have also seen new attacks inBelgium,France,Austria,external,Germanyandthe UK, as well as the first inFinlandand one inthe US. Although the vastmajority of Islamist attacks are elsewhere in the world, an unprecedented number have taken place in Europe and North America since thedeclaration of a ""caliphate"" by the so-called Islamic State, in June 2014. Thefirst look at the data behind the attacks,external- everything from the age of the perpetrators, to immigration status - offers an insight into those responsible and how they might be tackled. We identified 63 attacks between September 2014 and late August 2017 that we considered to be acts of jihadist terrorism. A relatively limited number of countries were affected: nine in Europe - those named above, plusDenmarkandSweden- along with the US and Canada. Flowers and a flag left near the Orlando nightclub where an Islamist gunman killed 49 people in June 2016 Regardless of country, most attacks were in large towns and cities - including Barcelona, London, Manchester, Paris, Nice, Berlin, Brussels, Stockholm and Orlando. A few attacks hit iconic targets, such as theChamps-Elyseesand theLouvre museumin Paris,Westminster in LondonandLas Ramblas in Barcelona. Many others targeted crowded spaces such as busy pedestrian areas, entertainment venues or transport hubs. But some terrorist attacks have hit more unusual places, including anoffice Christmas partyand aservice at a church. We looked at attacks motivated by jihadist ideology, that involved deliberate acts of violence against other people and were intended to intimidate or convey a message to a larger group. Other organisations use different definitions. Researchers used open-source material and interviews with officials It is possible that some attacks did not come to our attention, or that full details are not available The research covers the US, Canada and the 28 member states of the EU, plus Norway and Switzerland Attacks motivated by other ideologies - such asthe murder of Jo Cox- are not included in this study In total, the 63 attacks caused 424 deaths and left almost 1,800 people injured. The perpetrators are not included in these figures. TheParis attack of November 2015was the deadliest, with 130 people killed, including90 at the Bataclan theatre. France also saw theNice lorry attack, which left 86 people dead. 14 July 2016: A lorry ploughed into a crowd in the French Riviera town of Nice There were many other attacks that left many people dead and others injured. InOrlando, 49 people were killedin an attack on a gay nightclub Bombings atBrussels airport and at a metro stationleft 32 people dead 14 people were killed at aChristmas party in San Bernardino, California 12 people died when a lorry was driven into a crowdedChristmas market in Berlin 12 people died when the Paris offices ofCharlie Hebdowere attacked in January 2015 Five people were killed in theWestminster attackin April TheManchester Arena bombingin May led to 22 deaths TheLondon Bridge attackin June left eight people dead The attacks inBarcelona and Cambrilsleft 16 people dead In total, these 11 attacks were responsible for 386 deaths. However, most of the attacks did not cause casualties, with the exclusion of the perpetrators. Although thenumber of young people being radicalised has caused concern, the average age of the attackers - 27.5 - is not unusually young. The two youngest were 15 - an unnamed boywho attacked a Jewish teacher with a machetein Marseille, and Safia S,a girl who stabbed a police officerat a Hannover train station. Of the five who were under the age of 18 at the time, four were in Germany. The vast majority of the attackers were in their 20s, with about one in four attackers above the age of 30 and six aged 40 or older. The oldest suspect, Mohamed H Khalid, was 54 when he was accused of stabbing to death anelderly couple in the Austrian city of Linz,external. In the UK,Khalid Masood, was 52 when he drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer at the Houses of Parliament. Despitewomen becoming increasingly active in jihadist networks, only two out of 85 individual perpetrators were female. Fewer than one in five perpetrators was a convert to Islam, with a significantly higher percentage in North America than in Europe. However, the converts were significantly more likely to have a criminal background and to have served time in prison. Overall, half of the attackers had a prior criminal background. How can police stop terror suspects travelling? Is terror more of a threat to Europe than before? Terror deaths in Western Europe at highest level since 2004 Can you monitor every suspect? The relationship between terrorism and migration is a complex one and has been at the centre of extremely polarising debates, particularly during theEuropean migrant crisis. However, the number of attackers who were illegally in a country or who arrived as refugees is small. Two-thirds were citizens of the country they attacked, with others either legal residents, or legal visitors from neighbouring countries. However, individuals who were in the West illegally also carried out deadly attacks. November 2015: Tributes left in Paris following attacks that left 130 people dead At least two of those involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks arethought to have posed as refugeesto enter Europe through Greece. Three other individuals were refugees or asylum seekers at the time of attack, while seven were in the country illegally or awaiting deportation. The latter group includes Uzbek nationalRakhmat Akilov, who killed four people with a hijacked lorry in Stockholm in April 2017, and Tunisian citizenAnis Amri, who also used a lorry to commit his attack at the Berlin Christmas market. Wreckage from an attack on a Berlin Christmas market, December 2016 There is also one case of ""terrorist tourism"", involving Egyptian citizenAbdullah Hamamy, who lived in the United Arab Emirates and attacked soldiers at the Louvre in February 2017. Two of the four most lethal attacks - those in Paris in November 2015 and in Brussels in 2016 - are believed to bewell orchestrated multiple attacks directed by IS,external. 22 March 2016: A security guard helps a wounded woman after the attack on the Brussels metro system They were also executed in part by former foreign fighters. However, the two other most deadly attacks - those in Orlando in June 2016 and in Nice in July 2016 - were carried out independently by individuals without operational connection to a jihadist group. These episodes demonstrate that terrorist sympathisers who never travelled to conflict areas and who act independently can be as dangerous as a team of highly trained militants. Overall, links between attackers and jihadist groups operating overseas are not always easy to determine. Of the attacks that have hit the West since June 2014, fewer than one in 10 was carried out under direct orders from the leadership of IS. In some cases it can be difficult to tell, for example IS said it was behind both the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, but it did not provide any evidence. Nevertheless, the influence of IS can be clearly seen. During or before the attack, six out of 10 perpetrators pledged allegiance to a jihadist group, almost always IS - which frequently claims responsibility. Unsurprisingly, given the frequency of attacks and the number of deaths and injuries, jihadist terrorism has come to the fore of political debates in the West and receives widespread news coverage. The threat is not expected to wane in the near future, with policymakers, counter-terrorism officials and the public all being asked to take action. 22 March 2017: Westminster Bridge following a terror attack There are huge implications for domestic and foreign policy throughout Western countries. It is hoped that knowing more about the attacks and the people who carried them out will help us all have a more informed debate about what action is needed.

Belgium country profile,"For such a small country, Belgium has been a major European battleground over the centuries. Occupied by Germany during both world wars, it experienced an economic boom in the post-war years to become a model Western European liberal democracy.

Twitter 'bans women against trans ideology',"An open letter to Martha Lane Fox urges her to ""speak out against this new wave of misogyny"" Twitter is banning women who ""speak out against the dangerous dogma of trans ideology"", a feminist group has said. In a letter,externalto Twitter director Martha Lane Fox,Fair Play for Women,externalsays the company is allowing ""a concerted attack on women's free speech"". But trans activist Ashleigh Talbot said the group's letter seeks to ""whip up"" hatred against trans people. Twitter said its rules are enforced equally for every user, regardless of the commentary they engage in. Fair Play for Women describes itself as a group of ""ordinary women"" who argue that ""in the rush to reform transgender laws"" women's voices will not be listened to. It says Twitter users have been banned for stating ""basic, incontrovertible biological facts"" such as saying men are not women. Their letter links to comments, that it says has led to people being banned from the site: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Transsexual writer Miranda Yardleysaid she was banned from Twitter,externalfor stating that Green Party LGBT spokesperson Aimee Challenor, a trans woman, is a man. Writing on her blog she said: ""According to the rules of Twitter it is now hateful conduct to call someone who is a man, a man. ""The implication of this is that the concept of proscribed speech, things we are now not allowed to say, now extends to the truth. This is fundamentally illiberal."" Fair Play for Women also said women receive abuse for talking ""about their biology"" - including being threatened with violence and referred to as Terfs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists). The Green Party's Aimee Challenor said: ""Miranda Yardley's comments about me are abusive and damaging. Twitter is right to take action against this form of online harassment which goes against Twitter's rules."" Fair Play for Women has called on Martha Lane Fox - who is also a member of the House of Lords - to use her position in Twitter to ""stop allowing bullying men to police our language, threaten us and abuse us"". But trans activist Ashleigh Talbot said the letter ""seeks to do nothing but whip up further hatred against trans and non-binary people by calling us dangerous"". Trans activist Ashleigh Talbot disagrees with the arguments made in the letter sent to Martha Lane Fox She said many of those who say their free speech is being curtailed ""are often doing so from a regular column in a national newspaper or from a national radio programme"". ""Every week for the last few months there have been anti-trans attack pieces in the Mail, Times, Telegraph, Sun and so on,"" she said. She added that trans people represent a ""small, vulnerable community"" who are subject to ""bile day in and day out in the media"". Twitter did not want to comment on the letter but said it does not suspend accounts for being feminist, and that it would only ever suspend accounts for violating their rules. It said the rules are enforced equally for every user regardless of the commentary they engage in. The BBC has contacted Martha Lane Fox for a comment. Currently, if someone wishes to have their gender identity legally recognised they have to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate -a process LGBT campaigning group Stonewall describes as,external""long, demeaning and bureaucratic"". Stonewall is calling for a system of gender recognition based on self-identification, and wants to remove the requirement for a medical diagnosis before a transgender person can change their legally recognised gender. The organisation says changing the law would make life easier for trans people and ""barely affect"" non-trans people - also known as ""cis"" people. In July 2017 then Equalities Minister Justine Greening saidthe Gender Recognition Act needed to be updated and that a consultation would begin in the autumn. The Scottish government is currentlyconsulting on gender recognition.,external The campaigning group Man Friday argues allowing people to self-identify as a particular gender ""removes any gatekeeping to women's identity and protected spaces"". To protest against any change to the law, the group choose Fridays to identify as men and take part in activities such as using male changing rooms. On Friday a group of women attempted to access the men's only bathing pond in Hampstead Heath as part of a protest against self-identification. Allow Twitter content?

Paris boy's family thank Mali 'Spiderman',"This video can not be played Malian ""Spiderman"" rescues Paris child - then meets French president The family of a small boy dramatically rescued after dangling from a balcony in Paris, France have expressed their thanks to the Malian man who saved him. ""He's truly a hero,"" the boy's grandmother said of migrant Mamoudou Gassama, who scaled four floors to pluck the child from danger. The four-year-old's father, who had left him in their flat and gone shopping, faces charges of failing to look after his child, reports say. Mr Gassama will be given citizenship. French President Emmanuel Macron personally thanked him, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service. Mr Macron personally thanked Mr Gassama More details have begun to emerge of the circumstances surrounding the incident. The boy left RÃ©union, where his mother and grandmother live, about three weeks ago and moved to Paris to join his father, who works in the city. His mother and the couple's second child were due to join them in June. The father lived on the sixth-floor of the building in northern Paris, the building's concierge told BFMTV. How case shines light on today's France Travelling is a rite of passage for many Malians The boy had already fallen two storeys before somehow managing to grab hold of the fourth-floor balcony, according to this version of events. When asked by a resident in the neighbouring fourth-floor flat where he lived,he is reported to have pointed upwards,external. His mother told Antenne RÃ©union thatthe boy's father was not used to looking after him on his own,externaland had left him alone before. ""I can't justify what my husband did. People will say it could have happened to anyone and it has happened to other people. My son was just lucky,"" she said. After doing the shopping, the boy's father had delayed going home to play Pokemon Go, prosecutors said. Some reaction to the incident has focused on a man on the balcony of the neighbouring fourth-floor flat, who appears to be close enough to the boy to lift him before Mr Gassama arrives. But the neighbour told Le Parisien newspaper thathe was holding on to the boy's hand but could not pull him up,externalbecause of a divider separating the two balconies. ""I didn't want to take the risk of letting go of his hand, I thought it better to do things step by step,"" he said. He said the boy had been wearing a Spiderman outfit, was bleeding from his toe and had a torn nail. Firefighters came into his flat and climbed over the balcony divider to reach the boy and Mr Gassama, he said. He has been taken into care by the French authorities, French media said. The father is reported to have been left devastated,externalby what happened, BFMTV said. The French offence of failing in one's legal duty as a parent can be punished by two years in prison and a fine of â¬30,000 ($35,000; Â£26,000). Mr Gassama was awarded a certificate of courage and dedication by Paris police His mother is also due to be interviewed by social workers in RÃ©union, Antenne RÃ©union said. Speaking to French TV station RMC, the boy's grandmother described how she felt seeing the video of her grandson hanging off the balcony. ""My God, I was very shocked. My grandson, my grandson, save him!"" she said. ""Thankfully he [Mr Gassama] knew how to climb, because there were a lot of people below but he didn't just fold his arms. He raced up to the fourth floor. That was truly incredible. He was very brave,"" she said. The 22-year-old left the town of Yaguine in south-western Mali as a teenager in 2013. He took the migrant route across the Sahara desert,externalthrough Burkina Faso, Niger and Libya, and crossed the Mediterranean to Italy in 2014 at the second attempt after having once been intercepted at sea by police. ""I had no means to live and no-one to help me,"" Mr Gassama told Mr Macron. During his journey, he spent a year working in Libya, where migrants are frequently exploited and even enslaved by gangs. ""I suffered a lot. We were caught and beaten but I did not lose hope,"" he said. 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre He told Mr Macron that he had travelled to France because he did not know anyone in Italy and his brother had been living in France for many years. In Paris he worked cash-in-hand on building sites and lived in a hostel in the eastern suburb of Montreuil - known as ""little Bamako"" because of its large Malian population. He had not applied for asylum and was living illegally in France. In the hostel, he has been sharing a room with relatives and sleeping on a mattress on the floor. Mr Gassama (R) met Mr Bathily for advice on how to handle his sudden fame On MondayMr Gassama met another Malian migrant given French citizenship for his acts of courage,external- Lassana Bathily, who helped customers in a Jewish supermarket in western Paris hide when a supporter of the Islamic State group took hostages there in 2015. Muslim tells of hiding Jewish shoppers Mr Bathily, who has written a book about his experience, said Mr Gassama was ""still in a state of emotion"" following his daring rescue. ""He asked me about my experience and what I went through during the attack to get some advice,"" Mr Bathily told BFMTV. ""We weren't in it for anything but afterwards everyone was interested in us. ""He reacted like a human being. He didn't think it would become a media event."" On Tuesday Mr Gassama received French residency, a first step towards citizenship. He also signed a contract for an internship with the Paris fire service. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Crunch' heard before sinkhole opened,"The road sank slowly for about 45 minutes before the collapse, a witness said Ten homes have been evacuated after a large sinkhole opened up in a main road. Witnesses described a police car overtaking vehicles and blocking the A26, in Kent, just before part of the road collapsed into a void. Motorists said they heard a ""crunching sound"" before the 2m (6ft)-wide sinkhole appeared on Monday evening. Work to repair the void, which could extend for up to 20m (65ft) underground, is likely to take weeks. Lauren Bourke was in a car with her fiance when the stretch of road between Maidstone and Tonbridge began to dip. She said: ""The bottom of a bus hit the dipping tarmac and made a slight crunching sound which is when we knew the road definitely wasn't safe. ""A police car overtook us and stopped in front of us. ""He got out and blocked the road off. ""It was sinking for about 45 minutes and then all of a sudden the tarmac split and it just went within five minutes. Then the left hand side started sinking too but didn't drop completely."" The road began to give way with ""crunching"" noises Toby Howe, senior highways manager at Kent County Council (KCC), said the damage outside the Taj Barming restaurant was ""substantial"". ""Our preliminary investigations suggest that this void extends either side of the road from kerb to kerb for a total distance of 20 metres,"" he said. Mr Howe said teams would attempt to establish the cause of the collapse before working on repairs. He added: ""In addition, there are utility supplies of gas, electric and water in the vicinity so we will need them to be involved too."" Restaurant manager Mabs Salam said the sinkhole was about 6m (21ft) from their main entrance, but the business would open as planned on Tuesday night. He said visitors could use the back entrance and staff who lived upstairs had decided to sleep at the back of the building. ""It's like something you would see after an earthquake,"" he said. ""We're used to seeing potholes, but this is massive."" He said no-one had been allowed close enough to see to the bottom of the hole. The restaurant building had some cracks, he added, and the business had been advised to contact KCC's insurance department. Mr Salam said officials had advised the restaurant not to let anyone stay in the building overnight and had said if the business stayed open it was its own risk. He said he was waiting to hear from the restaurant owner and staff had made their own decision to stay upstairs. Festival death dad 'held dying son's hand' Woman breaks arm during arm wrestle Missing-from-care alerts rise 'worrying' A spokeswoman for Maidstone council said 10 properties had been evacuated and it was not known how long for. She said KCC as the highways authority would make a full assessment on Wednesday.

Saudi Arabia to criminalise sexual harassment,"In January 2018 women in Saudi Arabia were allowed to watch football matches at stadiums The Shura Council of Saudi Arabia, the country's formal consultative body, has approved a law to criminalise sexual harassment in the kingdom. The aims of the measure are ""fighting the crime of harassment, preventing it, punishing perpetrators and protecting victims in order to preserve the privacy, dignity and individual freedoms as guaranteed by Islamic jurisprudence and regulations in place"". It was drafted by the Interior Ministry after instructions from King Salman, according to local media reports. However, with men and women barred from intermingling in the strictly conservative Islamic kingdom, Saudis on social media have, largely, responded with humour. You may be also be interested in: Bulgarians tweeting in Cyrillic confused for Russian bots Arrested Development stars slammed for downplaying harassment Teaching boys not to 'stalk for love' The law provides for penalties of up to two years in prison and fines which could amount to $26,600 (Â£19,641). In some cases, such as repeat offenders, the sentence could be increased to five years in prison and fines of up to $80,000. The bill, which preserves the anonymity of alleged victims, also criminalises incitement to sexual harassment, as well as falsely reporting an incident to the authorities. It also stipulates alleged victims cannot withdraw a complaint or fail to report an incident to the police. The document also creates an obligation for public and private institutions to make all necessary arrangements to prevent harassment. In April 2018, the country lifted its 35-year ban on cinemas Saudis took to Twitter with the Arabic hashtag ""anti-harassment law"", using it over 29,200 times over the past few hours. The tone was mostly humorous as users tweeted self-deprecating jokes with the term ""sorry girls"". ""I'm sorry girls. Do unfollow me please. Women followers are no longer welcome,""@fantasticSaeed tweeted.,external Abdulrahman tweeted:,external""When they drafted the law, I remembered I don't talk to girls in the first place."" @majed_9_4shared an animated video,externalwhich shows a SWAT team storming a man's flat after he mistakenly sends a heart emoji to a friend. Ashwaqshared a comic strip,externalshowing a glum man telling a burly cellmate he was imprisoned for sending a heart emoji to a girl, shocking the hardened criminal. Saudi women are expected to be allowed to drive cars in Saudi Arabia from June Other users celebrated the perceived progress, with some crediting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the move. ""Those who were not disciplined by their parent have a government to discipline them. The daughters of people are not toys for you to insult.""@nnawafaliissa tweeted alongside pictures,externalof the crown prince and an infographic of the proposed law. @khaledomar1996 expected,external""harassment will disappear after this deterrent regulation"". However, the jokes werelost on some users, such as @tq_turki,,externalwho warned ""mocking and making light of state affairs and regulations and spreading memes via social media falls under the offence of undermining public morals in the anti-cyber criminality law"". Some users were also quick to demand restrictions on the behaviour they blame for sexual harassment. In February, female Muslim pilgrims used the hashtag #MosqueMeTooto share their experiences of sexual harassmentduring the Hajj pilgrimage and journeys to other religious sites. Mona Elthahawy, an Egyptian-American feminist and journalist,talked about her experience,externalof sexual assault during Hajj in 2013. Last week in Saudi Arabiaat least 11 women's rights activists were reportedly arrestedin a crackdown, according to human rights groups. Most of them were women who campaigned for the right to drive.

Fortnite sued for 'copying' rival gameThe makers of the hit video game are accused of copying rival PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.4h4 hours agoTechnology,"Players can customise characters in Fortnite (left) and PUBG (right) The makers of Fortnite, one of the world's most popular video games, have been accused of copying rival title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). The studio behind PUBG has asked a court in South Korea to determine whether Epic Games copied its intellectual property. Fortnite and PUBG have both attracted millions of gamers with their huge ""last player standing"" online battles. Epic Games has not yet commented on the lawsuit. PUBG was first released in March 2017. It was inspired by the Japanese thriller film Battle Royale, in which a group of students is forced to fight to the death by the government. In PUBG, up to 100 players parachute on to an island, search for weapons and kill one another until only one player remains. Fortnite was first released in July 2017 but its Battle Royale mode was not added until September 2017. Fortnite has more cartoon-like graphics The game also sees up to 100 players land on an island, search for weapons and kill one another until one player is left standing. However, Fortnite additionally lets players gather wood, metal and bricks to build defences. Both games have proved hugely popular. In February, Epic Games said Fortnite had broken the world record with 3.4 million people playing at once. The previous record of 3.3 million simultaneous players was set by PUBG. However, analysts suggest the popularity of PUBG has waned since January, while Fortnite continues to attract more players. PUBG confirmed it had applied for an injunction against Epic Games Korea in January.  The company is accused of copying PUBG's user interface and game items. PUBG was released in March 2017 ""We filed the suit to protect our copyright,"" the company toldthe Korea Times.,external Behind the scenes, the two companies have an existing business relationship as PUBG is built on the Unreal gaming engine, which was developed by Epic Games. According to Bloomberg, PUBG has generated sales of up to $1.3 billion (Â£980m). While Fortnite is free to download, players can buy cosmetic skins for weapons and characters. Analysts suggest the game generates more than $200m a month.

"Twitter 'bans women against trans ideology'A women's group says there is ""a concerted attack on women's free speech"" over transgender issues.3m4 minutes agoUK","An open letter to Martha Lane Fox urges her to ""speak out against this new wave of misogyny"" Twitter is banning women who ""speak out against the dangerous dogma of trans ideology"", a feminist group has said. In a letter,externalto Twitter director Martha Lane Fox,Fair Play for Women,externalsays the company is allowing ""a concerted attack on women's free speech"". But trans activist Ashleigh Talbot said the group's letter seeks to ""whip up"" hatred against trans people. Twitter said its rules are enforced equally for every user, regardless of the commentary they engage in. Fair Play for Women describes itself as a group of ""ordinary women"" who argue that ""in the rush to reform transgender laws"" women's voices will not be listened to. It says Twitter users have been banned for stating ""basic, incontrovertible biological facts"" such as saying men are not women.

Transsexual writer Miranda Yardleysaid she was banned from Twitter,externalfor stating that Green Party LGBT spokesperson Aimee Challenor, a trans woman, is a man. Writing on her blog she said: ""According to the rules of Twitter it is now hateful conduct to call someone who is a man, a man. ""The implication of this is that the concept of proscribed speech, things we are now not allowed to say, now extends to the truth. This is fundamentally illiberal."" Fair Play for Women also said women receive abuse for talking ""about their biology"" - including being threatened with violence and referred to as Terfs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists). The Green Party's Aimee Challenor said: ""Miranda Yardley's comments about me are abusive and damaging. Twitter is right to take action against this form of online harassment which goes against Twitter's rules."" Fair Play for Women has called on Martha Lane Fox - who is also a member of the House of Lords - to use her position in Twitter to ""stop allowing bullying men to police our language, threaten us and abuse us"". But trans activist Ashleigh Talbot said the letter ""seeks to do nothing but whip up further hatred against trans and non-binary people by calling us dangerous"". Trans activist Ashleigh Talbot disagrees with the arguments made in the letter sent to Martha Lane Fox She said many of those who say their free speech is being curtailed ""are often doing so from a regular column in a national newspaper or from a national radio programme"". ""Every week for the last few months there have been anti-trans attack pieces in the Mail, Times, Telegraph, Sun and so on,"" she said. She added that trans people represent a ""small, vulnerable community"" who are subject to ""bile day in and day out in the media"". Twitter did not want to comment on the letter but said it does not suspend accounts for being feminist, and that it would only ever suspend accounts for violating their rules. It said the rules are enforced equally for every user regardless of the commentary they engage in. The BBC has contacted Martha Lane Fox for a comment. Currently, if someone wishes to have their gender identity legally recognised they have to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate -a process LGBT campaigning group Stonewall describes as,external""long, demeaning and bureaucratic"". Stonewall is calling for a system of gender recognition based on self-identification, and wants to remove the requirement for a medical diagnosis before a transgender person can change their legally recognised gender. The organisation says changing the law would make life easier for trans people and ""barely affect"" non-trans people - also known as ""cis"" people. In July 2017 then Equalities Minister Justine Greening saidthe Gender Recognition Act needed to be updated and that a consultation would begin in the autumn. The Scottish government is currentlyconsulting on gender recognition.,external The campaigning group Man Friday argues allowing people to self-identify as a particular gender ""removes any gatekeeping to women's identity and protected spaces"". To protest against any change to the law, the group choose Fridays to identify as men and take part in activities such as using male changing rooms. On Friday a group of women attempted to access the men's only bathing pond in Hampstead Heath as part of a protest against self-identification. Allow Twitter content?

Woman 'would go to jail for helping dad die'Sandra Holmes and her son may face criminal charges after taking her father to a Dignitas facility.8h8 hours agoNorth West Wales,"This video can not be played Sandra and Scott Holmes want the law on assisted suicide changed A woman who took her 93-year-old father to die at a Dignitas facility in Switzerland says she is prepared to go to jail over assisted suicide. Sandra Holmes, 66, from Llanrwst, Conwy, and her son Scott, took John Lenton to die last October, knowing they could be breaking the law. She said her father asked her in the spring to accompany him to die abroad. Ms Holmes says she and Scott, 40, are waiting to see if they will face criminal charges. North Wales Police said it had examined the case and referred it to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS said the file was with its special crime division and was currently under review. Police assess 'assisted dying' death Cancer patient dies at Dignitas John Lenton served in the British Army in WWII Asked if she is prepared to go to prison, Ms Holmes said: ""Yes, if it came to that. We both knew that we might actually have to do that. I don't think for one minute it will come to that, but yes, if we have to."" Ms Holmes said she has no regrets about the action she and Scott took, adding: ""We're waiting for the CPS to decide whether to prosecute. The police are waiting for the CPS to decide. Nobody can do anything until that happens."" Scott Holmes also said he was prepared to go to prison ""if we have to."" ""We gave him the release he wanted, so we can't possibly regret that,"" he added. Ms Holmes said the trip had taken seven months to plan, costing about Â£15,000. Assisted dying debate: The key questions Ms Holmes said her father had expressed his desire to travel to Switzerland several months before his death She said she did not coerce her father - a WWII veteran from Newport - in any way, and several times gave him options to change his mind, even booking a return ticket for him from Switzerland. She is now calling for a change in the law for people like her father who choose to die. ""I believe it's every individual's choice to decide what they want to do,"" she said. ""That was dad's choice and therefore what we were doing was right for him. It may not be right for somebody else, but it was right for him, and I never had any doubt. ""I don't believe that anyone should be prosecuted for humanely helping someone who has made their own decision on this. ""If we had a pet in this country, a dog, that was in the condition my dad was in, we would be accused of cruelty for keeping the dog alive. Yet, in this country, we allow human beings to be kept in those conditions. And for that reason, the law has to change.""

Grenfell mum told son she could not breathe,"This video can not be played 'My Isaac would be here today' - Grenfell father A five-year-old boy ""would likely be alive"" had firefighters not told his family to stay put, the boy's father has told the Grenfell Tower inquiry. Paulos Tekle said he had to ""live with the guilt"", after the fire brigade repeatedly told his family to stay in their 13th floor flat. Mr Tekle said he was told to stay put more than an hour after the fire began. After eventually leaving the flat, his son, Isaac Paulos, died after reportedly getting lost in the smoke. Speaking on the sixth day of the Grenfell commemoration hearings, Mr Tekle told the inquiry: ""Our friends and neighbours were calling me and telling me to get out, the fire is spreading too fast up the building,"" he said. Mr Tekle called his friends to warn them of the fire, and they all lived. But he was told to stay in his flat after speaking to the fire brigade over the phone on two separate occasions. Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 6 At 02:00, firefighters reached his family's flat, but Mr Tekle said they were told again to stay where they were. It wasn't until 45 minutes later they were told to leave. ""I listened to the authority and that makes me angry,"" Mr Tekle said. ""Why we were kept inside for so long? I want answers. I want to know why I was physically stopped from leaving the flat at 2am. ""If I had not listened to the fire brigade my son would have likely be alive today."" In July,BBC Newsnight reportedthat the ""stay put"" advice lasted almost two hours after the fire was reported. The advice is based on the assumption that fire can be contained, and won't spread to other flats, which are protected by their walls and doors. Sakineh Afrasiabi and her younger sister Fatima Afrasiabi had managed to reach the higher floors of the tower, thinking they would be rescued In another tribute, the eldest daughter of Sakineh Afrasiabi, who died with her sister Fatemeh Afrasiabi, said she had lost her ""only friend and protector"". In a statement read by the family's solicitor, Shiva Aghlani said: ""Losing a mother who was your only shield from the world is something else."" The inquiry heard that, on the night of the fire, despite living on the 18th floor, Ms Afrasiabi and her sister reached the 23rd floor, where ""she believed that help was coming from above to rescue her"". Ms Aghlani said ""a tooth and a piece of her jaw bone"" was all she buried of her mother. ""I wish I could have been there that night,"" she said. ""I would have saved you and your sister, I would have helped you down the stairs."" Berkti Haftom, 29, with her son Biruk, 12, who both died in the fire The family of Berkti Haftom, 29, and her 12-year-old son Biruk also gave a series of emotional tributes. A statement read by her sisters revealed Ms Haftom was 10 weeks pregnant at the time of her death. Her only surviving son Nahom Tesfay, 18, said he now felt ""alone"". Nahom grew up in Eritrea, where he was raised by his grandmother, but would speak regularly to his mother in the UK and was due to join her in London. ""I was looking forward to living with my mum and my little brother but the fire changed everything,"" he said. Day 1: Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens Day 2: Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Day 3: Victim's son 'prays for death' to join father in heaven Day 4: Grenfell niece tribute distress for aunt Day 5: 'We will never play again' The girlfriend of Mohammad Alhajali, 23, told the inquiry how she received a message from him just before the fire took hold, saying: ""Hey, are you sleeping? I'm home now."" Mr Alhajali - a Syrian refugee - had fled his home country and had been in London for three years. His girlfriend Amal said the couple had hoped to marry. ""He liked his life here. He enjoyed it, but Syria was his home. He missed it so much,"" she said in a video tribute. ""He was a huge part of my life. He taught me to love myself. Right now when I think about my future, I don't really see anything."" Mohammad Alhajali came to London as a refugee having fled his home country of Syria Former flatmate and friend Mahmoud Al-Karad, said Mr Alhajali had spoken to him during the fire on 14 June. ""He was in there with a mother and her child. I told him to get out, that he should leave. ""His reply shows the kind of man that he was. He said: 'How can I leave? How can I leave the child?'"" This video can not be played Mariem Elgwahry 'did not reveal danger in final phone call' Ahmed Elgwahry described a final phone call with sister Mariem, 27, and mother Eslah, 64, who were both trapped on the building's highest floor. He said he stood helpless outside the tower and only disconnected the call an hour after they had fallen silent. ""On my final call with Mariem - despite her suffering, despite her gradual deterioration, despite her gradual loss of consciousness - she persisted in letting me know that she was still there,"" he said. ""She started fading away from me rather rapidly... she started to mumble, started banging the floor, and then finally no longer responsive."" He said he then heard his mother's final words: ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe."" Hamid Kani will be remembered for his smile, Masoud Shahabeddin said Hamid Kani, 61, ""will not be remembered for the way he died - but for the way he lived,"" his cousin Masoud Shahabeddin said. The two came to London in the 1970s from Iran. ""He fell in love with London and its people,"" Mr Shahabeddin said. Mr Kani worked as an actor and later a chef and spent 22 ""happy years"" living in Grenfell Tower. Mr Shahabeddin said his friend would be remembered for his sense of humour, warmth, his love of family and his compassion for others. Gloria Trevisan was a ""beautiful girl"", whose kindness and big heart ""didn't go unnoticed for anyone"" The mother of Italian architect Gloria Trevisan, who died alongside her fiance Marco Gottardi, urged families and survivors to use their anger as ""the catalyst for finding the truth, because that is what everybody really wants"". Speaking through an interpreter, Emmanuella Trevisan said she asked her daughter to come home to Italy for an anniversary on the same day as the fire, but Gloria decided to travel later. She said she hoped those ""who took the decision to put that cladding on that tower"" will ""feel it in their conscience, the pain and the grief caused to all of us"". This video can not be played Abu Baker Ibrahim was applauded at the inquiry, as were other victims' relatives A man who lost his mother, brother and sister in the fire, gave an emotional tribute to his family. Fathia Ahmed, 71, was found on the 23rd floor with her children Abufars Ibrahim, 39, and Isra Ibrahim, 33. Abu Baker Ibrahim said he missed ""everything"" about his mother. The family came to England from Sudan, after his father was killed in the 1980s. ""We enjoyed our time in England... My mother worked hard in a foreign land to keep us together... (she) was given flat 206 in Grenfell Tower in 2007."" Describing his grief, he said: ""You can sit and pretend that it's OK, but the minute you close that door and you're by yourself, it's horrible. ""I miss them. It's like having a clear vision and now it's just pure darkness."" Hassan Awadh Hassan paid tribute to his wife Rania Ibrahim and their two daughters Hassan Awadh Hassan paid a tearful tribute to his wife Rania Ibrahim and daughters Fethia, four, and Hania, three. Supported by his family and friends, Mr Hassan - who was in Egypt when the fire happened - wore a t-shirt printed with a picture of his wife and daughters and the words ""I love you"". He said the family had moved into the tower in 2015. However, even before they started living there, he said his wife expressed concerns about fire safety. Mr Hassan said: ""When I spoke to my friend I asked him my wife's question: 'If there is a fire, what do we have to do?' and he tells me 'Hassan, don't worry, this building is safe - if the flat next to you is on fire then nothing happens to your flat'."" Rania Ibrahim and her daughters Fethia, four, and Hania, three, died in the fire By Jennifer Scott, BBC News If you think about the first thing you would save in a fire, many of us would reach for the photo albums. The precious memories encapsulated in those pages mean the world to those who took them. But we all hope to never have to make that call. Hassan Adwah Hassan shared those moments today to show the Grenfell Inquiry what he had lost - his wife, Rania Ibrahim, and his two daughters, Fethia and Hania. People watched the emotional slideshow with pictures of his wedding day, the birth of his babies and the celebrations as they grew older. They smiled as the two little girls demanded papa cut the birthday cake, played in the bath or showed off their art from nursery. And they cried as they saw him embracing his girls on holidays, picnicking in the park and spending time with the family and friends they loved, knowing they could never be repeated. They are all scenarios we cherish with our own loved ones, and Hassan's life after Grenfell is one we cannot begin to imagine. This week is half-term and some of the survivors of the tragedy have brought their children with them. After such a moving tribute, they were sure to have been holding their families that little bit closer.

Fortnite sued for 'copying' rival game,"Players can customise characters in Fortnite (left) and PUBG (right) The makers of Fortnite, one of the world's most popular video games, have been accused of copying rival title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). The studio behind PUBG has asked a court in South Korea to determine whether Epic Games copied its intellectual property. Fortnite and PUBG have both attracted millions of gamers with their huge ""last player standing"" online battles. Epic Games has not yet commented on the lawsuit. PUBG was first released in March 2017. It was inspired by the Japanese thriller film Battle Royale, in which a group of students is forced to fight to the death by the government. In PUBG, up to 100 players parachute on to an island, search for weapons and kill one another until only one player remains. Fortnite was first released in July 2017 but its Battle Royale mode was not added until September 2017. Fortnite has more cartoon-like graphics The game also sees up to 100 players land on an island, search for weapons and kill one another until one player is left standing. However, Fortnite additionally lets players gather wood, metal and bricks to build defences. Both games have proved hugely popular. In February, Epic Games said Fortnite had broken the world record with 3.4 million people playing at once. The previous record of 3.3 million simultaneous players was set by PUBG. However, analysts suggest the popularity of PUBG has waned since January, while Fortnite continues to attract more players. PUBG confirmed it had applied for an injunction against Epic Games Korea in January.  The company is accused of copying PUBG's user interface and game items. PUBG was released in March 2017 ""We filed the suit to protect our copyright,"" the company toldthe Korea Times.,external Behind the scenes, the two companies have an existing business relationship as PUBG is built on the Unreal gaming engine, which was developed by Epic Games. According to Bloomberg, PUBG has generated sales of up to $1.3 billion (Â£980m). While Fortnite is free to download, players can buy cosmetic skins for weapons and characters. Analysts suggest the game generates more than $200m a month.

Woman 'would go to jail for helping dad die',"This video can not be played Sandra and Scott Holmes want the law on assisted suicide changed A woman who took her 93-year-old father to die at a Dignitas facility in Switzerland says she is prepared to go to jail over assisted suicide. Sandra Holmes, 66, from Llanrwst, Conwy, and her son Scott, took John Lenton to die last October, knowing they could be breaking the law. She said her father asked her in the spring to accompany him to die abroad. Ms Holmes says she and Scott, 40, are waiting to see if they will face criminal charges. North Wales Police said it had examined the case and referred it to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS said the file was with its special crime division and was currently under review. Police assess 'assisted dying' death Cancer patient dies at Dignitas John Lenton served in the British Army in WWII Asked if she is prepared to go to prison, Ms Holmes said: ""Yes, if it came to that. We both knew that we might actually have to do that. I don't think for one minute it will come to that, but yes, if we have to."" Ms Holmes said she has no regrets about the action she and Scott took, adding: ""We're waiting for the CPS to decide whether to prosecute. The police are waiting for the CPS to decide. Nobody can do anything until that happens."" Scott Holmes also said he was prepared to go to prison ""if we have to."" ""We gave him the release he wanted, so we can't possibly regret that,"" he added. Ms Holmes said the trip had taken seven months to plan, costing about Â£15,000. Assisted dying debate: The key questions Ms Holmes said her father had expressed his desire to travel to Switzerland several months before his death She said she did not coerce her father - a WWII veteran from Newport - in any way, and several times gave him options to change his mind, even booking a return ticket for him from Switzerland. She is now calling for a change in the law for people like her father who choose to die. ""I believe it's every individual's choice to decide what they want to do,"" she said. ""That was dad's choice and therefore what we were doing was right for him. It may not be right for somebody else, but it was right for him, and I never had any doubt. ""I don't believe that anyone should be prosecuted for humanely helping someone who has made their own decision on this. ""If we had a pet in this country, a dog, that was in the condition my dad was in, we would be accused of cruelty for keeping the dog alive. Yet, in this country, we allow human beings to be kept in those conditions. And for that reason, the law has to change.""

"England striker defends gun tattooRaheem Sterling responds to criticism of his new inking, saying it has ""deeper meaning"".4h4 hours agoUK","Sterling's tattoo was pictured during training in Burton-on-Trent on Bank Holiday Monday England footballer Raheem Sterling has defended his new tattoo of a gun, saying it has a ""deeper meaning"" and refers to his late father. Anti-gun campaigners criticised the Manchester City forward after he shared a photo of himself with the tattoo of an M16 assault rifle on his leg. The image has been called ""totally unacceptable"" and ""sickening"". But Sterling said it reflects a vow he made to ""never touch a gun"" after his father was shot dead when he was a boy. According to previous reports,,externalSterling's father was killed in Kingston, Jamaica. Sterling, 23, who will travel to Russia this summer as part of England's World Cup squad, first revealed his tattooin a photo posted to Instagram,externalof himself in training with team-mates at St George's Park. Sterling is currently in World Cup training with the England squad Lucy Cope, who founded group Mothers Against Guns after her son was shot dead in 2012, said Sterling should not play for England unless he gets rid of the tattoo. Speaking to the Sun newspaper,,externalshe said: ""This tattoo is disgusting. Raheem should hang his head in shame. It's totally unacceptable. ""We demand he has the tattoo lasered off or covered up with a different tattoo. ""If he refuses he should be dropped from the England team. He's supposed to be a role model but chooses to glamorise guns."" 'Give us some love,' Sterling urges fans Raheem Sterling: extended 2015 interview Sterling, who joined City from Liverpool for Â£49m in July 2015, responded on Instagram on Monday evening.

"Italy crisis hits European marketsEuropean shares fall over continuing Italian political unrest, with new elections in the pipeline.3h3 hours agoBusiness","Former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli was named prime minister-designate Fears over Italy's political upheaval spread to Wall Street after Europe's financial markets closed lower. The prospect of fresh electionsand the possibility of eurosceptic parties strengthening their position has raised concern about the eurozone's stability. The Dow Jones index shed 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%, coming after Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 2.7% and Europe's other main markets shed well over 1%. A sell-off in Italian bonds saw the yield on two-year debt breach 2%. It meant that short-term Italian bonds suffered their biggest one-day jump in 26 years. Movements in bond prices are important as they affect the cost of borrowing for the government. Italy's debt currently stands at 130% of its economic output. The bond sell-off hit the share prices of European banks exposed to government debt, especially those in Italy. Banco BPM, Banco Generali, Unicredit  and BPER Banca closed down between 5% and 6.7%. On Wall Street, JP Morgan was down 3.7%, and Bank of America and Citigroup were just more than 3% lower. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3%. Falling bank shares dragged down Europe's main share markets. At the close the UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1.3%, while Germany's Dax was down 1.5% and France's Cac 1.3% lower. ""It's a market that is totally in panic"", said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, who noted ""a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances"". Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in the US, said:  ""If the political situation in Italy worsens, the longer-term spillovers would be felt in the US via a stronger dollar and lower European growth."" What is Italy's political crisis all about? Call to impeach Italian president Italy's economy in charts The turmoil was precipitated after the anti-establishment Five Star and League political parties abandoned their attempts to form a ruling coalition after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella. He had vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic economy minister, and appointed former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister with the task of trying to form a government. But his term is likely to be cut short, as he will almost certainly lose a parliamentary vote of confidence. If he does, then new elections would soon follow. How bad is the financial situation in Italy? There is no question that the political crisis has led financial market investors to judge that the risks have increased markedly. The rise in Italian government bond yields has been very sharp and tells us that there is increased nervousness about the outlook. But we are not - not yet at least - anywhere near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12. At the time there was an informal rule of thumb sometimes used, that countries were likely to need a bailout if the yield on their ten year bonds - essentially the annual cost of borrowing money for ten years - was sustained at more than 7%. Italy did hit that level briefly in that earlier episode.  But it's currently around 3%. Higher than it was - but not yet flashing red. Five Star and the League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in March's election, and could increase their combined majority in a new national poll. ""We've seen a steep sell-off in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com ""The moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the eurozone debt crisis. ""The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe."" Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans. The leftistManifestonewspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire."" The centrist dailyCorriere Della Serasuggests that Mr Cottarelli will be a ""steady hand at the wheel, in market waters that promise to be rough"", but that it will be difficult for him operate because he will be ""a prime minister without trust"".

Who was behind attacks on the West?,"A series of attacks in Europe over the summer months has raised the number of people killed in the West by jihadists during the past three years to more than 420, writes Dr Lorenzo Vidino. The deaths of 16 people in Barcelona and Cambrils earlier this month highlighted the continued threat posed by Islamist militants. The summer months have also seen new attacks inBelgium,France,Austria,external,Germanyandthe UK, as well as the first inFinlandand one inthe US. Although the vastmajority of Islamist attacks are elsewhere in the world, an unprecedented number have taken place in Europe and North America since thedeclaration of a ""caliphate"" by the so-called Islamic State, in June 2014. Thefirst look at the data behind the attacks,external- everything from the age of the perpetrators, to immigration status - offers an insight into those responsible and how they might be tackled. We identified 63 attacks between September 2014 and late August 2017 that we considered to be acts of jihadist terrorism. A relatively limited number of countries were affected: nine in Europe - those named above, plusDenmarkandSweden- along with the US and Canada. Flowers and a flag left near the Orlando nightclub where an Islamist gunman killed 49 people in June 2016 Regardless of country, most attacks were in large towns and cities - including Barcelona, London, Manchester, Paris, Nice, Berlin, Brussels, Stockholm and Orlando. A few attacks hit iconic targets, such as theChamps-Elyseesand theLouvre museumin Paris,Westminster in LondonandLas Ramblas in Barcelona. Many others targeted crowded spaces such as busy pedestrian areas, entertainment venues or transport hubs. But some terrorist attacks have hit more unusual places, including anoffice Christmas partyand aservice at a church. We looked at attacks motivated by jihadist ideology, that involved deliberate acts of violence against other people and were intended to intimidate or convey a message to a larger group. Other organisations use different definitions. Researchers used open-source material and interviews with officials It is possible that some attacks did not come to our attention, or that full details are not available The research covers the US, Canada and the 28 member states of the EU, plus Norway and Switzerland Attacks motivated by other ideologies - such asthe murder of Jo Cox- are not included in this study In total, the 63 attacks caused 424 deaths and left almost 1,800 people injured. The perpetrators are not included in these figures. TheParis attack of November 2015was the deadliest, with 130 people killed, including90 at the Bataclan theatre. France also saw theNice lorry attack, which left 86 people dead. 14 July 2016: A lorry ploughed into a crowd in the French Riviera town of Nice There were many other attacks that left many people dead and others injured. InOrlando, 49 people were killedin an attack on a gay nightclub Bombings atBrussels airport and at a metro stationleft 32 people dead 14 people were killed at aChristmas party in San Bernardino, California 12 people died when a lorry was driven into a crowdedChristmas market in Berlin 12 people died when the Paris offices ofCharlie Hebdowere attacked in January 2015 Five people were killed in theWestminster attackin April TheManchester Arena bombingin May led to 22 deaths TheLondon Bridge attackin June left eight people dead The attacks inBarcelona and Cambrilsleft 16 people dead In total, these 11 attacks were responsible for 386 deaths. However, most of the attacks did not cause casualties, with the exclusion of the perpetrators. Although thenumber of young people being radicalised has caused concern, the average age of the attackers - 27.5 - is not unusually young. The two youngest were 15 - an unnamed boywho attacked a Jewish teacher with a machetein Marseille, and Safia S,a girl who stabbed a police officerat a Hannover train station. Of the five who were under the age of 18 at the time, four were in Germany. The vast majority of the attackers were in their 20s, with about one in four attackers above the age of 30 and six aged 40 or older. The oldest suspect, Mohamed H Khalid, was 54 when he was accused of stabbing to death anelderly couple in the Austrian city of Linz,external. In the UK,Khalid Masood, was 52 when he drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer at the Houses of Parliament. Despitewomen becoming increasingly active in jihadist networks, only two out of 85 individual perpetrators were female. Fewer than one in five perpetrators was a convert to Islam, with a significantly higher percentage in North America than in Europe. However, the converts were significantly more likely to have a criminal background and to have served time in prison. Overall, half of the attackers had a prior criminal background. How can police stop terror suspects travelling? Is terror more of a threat to Europe than before? Terror deaths in Western Europe at highest level since 2004 Can you monitor every suspect? The relationship between terrorism and migration is a complex one and has been at the centre of extremely polarising debates, particularly during theEuropean migrant crisis. However, the number of attackers who were illegally in a country or who arrived as refugees is small. Two-thirds were citizens of the country they attacked, with others either legal residents, or legal visitors from neighbouring countries. However, individuals who were in the West illegally also carried out deadly attacks. November 2015: Tributes left in Paris following attacks that left 130 people dead At least two of those involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks arethought to have posed as refugeesto enter Europe through Greece. Three other individuals were refugees or asylum seekers at the time of attack, while seven were in the country illegally or awaiting deportation. The latter group includes Uzbek nationalRakhmat Akilov, who killed four people with a hijacked lorry in Stockholm in April 2017, and Tunisian citizenAnis Amri, who also used a lorry to commit his attack at the Berlin Christmas market. Wreckage from an attack on a Berlin Christmas market, December 2016 There is also one case of ""terrorist tourism"", involving Egyptian citizenAbdullah Hamamy, who lived in the United Arab Emirates and attacked soldiers at the Louvre in February 2017. Two of the four most lethal attacks - those in Paris in November 2015 and in Brussels in 2016 - are believed to bewell orchestrated multiple attacks directed by IS,external. 22 March 2016: A security guard helps a wounded woman after the attack on the Brussels metro system They were also executed in part by former foreign fighters. However, the two other most deadly attacks - those in Orlando in June 2016 and in Nice in July 2016 - were carried out independently by individuals without operational connection to a jihadist group. These episodes demonstrate that terrorist sympathisers who never travelled to conflict areas and who act independently can be as dangerous as a team of highly trained militants. Overall, links between attackers and jihadist groups operating overseas are not always easy to determine. Of the attacks that have hit the West since June 2014, fewer than one in 10 was carried out under direct orders from the leadership of IS. In some cases it can be difficult to tell, for example IS said it was behind both the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, but it did not provide any evidence. Nevertheless, the influence of IS can be clearly seen. During or before the attack, six out of 10 perpetrators pledged allegiance to a jihadist group, almost always IS - which frequently claims responsibility. Unsurprisingly, given the frequency of attacks and the number of deaths and injuries, jihadist terrorism has come to the fore of political debates in the West and receives widespread news coverage. The threat is not expected to wane in the near future, with policymakers, counter-terrorism officials and the public all being asked to take action. 22 March 2017: Westminster Bridge following a terror attack There are huge implications for domestic and foreign policy throughout Western countries. It is hoped that knowing more about the attacks and the people who carried them out will help us all have a more informed debate about what action is needed.

Medics who saved Skripals reveal fears,"This video can not be played Newsnight: The night the Skripals were admitted to hospital Hospital staff who saved the lives of poisoned Russians Sergei and Yulia Skripal have revealed they did not expect the victims of the nerve agent attack to survive. The Skripals had been found slumped on a bench on 4 March - but staff treating them at Salisbury District Hospital did not initially know the reason why. Nursing director Lorna Wilkinson said a key moment came when policeman Nick Bailey was admitted with similar symptoms. ""There was a real concern as to how big this could get,"" she said. She told BBC Two's Newsnight: ""Have we just gone from having two index patients having something that actually could become all-consuming and involve many casualties? Because we really didn't know at that point."" This video can not be played Lorna Wilkinson was among those concerned about the potential scale of the Skripal poisoning And ward sister Sarah Clark, who was on duty that night, added that there were fears that the hospital's staff might end up being affected. She pointed out that they had not, at that stage, ""taken any extra precautions in terms of protecting ourselves"". What are nerve agents and what do they do? Yulia Skripal: 'We are so lucky to survive' Ex-spy Skripal discharged after poisoning When the nature of what they were facing became clear, hospital staff said they did not have high hopes of ever seeing their two patients recover. But after weeks of treatment - involving expert advice from the nearbyPorton Down research facility- Yulia and then Sergei were eventually discharged to continue their recovery at an undisclosed address. The series of interviews withNewsnightmarks the first time that staff at the hospital have spoken in detail about the event and how they reacted. The testimonies of the medical staff highlight the vital importance of the decisions made at key times: the speedy arrival in intensive care, the heavy sedation used to limit possible brain damage, and the importance of advice, tests and treatments suggested by the Porton Down experts. When the Skripals were found, an opioid overdose was suspected. ""We were just told that there were two patients down in the emergency department who were critically unwell and they would be coming up to the unit,"" recalled ward sister Ms Clark. But when police became aware of Mr Skripal'sformer career as a Russian spy, they told the hospital and discussed the possibility that he may have been the victim of a targeted attack. A major incident was declared at the hospital and police moved in to protect the Skripals. ""I spoke to the nurse in charge,"" recalled Dr Duncan Murray, the hospital's senior intensive care consultant, ""and it was this conversation I really could never have imagined in my wildest imagination as having with anyone... ""Essentially the story of a known Russian spy having been admitted to hospital in pretty unusual circumstances."" This video can not be played ""All the evidence was there that they would not survive"" - Dr Stephen Jukes on Sergei and Yulia Skripal As they continued the treatment, medical staff discarded the earlier theory about opioid poisoning, realising that what they were seeing were symptoms typical of organophosphate, or nerve agent, poisoning. Dr Stephen Jukes, an intensive care consultant at the hospital, said: ""When we first were aware this was a nerve agent, we were expecting them not to survive. ""We would try all our therapies. We would ensure the best clinical care. But all the evidence was there that they would not survive."" Both Skripals were heavily sedated which allowed them to tolerate the intrusive medical equipment they were connected to, but also helped to protect them from brain damage, a possible consequence of nerve agent poisoning. Over time, the sedation was reduced and the ventilation switched from the mouth to the trachea, as shown by the vivid scar seen on Yulia Skripal's neck in the TV statement she gave after she was released. This video can not be played ""My life has been turned upside down"": Yulia Skripal's video statement in full Once the patients became more conscious, staff had to carefully consider what they could tell them without prejudicing the police investigation, and decide on the right moment to allow questioning by detectives. Medical director Dr Christine Blanshard explained: ""Those are very difficult decisions, because on the one hand you want to provide reassurance to the patients that they are safe and they are being looked after, and on the other hand you don't want to give them information that might cause difficulties with subsequent police interviews."" It was the doctors and nurses that, out of concern for their patients, insisted that international inspectors obtain a court order before they would be allowed to take blood samples from the Skripals. Dr Jukes explained: ""These are vulnerable patients, they needed some form of advocate and without a court order we could not allow things to happen to them without their consent."" This video can not be played Dr Duncan Murray on why the Skripals recovered Once the Skripals were stable and able to speak, the key concern for medical staff was how their production of the key enzyme acetylcholinesterase - needed to re-establish their normal body functions - could be stimulated. The body will do this naturally after nerve agent poisoning, but the process can take many months. In trying combinations of drugs, Dr Murray says the hospital received input from ""international experts"", some of them from Porton Down. The laboratory, internationally known for its chemical weapons expertise, processed tests and offered advice on the best therapies. New approaches to well-known treatments were tried. Dr Jukes said that the speed of the Skripals' recovery came as a very pleasant surprise that he cannot entirely explain. Yulia was eventuallydischarged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April- and last week made a statement thanking the hospital. Her father'sdeparture from the hospital was announced on 18 May. Dr Murray said: ""The vast majority of the improvement and the success... were attributable to the very good generic, basic critical care."" He also praised the ""excellent teamwork by the doctors, fantastic care and dedication by our nurses"". Inevitably, there will be longer term questions about the Skripals' health. Dr Blanshard said they would need continuing support, noting: ""We have a total world experience of treating three patients for the effects ofNovichokpoisoning and I think it's safe to say that we're still learning.""

Questions as flash flood clean-up begins,"This video can not be played 'Nobody cares' about impact of Birmingham floods Residents have questioned why more was not done to protect their homes after they were flooded for the third time in nine years. Parts of Birmingham saw more than a month's rainfall in an hour on Sunday. Houses in Selly Oak and Selly Park were flooded, with waist-high water reported in one street and cars submerged. The Environment Agency, which confirmed a flood defence scheme for the area has been delayed, said surface water in the drains caused the problems. A man in his 80s died in Walsall after his car was submerged in flood-watersas rain swept the West Midlands. Areas of Northamptonshire were also flooded. Birmingham flooding: What went wrong? In Sir John's Road, Selly Park, homes were flooded and cars were under water, while wheelie bins floated down the road. People living in Sir John's Road, Selly Park, were badly affected by flash flooding over the weekend The street last flooded in June 2016which affected more than 100 houses and some people had to leave their homes. Residents have asked why more was not done to keep their homes safe. Man in 80s dies in Walsall as flash floods hit Midlands Storms cause heavy flooding Northampton flash flooding: Residents' clean-up under way Karina Thompson said: ""The dirt and mess and the aggravation from the insurance company... to be quite honest, it is extremely upsetting and this shouldn't have happened. ""It happened two years ago and people could have protected us."" This video can not be played Residents have filmed the flooded streets around Birmingham Ben Lees, a 25-year-old drainage engineer, was on his way home on Sunday night when he spotted a submerged vehicle in Walsall and dived into water deeper than 6ft (1.8m) to save a man trapped in the car. ""I opened the door, told him to take a breath and dragged him out,"" he said. Karina Thompson said more should have been done to protect residents in Selly Park The Environment Agency confirmed a multimillion-pound flood defence scheme for Selly Park North, which started last February, has been delayed but said other flood defences are working. A defence in Selly Park South was recently completed. Joe Cuthbertson, from the agency, said: ""A lot of Environment Agency schemes protect homes and businesses from river flooding. ""What we have seen in these areas of Birmingham over the weekend has been surface water flooding."" The deputy leader of Birmingham City Council, Brigid Jones, added the authority will be looking at what happened and what could be done better. Ben Lees pulled a man from a submerged car in Walsall The city council also apologised after 51-year-old Trevor Thomas, who is disabled, was trapped in his flooded bungalow in Kings Norton before a neighbour saved him. His mother, Pat, said she called social services to find him somewhere else to live and was told no-one was available to help on a bank holiday. A council spokesman said: ""We have robust procedures in place to ensure that assistance is available to service users in emergency situations. ""We apologise to Mr Thomas and will be investigating to see what has gone wrong."" Firefighters and paramedics had to swim to reach a man in his 80s in Walsall, but he died in hospital later A driver escaped serious injury when a tree fell on his car in Great Barr. It happened in Shady Lane just after 17:00 BST, and resident Lara Pike said the road was temporarily blocked while the scene was cleared. West Midlands Ambulance Service said one man had been able to free himself from the vehicle and was discharged by crews at the scene.

Italy crisis hits European markets,"Former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli was named prime minister-designate Fears over Italy's political upheaval spread to Wall Street after Europe's financial markets closed lower. The prospect of fresh electionsand the possibility of eurosceptic parties strengthening their position has raised concern about the eurozone's stability. The Dow Jones index shed 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%, coming after Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 2.7% and Europe's other main markets shed well over 1%. A sell-off in Italian bonds saw the yield on two-year debt breach 2%. It meant that short-term Italian bonds suffered their biggest one-day jump in 26 years. Movements in bond prices are important as they affect the cost of borrowing for the government. Italy's debt currently stands at 130% of its economic output. The bond sell-off hit the share prices of European banks exposed to government debt, especially those in Italy. Banco BPM, Banco Generali, Unicredit  and BPER Banca closed down between 5% and 6.7%. On Wall Street, JP Morgan was down 3.7%, and Bank of America and Citigroup were just more than 3% lower. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3%. Falling bank shares dragged down Europe's main share markets. At the close the UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1.3%, while Germany's Dax was down 1.5% and France's Cac 1.3% lower. ""It's a market that is totally in panic"", said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, who noted ""a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances"". Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in the US, said:  ""If the political situation in Italy worsens, the longer-term spillovers would be felt in the US via a stronger dollar and lower European growth."" What is Italy's political crisis all about? Call to impeach Italian president Italy's economy in charts The turmoil was precipitated after the anti-establishment Five Star and League political parties abandoned their attempts to form a ruling coalition after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella. He had vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic economy minister, and appointed former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister with the task of trying to form a government. But his term is likely to be cut short, as he will almost certainly lose a parliamentary vote of confidence. If he does, then new elections would soon follow. How bad is the financial situation in Italy? There is no question that the political crisis has led financial market investors to judge that the risks have increased markedly. The rise in Italian government bond yields has been very sharp and tells us that there is increased nervousness about the outlook. But we are not - not yet at least - anywhere near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12. At the time there was an informal rule of thumb sometimes used, that countries were likely to need a bailout if the yield on their ten year bonds - essentially the annual cost of borrowing money for ten years - was sustained at more than 7%. Italy did hit that level briefly in that earlier episode.  But it's currently around 3%. Higher than it was - but not yet flashing red. Five Star and the League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in March's election, and could increase their combined majority in a new national poll. ""We've seen a steep sell-off in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com ""The moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the eurozone debt crisis. ""The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe."" Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans. The leftistManifestonewspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire."" The centrist dailyCorriere Della Serasuggests that Mr Cottarelli will be a ""steady hand at the wheel, in market waters that promise to be rough"", but that it will be difficult for him operate because he will be ""a prime minister without trust"".

"Gaza mortar barrage fired at IsraelThe heaviest volley of mortars in years is launched, with one landing in a kindergarten's grounds.1han hour agoMiddle East","One of the mortars from Gaza landed in the grounds of an Israeli kindergarten Israel has attacked militant sites in Gaza after coming under the heaviest barrage of mortar and rocket fire from the Palestinian enclave in years. The Israeli army said air strikes hit 35 targets, including a cross-border tunnel, belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad - Gaza's main militant groups. In Israel, an empty kindergarten was hit when militants fired more than 30 mortars earlier in the day. The flare-up follows weeks of deadly violence on the Gaza-Israel border. More than 100 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli snipers amid protests which saw thousands of Palestinians mass on the border in support of the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Israel said its snipers had opened fire on attackers or people attempting to infiltrate under cover of protests, but UN and human right officials have accused Israel of using disproportionate force. Israeli fighter jets struck seven sites across the Gaza Strip, hitting what the Israeli military said were ""six military compounds, munition storage warehouses, naval targets, and terror headquarters"". Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said: ""Hamas and Islamic Jihad have already paid a heavy price and the bill has just been presented to them."" Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Education said a school was hit by shrapnel from Tuesday's air strikes, though there were no initial reports of Palestinian casualties. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Life in the Gaza Strip The Israeli military said its air force also struck ""an offensive Hamas terror tunnel"" near the Kerem Shalom crossing, where controlled amounts of food, fuel and goods are transferred into Gaza. Israeli aircraft hit seven locations across Gaza It said the tunnel stretched for 900m (3,000ft) under Israeli territory. It is the latest in a series of cross-border tunnels which Israel has destroyed or disabled since the end of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war. During that conflict, Israel destroyed more than 30 tunnels which it said were meant for attacks. The Kerem Shalom crossing is a lifeline for Gaza, which has been under an Israeli, then Egyptian, blockade beginning in 2006 when Hamas militants attacked the crossing and kidnapped an Israeli soldier. The blockade was tightened after Hamas, an Islamist group which won Palestinian elections in 2006, forcibly ousted its secular Fatah rivals from Gaza in June 2007. Sirens warning of incoming fire rang out in Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on and off on Monday. The Israeli military said the biggest volley of mortar shells was fired at several sites in Israel in the early hours, with most intercepted by the Iron Dome anti-missile defence system.

Some mortars landed, included one in the grounds of a kindergarten in the Eshkol region, which borders Gaza, shortly before pupils were due to arrive. More shells were launched in subsequent attacks, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Three Israelis were wounded, media reports said. The UN Middle East peace envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, condemned the attacks on Israel, saying he was ""deeply concerned by the indiscriminate firing of rockets by Palestinian militants from Gaza. ""Such attacks are unacceptable and undermine the serious efforts by the international community to improve the situation in Gaza"". Four Palestinian militants were killed by Israeli tank-fire earlier this week Hours earlier, machine-gun fire from Gaza hit houses and vehicles in the Israeli border town of Sderot, though without causing injuries, the IDF said. The upsurge in violence came after Israeli tank fire killed four militants in Gaza in two separate incidents at the start of the week. A member of Hamas was killed on Monday after Israeli soldiers caught a group attempting to breach the border and carry out an attack, while on Sunday three members of Islamic Jihad were killed after placing an explosive device on the border fence, the IDF said.

'Crunch' heard before sinkhole openedA police car overtook vehicles and blocked the A26 in Kent just before part of the road collapsed.,"The road sank slowly for about 45 minutes before the collapse, a witness said Ten homes have been evacuated after a large sinkhole opened up in a main road. Witnesses described a police car overtaking vehicles and blocking the A26, in Kent, just before part of the road collapsed into a void. Motorists said they heard a ""crunching sound"" before the 2m (6ft)-wide sinkhole appeared on Monday evening. Work to repair the void, which could extend for up to 20m (65ft) underground, is likely to take weeks. Lauren Bourke was in a car with her fiance when the stretch of road between Maidstone and Tonbridge began to dip. She said: ""The bottom of a bus hit the dipping tarmac and made a slight crunching sound which is when we knew the road definitely wasn't safe. ""A police car overtook us and stopped in front of us. ""He got out and blocked the road off. ""It was sinking for about 45 minutes and then all of a sudden the tarmac split and it just went within five minutes. Then the left hand side started sinking too but didn't drop completely."" The road began to give way with ""crunching"" noises Toby Howe, senior highways manager at Kent County Council (KCC), said the damage outside the Taj Barming restaurant was ""substantial"". ""Our preliminary investigations suggest that this void extends either side of the road from kerb to kerb for a total distance of 20 metres,"" he said. Mr Howe said teams would attempt to establish the cause of the collapse before working on repairs. He added: ""In addition, there are utility supplies of gas, electric and water in the vicinity so we will need them to be involved too."" Restaurant manager Mabs Salam said the sinkhole was about 6m (21ft) from their main entrance, but the business would open as planned on Tuesday night. He said visitors could use the back entrance and staff who lived upstairs had decided to sleep at the back of the building. ""It's like something you would see after an earthquake,"" he said. ""We're used to seeing potholes, but this is massive."" He said no-one had been allowed close enough to see to the bottom of the hole. The restaurant building had some cracks, he added, and the business had been advised to contact KCC's insurance department. Mr Salam said officials had advised the restaurant not to let anyone stay in the building overnight and had said if the business stayed open it was its own risk. He said he was waiting to hear from the restaurant owner and staff had made their own decision to stay upstairs. Festival death dad 'held dying son's hand' Woman breaks arm during arm wrestle Missing-from-care alerts rise 'worrying' A spokeswoman for Maidstone council said 10 properties had been evacuated and it was not known how long for. She said KCC as the highways authority would make a full assessment on Wednesday. In the meantime, residents had been allowed day access to their homes but were not allowed sustained access or to stay overnight, she added. ""KCC are working on site now. We are hoping for it to be made safe for people to get back to their properties as quickly as possible,"" she added. Police closed off the road before it fell through The road is closed between Hermitage Lane and Queens Road, with a diversion in place. On repairs, Mr Howe said: ""We really do not have an estimate as yet but it will be more like weeks than days."" A KCC spokesman said: ""Ten properties have been evacuated and Maidstone council has accommodated four people. ""We can't tell how long for. They are investigating now. ""Potentially it could be weeks, but we are endeavouring to get them back into the properties as quickly as possible."" He said there had been logistical problems with regard to getting a digger on site without causing further collapse. A smaller sinkhole also opened up in Tunbridge Wells on Monday.

Bank of Mum and Dad 'feels the pinch',"Parents are parting with thousands of pounds to help their children get on the property ladder, but they can't afford to lend as much as they used to. The average parental contribution for home buyers this year will be Â£18,000, down 17% from last year's Â£21,600, according to Legal & General (L&G). The drop shows that parents are ""feeling the pinch"", the firm says. Nonetheless, more than one in four buyers are still expected to receive financial help from friends or family. In total, financial services firm L&G said 27% of home buyers would get assistance - up from 25% last year. Despite the smaller sums being loaned, L&G said the so-called Bank of Mum and Dad was still ""a prime mover"" in the UK housing market. Francesca Hunt, from London, was given between Â£20,000 and Â£30,000 (she does not want to say the exact amount) by her parents last year to help her buy a house. She had enough money by herself for a deposit on a one-bed flat, but her parents thought a two-bedroom flat was a better investment. ""My parents decided that the price difference from a one to a two bed isn't, in the grand scheme of things, too much more,"" she says. Francesca said her parents had already put aside money to gift her at some point. ""If not, I would have inherited the money anyway. Better to use it now to get on the property ladder before prices go up even further,"" she says. The money her parents provided was ""gifted"" and Francesca says they don't own any of her flat as a result of their investment. L&G said almost 317,000 housing transactions this year would rely on at least some parental help. However, overall lending was expected to drop to Â£5.7bn this year from Â£6.5bn in 2017. Number of middle-aged renters doubles How many Â£1m-plus homes are sold near you? Could the Bank of Mum and Dad lend to other people's children? Where buyers live also has a big impact on how much they rely on their parents for help. In London, the average parental contribution is Â£31,000 compared with Â£11,000 in Scotland. The ""bank"" is expected to help fund 317,000 homes his year, up 3% on 2017 Contributions are highest in London and lowest in Scotland More buyers in London (41%) receive help from the Bank of Mum and Dad than in any other area Under-35s are most likely to receive help from their parents, with nearly three in five getting assistance Some older home buyers also rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad, with 20% of those aged between 45 and 55 receiving help ""People are feeling a bit of a pinch around the economy and therefore we're seeing pretty much a national trend outside of London for less to be given,"" L&G chief executive Nigel Wilson told the BBC. ""The volume of transactions depending on Bank of Mum and Dad funding keeps on growing, even as parents find it harder to provide as much money for the deposit."" He said it was not ""sustainable or fair"" for parents and young people to ""remain so co-dependent when it comes to housing purchases"".

Three killed in Belgium shooting,"This video can not be played Social media footage captured the sound of gunshots A man has shot dead two female police officers and a civilian in the eastern Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge. The gunman also took a female cleaner hostage at a school before being killed by police. Four other police officers were also injured. The man's motive is not yet clear but the incident is being treated as terrorism. Police sources quoted in local media said the man was heard shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic). Belgian broadcaster RTBF said the gunman was let out from prison on temporary release on Monday where he had been serving time on drug offences. It said that he may have been radicalised while in jail. LiÃ¨ge mayor Willy Demeyer confirmed the deaths of the two female officers during a press conference and said that ""physical and psychological support"" would be provided to the families of the victims. Hearses arrived at the scene where the gunman shot dead two female officers Mr Demeyer said it was an assault on the state of Belgium, adding: ""Police were definitely the target of this attack. ""We will forever be at the side of the police officers."" A bomb squad was sent to the scene of the shooting in Liege, Belgium Mr Demeyer added that ""all flags on municipal buildings"" were to be flown at half-mast, a book of condolences would be placed in the local town hall and a service would be held at 13:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday to honour the victims. The shooting unfolded late morning on Tuesday near a cafe in the city centre. Prosecutors said the man followed and ""savagely"" attacked the officers from behind with a knife before taking a gun from them and opening fire. He also shot dead a 22-year-old man who was sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car as he walked in the direction of a nearby school, where he briefly took a member of staff hostage. ""The young man who was killed in the vehicle was a pupil of the high school in LiÃ¨ge, he was going to qualify as a primary school teacher in the next few weeks,"" Mr Demeyer said. Armed police officers with shields, helmets and bulletproof vests then arrived at the scene and ""intervened"". The attacker began firing at the officers in an attempt to escape. Two officers were shot in the leg, leaving one officer in a serious condition. Two other officers received injuries to their arms before the attacker was shot dead, prosecutors said. Footage on social media showed people running to safety as several gunshots rang out. Children at the school were moved to safety. LiÃ¨ge city authorities later tweeted: ""The children in the local schools are safe."" Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel said he was following the situation closely and expressed his support for those caught up in the shooting. Allow Twitter content?

Can Salisbury move on?,"New signs have been put up around the Maltings to encourage people to visit local businesses Nearly two months have passed since the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were the victims of a nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Traces of military-grade Novichok were found at nine locations and a multi-million pound operation to decontaminate the locations could take months. Meanwhile, the city is still suffering the after effects. Coming out of the railway station it is clear to see that Salisbury is a popular tourist destination. An excitable group of middle-aged Spanish tourists in puffer jackets fresh off the train are checking their maps while a quieter Japanese couple go in search of a taxi. ""Ah, ver! La catedral!,"" shouts the Spanish group's leader, as they head towards the grand monument which boasts Britain's tallest spire and gives Salisbury its city status. It feels, however, more like a market town, with independent shops nestled between traditional pubs which line evocatively-named streets such as Fish Row, Silver Street and Pennyfarthing Street. Along Fisherton Street people are enjoying the sun and the cool breeze coming off the flowing River Avon, while others take photos of the 14th Century clock tower. On the opposite side is the approach to The Mill which has a number of new signs saying ""shops open this way"". These recently-erected signs are the first indication that all is not well. Salisbury Cathedral - with original Magna Carta documents - is a major attraction The blue and white signs give way to blue and white police tape fastened across the black metal fence outside The Mill pub, still deemed by government scientists to be at risk of contamination. Police in yellow high-visibility jackets stand guard in front of the boarded-up pub to ensure no-one crosses the cordon. ""It's a strange feeling. We go about our business and then see this police line,"" says resident, Rosemary Duffy. ""It's a bit frightening as it's an unknown quantity. It's a disgusting thing that's happened here but we've got to keep going."" Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in the Maltings area of the city ""It's a disgusting thing that's happened here but we've got to keep going,"" says Rosemary Duffy It is the first time Mrs Duffy has been to the Maltings shopping precinct since the Skripals were taken ill there on 4 March. She says she was tempted back by the free parking, laid on by the local council in a bid to get more people back into the city centre. Skripal poisoning sites clean-up begins 'It's just so quintessentially English' What are nerve agents and what do they do? Like most people driving to Salisbury, Mrs Duffy parked next to the 1980s-style shopping area made out of red brick. The walk to the shops is now lined by metre-high metal fences and police tape, blocking off the main route to the shops. Richard Wheeler's business is losing between Â£12-15,000 each week since the attack Within the cordon there are some big name shops such as Superdrug, Robert Dyas and Greggs but there is also the small, independent B and R Textiles which faces the bench - now removed - where the Skripals were found unconscious. ""I'm currently losing Â£12,000 to Â£15,000 a week,"" says manager Richard Wheeler, who has been providing soft furnishings such as blinds and curtains for 30 years. ""Up until now this has been a very successful business but if this doesn't get sorted out soon it could be the end of it."" Forced to close for a week, the 60-year-old was given permission to open his shop via the back entrance, which is outside of the police cordon, so he can fulfil existing orders and fittings. ""Those take us up to the end of May but I don't know what I'll do after that."" Twelve businesses have been forced to close because they are within police cordons Poppy White has worked 55 fewer hours than normal over the past month Customers such as Liz Hannah, 57, only discovered the shop was open after Mr Wheeler's daughter posted a message on Facebook. She describes the aftermath of the attack on the Skripals as ""a bit surreal and frightening at first"" but says people have got used to it. ""It's happened and there's not a lot you can do about it. I think it will take Salisbury a while to get over it but people need to know that it's safe. ""In a way the cordons makes you feel safer because at least you know they're being thorough and cleaning it all up. Salisbury will the cleanest city ever after this."" Residents want things to return to normal as quickly as possible But Mr Wheeler - who only has enough money to pay his six staff until the end of May - says he just wants things to return to normal. ""It all seems very long-winded but there's obviously processes the authorities have to go through which do take time, but the most frustrating thing was that for the first five weeks we didn't know anything. ""We saw nothing happening regarding a clean-up - that only started last week - and then it depends if they find anything during that."" ""It feels unfair to punish Salisbury because of a terrible attack,"" says John Goodman who is visiting Salisbury with his wife, Polly The frustration is also felt by the small independent businesses along Riverside Walk, on the other side of the Mill. ""Because of the cordons we don't get our footfall along here and we don't have any business,"" says Lucy Reeves at the Crystal shop, which sells a myriad of brightly coloured gems. ""It's been a massive shock. We now feel like the Maltings is a separate part of Salisbury, it's like there's a big wall up between us and the rest of Salisbury because it's so quiet now. ""I'd say we're about 70% down on what we would normally be for this time of year which is quite scary. It could be really serious if this continues."" Ms Reeves describes the cordons as ""annoying"" but says the police ""are all really lovely"". She adds: ""It's nice having them around actually, it's someone to talk to."" Fred, Cathay, Antoine and Louise from Nice, France, visiting Salisbury for the first time Poppy White works further down Riverside Walk at Ganesha Handicrafts. ""Sales have been down, and some days we don't get anything at all,"" says the 23-year-old. The shop is now operating on reduced hours and is struggling to meet a quarter of its daily sales targets. But it is not just the shops that are suffering, it is also the people who work in them. Ms White has worked 55 fewer hours than normal over the past month. ""That equates to a lot of money that I can't live without. It's a really difficult situation. ""If this continues much longer I will have to find somewhere else to work and I don't want to do that because I like this job. ""We have a lot of loyal customers but I've only seen two of those because it's scary."" Local businesses are keen to promote a ""business as usual"" message despite the visible police presence Tourism is big business in Salisbury. Nearly 10% of all jobs are tourism related, and it is estimated that more than five million people visited Salisbury in 2016, spending about Â£270m. VisitWiltshire, which promotes tourism in the city, says it has seen a drop in the number of visitors and revenue for March and April. It describes the picture as ""mixed"" with some businesses reporting losses of 40%. There are concerns about forward bookings and cancellations from the domestic market which is why VisitWiltshire was given a Â£200,000 government grant to promote its message that it is ""business as usual"". Undeterred by the headlines, John and Polly Goodman have visited from Reading. ""I'm sure [it is] perfectly safe. I don't have any qualms about being here at all,"" says Mr Goodman. ""They know what they're doing and they're cleaning it all up and I trust the authorities to get it sorted. It feels unfair to punish Salisbury because of a terrible attack."" Leader of Salisbury City Council, Matthew Dean, says free parking, park and ride, and bus travel have been brought in to encourage people to visit Fred and Cathay from Nice, France, are visiting the city for the first time as part of a tour around the UK, with their children Antoine and Louise. ""I knew something had happened but I didn't know it was actually here. But frankly, we don't care at all,"" says Cathay. ""We come from Nice where a man in a truck killed 80 people. Fred's mum was injured in that attack but she is ok. For us, we live and want to explore the world."" Wiltshire Council has introduced free parking, free park and ride, and some free bus travel in an attempt to draw people back. Salisbury City Council leader, Matthew Dean, says a number of special events are also in the pipeline and a St George's day celebration held on Sunday in the Market Square attracted 2,500 people. ""The affected areas from the attack comprise less than 2% of the city,"" he says. Different barriers have been erected at Zizzi's, the restaurant where the Skripals ate on 4 March Paul Lewis's jewellers overlooks Zizzi's, seen cordoned off in the background Allum and Sidaway, a family-run jewellers, faces Zizzi's - the restaurant where the Skripals ate before the attack and which is now hidden by a blue cordon. The shop's manager Paul Lewis is also a director of Salisbury's Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 500 businesses. ""This January and February saw year-on-year growth - of 25% and 45% respectively - but since March when the incident happened I've had a 25% drop."" He forecasts April will be worse for his shop. ""I can expect that because there was a media circus going on right outside my door. It still doesn't feel like there's any sort of recovery."" The editor of the Salisbury Journal says locals are frustrated with some national media coverage A few narrow streets away from the Market Square, the Salisbury Journal's editor Joe Riddle is preparing the latest issue of his paper. The journalist grew up in the city and believes it will recover. ""A lot of people are fed up with how some sections of the national press are portraying Salisbury, giving the impression it is shut down and that the whole city is a no-go area. ""There is frustration and they feel that is putting people off from coming here. ""Most people in Salisbury have moved on and hopefully, once this has all blown over, it will be business as usual.""

Frances studied acting in London but she gained fame after moving to Australia in 1970. In a career spanning decades, she starred in popular local soaps and dramas including The Young Doctors, Prisoner, and Sons and Daughters. On Home and Away, she played Morag - the famously scheming sister of Ray Meagher's Alf Stewart - in various stints from 1988 until last year. ""I've always played the strong ladies,"" she told the local Nine Network earlier this year. ""I'm going to fight it [the cancer], by God I am. [Acting] has been a wonderful road and I've loved every minute of it. I've loved every soapie I've been on."" In an interview in January, Frances revealed that she had also suffered a recent hip bone fracture and an ulcer in her throat. ""I swear I have had a hex placed on me for the past 12 months,"" she told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph. The Seven Network described Frances as a unique actress. ""Her on screen presence inspired a generation of actors. This gift was coupled with an ability to bring a sense of dignity and presence into each room she entered,"" it said in a statement. Meagher said: ""Cornie was an incredibly loved and valued member of our cast over many, many years. We had a moment of silence for her on set this morning and she'll be sadly missed by both cast and crew."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gaza mortar barrage fired at Israel,"One of the mortars from Gaza landed in the grounds of an Israeli kindergarten Israel has attacked militant sites in Gaza after coming under the heaviest barrage of mortar and rocket fire from the Palestinian enclave in years. The Israeli army said air strikes hit 35 targets, including a cross-border tunnel, belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad - Gaza's main militant groups. In Israel, an empty kindergarten was hit when militants fired more than 30 mortars earlier in the day. The flare-up follows weeks of deadly violence on the Gaza-Israel border. More than 100 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli snipers amid protests which saw thousands of Palestinians mass on the border in support of the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Israel said its snipers had opened fire on attackers or people attempting to infiltrate under cover of protests, but UN and human right officials have accused Israel of using disproportionate force. Israeli fighter jets struck seven sites across the Gaza Strip, hitting what the Israeli military said were ""six military compounds, munition storage warehouses, naval targets, and terror headquarters"". Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said: ""Hamas and Islamic Jihad have already paid a heavy price and the bill has just been presented to them."" Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Education said a school was hit by shrapnel from Tuesday's air strikes, though there were no initial reports of Palestinian casualties. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Life in the Gaza Strip The Israeli military said its air force also struck ""an offensive Hamas terror tunnel"" near the Kerem Shalom crossing, where controlled amounts of food, fuel and goods are transferred into Gaza. Israeli aircraft hit seven locations across Gaza It said the tunnel stretched for 900m (3,000ft) under Israeli territory. It is the latest in a series of cross-border tunnels which Israel has destroyed or disabled since the end of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war. During that conflict, Israel destroyed more than 30 tunnels which it said were meant for attacks. The Kerem Shalom crossing is a lifeline for Gaza, which has been under an Israeli, then Egyptian, blockade beginning in 2006 when Hamas militants attacked the crossing and kidnapped an Israeli soldier. The blockade was tightened after Hamas, an Islamist group which won Palestinian elections in 2006, forcibly ousted its secular Fatah rivals from Gaza in June 2007. Sirens warning of incoming fire rang out in Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on and off on Monday. The Israeli military said the biggest volley of mortar shells was fired at several sites in Israel in the early hours, with most intercepted by the Iron Dome anti-missile defence system.

Some mortars landed, included one in the grounds of a kindergarten in the Eshkol region, which borders Gaza, shortly before pupils were due to arrive. More shells were launched in subsequent attacks, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Three Israelis were wounded, media reports said. The UN Middle East peace envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, condemned the attacks on Israel, saying he was ""deeply concerned by the indiscriminate firing of rockets by Palestinian militants from Gaza. ""Such attacks are unacceptable and undermine the serious efforts by the international community to improve the situation in Gaza"". Four Palestinian militants were killed by Israeli tank-fire earlier this week Hours earlier, machine-gun fire from Gaza hit houses and vehicles in the Israeli border town of Sderot, though without causing injuries, the IDF said. The upsurge in violence came after Israeli tank fire killed four militants in Gaza in two separate incidents at the start of the week. A member of Hamas was killed on Monday after Israeli soldiers caught a group attempting to breach the border and carry out an attack, while on Sunday three members of Islamic Jihad were killed after placing an explosive device on the border fence, the IDF said.

May told abortion reform 'is feminist test',"This video can not be played Labour's Chakrabarti says 'feminist' May must act on Northern Ireland abortion Labour has challenged Theresa May to show she really is a feminist by backing reform of Northern Ireland's strict abortion law. Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti said women in Northern Ireland ""have been let down by privileged women and men for too long"". She said the PM was a ""self-identifying feminist"" and ""the test of feminists is whether they stick up for all women"". FollowingIreland's historic vote,the PM has been urged to liberalise NI law. MPs from all parties - including some within Mrs May's own cabinet - have already called on the prime minister to support a change to the law in Northern Ireland, which is more restrictive on abortion rights compared to the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster, who is the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party propping up Mrs May's minority government,  previously said the landslide pro-abortion vote in Ireland had no impact on Northern Ireland. The UK government agreed with her. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? What next for Northern Ireland? Foster says abortion vote no impact on NI Report recommends NI abortion law change Writing an opinion piece in Tuesday's Daily Mirror,,externalBaroness Chakrabarti said women ""have a right to make difficult ethical decisions about their bodies for themselves"". Feminists must stand up for all women, ""not just women we meet at parties"", she wrote, adding: ""This is a feminist test."" The Mirror article reiterates the position set out by Baroness Chakrabarti on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday. Then she said: ""We are calling on Mrs May, a self-identifying feminist, to negotiate with the parties in Northern Ireland and then to legislate without further delay."" The peer continued: ""I think that Theresa May, really as a self-identifying feminist, needs to say 'Yes, I unveil statues of suffragists in Parliament Square, but the test of my feminism will be whether I guarantee fundamental human rights for women.'"" Analysis, by BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth Theresa May would no doubt defend her record on so-called women's issues; pointing to her work on modern slavery in the Home Office and attempts to address the gender pay gap from Downing Street. But the issue of abortion reform is far more politically fraught. Reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority, Mrs May can't afford to anger the Northern Irish party by suggesting reform from Westminster. On the other hand, several senior Tories - on whose backing the prime minister also depends - have expressed support for change. With no devolved administration in Belfast there is some pressure for the UK Government to act. Keen to avoid that, Downing Street sources have repeatedly said it's an issue to be determined in Northern Ireland. Her personal view, whatever that may be, simply might not come into play. Theresa May became the Conservative Party's first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith Theresa May, the UK's second female prime minister, has previously shown support for the feminist movement, and was famously pictured in a t-shirt with the slogan: ""This is what a feminist looks like."" As home secretary,she criticised fellow Tory Dominic Raabfor accusing feminists of ""obnoxious bigotry"" and claiming men had a raw deal in the workplace. In March, when campaigners for gender equality marched through London, Theresa May tweeted her support, referencing her promisewhen she promised to be a ""bloody difficult woman""to the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker during Brexit talks.

Unlike the rest of the UK, abortion in Northern Ireland is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. Downing Street is understood to believe that any reform ""is an issue for Northern Ireland"". But a Downing Street source said it demonstrated ""one of the important reasons we need a functioning executive back up and running"". Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, after a power-sharing deal between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed.

Foreign Secretary 'needs more authority',"Boris Johnson has insisted the UK will become a more ""outward-looking"" country after Brexit The Foreign Office needs ""more authority"" if the UK is to maximise its international influence after Brexit, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat has said. The department should regain ""strategic control"" over trade, defence, aid and intelligence as well as diplomacy, Mr Tugendhat - who is chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee - argued. Boris Johnson and his predecessors had found themselves ""hobbled"", he said. Ministers say a ""Global Britain"" will maintain its clout on the world stage. They point to the UK's membership of Nato and the UN Security Council, its historic relationships with the United States and the Commonwealth, and the use of soft power to advance the UK's values and interests. Although Mr Johnson remains a vocal advocate for Brexit, the process is being handled by other departments rather than the Foreign Office, leading to suggestions he has been marginalised. Boris Johnson would like a 'Brexit plane' Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Foreign aid 'to be used for UK interests' While No 10 has overall responsibility, the day-to-day negotiations are being led by the Department for Exiting the European Union and the Department for International Trade is responsible for paving the way for trade agreements after the UK leaves in March 2019. Meanwhile, the UK's Â£13bn overseas aid budget is controlled by the Department for International Development while the intelligence agencies report to No 10, via the Cabinet Office. The MP chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee In a speech in London, the MP said the Foreign Office was no longer the ""strategic engine"" of foreign policy making, having ""lost control"" of key functions such as trade and development and finding itself in a constant ""tug-of-war"" on national security with the Cabinet Office. ""Successive foreign secretaries - including the current one - have been hobbled,"" he told the Royal United Services Institute. ""They have had the title but they have not had the power"". He said he was not calling for the international trade, aid and defence departments to be axed as there was real technical skill involved in managing multibillion-pound programmes but he believed the Foreign Office should have ""strategic oversight"" over their delivery. Following Brexit, he said there was a real opportunity for the UK to work with like-minded countries such as Japan and Germany to advance shared interests such as free trade and the rule of law as part of a natural ""evolution"" of the post-1945 political and security order. The ex-army officer told the BBC he had ""nothing personal"" against Mr Johnson, who he said was ""talented"", but there was a clear need for someone to set a ""total foreign policy"" in the run-up to Brexit and afterwards. ""Even he has not been able to use all the levers that some of his predecessors had because he simply does not have them,"" Mr Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The reality is that Brexit isn't just about Europe. Brexit is about Britain's place in the world and this is why the foreign policy of the UK needs to be broader than just the British policy about Europe, or the British policy about trade or defence, or indeed aid."" ""All of these things play into our Brexit deal: how we look after people in North Africa affects migrant flows into Italy, how we do defence deals with the United States affects trade with France and Germany, how we do defence engagement in the Middle East affects directly energy prices and therefore the interests of European consumers."" Mr Johnson has rejected suggestions the Foreign Office's influence has shrunk, insisting the UK has one of the largest ""diplomatic footprints"" in the world. In March, he announced the creation of 250 new diplomatic posts - including 10 new sovereign missions - as part of a 15% increase in the size of the UK's overseas network. This is being funded by money set aside for Brexit preparations and for the government's Global Britain strategy, which Mr Johnson has defined as the UK being more ""outward-looking and more engaged with the world than ever before"".

N Korea official 'heads to US for talks',"General Kim Yong-chol (L) is regularly seen at Kim Jong-un's side One of North Korea's most senior officials is travelling to New York, as preparations for a planned summit gather pace. Former intelligence chief Gen Kim Yong-chol is the most senior North Korean official to visit the US since 2000. US President Donald Trump confirmed the news on Tuesday, saying he had put ""a great team together"" for the talks. The proposed meeting with Kim Jong-un was thrown into doubt after Mr Trump announced he was pulling out last week. But both sides have been working to get the summit - scheduled for 12 June in Singapore - back on track. It would be the first time a North Korean leader has met a sitting US president. Kim Yong-chol: Kim Jong-un's right hand man North Korea crisis in 300 words What does Kim Jong-un really want? The word Trump and Kim can't agree on The introduction of Gen Kim to negotiations is significant, as it underlines North Korea's desire to ensure the talks go ahead. A former spy chief, he has been part of recent high-profile diplomatic overtures by the North. South Korean news agency Yonhap had reported earlier on Tuesday that Gen Kim was due to fly to New York on Wednesday, after speaking with Chinese officials in Beijing. Confirming the news, Mr Trump said that meetings were under way about the summit ""and more"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gen Kim, 72, is a controversial figure in neighbouring South Korea, and previously served as a negotiator in inter-Korean talks. Gen Kim (R), pictured here behind Ivanka Trump, attended the closing ceremony of the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics During his time as a military intelligence head, he was accused of being behind attacks on South Korean targets, including the torpedoing of a South Korea warship which killed 46 seamen, as well as the 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures. As a result of these incidents, the US imposed personal sanctions on Gen Kim in 2010 and 2015. Despite reportedly being punished for an ""overbearing attitude"" in 2016, he has continued to hold senior posts in the army and party, and was the head of North Korea's delegation to the closing ceremony of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea. The influential figure is regularly seen at the North Korean leader's side and has attended meetings with the leaders of China and South Korea, and met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Pyongyang. In February, he was sent to the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, where he sat close to Mr Trump's daughter and adviser, Ivanka Trump. Kim Yong-chol: A controversial figure Also on Tuesday, a ""pre-advance"" team from the US was due to meet North Korean officials in Singapore, US officials said. It follows a weekend of busy diplomacy, headlined by asurprise meeting between South Korea President Moon and Mr Kim in the border town of Panmunjom.At the meeting the pair agreed that the North Korea-US summit must be held. The details of the potential US-North Korea meeting remain unclear, but discussions would address Pyongyang's nuclear programme and ways to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula. Gen Kim's visit to the US will be the most high-profile visit by a member of the North Korean regime since top military official Jo Myong-rok travelled to Washington in 2000, where he met President Bill Clinton and became the first North Korean officer to enter the Pentagon.

BBC presenter recalls 'horrible' harassment,"BBC presenter Martha Kearney has recalled the ""horrible and humiliating"" sexual harassment she experienced as a young journalist. Kearney, a new host on Radio 4's Today programme, revealed men touched her bottom while she was an LBC Westminster correspondent in the 1980s. She said she regrets not confronting her bosses, and hopes the#MeToo campaignwill make a difference. ""I wish I'd felt stronger, less intimidated,"" she told the Radio Times. ""But in my 20s bosses were powerful people."" She continued: ""I didn't complain. It was the world of work, the rough and tumble of the newsroom. ""The young women I work with at Today have zero tolerance."" The #MeToo movement, which spread around the world following allegations against Harvey Weinstein, has seen people reveal their stories of abuse and harassment. Harvey Weinstein: What next after first charges filed? What has #MeToo actually changed? What is the gender pay gap? Kearney, who was until recently the host of The World At One, also spoke about the BBC's gender pay gap, saying it was time to see whether the corporation's leadership would honour their promises on equal pay. Last year, a report found men working for the BBCearned an average of 9.3% more than women, compared with a national average of 18% more. It followeda row over star salaries, in which it was revealed that most of the top-earning presenters were men. ""There was anger and shock when the pay figures came out,"" Kearney said. ""Now the BBC is moving in the right direction, but the pace may not be as fast as we'd like."" Kearney took over the Today programme role from Sarah Montague, months after it was revealedMontague was earning significantly less than her co-presenters. Montague moved to The World At One in March. Montague left Today months after it was revealed she was paid significantly less than her co-hosts Kearney also said she had covered ""enough"" stories about equal pay to know there were ""structural problems"" and a need to make workplaces more ""family friendly"". She added: ""But there's something else going on, I think it's unconscious bias at all large organisations."" BBC director general Tony Hall has pledged to close the BBC's gender pay gap by 2020.

Journalists killed while covering US storm,"News channel WYFF 4 paid tribute to its two journalists Two journalists were killed in a ""freak of nature"" accident while covering weather conditions in North Carolina during storm Alberto. Mike McCormick and Aaron Smeltzer, from news outlet WYFF, died when a falling tree crushed their car as they drove down a highway. Fire chief Geoff Tennant had recorded an interview with the pair minutes before he received the emergency call. He said they had each exchanged wishes to stay safe just 10 minutes earlier. Mr McCormick was a reporter and anchor, and Mr Smeltzer was a photojournalist. Both were on assignment covering the extreme weather. The tree, Mr Tennant said, ""probably fell in excess of 30 feet"". While the deaths of the two journalists are not being directly attributed to the storm itself, the heavy rainfall had waterlogged the soil, probably contributing to the tree's fall. ""It is one of those things you know is going to happen, or you can predict it may happen - you don't know when,"" Mr Tennant said. Allow YouTube content?

The news station which employed both men paid tribute to them in its reporting. ""Our news family grieves over the loss of two special journalists - and two special friends,"" news anchor Carol Goldsmith said as she reported the news on WYFF 4's evening news. Mr McCormick was an anchor and reporter covering the Spartanburg area with more than a decade's experience in the role. Mr Smeltzer had joined WYFF this year from local competitor station WSPA. Early start to Atlantic Hurricane season? Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? In their own story on the tragedy, WSPA 7's anchors said: ""The journalists who died in today's crash were friends to many of us. ""They were committed to their work, to this community, and while we are of course competitors on air, Mike and Aaron were our friends and they were part of our larger journalism family. ""We will miss them both terribly."" Viewers also sent in their messages of sympathy after the news was broadcast. Subtropical storm Alberto is the first named Atlantic storm of 2018.It made landfall on Florida's north-western coast on Monday, which was also the Memorial Day holiday in the United States. It has since weakened to a subtropical depression, with maximum winds of 35 mph (55km/h) and sustained heavy rainfall, the US National Hurricane Centre said.

YouTube deletes 'violent' music videos,"YouTube says it has deleted more than half of the ""violent"" music videos that the country's most senior police officer asked it to take down. More than 30 clips have been removed so far. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has blamed some videos for fuelling a surge in murders and violent crime in London - and singled out drill music. She asked YouTube to delete content which glamorises violence. Drill originated in Chicago. Its biggest breakout star is arguably Chief Keef, famous for his 2012 track I Don't Like. The genre's lyrics often detail vivid accounts of taking drugs and violence. In February, 17-year-old rapper Junior Simpson wassentenced to life in prisonafter he and three others stabbed 15-year-oldJermaine Goupall to death. The court heard he'd penned a track about knife attacks before carrying out the killing. Giving him a life sentence, judge Anthony Leonard QC told Simpson: ""You suggested the lyrics were just for show but I do not believe that, and I suspect you were waiting for the right opportunity for an attack."" In the past two years police have asked YouTube to take down between 50 and 60 music videos, because they were deemed to incite violence. The video-sharing site has now removed more than 30 of them. ""The gangs try to outrival each other with the filming and content - what looks like a music video can actually contain explicit language with gangs threatening each other,"" the Metropolitan Police's Mike West said. ""There are gestures of violence, with hand signals suggesting they are firing weapons and graphic descriptions of what they would do to each other. Pressplay, a company that promotes drill music videos, said on its Instagram page that police had ""forced"" YouTube to take some clips down because of ""what's happened lately"". But the same post said the clips ""will probably be back up in the next few weeks"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

One in 25 Year 6 children 'severely obese',"One in 25 children in England aged 10 or 11 are severely obese, new analysis has found. Height and weight measurements show the number of children classed as severely overweight rose from 15,000 in reception to 22,000 by the time they leave primary school. The Local Government Association, which analysedPublic Health England figures,external, said action was urgently needed. The government insisted its childhood obesity plan was ""comprehensive"". The weight and height of all children in England is measured when they start and leave primary school, under the government's national child measurement programme. Figures from 2016-17 showed that for children in reception - aged four or five - about 1 in 40 (15,000 out of 629,000), was classed as severely obese. By the time they were aged 10 and 11, more than one in 25 children (22,000 out of 556,000) were in this category. What to do if your child is overweight School anti-obesity plans 'don't work' This is the first time the national child measurement programme data has included the severely obese category. Obesity in children is measured differently from adults. A BMI of more than 40 means adults are severely obese, but in children it is based on reference growth charts forboys,externalandgirls.,external Check your child's BMI usingthe NHS's BMI calculator,external The Local Government Association warned that obese children risked having their years of healthy adult life cut short by a host of health problems, including diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Izzi Seccombe, chairwoman of the LGA's community wellbeing board, said: ""These new figures on severely obese children, who are in the most critical overweight category, are a further worrying wake-up call for urgent joined-up action."" She said the UK was the most obese nation in western Europe, adding that ""today's obese children will become tomorrow's obese adults"" unless the problem is tackled. The government launched itschildhood obesity plan,externalin England in 2016.

Abortion reform 'a feminist test for May',"This video can not be played Labour's Chakrabarti says 'feminist' May must act on Northern Ireland abortion Labour has challenged Theresa May to show she really is a feminist by backing reform of Northern Ireland's strict abortion law. Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti said women in Northern Ireland ""have been let down by privileged women and men for too long"". She said the PM was a ""self-identifying feminist"" and ""the test of feminists is whether they stick up for all women"". FollowingIreland's historic vote,the PM has been urged to liberalise NI law. MPs from all parties - including some within Mrs May's own cabinet - have already called on the prime minister to support a change to the law in Northern Ireland, which is more restrictive on abortion rights compared to the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster, who is the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party propping up Mrs May's minority government,  previously said the landslide pro-abortion vote in Ireland had no impact on Northern Ireland. The UK government agreed with her. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? What next for Northern Ireland? Foster says abortion vote no impact on NI Report recommends NI abortion law change Writing an opinion piece in Tuesday's Daily Mirror,,externalBaroness Chakrabarti said women ""have a right to make difficult ethical decisions about their bodies for themselves"". Feminists must stand up for all women, ""not just women we meet at parties"", she wrote, adding: ""This is a feminist test."" The Mirror article reiterates the position set out by Baroness Chakrabarti on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday. Then she said: ""We are calling on Mrs May, a self-identifying feminist, to negotiate with the parties in Northern Ireland and then to legislate without further delay."" The peer continued: ""I think that Theresa May, really as a self-identifying feminist, needs to say 'Yes, I unveil statues of suffragists in Parliament Square, but the test of my feminism will be whether I guarantee fundamental human rights for women.'"" Analysis, by BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth Theresa May would no doubt defend her record on so-called women's issues; pointing to her work on modern slavery in the Home Office and attempts to address the gender pay gap from Downing Street. But the issue of abortion reform is far more politically fraught. Reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority, Mrs May can't afford to anger the Northern Irish party by suggesting reform from Westminster. On the other hand, several senior Tories - on whose backing the prime minister also depends - have expressed support for change. With no devolved administration in Belfast there is some pressure for the UK Government to act. Keen to avoid that, Downing Street sources have repeatedly said it's an issue to be determined in Northern Ireland. Her personal view, whatever that may be, simply might not come into play. Theresa May became the Conservative Party's first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith Theresa May, the UK's second female prime minister, has previously shown support for the feminist movement, and was famously pictured in a t-shirt with the slogan: ""This is what a feminist looks like."" As home secretary,she criticised fellow Tory Dominic Raabfor accusing feminists of ""obnoxious bigotry"" and claiming men had a raw deal in the workplace. In March, when campaigners for gender equality marched through London, Theresa May tweeted her support, referencing her promisewhen she promised to be a ""bloody difficult woman""to the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker during Brexit talks.

Unlike the rest of the UK, abortion in Northern Ireland is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. Downing Street is understood to believe that any reform ""is an issue for Northern Ireland"". But a Downing Street source said it demonstrated ""one of the important reasons we need a functioning executive back up and running"". Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, after a power-sharing deal between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed.

Private search for MH370 formally ends,"Some items of debris have been found along the east African coast The four-year hunt for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has ended with the latest, privately funded search coming to a close. US-based Ocean Infinity had been using a deep-sea vessel to survey a vast area of the southern Indian Ocean. But it found nothing and Malaysia's government says it has no plans to begin any new searches. The plane disappeared on 8 March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. Official search efforts ended last year and there are still fierce debates about what happened to the flight. Grace Nathan, whose mother was on MH370, said she was opposed to ending the hunt,external. ""People might think: 'Why are these people still harping on about this, it's been four years'. It's important for people to remember that MH370 is not history,"" she told the Guardian newspaper. Missing MH370: What we know MH370: Key pieces of debris found Too soon for MH370 memorial, say relatives 8 March 2014: Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 departs for Beijing. The plane loses contact less than an hour after take-off, with no distress signal or message sent. Initial search efforts focus on the South China Sea 15 March 2015: After evidence emerges that the plane was diverted to the south, the focus switches to the Indian Ocean July 2015: Large piece of debris washes ashore on Reunion, an island in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar January 2017: The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China announce they are suspending the official search after failing to find anything in the area thought to be the plane's final resting place January 2018: Amid pressure from relatives, Malaysia signs a deal with a private company to resume the hunt. Ocean Infinity agree to work unpaid but would have received a reward of up to $70m if it had found the wreckage May 2018: Deteriorating weather makes operating in the area impossible, bringing the hunt to an end. Malaysia says it has no plans to restart it There is still no answer. Finding the plane, or at least more bits of its wreckage, could prove key but investigators have very limited information about the plane's last hours. Experts still cannot come to a definitive conclusion as to whether MH370 remained under the pilot's command, or crashed out of control into the sea. This video can not be played Flight MH370: Audio recording reveals final cockpit communications One widely explored theory is that the plane's pilot deliberately brought it down. But Australian investigators have rejected this, saying he was unconscious during the final moments. Technical failure remains another possibility but in the absence of an official explanation conspiracy theories have abounded. Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke says a full report into the plane's disappearance will be published in the future but has not given a date. Australia, Malaysia and China have agreed that an official search would resume only if credible evidence emerged on the plane's location. Although the Malaysian government says it will not extend the private search, Anwar Ibrahim, who is widely tipped as next prime minister, told The Australian newspaper there was ""further digging"" to be done. In the long-term,a project to map the ocean floor may also offer answers,external.

YouTube deletes drill music videos,"YouTube says it has deleted more than half of the ""violent"" music videos that the country's most senior police officer asked it to take down. More than 30 clips have been removed so far. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has blamed some videos for fuelling a surge in murders and violent crime in London - and singled out drill music. She asked YouTube to delete content which glamorises violence. Drill originated in Chicago. Its biggest breakout star is arguably Chief Keef, famous for his 2012 track I Don't Like. The genre's lyrics often detail vivid accounts of taking drugs and violence. In February, 17-year-old rapper Junior Simpson wassentenced to life in prisonafter he and three others stabbed 15-year-oldJermaine Goupall to death. The court heard he'd penned a track about knife attacks before carrying out the killing. Giving him a life sentence, judge Anthony Leonard QC told Simpson: ""You suggested the lyrics were just for show but I do not believe that, and I suspect you were waiting for the right opportunity for an attack."" In the past two years police have asked YouTube to take down between 50 and 60 music videos, because they were deemed to incite violence. The video-sharing site has now removed more than 30 of them. ""The gangs try to outrival each other with the filming and content - what looks like a music video can actually contain explicit language with gangs threatening each other,"" the Metropolitan Police's Mike West said. ""There are gestures of violence, with hand signals suggesting they are firing weapons and graphic descriptions of what they would do to each other. Pressplay, a company that promotes drill music videos, said on its Instagram page that police had ""forced"" YouTube to take some clips down because of ""what's happened lately"". But the same post said the clips ""will probably be back up in the next few weeks"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Missing-from-care alerts rise 'worrying',"Teenagers make up the largest group of people reported missing in London, figures show An increase in reports of vulnerable people going missing from care in London is ""worrying"", a charity has said. Data obtained by the BBC has revealed that the Met Police handled nearly 17,000 missing from care reports in 2017 - a 34% rise since 2013. These include children missing from foster homes, and adults disappearing from nursing and residential homes. Missing People,externalsaid those going missing are at a ""high risk of harm"". Over the same time period the number of reports of adults and children with mental health issues going missing increased by 15%. The majority of missing people are found within the first 48 hours, but some are not, Missing People said. Teenagers make up the largest age group of people who are reported missing in London, figures show. The number of disappearances reported to police in the 13-18 age category rose from 23,098 in 2013 to 32,811 in 2017 - a 42% rise. Nearly 5,000 teenagers were recorded as missing in the first two months of 2018. More than half of them were in care. Det Sgt Chris Minnighan, of the Met Police's missing persons unit, said much of the recent rise was likely to reflect London's growing population, improved processes and repeat missing cases. He believes an over-reliance on police to locate someone on behalf of other agencies - such as care homes, NHS mental health facilities and hospitals - could also be contributing to the rise. ""Police are too often a comfort blanket to social services,"" he said. ""If their kids haven't come home on time, they will call the police and just have the attitude of 'It's their problem now, I'm going to bed'."" In 2015-16, 19 children's care homes in London accounted for thousands of missing cases, he said. Rise in 'missing' foster children Missing children data 'worrying' Missing children plans announced One individual child was also classified as missing 60 times between 2016-17. Susannah Drury, of Missing People, said the statistics painted ""a worrying picture"". ""Those living in care are amongst the most vulnerable in our communities and become even more vulnerable when they are missing as they are hidden from help and at increased risk of harm, including exploitation."" ""Repeat cases are a clear cry for help"", the Children's Society said Iryna Pona, of theChildren's Society,external, said carers will usually do everything possible to find a missing child before calling the police. She said it is important for carers and police to treat every episode seriously. ""A child going missing repeatedly would be a clear sign that something is wrong rather than a behavioural pattern,"" she said. ""Repeat cases are a clear cry for help and the child could very well be being sexually or criminally exploited. ""It's very common for children who are placed in homes far away from where they grew up to go missing as they are more likely to miss their family or social circle. ""But, these children are very vulnerable to exploitation due to the fact they are in care, and also because of the distance away from home."" The Met launched the Herbert Protocol which encourages carers to compile information which could be used in the event of a vulnerable person going missing Jacob - not his real name - from Shoreditch, east London, spent most of his childhood moving between care homes. The 24-year-old said it ""was the norm"" for children to run away from their foster homes. His best friend Rory went missing on his 17th birthday and never returned. ""He was having a tough time settling in due to his anxiety and depression, and then one morning he was just gone,"" he said. ""I remember the staff being quite frantic, but assumed he would turn up eventually - like all the other kids did. ""I think if the staff had helped him settle in more, or noticed he was unhappy, he would have stayed. ""But he didn't. I haven't heard from him since. ""The not knowing was the worst. Sometimes I used to pray that he wasn't in danger, in jail or even dead."" Everyone missing is divided into low, medium and high risk by police If a disappearance is out of character - the risk is raised Common reasons for adults to go missing are stresses at home, relationship problems and financial problems The most common reasons for children to go missing are abuse, neglect and conflict at home Source: Missing Persons Bureau Rise in 'missing' foster children Missing children data 'worrying' Missing children plans announced The Children's Society UK Missing Persons Unit The Met Missing People Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first South London's Christmas Lane Community pays tribute to 14-year-old with âpure heartâ stabbed to death on bus The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Free schools boost for north-east England,"The government's free school programme is being redirected towards the worst-performing areas of England, particularly the North East. Ministers are targeting the next wave of about 35 new schools in the bottom third of lowest-performing areas. It comes after criticism that the free school programme has focused on the wealthier South East. The government will also give councils Â£50m to create about 740 new school places for children with special needs. The money could help to build facilities including sensory rooms and playgrounds with specialist equipment. It is part of Â£680m which the Department for Education (DfE) has allocated to help create 40,000 more good school places in primaries and secondaries by 2021. The government said the move to redirect the programme to areas with poorer levels of education would put free schools where they were most needed. It was confirmed in guidance set out by the DfE and pubished at the same time as Education Secretary Damien Hinds said the government would be funding the expansion of grammar schools. Free schools are privately run but publicly funded. All new schools have to be free schools, which are approved and directly funded by the DfE. What are free schools? First T-level colleges announced Rankings 'toxic' for poor white schools Malcolm Trobe, from the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""It's very important to target resources into areas that are not performing well. That's really good. ""But school places are basically directed towards where we need some additional places because of demographic demand. ""If you are targeting all your money in one part of the country, one, is there sufficient demographic demand in these areas for the new schools? And two, how do you deal with demographic demand in the rest of the country?"" Mark Lehain, interim director of New Schools Network, said: ""We know the difference that these schools can make across the country and it's fantastic that the new application window has opened. ""This is going to lead to great new schools being set up in the areas that desperately need them, and we look forward to helping them in this process."" The Â£50m for special needs provision follows increased demand for services and concerns that schools do not have enough places. The money could be used to create extra places in bespoke schools or within mainstream schools, the DfE said. In April, the National Education Union heard schools were at ""breaking point"" and highlighted the plight of the ""invisible children"". But Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the funding ""will not reverse the damage that years of cuts have inflicted"". Announcing the money, Children and Families Minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""All parents want to send their child to a good local school, one that meets their individual needs and supports them to achieve their full potential, regardless of the challenges they may face. ""This funding will help to create thousands more school places across the country, with a clear focus on transforming the experience of education for children with special educational needs or disabilities."" Some 'outstanding schools not that good' Secondary school place 'shortage looms' Many councils have had to shift significant day-to-day funds from mainstream school budgets to pupils with high levels of special educational need. Some are sending pupils long distances to access costly provision in special schools in other council areas. Richard Watts, of the Local Government Association, said: ""The most effective way to set up new schools and meet the demand for school places would be to give councils the powers and funding to open new council-maintained schools where there is a need for additional places. ""Councils have responsibility for planning school places so it makes no sense for councils to be given the responsibility to plan for school places but then not be allowed to open schools themselves.""

Bank of mum and dad 'feels the pinch',"Parents are parting with thousands of pounds to help their children get on the property ladder, but they can't afford to lend as much as they used to. The average parental contribution for home buyers this year will be Â£18,000, down 17% from last year's Â£21,600, according to Legal & General (L&G). The drop shows that parents are ""feeling the pinch"", the firm says. Nonetheless, more than one in four buyers are still expected to receive financial help from friends or family. In total, financial services firm L&G said 27% of home buyers would get assistance - up from 25% last year. Despite the smaller sums being loaned, L&G said the so-called Bank of Mum and Dad was still ""a prime mover"" in the UK housing market. Francesca Hunt, from London, was given between Â£20,000 and Â£30,000 (she does not want to say the exact amount) by her parents last year to help her buy a house. She had enough money by herself for a deposit on a one-bed flat, but her parents thought a two-bedroom flat was a better investment. ""My parents decided that the price difference from a one to a two bed isn't, in the grand scheme of things, too much more,"" she says. Francesca said her parents had already put aside money to gift her at some point. ""If not, I would have inherited the money anyway. Better to use it now to get on the property ladder before prices go up even further,"" she says. The money her parents provided was ""gifted"" and Francesca says they don't own any of her flat as a result of their investment. L&G said almost 317,000 housing transactions this year would rely on at least some parental help. However, overall lending was expected to drop to Â£5.7bn this year from Â£6.5bn in 2017. Number of middle-aged renters doubles How many Â£1m-plus homes are sold near you? Could the Bank of Mum and Dad lend to other people's children? Where buyers live also has a big impact on how much they rely on their parents for help. In London, the average parental contribution is Â£31,000 compared with Â£11,000 in Scotland. The ""bank"" is expected to help fund 317,000 homes his year, up 3% on 2017 Contributions are highest in London and lowest in Scotland More buyers in London (41%) receive help from the Bank of Mum and Dad than in any other area Under-35s are most likely to receive help from their parents, with nearly three in five getting assistance Some older home buyers also rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad, with 20% of those aged between 45 and 55 receiving help ""People are feeling a bit of a pinch around the economy and therefore we're seeing pretty much a national trend outside of London for less to be given,"" L&G chief executive Nigel Wilson told the BBC. ""The volume of transactions depending on Bank of Mum and Dad funding keeps on growing, even as parents find it harder to provide as much money for the deposit."" He said it was not ""sustainable or fair"" for parents and young people to ""remain so co-dependent when it comes to housing purchases"".

"One in 25 Year 6 children 'severely obese'The figures for 10 and 11-year-olds are a further wake-up call, the Local Government Association says.2h2 hours agoHealth","One in 25 children in England aged 10 or 11 are severely obese, new analysis has found. Height and weight measurements show the number of children classed as severely overweight rose from 15,000 in reception to 22,000 by the time they leave primary school. The Local Government Association, which analysedPublic Health England figures,external, said action was urgently needed. The government insisted its childhood obesity plan was ""comprehensive"". The weight and height of all children in England is measured when they start and leave primary school, under the government's national child measurement programme. Figures from 2016-17 showed that for children in reception - aged four or five - about 1 in 40 (15,000 out of 629,000), was classed as severely obese. By the time they were aged 10 and 11, more than one in 25 children (22,000 out of 556,000) were in this category. What to do if your child is overweight School anti-obesity plans 'don't work' This is the first time the national child measurement programme data has included the severely obese category. Obesity in children is measured differently from adults. A BMI of more than 40 means adults are severely obese, but in children it is based on reference growth charts forboys,externalandgirls.,external Check your child's BMI usingthe NHS's BMI calculator,external The Local Government Association warned that obese children risked having their years of healthy adult life cut short by a host of health problems, including diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Izzi Seccombe, chairwoman of the LGA's community wellbeing board, said: ""These new figures on severely obese children, who are in the most critical overweight category, are a further worrying wake-up call for urgent joined-up action."" She said the UK was the most obese nation in western Europe, adding that ""today's obese children will become tomorrow's obese adults"" unless the problem is tackled. The government launched itschildhood obesity plan,externalin England in 2016.

"England striker defends gun tattooRaheem Sterling responds to criticism of his new inking, saying it has ""deeper meaning"".3m4 minutes agoUK","Sterling's tattoo was pictured during training in Burton-on-Trent on Bank Holiday Monday England footballer Raheem Sterling has defended his new tattoo of a gun, saying it has a ""deeper meaning"" and refers to his late father. Anti-gun campaigners criticised the Manchester City forward after he shared a photo of himself with the tattoo of an M16 assault rifle on his leg. The image has been called ""totally unacceptable"" and ""sickening"". But Sterling said it reflects a vow he made to ""never touch a gun"" after his father was shot dead when he was a boy. According to previous reports,,externalSterling's father was killed in Kingston, Jamaica. Sterling, 23, who will travel to Russia this summer as part of England's World Cup squad, first revealed his tattooin a photo posted to Instagram,externalof himself in training with team-mates at St George's Park. Sterling is currently in World Cup training with the England squad Lucy Cope, who founded group Mothers Against Guns after her son was shot dead in 2012, said Sterling should not play for England unless he gets rid of the tattoo. Speaking to the Sun newspaper,,externalshe said: ""This tattoo is disgusting. Raheem should hang his head in shame. It's totally unacceptable. ""We demand he has the tattoo lasered off or covered up with a different tattoo. ""If he refuses he should be dropped from the England team. He's supposed to be a role model but chooses to glamorise guns."" 'Give us some love,' Sterling urges fans Raheem Sterling: extended 2015 interview Sterling, who joined City from Liverpool for Â£49m in July 2015, responded on Instagram on Monday evening.

Can Salisbury survive the spy poisoning?,"New signs have been put up around the Maltings to encourage people to visit local businesses Nearly two months have passed since the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were the victims of a nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Traces of military-grade Novichok were found at nine locations and a multi-million pound operation to decontaminate the locations could take months. Meanwhile, the city is still suffering the after effects. Coming out of the railway station it is clear to see that Salisbury is a popular tourist destination. An excitable group of middle-aged Spanish tourists in puffer jackets fresh off the train are checking their maps while a quieter Japanese couple go in search of a taxi. ""Ah, ver! La catedral!,"" shouts the Spanish group's leader, as they head towards the grand monument which boasts Britain's tallest spire and gives Salisbury its city status. It feels, however, more like a market town, with independent shops nestled between traditional pubs which line evocatively-named streets such as Fish Row, Silver Street and Pennyfarthing Street. Along Fisherton Street people are enjoying the sun and the cool breeze coming off the flowing River Avon, while others take photos of the 14th Century clock tower. On the opposite side is the approach to The Mill which has a number of new signs saying ""shops open this way"". These recently-erected signs are the first indication that all is not well. Salisbury Cathedral - with original Magna Carta documents - is a major attraction The blue and white signs give way to blue and white police tape fastened across the black metal fence outside The Mill pub, still deemed by government scientists to be at risk of contamination. Police in yellow high-visibility jackets stand guard in front of the boarded-up pub to ensure no-one crosses the cordon. ""It's a strange feeling. We go about our business and then see this police line,"" says resident, Rosemary Duffy. ""It's a bit frightening as it's an unknown quantity. It's a disgusting thing that's happened here but we've got to keep going."" Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in the Maltings area of the city ""It's a disgusting thing that's happened here but we've got to keep going,"" says Rosemary Duffy It is the first time Mrs Duffy has been to the Maltings shopping precinct since the Skripals were taken ill there on 4 March. She says she was tempted back by the free parking, laid on by the local council in a bid to get more people back into the city centre. Skripal poisoning sites clean-up begins 'It's just so quintessentially English' What are nerve agents and what do they do? Like most people driving to Salisbury, Mrs Duffy parked next to the 1980s-style shopping area made out of red brick. The walk to the shops is now lined by metre-high metal fences and police tape, blocking off the main route to the shops. Richard Wheeler's business is losing between Â£12-15,000 each week since the attack Within the cordon there are some big name shops such as Superdrug, Robert Dyas and Greggs but there is also the small, independent B and R Textiles which faces the bench - now removed - where the Skripals were found unconscious. ""I'm currently losing Â£12,000 to Â£15,000 a week,"" says manager Richard Wheeler, who has been providing soft furnishings such as blinds and curtains for 30 years. ""Up until now this has been a very successful business but if this doesn't get sorted out soon it could be the end of it."" Forced to close for a week, the 60-year-old was given permission to open his shop via the back entrance, which is outside of the police cordon, so he can fulfil existing orders and fittings. ""Those take us up to the end of May but I don't know what I'll do after that."" Twelve businesses have been forced to close because they are within police cordons Poppy White has worked 55 fewer hours than normal over the past month Customers such as Liz Hannah, 57, only discovered the shop was open after Mr Wheeler's daughter posted a message on Facebook. She describes the aftermath of the attack on the Skripals as ""a bit surreal and frightening at first"" but says people have got used to it. ""It's happened and there's not a lot you can do about it. I think it will take Salisbury a while to get over it but people need to know that it's safe. ""In a way the cordons makes you feel safer because at least you know they're being thorough and cleaning it all up. Salisbury will the cleanest city ever after this."" Residents want things to return to normal as quickly as possible But Mr Wheeler - who only has enough money to pay his six staff until the end of May - says he just wants things to return to normal. ""It all seems very long-winded but there's obviously processes the authorities have to go through which do take time, but the most frustrating thing was that for the first five weeks we didn't know anything. ""We saw nothing happening regarding a clean-up - that only started last week - and then it depends if they find anything during that."" ""It feels unfair to punish Salisbury because of a terrible attack,"" says John Goodman who is visiting Salisbury with his wife, Polly The frustration is also felt by the small independent businesses along Riverside Walk, on the other side of the Mill. ""Because of the cordons we don't get our footfall along here and we don't have any business,"" says Lucy Reeves at the Crystal shop, which sells a myriad of brightly coloured gems. ""It's been a massive shock. We now feel like the Maltings is a separate part of Salisbury, it's like there's a big wall up between us and the rest of Salisbury because it's so quiet now. ""I'd say we're about 70% down on what we would normally be for this time of year which is quite scary. It could be really serious if this continues."" Ms Reeves describes the cordons as ""annoying"" but says the police ""are all really lovely"". She adds: ""It's nice having them around actually, it's someone to talk to."" Fred, Cathay, Antoine and Louise from Nice, France, visiting Salisbury for the first time Poppy White works further down Riverside Walk at Ganesha Handicrafts. ""Sales have been down, and some days we don't get anything at all,"" says the 23-year-old. The shop is now operating on reduced hours and is struggling to meet a quarter of its daily sales targets. But it is not just the shops that are suffering, it is also the people who work in them. Ms White has worked 55 fewer hours than normal over the past month. ""That equates to a lot of money that I can't live without. It's a really difficult situation. ""If this continues much longer I will have to find somewhere else to work and I don't want to do that because I like this job. ""We have a lot of loyal customers but I've only seen two of those because it's scary."" Local businesses are keen to promote a ""business as usual"" message despite the visible police presence Tourism is big business in Salisbury. Nearly 10% of all jobs are tourism related, and it is estimated that more than five million people visited Salisbury in 2016, spending about Â£270m. VisitWiltshire, which promotes tourism in the city, says it has seen a drop in the number of visitors and revenue for March and April. It describes the picture as ""mixed"" with some businesses reporting losses of 40%. There are concerns about forward bookings and cancellations from the domestic market which is why VisitWiltshire was given a Â£200,000 government grant to promote its message that it is ""business as usual"". Undeterred by the headlines, John and Polly Goodman have visited from Reading. ""I'm sure [it is] perfectly safe. I don't have any qualms about being here at all,"" says Mr Goodman. ""They know what they're doing and they're cleaning it all up and I trust the authorities to get it sorted. It feels unfair to punish Salisbury because of a terrible attack."" Leader of Salisbury City Council, Matthew Dean, says free parking, park and ride, and bus travel have been brought in to encourage people to visit Fred and Cathay from Nice, France, are visiting the city for the first time as part of a tour around the UK, with their children Antoine and Louise. ""I knew something had happened but I didn't know it was actually here. But frankly, we don't care at all,"" says Cathay. ""We come from Nice where a man in a truck killed 80 people. Fred's mum was injured in that attack but she is ok. For us, we live and want to explore the world."" Wiltshire Council has introduced free parking, free park and ride, and some free bus travel in an attempt to draw people back. Salisbury City Council leader, Matthew Dean, says a number of special events are also in the pipeline and a St George's day celebration held on Sunday in the Market Square attracted 2,500 people. ""The affected areas from the attack comprise less than 2% of the city,"" he says. Different barriers have been erected at Zizzi's, the restaurant where the Skripals ate on 4 March Paul Lewis's jewellers overlooks Zizzi's, seen cordoned off in the background Allum and Sidaway, a family-run jewellers, faces Zizzi's - the restaurant where the Skripals ate before the attack and which is now hidden by a blue cordon. The shop's manager Paul Lewis is also a director of Salisbury's Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 500 businesses.

Hero rescuer to become French citizen,"This video can not be played Malian ""Spiderman"" rescues Paris child - then meets French president A Malian migrant, hailed as a hero after mounting a daring rescue to save a small boy dangling from a balcony in Paris, is to be made a French citizen. Mamoudou Gassama won widespread praise after climbing the outside of the building to save the four-year-old. Video showed him being cheered on by spectators,externalas he pulled himself from balcony to balcony to the fourth floor. After meeting him at the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron said he would be made a naturalised citizen. He personally thanked Mr Gassama, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service. Travelling a rite of passage for many Malians Mr Gassama is said to have arrived in France last year, taking the long and dangerous journey to Europe via a boat over the Mediterranean to Italy. The drama that thrust him to fame unfolded on Saturday evening on a street in the north of the city. Mr Gassama said he had been walking past when he saw a crowd gathered in front of the building. He told Mr Macron: ""I just didn't have time to think, I ran across the road to go and save him. Firefighters rescue man stuck for hours in swing 'Wolf-like' creature puzzles experts Busking goes cashless in 'world first' for London ""I just climbed up and thank God, God helped me. The more I climbed the more I had the courage to climb up higher, that's it,"" he added. He said that the boy was crying when he hauled him to safety and had also suffered an injured foot. Firefighters arrived to find the child had already been rescued. ""Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,"" a spokesperson said. Mr Gassama met French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday Outside the presidential palace he showed off a certificate he was given Local authorities quoted by French media said the boy's parents were not at home at the time. The father has been questioned by police on suspicion of leaving his child unattended, judicial sources say. The mother was not in Paris at the time, it is believed. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was among those to praise the 22-year-old's heroism and said she had called him to thank him. She referred to him as the ""Spiderman of the 18th"", referring to the Paris district where the rescue took place, calling him an ""example for all citizens"". Allow Twitter content?

Alex Duval Smith, West Africa correspondent, BBC News Mr Gassama's four-storey dash is a reminder of another Malian hero who gained national prominence in January 2015 during an extremist attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris. A young Malian employee, Lassana Bathily, was credited with saving the lives of six hostages including a baby when he led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to their rescue. Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President FranÃ§ois Hollande. In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali. Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness.
