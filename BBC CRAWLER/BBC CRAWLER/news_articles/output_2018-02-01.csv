Climber describes 'Killer Mountain' ordeal,"This video can not be played Elisabeth Revol describes her rescue from one of Pakistan's most deadly Himalayan mountains, Nanga Parbat A French mountaineer has described how she was forced to abandon her weak and ailing climbing partner in order to be rescued from one of Pakistan's most deadly Himalayan mountains. Elisabeth Revol told AFP news agency that Polish climber Tomasz Mackiewicz's health worsened as they descended Nanga Parbat, nicknamed ""Killer Mountain"". Only she was rescued by an elite Polish climbing team in a dramatic operation. Doctors in France are now assessing whether she will require amputations. Rescuers could not reach Mr Mackiewicz and it is thought unlikely he could have survived. Among her recollections, Ms Revol said that altitude-induced hallucinations had caused her to take a shoe off in freezing conditions. The pair began climbing on 20 January, and within a few days were approaching the summit. But shortly after they reached the peak of the 8,120m (26,640ft) mountain, Mr Mackiewicz complained that he could not see. Ms Revol told AFP: ""He hadn't used a mask because it was a bit hazy during the day and by nightfall he had ophthalmia [an inflammation of the eye]."" Rescuers could not reach Polish climber Tomasz Mackiewicz He then clung to her shoulders as they began the difficult descent in darkness. Mr Mackiewicz, she said, began to have trouble breathing. ""He took off the protection he had in front of his mouth and he began to freeze. His nose became white and then his hands, his feet."" They huddled overnight in a crevasse but his condition deteriorated further with ""blood streaming from his mouth"" - a sign of a build up of fluid in the body, the ultimate stage of acute altitude sickness. She sent several messages for help and was told by rescuers to go down to 6,000m. She then left Mr Mackiewicz behind. ""It wasn't a decision I made, it was imposed on me,"" she said. Thinking that help would arrive quickly, Ms Revol left without carrying a tent or a duvet. When rescuers did not turn up, she was forced to spend another night in a crevasse. Ms Revol (centre) at the base of the Nanga Parbat after her rescue In the interview, she described having altitude-induced hallucinations. She imagined that people were bringing her hot tea, and that in order to thank them, she had to give them her shoe. After being barefoot for five hours, Ms Revol developed frostbite. An elite Polish climbing team took part in the rescue operation She heard helicopters but, because of the strong winds, they could not reach her. Fearing that she would have to spend another night there, Ms Revol began a final descent, with wet gloves and frozen feet, and managed to reach one of the rescue teams. She was flown to hospital in Islamabadand then on to Switzerland, before being transported across the French border. Doctors in the Haute-Savoie region of eastern France are now assessing whether she will require amputations to her hands and left foot due to frostbite. Despite the ordeal, she has not ruled out climbing again, saying: ""I need this.""

Apple sells fewer phones but profits rise,"The new iPhone X started selling in November Apple sold slightly fewer iPhones in the final three months of 2017 than it did the year before, but higher prices compensated for the dip. The firm reported a record $20bn (Â£14bn) in quarterly profits, driven by strong growth in Japan and Europe. The results were the first official glimpse of sales figures for Apple's expensive iPhone X. Chief executive Tim Cook said demand for the product, which starts at about $1,000, had surpassed expectations. Quarterly sales at the firm climbed by 13% year-on-year to a record $88.3bn. After an initial fall, Apple shares climbed more than 3% in after-hours trade. Apple released the iPhone X in November, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the device. And while the overall number of iPhones sold in the period slipped by 1% year-on-year to 77.3 million, the iPhone X had been the top-selling Apple handset  every week since its launch,  Mr Cook said. However the tech giant also issued a weaker-than-expected sales forecast for coming months, which appears to reinforce investor concerns that demand for Apple products may be dimming. Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco Last year Apple launched three new iPhones, but one was not like the others. The iPhone X was the main event, the talk of the town. In contrast, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus felt obsolete before Tim Cook had even finished his presentation. Investors were worried that the presence of the iPhone X would put off people buying the cheaper iPhones. And, given the X started at $999, those people may decide not to buy an iPhone at all. And that appears to be basically what happened. Apple sold marginally fewer iPhones compared with this time last year (though the company blamed that on a shorter accounting period compared with the same time in 2016). With the average selling price going up by around $100, to $796, it means Apple may be selling fewer iPhones, but it is making more from each one. Apple investors will be seeing it like this: selling fewer iPhones but dramatically upping the price is certainly one way to solve that ever-present supply chain headache. So, a timid quarter by Apple's unparalleled standards. But by no means a problem. Mr Cook said he was not over-concerned by the dip in handset sales,  adding that the 1.3 billion active Apple devices around the world provided a strong customer base for the firm's services businesses, which include Apple Pay. Analyst Carolina Milanesi, of California-based Creative Strategies,tweeted,externalthat ""1.3 billion users most of whom are extremely engaged with their devices is why the services numbers will be more and more interesting going forward"". Apple has been under a cloud afterrevealing that it deliberately slowed batteries in older phones, prompting investigations in several countries. It has since apologised, offering customers cheaper batteries and other modifications, though analysts have said that could reduce replacement purchases, potentially affecting the firm's bottom line. Jeff Fieldhack, research director at technology consultancy Counterpoint, said while Apple's opening quarter was ""fantastic"" for its new devices, it may struggle to keep sales levels up. ""Because of the higher prices, it will be a challenge to keep those volumes going,"" Mr Fieldhack said. He added the firm's performance in China, India and other emerging markets would also be crucial to future growth. Apple has struggled to lure customers away from several rivals in China, the world's largest smartphone market, as it competes against more affordable devices. It faces similar challenges in India, where the firm currently has just 2% market share . Growing its Indian customer base will be important for future sales, Mr Fieldhack said. iPhone X launch sees overnight queues Apple shares surge as iPhone X launches Apple iPhone X: The internet reacts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Body-in-freezer web search 'coincidence',"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston, south-west London A man accused of raping and murdering his niece has told a court it was ""pure coincidence"" that he made internet searches on freezing a human body a few weeks before her death. Celine Dookhran was found dead in a freezer in a house in Kingston, south-west London, on 19 July last year. Mujahid Arshid, 33, told the Old Bailey he had carried out the internet search after watching a documentary about people living in Alaska. He denies all the charges. He is also accused of kidnapping, raping and attempting to murder a second woman who cannot be named for legal reasons. Mr Arshid told the jury it was ""pure coincidence"" he had carried out an internet search for ""at what temperature does the human body freeze to death"" weeks before 20-year-old Ms Dookhran was killed. Mujahid Arshid denies raping and murdering his niece Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC also asked the 33-year-old about internet searches for ""acid bath murderer"" which were discovered on his personal laptop. The court heard the searches pulled up information on a notorious serial killer, John George Haigh, who was convicted in 1949 of a number of murders where he had disposed of the bodies using acid. Mr Arshid admitted carrying out the search but said it was because he had been wanting to start manufacturing and selling an acid-based product to unblock drains. He said he was going to call the product ""Haigh it's gone!"" using a pun on the murderers name which he described as ""funny"". ""Where's the comedy?"" Mr Aylett replied. Mr Arshid was later asked about a series of text messages he had sent to his wife several hours after the alleged crimes where he told his wife ""a darkness came over me."" He told the court he had been in a ""hysterical state of mind"" at the time and that he may have been having a psychotic break when he sent the messages. The trial continues. Murder accused rejects sex fantasy claim Murder accused 'offered victim for rape' Murder accused told wife of 'darkness' Accused 'blames murder on second woman' Woman texted mum 'he's going to kill me' Man 'inspired by acid bath killer' Builder 'kidnapped and raped' women HM Courts & Tribunals Service The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Michelle Sadio: Arrest after woman killed in drive-by shooting outside London church Bach manuscript among items worth more than Â£45 million donated to UK museums Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Supply Teaching Assistant - Kingston Police concerned for 'vulnerable' missing man with autism last seen in north London Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Fake porn videos deleted from internet,"Emma Watson is among several actresses who have had their faces merged with pornography as seen in this screenshot Pornographic videos that used new software to replace the original face of an actress with that of a celebrity are being deleted by a service that hosted much of the content. San Francisco-based Gfycat has said it thinks the clips are ""objectionable"". The creation of such videos has become more common after the release of a free tool earlier this month that made the process relatively simple. The developer says FakeApp has been downloaded more than 100,000 times. It works by using a machine-learning algorithm to create a computer-generated version of the subject's face. To do this it requires several hundred photos of the celebrity in question for analysis and a video clip of the person whose features are to be replaced. The results - known as deepfakes - differ in quality. FakeApp's creator says a single button press is required to generate the videos once a computer has been given source material But in some cases, where the two people involved are of a similar build, they can be quite convincing. Some people have used the technology to create non-pornographic content. These include a video in which the face of Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has been replaced with that of US President Donald Trump, and several in whichone movie star's features,externalhave been swapped with those of another.

But the most common use of the tool has apparently been to reversion pornography to feature popular female actresses and singers. Many of these clips have subsequently been shared online and critiqued by others. Many creators uploaded their clips to Gfycat. The service is commonly used to host short videos that are then posted to social website Reddit and elsewhere. Gfycat allows adult content, but began deleting some of the deepfakes earlier this week, a matter that was first reported by the news site Motherboard. ""Our terms of service allow us to remove content that we find objectionable. We are actively removing this content,"" Gfycat said in a brief statement. Photos of the singer Ariana Grande have been used to replace the features of one pornographic actress Reddit has yet to comment on the matter. It still provides access to clips that Gfycat has yet to delete, as well as deepfakes hosted by others. Itscontent policy prohibits,external""involuntary pornography"". Fake Obama created using AI tool But it is not clear whether it would recognise the deepfakes as such. Moreover, it requires the subjectinvolved to make a complaint,external. However, Gfycat is not the only party to have forced some of the material offline. The owner to the rights of some of the explicit content has demanded that clips be blocked on copyright grounds. In addition, the chat service Discord closed down a group dedicated to sharing the clips, saying that they had violated its rules on non-consensual pornography.

Patients 'sent home to no heat or light',"Frail and vulnerable patients are being trapped in an ""endless cycle"" of going in and out of hospitals in England, the British Red Cross is warning. The charity said the pressure on the NHS meant hospitals were rushing some patients home before they were ready and without adequate checks being made. It said its staff had found patients in distressing situations, sent back to homes with no heating or lighting. Hospitals are meant to coordinate care for frail patients on discharge. But the Red Cross said that simply was not happening because of the lack of community services available from councils and the NHS. It meant there were growing numbers of patients being readmitted soon after leaving hospital because they were getting no help, the charity said. It pointed to a report last year that suggested the number of readmissions within 30 days of being dischargedhad risen by nearly a quarter in the past four years. The study - based on Freedom of Information responses from hospitals - suggested close to one in 20 admissions was likely to be a repeat admission. The charity said it wanted to see automatic home checks for every frail patient on discharge.

Its report highlighted a number of cases, including: a woman who had been in hospital for two months sent home with no help and a fridge full of mouldy food frail patients with conditions such as broken hips being returned to homes where the gas or electricity had been cut off during their hospital stay a man on crutches taken home by ambulance at 23:00 and left in the car park outside his home The charity said the lack of support patients received increased the risk of falls in particular. Red Cross chief executive Mike Adamson said his teams had first-hand experience of the problems being encountered as they provided support to about 300,000 people across the UK after being discharged from hospital. He said: ""The NHS is rightly a source of national pride, but despite the best efforts of hardworking doctors and nurses we know many of our hospitals remain under serious pressure this winter. ""When the system is strained, all too often it is frail, older people who live alone that are falling into crisis in the gap between hospital and home."" His comments come on the day the NHS in England released figures showing the pressure hospitals are under. They showed bed-occupancy rates were once again at unsafe levels across the NHS. Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society of Acute Medicine, which represents doctors looking after patients brought in as an emergency, said staff were becoming ""increasingly anxious"" about the pressures they were working under. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said what the Red Cross had documented should not be happening. ""We expect local authorities to work closely with the NHS to ensure people are treated in the most appropriate setting and when they are discharged from hospital they have a care plan in place."" The Local Government Association called it a ""telling"" report and said a lack of funding was impacting on the ability of councils to provide care.

Five migrants shot in huge Calais brawl,"A man gets medical help from rescue workers after clashes in Calais, northern France At least five migrants have been shot during a mass brawl between Afghans and Eritreans in the French port city of Calais, local officials say. A 37-year-old Afghan man is suspected of firing shots at a queue for food handouts. Four Eritreans aged between 16 to 18 are in a critical condition. Hundreds of migrants have converged on the area in an attempt to cross the Channel to the UK. A sprawling camp known as the ""Jungle"" was dismantled near Calais in 2016. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said the violence had reached a new level and accused gangs that try to smuggle migrants to the UK of instigating the violence. This is the worst outbreak of violence between migrants in Calais for months, and the use of firearms is a worrying escalation of the tensions, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports. The cause is not yet clear but an initial fight on the city's southern outskirts broke out on Thursday afternoon, where migrants had been queuing for food handouts. Around 100 Eritreans and some 30 Afghans were caught up in the violence, which lasted almost two hours after the shots were fired. The four critically injured were shot in the neck, chest, abdomen and spine, AFP news agency reported. A group of migrants pictured with sticks during the clashes A second melee erupted shortly afterwards at an industrial site around 5km (three miles) away, when between 150 and 200 Eritreans armed with iron rods and sticks clashed with about 20 Afghans, the local prefecture said. Later in the afternoon further violence broke out at a food distribution point in an area of Calais not far from the site of the old ""Jungle"" camp. Security forces were sent to the area and there were no reports of incidents during the night. In total, 22 people were injured, including some with stab wounds, AFP added. WATCH: Child refugees hope to leave France for UK Visiting Calais, Mr Collomb added: ""There's been an escalation of violence that has become unbearable for both the people of Calais and the migrants"". The government would take control of food distribution, currently done by charities, with those groups working in association with authorities, he said. Though the""Jungle"" camp was demolished in 2016, hundreds of migrants are still living rough in the nearby woods, hoping to reach the UK. Many are young men. This video can not be played Violence broke out near the old ""Jungle"" camp Local charities put the number of such migrants living in Calais at around 800, while the authorities say there are between 550 and 600. Mr Collomb urged migrants not to head to Calais if they wanted to try to get to the UK, saying their attempts from there - often trying to hide themselves in lorries - would be unsuccessful. What next after the Jungle? The Calais ""Jungle"" became the French symbol of the European migrant crisis, and some 7,000 people - most from the Middle East and Africa - were living there before the area was cleared. Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Theresa Maysigned a treaty to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais. This video can not be played The migrants living where the Calais Jungle once stood Mr Macron has said that France will not allow a new migrant camp to be set up in Calais, and French police have been accused of brutality by some activists. He is expected to unveil a new migrant policy next month, which will include speeding up the application process for asylum seekers and faster removal of those who fail to be accepted. Charities and some of the president's allies have accused the government of taking a hard line on immigration. Could Calais Jungle grow back? Video, 00:01:43Could Calais Jungle grow back?

New Scottish domestic abuse law passed,"Ministers want to create a specific offence criminalising psychological abuse A bill to criminalise psychological domestic abuse has been passed, with some campaigners saying it ""could change Scotland forever"". The Domestic Abuse bill,external, which has wide backing, creates a specific offence of ""abusive behaviour in relation to a partner or ex-partner"". This includes psychological abuse such as coercive and controlling behaviour as well as violence. Critics claimed it could be difficult to gather sufficient evidence. However MSPs voted by 118 to one to pass the legislation, with every member speaking in favour during the final debate. It later emerged that Conservative Margaret Mitchell - who had spoken of the ""total consensus"" behind the bill - had recorded the only vote against. She said she pressed the wrong button during the vote and blamed the mistake on not wearing her glasses. Members stood to applaud domestic abuse survivors in the public gallery after the result was announced. Look back on the debate on Holyrood Live Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said it was a ""momentous day"", saying laws would now ""reflect the experience all to many women have suffered"". He said: ""Attitudes towards domestic abuse have changed considerably since this Parliament was established in 1999. Back then, some were of the mindset that domestic abuse - especially where it did not involve physical violence - was a private matter. Attitudes have rightly changed - albeit further work is needed to challenge lingering outdated or dismissive attitudes. ""I am very grateful to the domestic abuse survivors who presented their evidence to the justice committee. ""Their courage helped shaped the legislation I brought to parliament, and their actions will help the justice system prosecute those who commit one of society's most insidious crimes."" MSPs applauded domestic abuse survivors in the public gallery after the legislation was passed The new legislation says abusive behaviour is: Behaviour that is violent, threatening or intimidating Behaviour whose purpose is one of the following: making a partner dependent or subordinate isolating a partner from friends, relatives or other sources of support controlling, regulating or monitoring a partner's day-to-day activities depriving a partner of, or restricting, freedom of action frightening, humiliating, degrading or punishing a partner. The offence is aggravated if any of the behaviour is directed at a child or witnessed by them. However, Dr Marsha Scott, the chief executive of Scottish Women's Aid, said she was ""excited"" about the legislation. She said: ""Women have been telling us for 40 years that it is psychological and emotional abuse that is the most traumatic for them and the hardest to recover from, yet for such a long time we had absolutely no tools in legislation to take their stories seriously and hold abusers accountable for the untold harm that they wreak."" Ms Scott said it was the first bill in the world to create a way of ""victimless prosecution"". She said: ""It does not blame women and it does not mean women have to come into court and prove how harmed they have been by the abuse. ""In fact it is all structured in looking at the behaviour of the perpetrator and asking 'would a reasonable person think that this could be harmful?'."" Jennifer says it is now clear she suffered emotional abuse Looking back Jennifer says it is ""as clear as day"" that she suffered emotional abuse in her relationship with her ex-boyfriend. However, at the time, she did not realise how bad it was because it was ""death by a thousand cuts"". ""You think 'he doesn't like that so I'd better change that bit about me',"" she says. ""You start to clock up these ideas of 'I'd better not wear this' or 'if I say this or I'm too loud then maybe it's my fault'."" Read Jennifer's story Grazia Robertson said there could be problems gathering evidence Grazia Robertson, a criminal solicitor in Glasgow, told BBC Scotland it could be difficult to secure prosecutions. ""How would you gather sufficient evidence to successfully prosecute in a criminal court?"" she said ""I think there will be problems."" She said the bill acknowledges that prosecutions may not be able to rely on evidence from the person who has been abused. ""You may be relying on the evidence or perceptions of other people and that will make it more difficult,"" she said. Marsha Scott from Scottish Women's Aid said she was excited by the new legislation Dr Scott, from Scottish Women's Aid, said: ""There are a lot of myths out there that somehow it will be hard to get evidence to support prosecutions. ""Actually it is much harder to corroborate a threat to someone that is a one-off. ""This law will take an incident and look at it as a course of conduct. ""That will then mean there are lots of opportunities to gather evidence - there are texts, receipts and financial abuse, there are friends' stories, there are all kinds of things that will help to provide evidence of what was going on."" She said there was work to be done to build the confidence of victims and the training of police and prosecutors but ""this week we will know there is a possibility that this law will change Scotland forever"".

950 miners trapped after power cut,"Food and water is reaching the miners, their employer says About 950 workers remain trapped in a gold mine in South Africa after a storm caused a power cut, preventing them from getting out, Without electricity, lifts could not bring the night shift workers to the surface, but they ""appear to be fine"", a spokesman for their employer said. He said about 65 miners have so far been rescued and all are accounted for. Trade union officials said they feared that the lives of the miners, trapped since Wednesday night, were at risk. South Africa is a leading gold producer, but the industry has often been accused of a poor safety record. The Beatrix mine is in Welkom town, about 290km (180 miles) south-west of Johannesburg. It is owned by Sibanye-Stillwater mining firm. It has 23 levels, going down to 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) below ground.

The National Union of Mineworkers (Num) said the rescue process was ""very slow"". ""The problem is they are rescuing one mineworker at a time. It is worrying,"" Num spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu said. The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) said its concerns about dehydration and a lack of food had been heightened by ""the sheer number of workers"" trapped.

Muslim detainees 'made to pray by toilet',"The detainees were being held at Brook House immigration removal centre, near Gatwick Airport A High Court judge has criticised the home secretary after hearing Muslim men were forced to pray next to a toilet at an immigration removal centre. Mr Justice Holman said Amber Rudd had failed to provide any justification for the practice at the Brook House facility, near Gatwick Airport - operated by the private company, G4S. As a result, he said the two detainees' rights had been breached. The Home Office said it would consider the judgement ""carefully."" The judge also ruled Ms Rudd had acted unlawfully in allowing smoking in rooms at the centre. Regulations permitting exemptions to the smoking ban in public places do not extend to immigration removal centres, said Mr Justice Holman, but could be amended if the government wished to do so. The ruling means the home secretary will either have to phase out smoking from most areas of UK immigration removal centres or get the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to agree to introduce new rules allowing it. Inquiry call into immigration 'abuse' 'Serious questions' over G4S profits Immigration detainees 'held for years' The case against Ms Rudd was brought by two asylum seekers - Mohammed Hussein, originally from Ethiopia, and Muhammad Rahman, from Bangladesh. They were both detained at Brook House for several months last year before being released. The pair, who said they were devout Muslims, argued that the conditions and regime at the centre breached their right to religious observance. They said they were each locked in a room - measuring 4m x 3m - for 11 hours at night with two other detainees, and their evening and early morning prayers were conducted 3m from an ""exposed and open lavatory pan"". One of the men described the room as ""smelly and dirty"", saying it distracted him from his prayers. The other detainee called the conditions ""disgusting"". Mr Justice Holman said the evidence ""clearly established"" that being forced to worship in such a confined space with an internal lavatory contravened the men's right to worship under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. He said the conditions were also discriminatory because they affected Muslims more than people of other religions, due to their prayer requirements. The court heard that the home secretary had ""conceded"" that she had not paid ""due regard"" to the need to eliminate discrimination as she was obliged to do under the Equality Act. The judge ordered her to address the issue within a ""reasonable time"" and demonstrate that she had done so. A Home Office spokeswoman said the department respected the rights of detainees to practise their religious faith. ""Immigration Removal Centres are equipped with mosques and multi faith rooms for detainees to use for prayer, study and reflection,"" she said. ""Communal prayers are available in all centres as well as facilities for prayer in the detainees' rooms such as access to prayer mats."" But she added: ""We will consider today's judgement carefully."" Mr Justice Holman said Amber Rudd (pictured) had failed to provide any justification for the practice at Brook House Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who represented the detainees, said they hoped the government would take immediate steps to improve conditions. Raza Halim, the pair's barrister, said: ""Religion and prayer provide unique solace to many far from home because of war or persecution. ""It is particularly profound in the circumstances of a detention that you cannot understand. ""The court recognised how Muslim worship could be 'degraded' because of where detainees are forced to pray near open, recently used toilet pans in small cells."" The BBC has contacted G4S for a response. Brook House became the subject of a BBC Panorama undercover investigationlast year that revealed detainees were ""mocked and abused"". The programme said it had seen ""widespread self-harm and attempted suicides"" in the centre, and that drug use was ""rife"". According to the Home Office, the majority of those held are failed asylum seekers or illegal immigrants waiting to be deported from the UK on organised charter flights. Brook House is one of 11 detention removal centres in England, which together took in 28,908 people last year - including 71 children.

White House 'to release' secret memo,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation A Republican-drafted memo alleging FBI bias against US President Donald Trump will be released on Friday, a senior White House official says. Mr Trump is expected to declassify the document and send it to Congress for release, according to US media. The FBI has voiced ""grave concerns"" about the release of the memo, which may have redactions. It reportedly says the FBI misled an intelligence court to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump election campaign. Democrats say the memo is a ruse to discredit a federal inquiry into links between President Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington The four-page document was compiled by aides for House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, who served on the Trump team during his White House transition. It reportedly accuses the FBI and justice department of misleading a judge in March last year while seeking to extend a surveillance warrant against Carter Page, who was a foreign policy adviser to the 2016 Trump election campaign. The memo is said to argue that the FBI and justice department did not tell the judge that some of their justification for the warrant relied on a much-disputed Trump-Russia dossier. Compiled by a former British intelligence agent, that dossier was financed in part through the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. Unnamed sources told Reuters news agency the Republican memo is misleading because all the dossier excerpts used in the FBI warrant application were independently confirmed by US intelligence. Mr Page, the former Trump adviser, testified before a congressional committee last November that he met Russian government officials during a trip to Moscow in July 2016. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Aides to Republican Devin Nunes wrote the secret memo Congressional Democratic leaders called on Thursday for Mr Nunes' immediate removal as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. They accuse him of seeking to undermine inquiries into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin or obstructed US investigators. Democrats say the White House could use the memo to justify firing justice department special counsel Robert Mueller, whose Russia investigation is overhanging the Trump presidency. The House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff, says Republicans have also amended the memo. Mr Schiff said the text was changed after the Republicans who control the panel voted on Monday to release the document. The California Democrat said Mr Nunes had sent the White House a version of the memo that had been ""materially altered"". But an unnamed Republican aide said the amendments were grammatical changes and ""minor edits"", including two tweaks requested by the FBI and by Democrats. The aide accused Democrats of an ""increasingly strange attempt to thwart publication"". The Republican president's declassification of the memo could pit him against his own Department of Justice. The agency, which oversees the FBI, has warned that the memo's release could jeopardise underlying intelligence used to draft it. It could also damage the arrangement under which US intelligence agencies brief lawmakers on secrets, with the understanding they will not end up in the public domain. FBI Director Christopher Wray, who was appointed by President Trump, said on Thursday he will issue a rebuttal if the document is released. The FBI issued an unusual rebuke on Wednesday to the president and his fellow Republicans in Congress. The law enforcement bureau voiced ""grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy"". The president has called the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"" and ""hoax"".

Treatment for sick boy 'futile',"Alfie Evans suffers from a progressive neurological degenerative condition The father of a seriously ill 20-month-old boy broke down in tears as a court was told further hospital treatment would be ""futile"". Tom Evans and Kate James, both 20 and from Bootle, want to take their son Alfie abroad for treatment. The hearing to decide if life support should be withdrawn from Alfie, who has a mystery illness, was stopped briefly while Mr Evans was comforted by family. UK doctors said continuing treatment was unkind, the court heard. Alfie is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" and has a degenerative neurological condition that has not been precisely diagnosed. Mr Justice Hayden, who told the court he himself had had the ""privilege"" of visiting Alfie in hospital, said: ""Everybody in this court shares the same objectives, everybody wants the best for Alfie."" Alfie's parents believe he responds to them, and his father told reporters outside court he was ""improving healthwise"". But the High Court, sitting in Liverpool, heard any movements by the child are spontaneous seizures as a result of touching. Michael Mylonas QC, representing the hospital, said: ""One of the problems of this case is they look at him and, barring the paraphernalia of breathing and feeding, he's a sweet, lovely, normal-looking boy who opens his eyes, [and] will smile..."" Tom Evans and Kate James want to take their son Alfie abroad for treatment Mr Mylonas said scans of Alfie had shown ""catastrophic degradation of his brain tissue"" which was getting worse. He said that, at the request of the parents, three medical experts from the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome had visited Alfie in Alder Hey. They had reached the same conclusions in terms of the ""complete futility"" of trying to find a cure or alleviating his seizures. The Italian experts had suggested operations to help Alfie breathe and feed and keep him alive for an ""undefined period"". But Dr Martin Samuels, an expert in the ventilation of children, believed such operations were ""inappropriate"". Supporters of Tom Evans and Kate James outside Liverpool Family Court ""I think we are all agreed from the medical perspective that life expectancy is limited,"" he said. Prof Helen Cross told the court that tests showed Alfie only displayed brain activity when he was having seizures. She said Alfie's scans were ""highly abnormal"" with an estimated loss of 70% of his brain nerve fibre. This was not reversible, she said. ""Prolonging his life unnecessarily is not a way to go considering his brain is being progressively destroyed and there is no prospect of recovery,"" she added. Supporters wearing T-shirts saying ""release Alfie Evans"" are also at the two-day hearing. Despite mediation between the parents and specialists caring for Alfie at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, the city's family court will decide the child's fate. It follows apreliminary hearing at the High Courtin London last year when Mr Justice Hayden said everyone wanted what was best for Alfie, but ruled he would make a decision if agreement could not be reached after hearing from both sides. Doctors at Alder Hey believe they should stop ""mechanical ventilation"" for Alfie, who was born in May 2016. Alfie with his father and mother Kate James The Bambino Gesu Hospital was also involved in the case of terminally-ill Charlie Gard, asking British doctors if he could be transferred to their care. It came afterPope Francis calledfor his parents to be allowed to ""accompany and treat their child until the end"". Charlie had mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness,and died in a hospice at 11-months-old. The hearing will continue with more expert evidence on Friday.

Wagner 'person of interest' in Wood's death,"Police say Robert Wagner was the last person to see his wife, actress Natalie Wood, alive US police investigating the mysterious death of film star Natalie Wood say her husband Robert Wagner is now a person of interest. Investigators in Los Angeles say Wagner has ""constantly changed his story"", adding that his version of events does not ""add up"". Wood was found drowned in 1981 during a California boat trip with Wagner and the actor Christopher Walken. Her death was ruled to have been an accident but questions have lingered. ""As we've investigated the case over the last six years, I think [Wagner] is more of a person of interest now,"" Lt John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's office told CBS News. ""We know now that he was the last person to be with Natalie before she disappeared,"" he said. ""I haven't seen him tell the details that match all the other witnesses in this case"". ""I think he's constantly changed his story a little bit. And his version of events just don't add up,"" Lt Corina added. Natalie Wood's death certificate amended LA police reopen actress' death inquiry Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht have contributed to the mystery of how the actress died in November 1981. Family members have previously asked for authorities to re-examine the findings of the original investigation. Wood, who was 43 when she died, was nominated for an Oscar three times but never won Wood, who starred in West Side Story and Rebel Without a Cause, had been partying the night before her death. The coroner's investigation ruled she had been drinking and may have slipped trying to board a dinghy. But police say two new witnesses have corroborated accounts of a fight between Wagner and Wood on the night she disappeared. They say it appears the actress was the victim of an assault. The post-mortem report said Wood had bruises on her body and arms as well as a facial abrasion on her left cheek. The captain of the boat, Dennis Davern, told NBC News in 2011 that he lied to police during the initial investigation and that a fight between Wood and Wagner had led to her death. Wagner has had numerous TV and film roles TV star Wagner, 87, has not commented on the latest developments but acknowledged in his memoir that he had argued with his wife before she disappeared. Investigators say he has refused to speak to them since the case was reopened in 2011. Fidel Castro's son 'takes own life' Fake porn videos deleted from internet Man builds tank, loses driving licence In 2012, Wood's death certificate was amended to reflect the uncertainty surrounding her death. It now says she died as a result of ""drowning and other undetermined factors"" and the circumstances of how she ended up in the water are ""not clearly established"". As a child, Wood featured in films like Miracle on 34th Street and The Ghost and Mrs Muir. She was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Rebel Without a Cause, and for best actress for Splendor in the Grass and Love with the Proper Stranger.

May to fight post-Brexit residency move,"The prime minister said those arriving after Brexit would have a different set of expectations Theresa May has indicated she will fight a proposal to give residency rights to EU citizens during the transition period after Brexit. She said there had to be a difference between those arriving after the UK leaves and those who came before. She also sought to reassure Tory MPs worried about the length of transition. The European Parliament's Brexit lead, Guy Verhofstadt, responded by tweeting:  ""Citizens' rights during the transition are not negotiable."" He said that ""for the transition to work"" there could not be ""two sets of rights for EU citizens"". A guide: What is the Brexit 'transition' phase? End obsession with Europe, Fox urges Pienaar: Are the Conservatives unleadable on Brexit? And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he opposed the PM's move, which he said would make it ""harder for all of us"" if it made it harder for EU nationals to come and work in the NHS. Asked whether he believed he thought Mrs May had bowed to pressure from Brexiteers, the UK opposition leader said: ""I think Theresa May is probably looking behind herself all the time. ""What she needs to be concentrating on is protecting jobs and ensuring we have good, tariff-free relations with Europe in the future."" The transition period - also referred to as an implementation period - is seen as a way to minimise disruption when the UK leaves the EU for things like business, holidaymakers and security. Earlier this week, the EU set out what it was prepared to offer the UK, saying it expected the transition to last from the day of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020. Some Brexit-supporting MPs are worried that this period could be extended, but speaking during her trade trip to China, Mrs May insisted such an ""implementation period"" would last about two years. ""We are not talking about something that is going to go on and on... we're leaving the European Union. There is an adjustment period for businesses - and indeed government - for changes that need to be made,"" she said. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Theresa May has been under pressure from pro-Brexit backbenchers to address the question of citizens' rights. They argue that the EU has accepted full citizens' rights would only apply to people who are here before Brexit on 29 March, 2019. But the EU says arrangements during the transition period have to be negotiated separately and wants full rights to extend until December 2020. The PM is saying no - it's an important principle that people who arrive during transition are treated differently. In practice, though, the only difference during transition would be that EU citizens arriving then would have to register that they are here. But government sources say that what rights they have after transition has to be a matter for negotiation. For example, if there's a new system that requires visas or work permits, they may have to apply for one. In December, the two sides agreed a deal setting out the proposed rights of EU citizens in the UK and British expats on the continent after Brexit. It says that all EU nationals who have been in the UK for more than five years will be expected to be granted settled status, giving them indefinite leave to remain with the same access to public services as now. Those who have been resident for a shorter period but who arrive before the Brexit cut-off date, currently expected to be 29 March, 2019, will also be able to stay and get settled status once they have been in the UK for five years. At the time, Downing Street said it envisaged anyone arriving after Brexit being able to continue to live, work and study in the UK during the transition period but that they would need to register, and the future immigration rules would have to be agreed as part of the wider transition negotiations. But the EU has since said it expects existing rules on freedom of movement - including the path to permanent residency - to apply in full until the end of the transition phase, which is currently expected to be 31 December 2020. The EU has said the UK must abide by all its rules and regulations during the transition phase Mrs May, who is on the second day of a three-day trade trip to China, said she would contest the issue of long-term residency rights when transition negotiations begin in earnest next month. ""When we agreed the citizens' rights deal in December we did so on the basis that people who had come to the UK when we were a member of the EU had set up certain expectations,"" she said. ""It was right that we have made an agreement that ensured they could continue their life in the way they had wanted to - now for those who come after March 2019 that will be different because they will be coming to a UK that they know will be outside the EU. ""I'm clear there is a difference between those people who came prior to us leaving and those who will come when they know the UK is no longer a member."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, who is travelling with the prime minister, said Mrs May was showing she was willing to push back against the EU amid discontent on the Conservative benches. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? UK agrees 'first step to China deal' But Mrs May is also under pressure from pro-European Conservative MPs who want to maintain close ties with the EU. Speaking to the Today programme, former chancellor George Osborne questioned whether the prime minister had a Commons majority to leave the EU customs union. Mr Osborne, who has criticised the prime minister several times since leaving front-line politics, also said an increasing number of Tory MPs were now considering whether the UK should be in the European Free Trade Association, like Norway and Switzerland. Ministers have already said the UK has to leave the customs union and single market as part of Brexit. Meanwhile, government analysis has emerged suggesting the cost of cutting EU migration would be much greater than the benefits of a US trade deal. BuzzFeed News has claimed,externalgovernment studies on the economic impact of Brexit say reducing migration from the bloc into the UK would nullify the benefits of any trade deal struck with Washington. Ministers agreed on Wednesday to let MPs see another leak from the same impact analysis which suggests the economy would be worse off as a result of a number of possible Brexit scenarios. Asked about the latest Buzzfeed report in the Commons, Brexit Minister Suella Fernandes said the document was not government policy, and ""comes with significant caveats"".

"Wagner 'person of interest' in Wood's deathPolice say star Natalie Wood's then husband actor Robert Wagner has ""changed his story"" about how she died in 1981.24m24 minutes agoUS & Canada","Police say Robert Wagner was the last person to see his wife, actress Natalie Wood, alive US police investigating the mysterious death of film star Natalie Wood say her husband Robert Wagner is now a person of interest. Investigators in Los Angeles say Wagner has ""constantly changed his story"", adding that his version of events does not ""add up"". Wood was found drowned in 1981 during a California boat trip with Wagner and the actor Christopher Walken. Her death was ruled to have been an accident but questions have lingered. ""As we've investigated the case over the last six years, I think [Wagner] is more of a person of interest now,"" Lt John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's office told CBS News. ""We know now that he was the last person to be with Natalie before she disappeared,"" he said. ""I haven't seen him tell the details that match all the other witnesses in this case"". ""I think he's constantly changed his story a little bit. And his version of events just don't add up,"" Lt Corina added. Natalie Wood's death certificate amended LA police reopen actress' death inquiry Conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht have contributed to the mystery of how the actress died in November 1981. Family members have previously asked for authorities to re-examine the findings of the original investigation. Wood, who was 43 when she died, was nominated for an Oscar three times but never won Wood, who starred in West Side Story and Rebel Without a Cause, had been partying the night before her death. The coroner's investigation ruled she had been drinking and may have slipped trying to board a dinghy. But police say two new witnesses have corroborated accounts of a fight between Wagner and Wood on the night she disappeared. They say it appears the actress was the victim of an assault. The post-mortem report said Wood had bruises on her body and arms as well as a facial abrasion on her left cheek. The captain of the boat, Dennis Davern, told NBC News in 2011 that he lied to police during the initial investigation and that a fight between Wood and Wagner had led to her death. Wagner has had numerous TV and film roles TV star Wagner, 87, has not commented on the latest developments but acknowledged in his memoir that he had argued with his wife before she disappeared. Investigators say he has refused to speak to them since the case was reopened in 2011. Fidel Castro's son 'takes own life' Fake porn videos deleted from internet Man builds tank, loses driving licence In 2012, Wood's death certificate was amended to reflect the uncertainty surrounding her death. It now says she died as a result of ""drowning and other undetermined factors"" and the circumstances of how she ended up in the water are ""not clearly established"". As a child, Wood featured in films like Miracle on 34th Street and The Ghost and Mrs Muir. She was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Rebel Without a Cause, and for best actress for Splendor in the Grass and Love with the Proper Stranger.

"Girl, 12, held in LA school shooting","Police checked students as they were evacuated from classrooms Two teenage students have been shot at a Los Angeles school, and police say that a 12-year-old girl is in custody and her weapon has been seized. The gunfire broke out at 08:55 local time (16:55 GMT) at Salvador Castro Middle School in the Westlake District. A 15-year-old boy who was shot in the head is in ""critical but stable"" condition, and a girl, 15, was shot in the wrist, officials say. Three others, aged 11 to 30, suffered minor injuries, police say. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirmed to the BBC the female is 12 years old. Allow Twitter content?

An 11-year-old boy, a 12-year-old girl and a 30-year-old woman reportedly sustained minor injuries, with abrasions to the head and face but were not shot, said Fire Department Captain Erick Scott at a news conference. Authorities have not released a suspected motive for the shooting, or more details of how the girl was arrested. Steve Zipperman, the chief of police for Los Angeles schools, said that investigators will carefully examine the case and will make trauma counsellors available to any students who may need them. ""We will attend to the needs of these students who witnessed this very carefully, with the understanding that this is very traumatic,"" he said at a press conference outside the school. Interim Superintendent for the Los Angeles Unified School District Vivian Ekchian said in a statement, ""our thoughts and prayers are with those who were hurt in today's shooting incident"". Ms Ekchian added the school district is ""providing appropriate supports to those who may be impacted by the incident"". This is at least the third shooting at a US school in recent weeks.

Birds Eye ad pulled over safety fears,"Birds Eye said it immediately removed the advert when it was made aware of the issue Frozen food giant Birds Eye has pulled a fish finger advert over concerns raised by County Durham safety campaigners. The TV advert featured a man and boy jumping into the sea with a voiceover declaring: ""Captain Birds Eye loves the simple things, like jumping into cold water on a hot day with his grandson."" A campaign group set up after the death of a 14-year-old boy from cold water shock called the advert inappropriate. The firm agreed to amend it. Cameron Gosling, from Crook, died after going swimming with friends in the River Wear in July 2015. It later emerged he had not acclimatised to the cold temperature of the water. The teenager's family and Durham County Council subsequently launched the Dying to be Cool campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of swimming in cold water. Cameron Gosling died after going swimming in the River Wear Cameron's mother Fiona contacted the company to say she was ""shocked"" when she saw the advert. She added: ""There are so many families and organisations that work so hard on water safety education. It seemed as though Birds Eye hadn't done its research before making it."" The council wrote to Birds Eye expressing concern that the advert suggested jumping into cold water on a hot day was safe. A spokesman for Birds Eye said: ""We take our advertising responsibilities very seriously and we were grateful to be made aware of this issue. ""We have taken the current advert off air. We are now amending the voiceover to remove references to the temperature of the water and weather. ""As a family brand, we decided to take swift action and wish campaigners every success in highlighting this important issue."" Body found in missing teen search Bikers escort teenager's coffin.

Two thirds 'have no one to talk to',"Two thirds of UK adults feel they have nobody to talk to about their problems, a survey has found. Of the 2,500 people questioned, 66% said they had no one to speak to about mental health, relationships or money. Difficulty finding the right time or place to talk were given as reasons behind the trend, the survey by mental health campaign Time to Change said. The campaign's director Sue Baker OBE said hard work was needed by everyone to break down ""barriers to talking"". More than a third (36%) of those questioned said they could never find the right time to raise their problems, while 28% said they had not spoken to anybody as they could not find anywhere appropriate to raise their concerns. Just over 22% said they had waited for a year for the ""perfect"" moment to discuss their issues. The survey by the Time to Change project has been released to coincide withTime to Talk Day,external, which is backed by charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness. Ms Baker said: ""People still think there is no right time or place to talk about mental health - that it's something that should be whispered about in quiet corners. Mental health and stigma: 'You're not alone' Ruby Tandoh: Sharing food helps my mental health Mental health beds for young people tripled in Bristol ""Conversations have the power to change lives, wherever they take place. So whether you're at home, at work, in the cinema, or even in the car, Time to Talk Day (1 February) is the perfect chance to be more open about mental health."" Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Jeremy Hunt added: ""Too many people still feel unable to talk about their mental health. ""Time to Talk Day is an important reminder of the power of conversation, and how by taking small steps to help others we can all make our own contribution to a better and more mentally resilient society."" This video can not be played NHS begins running club for mental health The survey comes just weeks after the government announced new measures to help combat loneliness and social isolation in the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May said in January that a series of policy changes - including the creation of a loneliness minister - would be introduced following recommendations from the Jo Cox Commission, which campaigns on the issue. Research carried out by the commission found that almost 200,000 older people had not had a conversation with a friend or relative in more than a month. It also said that more than nine million people in the UK described themselves as ""always or often lonely"". Tips for starting conversations 1. Start small Many people find talking in person intimidating, and that is understandable. But it does not need to stop you from starting a conversation altogether. You could make a quick phone call, send your best mate a text, or leave a note for a parent. 2. Time and place Sometimes it is easier to talk side by side rather than face to face. So, if you do talk in person, you might want to chat while you are doing something else. You could start a conversation when you're walking, cooking or stuck in traffic. 3. Gentle questions There are lots of misconceptions around mental illness. That means asking questions can be an important way of learning. Just remember not to get too personal, and be aware if the discussion is making someone feel uncomfortable. 4. Be open Being open and honest with others can help to build trust. For example, you might choose to tell your friend something about you that they may not know. Just remember, do not feel pressure to share anything that you are not comfortable with. 5. Treat people the same When someone is diagnosed with a mental illness, they are still the same person as they were before. And that means when a friend or loved one opens up about mental health, they do not want to be treated any differently. If you want to support them, keep it simple. Do the things you would normally do.

Polar bears 'running out of food',"This video can not be played Watch: Collar cams reveal polar bear's-eye view High-tech tracking collars on nine female polar bears have measured the animals' efforts to find food on the diminishing Arctic ice. Each bear wore a collar - recording video, location and activity levels - for 8-12 days, while metabolic tracers tracked the bears' energy use. This revealed that most of the animals were unable to catch enough prey to meet their energy needs. The team says wild bears have higher metabolic rates than thought. The team tracked nine solitary female polar bears over 8-12 days Moreover, climate change appears to be having dramatic effects on the Arctic sea-ice, forcing polar bears to move greater distances as they hunt, and making it harder for them to catch prey. The vision of a polar bear plucking a vulnerable seal off an ice floe is something familiar to wildlife documentary fanatics. Earlier this winter, though,an image of an emaciated polar bear went viral,with many asking if this was the telltale image of climate change. The authors of this study,published in the journal Science,external, point out that the animals do now need to travel further to find seals, and that this is likely to be an ""important factor explaining declines in their body condition and survival"" of polar bears. Polar bears travel further on ice Polar bears use the sea ice to hunt seals and, as it diminishes, have to travel further to find their food In Spring of 2014, 2015, and 2016, Anthony Pagano, a researcher at the University of California Santa Cruz and his colleagues, set out to track the polar bears' hunting and survival during this critical season. They captured nine females on the sea-ice of the Beaufort Sea and measured the metabolic rates of each bear using blood and urine samples. They also fitted the bear with the GPS-camera collars, to record and film their activity. ""We found that polar bears actually have much higher energy demands than predicted. They need to be catching a lot of seals,"" Mr Pagano explained. The extent of Arctic sea-ice, as measured at its minimum in September, is decreasing at a rate of about 14% per decade, which is likely reducing polar bears' access to seals. And their plight could be exacerbated by the need to alter hunting strategies with the seasons. In the spring, the researchers explained polar bears are mostly preying on juvenile seals. But later in the year, after the bears' long summer fast, those young seals are older and wiser, meaning polar bears are not able to catch as many. ""It's thought that bears might catch a couple per month in the fall, compared to five to 10 per month in the spring and early summer,"" Mr Pagano said. ""We now have the technology to learn how they are moving on the ice, their activity patterns, and their energy needs, so we can better understand the implications of these changes we are seeing in the sea-ice.""

"Consumers face Â£1,000 hit for not switching","Customers who fail to switch their energy, broadband or insurance providers could be paying up to Â£1,000 extra a year, Citizens Advice warns. The charity is calling for an investigation by the UK's competition watchdog into what it calls the extra price of ""loyalty"". Customers who do not switch are often moved onto default tariffs. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was already looking at the impact on vulnerable people. Using its previous studies into various sectors, the charity suggested that it was common for longstanding customers to be charged more than new customers. How to switch energy supplier Mobile companies overcharging customers after contracts end Sectors affected included energy, mobile, broadband, home insurance, fixed-rate mortgages and cash Isa savings accounts. The charity estimated that longstanding customers could be paying Â£987 more a year. Many were customers aged over 65 and some were on low incomes who were unlikely or unable to switch, Citizens Advice said. ""Companies routinely use tactics that take advantage of human behaviour, and regulators are letting them get away with it,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""That is why regulators need to take action by setting targets to reduce the number of loyal customers who pay over the odds, and investigating solutions for vulnerable people.""

Climber describes 'Killer Mountain' ordealElisabeth Revol says she was forced to abandon her climbing partner in order to be rescued.1han hour agoEurope,"This video can not be played Elisabeth Revol describes her rescue from one of Pakistan's most deadly Himalayan mountains, Nanga Parbat A French mountaineer has described how she was forced to abandon her weak and ailing climbing partner in order to be rescued from one of Pakistan's most deadly Himalayan mountains. Elisabeth Revol told AFP news agency that Polish climber Tomasz Mackiewicz's health worsened as they descended Nanga Parbat, nicknamed ""Killer Mountain"". Only she was rescued by an elite Polish climbing team in a dramatic operation. Doctors in France are now assessing whether she will require amputations. Rescuers could not reach Mr Mackiewicz and it is thought unlikely he could have survived. Among her recollections, Ms Revol said that altitude-induced hallucinations had caused her to take a shoe off in freezing conditions. The pair began climbing on 20 January, and within a few days were approaching the summit. But shortly after they reached the peak of the 8,120m (26,640ft) mountain, Mr Mackiewicz complained that he could not see. Ms Revol told AFP: ""He hadn't used a mask because it was a bit hazy during the day and by nightfall he had ophthalmia [an inflammation of the eye]."" Rescuers could not reach Polish climber Tomasz Mackiewicz He then clung to her shoulders as they began the difficult descent in darkness. Mr Mackiewicz, she said, began to have trouble breathing. ""He took off the protection he had in front of his mouth and he began to freeze. His nose became white and then his hands, his feet."" They huddled overnight in a crevasse but his condition deteriorated further with ""blood streaming from his mouth"" - a sign of a build up of fluid in the body, the ultimate stage of acute altitude sickness. She sent several messages for help and was told by rescuers to go down to 6,000m. She then left Mr Mackiewicz behind. ""It wasn't a decision I made, it was imposed on me,"" she said. Thinking that help would arrive quickly, Ms Revol left without carrying a tent or a duvet. When rescuers did not turn up, she was forced to spend another night in a crevasse. Ms Revol (centre) at the base of the Nanga Parbat after her rescue In the interview, she described having altitude-induced hallucinations. She imagined that people were bringing her hot tea, and that in order to thank them, she had to give them her shoe. After being barefoot for five hours, Ms Revol developed frostbite. An elite Polish climbing team took part in the rescue operation She heard helicopters but, because of the strong winds, they could not reach her. Fearing that she would have to spend another night there, Ms Revol began a final descent, with wet gloves and frozen feet, and managed to reach one of the rescue teams. She was flown to hospital in Islamabadand then on to Switzerland, before being transported across the French border.

More Brits become millionaires,"The number of British households that could consider themselves as millionaires rose by nearly a third in two years, official figures show. A total of 3.6 million households in Britain held wealth of more than Â£1m by June 2016, up 29% in two years, the Office for National Statistics said. Wealth includes pension savings, investments, belongings, and property values less any outstanding mortgage. Campaigners argue that the figures expose wealth inequality. The median wealth per British household, after borrowing is taken into account, was Â£259,400 by July 2016. This was 15% higher compared with two years earlier, theofficial figures,externalshow. The figures do not account for the rising cost of living over that time. The figures show the amount of wealth held by each of Britain's 26 million households as a whole, irrespective of whether there is one or several occupants. While the wealth of those at the top end of the scale has risen, driven by the growth of private pensions and property values, those at the other end have suffered a fall over the same period. The poorest fifth of households, less likely to own a home or a private pension, saw their wealth diminish. For the bottom one in 10 households, that meant a typical fall of Â£3,000 to Â£32,000. Your biggest financial decision - in charts The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Conor D'Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, which lobbies for low-income groups, said: ""Britain is very good at generating wealth, but terrible at spreading it around the country and even worse at taxing it properly. As a result, we have unacceptably high levels of wealth inequality. ""Young people in particular are feeling the effects of Britain's wealth divide. Our large millennial generation own just 2% of the nation's wealth. This stems from their struggle get on the housing ladder, boosting other's people wealth in the private rented sector, rather than build assets of their own."" The data does show that there was little change in the proportion of wealth held by those at the top and those at the bottom over the period covered by the figures. The key factors behind the rise in wealth has been more people seeing their pension pots expand, as well as the rise in property values. There was a 20% rise in private pension wealth by July 2016 compared with two years earlier, to Â£5.3 trillion, primarily the result of workplace final-salary pensions growing in value, or amid pensions already being paid to those who are retired. This total was slightly ahead of the 17% rise in property wealth, which grew to Â£4.6 trillion over the same period. This increase in property wealth was reflected in the regional breakdown of wealth. Median net property wealth in London was Â£351,000 by June 2016 - a third higher than two years earlier. There were signs of Londoners choosing to put money into a deposit for a home, rather than into savings or shares. The amount of financial wealth in London fell the sharpest compared with other areas of Britain. Median household total wealth, which includes everything from cars to cash, was highest in the South East of England at Â£381,000 by June 2016, followed by the South West of England (Â£336,000). The lowest was in the North East of England, with median household wealth of Â£163,000. Your biggest financial decision - in charts Has your pay outperformed inflation?

Republicans 'altered' secret memo on FBI,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The US House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat has accused Republicans of amending a memo about claims of FBI surveillance at the 2016 election. Adam Schiff said Republicans had changed the text after it was voted on. The secret document was passed by the Republican-dominated committee but needs approval from President Donald Trump to be made public. It is believed to accuse the FBI of abusing its surveillance powers to target the Trump campaign. The four-page document was compiled by staffers for House Intelligence Committee head Devin Nunes, a member of Mr Trump's Republican party. Concerns about its contents were raised by the FBI itself which complained of ""material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy"". Democrats fear the document may be an attempt to discredit the inquiry into Trump campaign links to Russia, which is being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. If Mr Trump gives his approval, the memo may be released later on Thursday. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Staffers for Republican Devin Nunes wrote the secret memo It apparently accuses the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) of abusing a programme known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) during the presidential election campaign. The allegation is that the FBI spied on a member of Mr Trump's campaign on the basis of unproven accusations against Mr Trump known as the ""Russian dossier"". That dossier was compiled by former UK intelligence agent Christopher Steele with money financed in part from Hillary Clinton's campaign. Following his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, Mr Trump was heard telling a Republican lawmaker he was ""100%"" for releasing the document. The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington Why attacks on Mueller are mounting According to Mr Schiff, the text approved by the committee on Monday is not the same as that given to the White House.

Mr Nunes sent a version of the memo that was ""materially altered"", the Democrat said. He gave no details. Quoted by Reuters news agency, a spokesman for Mr Nunes described the changes to the memo as minor, including two edits requested by the FBI and Democrats themselves. Mr Schiff's allegation was, the spokesman added, an ""increasingly strange attempt to thwart publication"". In a rare statement, the agency said it had had ""limited opportunity"" to review the document,externalbefore the committee voted to release it on Monday. ""We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the Fisa process,"" it added. The DoJ has said it would be ""extraordinarily reckless"" to release the memo. Trump officials say the memo proves his allegation that he has been treated unfairly by the FBI. Devin Nunes, who served on the Trump team during his White House transition, described the FBI's objections as ""spurious"". After firing FBI director James Comey last year, Mr Trump reportedly asked his temporary replacement, Andrew McCabe, how he had voted in the 2016 presidential election. Mr McCabe resigned last month as Mr Trump accused him of pro-Democratic bias. He had been planning to retire in March. In December, Mr Trump reportedly challenged Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mr Mueller, over his loyalties.He wanted to know whether Mr Rosenstein was ""on my team"", CNN reports.,external Mr Schiff suggested the White House would use the memo, if released, to fire Mr Mueller or Mr Rosenstein. ""This is not about the facts,"" he said. ""This is about a narrative the chairman [Mr Nunes] wants to put out - a misleading narrative, to undermine the FBI, undermine the [justice] department and ultimately undermine Bob Mueller."" However, Mr Nunes said it was clear that top officials had used ""unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign"". ""Once the truth gets out, we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again,"" he added.

May to fight post-Brexit residency moveThe PM says EU nationals arriving after the UK's exit should not automatically expect full rights.22m23 minutes agoUK Politics,"The prime minister said those arriving after Brexit would have a different set of expectations Theresa May has indicated she will fight a proposal to give residency rights to EU citizens during the transition period after Brexit. She said there had to be a difference between those arriving after the UK leaves and those who came before. She also sought to reassure Tory MPs worried about the length of transition. The European Parliament's Brexit lead, Guy Verhofstadt, responded by tweeting:  ""Citizens' rights during the transition are not negotiable."" He said that ""for the transition to work"" there could not be ""two sets of rights for EU citizens"". A guide: What is the Brexit 'transition' phase? End obsession with Europe, Fox urges Pienaar: Are the Conservatives unleadable on Brexit? And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he opposed the PM's move, which he said would make it ""harder for all of us"" if it made it harder for EU nationals to come and work in the NHS. Asked whether he believed he thought Mrs May had bowed to pressure from Brexiteers, the UK opposition leader said: ""I think Theresa May is probably looking behind herself all the time. ""What she needs to be concentrating on is protecting jobs and ensuring we have good, tariff-free relations with Europe in the future."" The transition period - also referred to as an implementation period - is seen as a way to minimise disruption when the UK leaves the EU for things like business, holidaymakers and security. Earlier this week, the EU set out what it was prepared to offer the UK, saying it expected the transition to last from the day of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020. Some Brexit-supporting MPs are worried that this period could be extended, but speaking during her trade trip to China, Mrs May insisted such an ""implementation period"" would last about two years. ""We are not talking about something that is going to go on and on... we're leaving the European Union. There is an adjustment period for businesses - and indeed government - for changes that need to be made,"" she said. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Theresa May has been under pressure from pro-Brexit backbenchers to address the question of citizens' rights. They argue that the EU has accepted full citizens' rights would only apply to people who are here before Brexit on 29 March, 2019. But the EU says arrangements during the transition period have to be negotiated separately and wants full rights to extend until December 2020. The PM is saying no - it's an important principle that people who arrive during transition are treated differently. In practice, though, the only difference during transition would be that EU citizens arriving then would have to register that they are here. But government sources say that what rights they have after transition has to be a matter for negotiation. For example, if there's a new system that requires visas or work permits, they may have to apply for one. In December, the two sides agreed a deal setting out the proposed rights of EU citizens in the UK and British expats on the continent after Brexit. It says that all EU nationals who have been in the UK for more than five years will be expected to be granted settled status, giving them indefinite leave to remain with the same access to public services as now. Those who have been resident for a shorter period but who arrive before the Brexit cut-off date, currently expected to be 29 March, 2019, will also be able to stay and get settled status once they have been in the UK for five years. At the time, Downing Street said it envisaged anyone arriving after Brexit being able to continue to live, work and study in the UK during the transition period but that they would need to register, and the future immigration rules would have to be agreed as part of the wider transition negotiations. But the EU has since said it expects existing rules on freedom of movement - including the path to permanent residency - to apply in full until the end of the transition phase, which is currently expected to be 31 December 2020. The EU has said the UK must abide by all its rules and regulations during the transition phase Mrs May, who is on the second day of a three-day trade trip to China, said she would contest the issue of long-term residency rights when transition negotiations begin in earnest next month. ""When we agreed the citizens' rights deal in December we did so on the basis that people who had come to the UK when we were a member of the EU had set up certain expectations,"" she said. ""It was right that we have made an agreement that ensured they could continue their life in the way they had wanted to - now for those who come after March 2019 that will be different because they will be coming to a UK that they know will be outside the EU. ""I'm clear there is a difference between those people who came prior to us leaving and those who will come when they know the UK is no longer a member."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, who is travelling with the prime minister, said Mrs May was showing she was willing to push back against the EU amid discontent on the Conservative benches. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? UK agrees 'first step to China deal' But Mrs May is also under pressure from pro-European Conservative MPs who want to maintain close ties with the EU.

May to fight post-Brexit residency moveThe PM says EU nationals arriving after the UK's exit should not automatically expect full rights.28m29 minutes agoUK Politics,"The prime minister said those arriving after Brexit would have a different set of expectations Theresa May has indicated she will fight a proposal to give residency rights to EU citizens during the transition period after Brexit. She said there had to be a difference between those arriving after the UK leaves and those who came before. She also sought to reassure Tory MPs worried about the length of transition. The European Parliament's Brexit lead, Guy Verhofstadt, responded by tweeting:  ""Citizens' rights during the transition are not negotiable."" He said that ""for the transition to work"" there could not be ""two sets of rights for EU citizens"". A guide: What is the Brexit 'transition' phase? End obsession with Europe, Fox urges Pienaar: Are the Conservatives unleadable on Brexit? And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he opposed the PM's move, which he said would make it ""harder for all of us"" if it made it harder for EU nationals to come and work in the NHS. Asked whether he believed he thought Mrs May had bowed to pressure from Brexiteers, the UK opposition leader said: ""I think Theresa May is probably looking behind herself all the time. ""What she needs to be concentrating on is protecting jobs and ensuring we have good, tariff-free relations with Europe in the future."" The transition period - also referred to as an implementation period - is seen as a way to minimise disruption when the UK leaves the EU for things like business, holidaymakers and security. Earlier this week, the EU set out what it was prepared to offer the UK, saying it expected the transition to last from the day of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020. Some Brexit-supporting MPs are worried that this period could be extended, but speaking during her trade trip to China, Mrs May insisted such an ""implementation period"" would last about two years. ""We are not talking about something that is going to go on and on... we're leaving the European Union. There is an adjustment period for businesses - and indeed government - for changes that need to be made,"" she said. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Theresa May has been under pressure from pro-Brexit backbenchers to address the question of citizens' rights. They argue that the EU has accepted full citizens' rights would only apply to people who are here before Brexit on 29 March, 2019. But the EU says arrangements during the transition period have to be negotiated separately and wants full rights to extend until December 2020. The PM is saying no - it's an important principle that people who arrive during transition are treated differently. In practice, though, the only difference during transition would be that EU citizens arriving then would have to register that they are here. But government sources say that what rights they have after transition has to be a matter for negotiation. For example, if there's a new system that requires visas or work permits, they may have to apply for one. In December, the two sides agreed a deal setting out the proposed rights of EU citizens in the UK and British expats on the continent after Brexit. It says that all EU nationals who have been in the UK for more than five years will be expected to be granted settled status, giving them indefinite leave to remain with the same access to public services as now. Those who have been resident for a shorter period but who arrive before the Brexit cut-off date, currently expected to be 29 March, 2019, will also be able to stay and get settled status once they have been in the UK for five years. At the time, Downing Street said it envisaged anyone arriving after Brexit being able to continue to live, work and study in the UK during the transition period but that they would need to register, and the future immigration rules would have to be agreed as part of the wider transition negotiations. But the EU has since said it expects existing rules on freedom of movement - including the path to permanent residency - to apply in full until the end of the transition phase, which is currently expected to be 31 December 2020. The EU has said the UK must abide by all its rules and regulations during the transition phase Mrs May, who is on the second day of a three-day trade trip to China, said she would contest the issue of long-term residency rights when transition negotiations begin in earnest next month. ""When we agreed the citizens' rights deal in December we did so on the basis that people who had come to the UK when we were a member of the EU had set up certain expectations,"" she said. ""It was right that we have made an agreement that ensured they could continue their life in the way they had wanted to - now for those who come after March 2019 that will be different because they will be coming to a UK that they know will be outside the EU. ""I'm clear there is a difference between those people who came prior to us leaving and those who will come when they know the UK is no longer a member."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, who is travelling with the prime minister, said Mrs May was showing she was willing to push back against the EU amid discontent on the Conservative benches. Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? UK agrees 'first step to China deal' But Mrs May is also under pressure from pro-European Conservative MPs who want to maintain close ties with the EU.

Interserve shares slide amid Capita woes,"Interserve is building the Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre at Stanford Hall in the East Midlands Shares in outsourcing firm Interserve tumbled on Thursday in the wake of Capita's profit warning that wiped more than Â£1bn off its market value. Interserve slid almost 20%, Mitie fell 6.9% and Serco lost 3.4% as investors fretted about the state of the wider outsourcing sector. The fall for Interserve followeda profit warning in Octoberthat sent its shares tumbling by nearly 30%. After almost halving on Wednesday, Capita shed a further 13% on Thursday. Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden told MPs on Thursday that Capita was not ""in a comparable position"" to Carillion, which collapsed last month. He confirmed that government officials met Capita bosses after its profit warning. On Wednesday Capita warnedthat its profits for 2018 would be about a third lower than expected, prompting it to axe dividend payments to shareholders and raise Â£700m by issuing new shares. Despite some important differences, Interserve is the company that bears the closest resemblance to the liquidated Carillion. While Carillion had a number of major projects that went sour, Interserve's problems stem primarily from one line of business - its energy-from-waste business, from which it is extricating itself. The UK government says it is monitoring Interserve and in a recent statement declared ""it doesn't believe any of its key suppliers are in a similar position to Carillion"". Interserve is a much smaller business than Carillion, but if you were looking for a mini-me this looks like a chip off the old block. The company announces full-year results at the end of March. It will feel like a long wait for shareholders - and chief executive Debbie White, who will have to reassure and convince the banks to stick with Interserve before she can reassure the markets. Read more from Simon here. Capita operates the London congestion charge, runs the government's Jobseeker's Allowance helpline and administers the teachers' pension scheme. It also collects the TV licence fee on behalf of the BBC. Answering an urgent question from Business Select Committee chair Rachel Reeves on whether Capita posed a risk to public services and finances, Mr Dowden said it was ""in a very different situation"" to that of Carillion. ""We continue to work closely with the company to monitor the execution of its plan, and of course to ensure the continued delivery of public services,"" he said. ""We regularly monitor the financial stability of all our strategic suppliers including Capita and we do not believe that they are in a comparable position to Carillion. ""The measures that Capita has announced are designed to strengthen its balance sheet, reduce its pension deficit and to invest in core elements of its business. Arguably these are the measures that could have prevented Carillion from getting into the difficulties that they did."" Carillion, the construction and services company, collapsed in January after it was unable to secure financial support to continue trading. However, Ms Reeves described the government's thinking on the differences between Capita and Carillion as ""muddled and complacent"". The Labour MP said: ""Both Capita and Carillion have debts of more than Â£1bn and pensions deficits in the hundreds of millions. Both Capita and Carillion paid out dividends of more than Â£1bn in the last five years. ""Both Capita and Carillion rely on the public purse for half of their contracts.

May hails 'first step' to China trade deal,"Theresa May has agreed a joint trade and investment review with China as the first step towards an ""ambitious"" post-Brexit deal, Downing Street said. The prime minister said ""we will be free to strike our own trade deals"" after leaving the EU, following talks with China's President Xi Jinping. Mr Xi said China's markets would be further opened to the UK, including in beef, dairy and other food products. Mrs May said Â£9bn in business deals would be signed on her three-day trip. There was no specific discussion of a particular model for a trade deal between the two countries after Brexit during the two leaders' 80 minute meeting, Downing Street said. But the point of the review agreed by the two countries was to look at what model could work best, a spokesman said. Mrs May and Mr Xi also discussed their shared determination to end illegal nuclear activity by North Korea and agreed that denuclearisation was the objective, Downing Street said. May to fight post-Brexit residency move I'm not a quitter, says Theresa May as China visit begins China thrilled over 'Auntie May' visit In the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong, they restated their commitment to the ""One Country, Two Systems"" arrangement in place since the former colony was handed back by the UK to China in 1997. Stressing that he was looking forward to building on the success of the UK-China relationship, Mr Xi quoted Shakespeare, saying: ""What's past is prologue."" Mrs May ""pointed to the joint trade and investment review which will now take place as the first step towards delivering ambitious future trade arrangements"", Downing Street said. The two leaders also agreed to hold more talks on China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative at their meeting, which was also attended by the UK's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Mrs May and Mr Xi agreed the importance of having frank conversations in areas where the two countries do not see eye-to-eye, Downing Street said in a statement. Talks between the two leaders were followed by a traditional Chinese tea ceremony for Mrs May and husband Philip, hosted by President Xi and China's First Lady Madame Peng and a dinner at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. The UK prime minister is in China at the head of a 50-strong business delegation. Theresa May outside the British Embassy in Beijing Mrs May is understood to have raised environmental issues with Mr Xi - and she presented him with a box-set of the BBC's Blue Planet II series, with a personal message from presenter Sir David Attenborough. The show examined the effect of human behaviour on the environment and was referenced by Mrs May last month when she pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042as part of a 25-year green strategy. On the first day of her trip the prime minister announced a UK-China effort to strengthen international action against the illegal trade in ivory. UK-China trade is currently worth a Â£59bn a year. One of the UK companies travelling with the PM, health-tech firm Medopad, has said it signed more than Â£100m of commercial projects and partnerships with organisations including China Resources, GSK China, Peking University and Lenovo. By Laura Kuenssberg, political editor International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is in China and wants his restive colleagues at home to focus on the big picture. Listing the number of deals that have been done already this week during the prime minister's visit he told me that building levels of trade with China is a real ""success story"". No 10 is confident that by the end of this marathon trip well over Â£9bn of new contracts will have been secured - such a high profile political investment edging deals over the line.

Poland Holocaust complicity bill passed,"Poland has long objected to phrases which suggest shared responsibility for Nazi Germany's actions Poland's Senate has approved a controversial bill making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation or state of complicity in the Nazi Holocaust. The bill, which sets fines or a maximum three-year jail term as punishment, must be signed off by the president before becoming law. President Andrzej Duda says Poland has the right ""to defend historical truth"". But it has outraged Israeli MPs, who are now seeking to strengthen their own Holocaust denial laws. It says that ""whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reich â¦ shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years"". But it adds the caveat that a person ""is not committing a crime if he or she commits such an act as part of artistic or scientific activities"". It passed in a late-night sitting of the upper house of the Polish parliament with 57 votes to 23, with two abstaining. The country has long objected to the use of phrases like ""Polish death camps"", which suggest the Polish state in some way shared responsibility for camps such as Auschwitz. The camps were built and operated by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland in 1939. But the more contentious point raised by the bill is whether it will outlaw references to acts of individual complicity by Poles with the Nazis - something historians say there is clear evidence for. The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love Convicted Auschwitz guard pleads for mercy Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The Israelis are furious about the bill, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as an attempt to rewrite history and deny the Holocaust. There was particular anger as it came just a few days afterthe Polish president promised to engage in dialogue with Israel about the bill amid the outcry. Deputies from across Israel's often fractious political spectrum have united to denounce it. Opposition MP Tzipi Livni of the Zionist Union party - normally a staunch critic of Mr Netanyahu - said: ""They have spat in Israel's face twice, firstly as the state of the Jewish people that is trying to prevent a second Holocaust, and secondly in the face of an Israeli prime minister who had reached an agreement with his Polish counterpart, and had it ignored."" Centrist MP Yair Lapin was also defiant, tweeting that the law could not change history. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Following the passage of the law, Israel's Foreign Ministry asked to postpone the visit of a senior Polish official. Pavel Solosh, the head of the Polish National Security Council, will not arrive in Israel on Sunday as was planned. Now, Israeli MPs are backing a bill that would expand Israel's existing Holocaust denial laws to include a five-year jail sentence for anyone denying or minimising the role of Nazi collaborators, including Poles, in crimes committed in the Holocaust. The amended law would also give legal aid to any Holocaust survivor telling their story who is prosecuted in a foreign country. The US state department had also urged the Polish government to rethink,externalthe bill. Polish politicians have expressed bafflement at the Israeli response. ""We are very sad and surprised our fight for the truth, for the dignity of Poles, is perceived and interpreted in this way,"" said Senate speaker Stanislaw Karczewski. Deputy Justice Minister Marcin Warchol said it was wrong to suggest the bill would stop people researching Polish history. ""Poland is a democratic state of law which respects the freedom of public debate, scientific research, and the right to criticism,"" he said. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland was committed to combating lies about the Holocaust. ""The camps where millions of Jews were murdered were not Polish. This truth needs to be protected,"" he said. Poland is governed by a nationalist party, Law and Justice (PiS), which is keen to show the world how Poland was ruthlessly victimised by its German and Soviet neighbours in the war. Media reaction to the law has been much more ambivalent. ""Instead of settling the crisis, we have made it even worse,"" said a columnist in the conservative daily Rzeczpospolita. About 100 Polish artists, politicians and journalists have signed an open letter calling for the repeal of the bill, saying it goes too far in trying to make Poland ""the only blameless nation in Europe"". by Adam Easton, Warsaw correspondent ""Polish death camps"" is a depressingly frequent term in the international media, often as a kind of journalistic shorthand. Even President Obama used it in 2012 during a speech honouring a Polish war hero, Jan Karski. Many Poles believe that the user thinks that Poles created and ran the camps. Of course that's not true. Poland's right-wing government, while acknowledging that some Poles blackmailed Jews in hiding to enrich themselves, is keen to promote the history of Poland as a victim, of not just the Nazis, but also the Soviets. The government is rightly proud that more Poles are honoured in Israel for saving Jews during the war than citizens of any other nation in occupied Europe. But Polish-Jewish relations during the war were complex - they were neither black nor white. Historians say individual Poles denounced their Jewish neighbours to the Germans and also took part in their murder. Critics say this bill may act as a muzzle on people trying to uncover the full complexity of the Holocaust. Poland was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany. Millions of its citizens were killed, including three million Polish Jews in the Holocaust. Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust overall. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he strongly opposed the bill More Poles have been honoured by Israel for saving the lives of Jews during the war than any other nation. However, historians say others were complicit by acts such as informing on Jews in hiding for rewards, and participating in Nazi-instigated massacres including in Jedwabne where hundreds of Jews were murdered by their neighbours. A historian and well-known ""Nazi-hunter"" at the Simon Wiesenthal Center,Efraim Zuroff, says the number of collaborators runs into ""many thousands"",external. ""The Polish state was not complicit in the Holocaust, but many Poles were,"" Mr Zuroff told the Times of Israel.

What led Finsbury Park attacker to kill?,"Darren Osborne has been convicted of the murder of 51-year-old Makram Aliby driving a van into a crowd outside a Finsbury Park mosque. But why did Osborne do it? What was his motivation? There is no easy answer because, quite simply, it is very hard to pin down the routes of radicalisation. All the evidence shows each person who turns to violence for an ideological reason has their own reasons - but they typically fit into a list of 22 ""vulnerabilities"". These have been developed by offending experts (and hotly debated by critics) in recent years. What's clear from Osborne's case is that his personal trajectory towards terrorism covers quite a lot of these vulnerabilities. This video can not be played CCTV shows the moments before a van hit a crowd near Finsbury Park mosque The most important factor in his story could be his mental state in the months before the attack and his apparent feelings of being at a crossroads. Osborne's partner said that, in hindsight, he was a ""ticking time bomb"". He had a history of alcoholism and hadn't worked properly for years. His partner told police that he had increasingly become something of a loner and suffered anxiety. He had been prescribed anti-depressants and had been referred to Cardiff's NHS specialist centre which organises treatment for drug and alcohol misuse. In the weeks before the attack in June, Osborne threatened twice to kill himself, saying that he felt worthless. Mental health problems are increasingly being recognised by counter-terrorism experts as key factors in radicalisation. Last November, pilot schemes linking the NHS and police to treat potential suspects with such problems were expanded nationally. CCTV from a van hire firm near Cardiff was played in court Osborne began to exhibit other known warning signs: he developed an irrational grievance and sense of injustice that drove him to take matters into his own hands. It appears to have begun when Osbornebecame fixated on Three Girls, a three-part BBC drama about the Rochdale abuse scandalin which most of the victims were white and most of the perpetrators were Pakistani-heritage men. His partner told police how he had become ""obsessed"" with the drama which aired the month before the attack. Commander Dean Haydon, the head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, says that this drama was the ""catalyst"". Osborne began accusing Muslims of being rapists or paedophiles - and the couple argued as he had never previously been openly racist or hostile to Muslims. This video can not be played Jurors were shown footage which allegedly shows Darren Osborne writing at a pub table two days before the attack These arguments appear to fit one of the most important warning signs of a potential terrorist: he developed a ""them and us"" view of the world. He joined Twitter and hunted for anything to justify what he was now thinking. And this, says Commander Haydon, was the second crucial stage in Osborne's journey. ""He accessed this material and was using it to self-radicalise,"" said Commander Haydon. ""Online played a major role in what happened. We have legislation in place that deals with [terrorist] propaganda. But some of the material that's online is unpleasant but does not cross the boundary into crime."" And it's that legal material that's in question in this case. The killer looked at content from the far-right group, Britain First, but appeared more attracted to Tommy Robinson who had previously founded and headed the English Defence League. Mr Robinson is now an alt-right commentator who describes himself as a journalist and Osborne subscribed to his group email list. On 22 May, Osborne received one of the emails that warned of an Islamic ""nation within a nation"" forming in the UK. Osborne left a rambling letter in his van. He specifically referred to the 2017 attacks in London and Manchester, the grooming and abuse scandals and personalities who had been criticised by Mr Robinson. He appeared to refer to a deeply controversial Iran-backed march in London, which had been his original target, again a topic that had exercised Mr Robinson. Two days before Osborne's attack, Mr Robinson tweeted a newspaper headline referring to whether people should ""look back in anger"" over the Manchester bombing. Osborne signed off his note with a sarcastic: ""Don't look back in anger, God Save the Queen."" Osborne used a hired van to carry out the attack outside the London mosque The BBC asked Mr Robinson whether his words had inflamed tensions and contributed to Osborne's state of mind. He said that he had never heard of the killer and there had been no direct contact with him. ""This is a complete stitch [up] from the state,"" he said, referring to his name coming up in the prosecution's case. In just a few weeks, Osborne went from a troubled, angry and unpredictably violent alcoholic to a killer who was fixated on the idea that Muslims in Britain were some kind of threat to the nation. But the speed of that transformation is not unusual. In August 2014, Brusthom Ziamani was arrestedcarrying a hammer, knife and Islamic flag: he wanted to mimic the Woolwich killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He had only recently become a follower of the now-jailed preacher Anjem Choudary - and the evidence suggested his further shift into violent extremism was very rapid. In other words, it's very difficult to spot the lone would-be attackers, whatever their motivation.

Guide: What is Brexit transition?,"There is lots of talk about a Brexit ""transition"" period at the moment. Here's what you need to know: It's what is expected to happen straight after the UK officially leaves the European Union on 29 March, 2019. The plan is for a time-limited period (of approximately two years) before the eventual permanent arrangements for UK-EU relations  - which have yet to be agreed - kick in. Theresa May has said the transition period, which the UK side tends to refer to as an ""implementation phase"", will allow businesses time to prepare for the new arrangements, and avoid disrupting holiday-makers and things like international security measures. However, the two sides have different ideas about what it should look like. We don't exactly know yet, because this is what is about to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. But we do know what the two sides want. The EU, whichpublished its demands,externalearlier this week, says the transition should not extend beyond 31 December 2020, 21 months after Brexit day. It wants the UK to continue to follow its rules during this time - but not be involved in making decisions. The UK says businesses should not have to adapt twice to new rules and regulations - suggesting it agrees on a largely ""status quo"" arrangement. It has said free movement of people, goods and money can continue, and that it will still be subject to European Court of Justice rulings. The two sides will negotiate on what the transition period will look like But Brexit Secretary David Davis also wants a ""right to object"" to new EU laws it doesn't agree with, and has predicted an ""argument"" with the other side about this. Another potential sticking point comes on citizens' rights - in particular EU nationals who move to the UK during the transition period. Do they get treated the same as if they had arrived while the UK was in the EU? The EU says yes, the UK no. The UK also wants to be able to strike trade deals with other countries - which it cannot do as an EU member - although these cannot come into force until the transition ends. The EU has not objected to this. May to fight EU transition residency plan That is what some Brexiteers are worried about. They say that if the UK continues to follow EU rules and regulations it will have left ""in name only"". Prominent Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg fears the UK will become a ""vassal state"" of the EU - subject to its rules without any say over how they are made. This is one of the reasons the prime minister has come under pressure in recent weeks. Mrs May tried to address this during her trip to China, telling reporters: ""We are not talking about something that is going to go on and on... we're leaving the European Union. ""There is an adjustment period for businesses - and indeed government - for changes that need to be made."" Why is there talk about threats to Theresa May's job? That's when the UK will adopt its new relationship with the European Union. Given the talk of a ""business as usual"" transition period, this could be when Brexit begins to feel like Brexit. But we don't yet know what this will feel like - because the UK and the EU have not started discussing their ""future partnership"" yet. That will happen once the transition negotiations have been completed.

Kuenssberg: Fox warns Tories,"International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is in China and wants his restive colleagues at home to focus on the big picture. Listing the number of deals that have been done already this weekduring the prime minister's visit he told me that building levels of trade with China is a real ""success story"". No 10 is confident that by the end of this marathon trip well over Â£9bn of new contracts will have been secured - such a high profile political investment edging deals over the line. Mr Fox accepts it will take some to get trade deals done in the longer term. The UK will be limited not just before Brexit, but also during the transition period, in how much can get done. But for him this is a vital time, working to dismantle existing barriers to doing business and preparing for bigger deals, whether ""gold standard"", or not, that can be concluded over time. And while to some ears, it might sound ironic for a senior Tory politician to be making such a request, he suggested that Britain needed to get over its obsession with Europe. And as for hisbickering colleagues, they needed to get over their focus on what's happening in Westminster. Dr Fox told me: ""I sometimes wish that first of all people could see the prime minister the way that she's seen in other countries in terms of the vision that she's put forward for Britain. ""Secondly I wish they could see Britain in the way that the rest of the world sees us and not the some of the internal commentators in the UK."" Many Tory MPs would agree with Dr Fox that focusing on internal manoeuvres hinders the Tory cause. But it is almost impossible for a politician to create completely different personas at home and abroad. That's not withstanding the Chinese state TV reporting that theprime minister is supposedly becoming affectionately known as Auntie May. Whether it's Beijing, Brussels or back home, it's hard for Theresa May to hide from the doubts.

Mosque attack suspect's views 'not on trial'The judge says jurors must decide if the defendant was driving the van that hit people in Finsbury Park.1m2 minutes agoUK,"Darren Osborne is accused of murder and attempted murder The judge in the trial of a man accused of driving a van into a group of people outside a London mosque has told the jury he is not on trial for his views. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb was summing up evidence heard during the first eight days of the trial of Darren Osborne. Prosecutors said Mr Osborne had become ""obsessed"" with Muslims and had intended to kill as many as possible. He denies murder and attempted murder, saying a friend called Dave was driving when people in Finsbury Park were hit. Makram Ali, 51, from Haringey, was killed after leaving a prayer meeting at Muslim Welfare House in June and nine other people were injured. Mr Osborne said he hired the van to kill Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on a march he was due to attend. The 48-year-old, from Cardiff, told the court he was alone in the van as he drove towards the march - but that ""road blocks"" in central London had ""thwarted their plans"". Closing the defence, Lisa Wilding QC said Mr Osborne accepted many of the arguments made by the prosecution, as well as the views he holds, but she said that did not make him guilty of the charges. She said: ""You may describe his views as abhorrent, but why would a man so intent on killingâ¦ to proclaim his cause and give his views, why would he deny doing the very thing he set out to do if, in fact, he did do it?"" Ms Wilding said his plan was over after he could not get to the march and there was no ""plan B"". She added: ""You may think that Darren Osborne doesn't know his own mind, so how can you?"" Speaking to the jury after both the prosecution and defence had made their closing arguments, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said the defendant was not on trial for his views, but for whether they had led him to commit the offence he was charged with. She said: ""Every ordinary decent person hates child abuse and acts of terror. That sort of feeling is very different from hatred to those who follow a religion because a small proportion of them commit terror. ""There is no defence of being in the grip of moral justification or outrage."" But the judge added: ""His defence is he was not the driver, if you are not sure he was, he must be acquitted."" The jury has now been sent out to consider their verdict. Mr Osborne denies the murder of Mr Ali and the attempted murder of ""persons at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Whadcoat Street, London"".

Extremists trying to 'pervert education',"Religious extremists are using schools to narrow children's horizons and ""pervert education"", England's chief inspector of schools has warned. Amanda Spielman said some community leaders see schools as vehicles to ""indoctrinate impressionable minds""  - with extremist ideology in some cases. Ofsted inspectors are increasingly coming into contact with such extremists, she said. She is asking head teachers to confront those who foster extremist behaviour. It comes after an east London head teacher who tried to stop girls under the age of eight from wearing a hijab in the classroom was subjected to a campaign of abuse. ""Rather than adopting a passive liberalism that says anything goes, for fear of causing offence, schools leaders should be promoting a muscular liberalism,"" Ms Spielman has said at a conference held by the Church of England in London. Should there be more Muslim state schools? How the Islamic veil has divided opinion across Europe ""That sort of liberalism holds no truck for ideologies that seek to close minds or narrow opportunity. ""Occasionally that will mean taking uncomfortable decisions or having tough conversations. ""It means not assuming that the most conservative voices in a particular faith speak for everyone."" She added: ""Ofsted inspectors are increasingly brought into contact with those who want to actively pervert the purpose of education. ""Under the pretext of religious belief, they use education institutions, legal and illegal, to narrow young people's horizons, to isolate and segregate, and in the worst cases to indoctrinate impressionable minds with extremist ideology. ""Freedom of belief in the private sphere is paramount, but in our schools it is our responsibility to tackle those who actively undermine fundamental British values or equalities law."" Ms Spielman has previously criticised practices in supplementary schools and some private faith schools. She was understood to be making the speech in support of head teacher Neena Lall, of St Stephen's state primary in east London, who tried to prevent children under the age of eight from wearing the hijab in class. Generally speaking, Muslim girls, although not all of them, wear the hijab after the age of 10. Ms Lall also tried to stop younger pupils from taking part in Ramadan fasting during school hours. This prompted a backlash from some members of the local community and parents, although many parents voiced support for the move. Ms Spielman said: ""School leaders must have the right to set school uniform policies in a way that they see fit, in order to promote cohesion. ""It is a matter of deep regret that this outstanding school has been subject to a campaign of abuse by some elements within the community. ""I want to be absolutely clear - Ofsted will always back heads who take tough decisions in the interests of their pupils."" Ofsted said Ms Spielman was not targeting the Islamic faith, but all forms of fundamentalism. Dr Zubaida Haque, of the Runnymede Trust, told BBC News head teachers' attempts to ban the wearing of hijabs or other religious items in schools could contradict British values Ofsted was trying to promote, including mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. She said that in most cases young girls wore the hijab because they wanted to be like their mothers. It was not an issue of safeguarding and there had been no consultation with Muslim communities, she added. A Department for Education official said: ""Extremism has no place in our society - that's why we changed the law and the requirements on schools so that they have to actively promote the 'fundamental British values' of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and the mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. ""If there are any allegations of schools promoting ideologies or discrimination in the classroom, we will not hesitate to take action."" Shaista Gohir, who chairs Muslim Women's Network UK, said: ""The rising phenomenon of primary-school-aged girls wearing the hijab is certainly not an issue to trivialise. ""In continuing to defend this practice, what messages are being sent to these girls about their hair and body? ""Are we telling them they are little temptresses if they don't cover up?"" By wading into the thorny area of who should and should not wear a hijab, the Ofsted chief inspector may have inadvertently opened an old wound Secular organisations, and in particular schools across Europe, have long grappled with this item of Muslim dress. The veil is unique in that it is viewed as a symbol of multi-culturalism, sexism, coercion, women's liberation and community division all at once. The focus here may be on young children's approach to this special piece of cloth. And the majority of Muslim girls do not adopt the hijab before the age of 10. But is it the role of a head teacher to dictate who should and who should not be allowed to wear such an item? Even if they are in charge of uniform policies. By calling on head teachers to exercise a ""muscular liberalism"" in the face of ultra-conservative forces, she may yet stir up more opposition than she anticipated.

Teenager challenges 100-calorie snack ad,"This video can not be played Tallulah Self, 18, was in hospital with anorexia ""The 100-calorie snack benchmark assumes that all children's needs are the same,"" says Tallulah Self, 18, who has a history of anorexia nervosa. ""It's like saying all cars need the same fuel - and the same amount."" Tallulah is critical of a campaign launched by Public Health England (PHE) in the new year, urging parents to limit children's snacks to 100 calories - and to let them have only two a day. The campaign is aimed at tackling the growing problem of childhood obesity. But for Tallulah - who spent six months in hospital in 2016 with anorexia - the Change4Life ""Look for 100 calorie snacks,external"" adverts touched a raw nerve. ""As someone with experience of an eating disorder, I was angered by the misleading and potentially harmful message, promoting restriction and calorie-counting. ""I messaged a couple of my friends saying, 'Would it be crazy to make a video about this?' and I gave myself four days to make a film."" 'Limit children's snacks to 100 calories' How much sugar is hidden in your food? Tallulah, who has a BTec in media production, recently got a job in London as a film-maker, having decided not to apply to university currently because of her illness. She decided to use her skills to make aYouTube video,external, compiling the views of young people who have had eating disorders, parents and bloggers and vloggers. The contributors express their concern that the Change4Life campaign could be seen to promote a mindset of dieting and calorie-counting. Tallulah adds: ""The diet culture is unavoidable in the media, but this campaign seems to reflect this diet culture and almost puts it on to the future generation, which I don't think is what we should be teaching them or reinforcing in society."" ""Of course obesity is an issue,"" says Tallulah. ""I totally support what Change4Life are doing, I just think they're going about it in a potentially harmful and misleading way. ""Obesity is an issue and needs addressing, but so are eating disorders. ""Yes, maybe a higher proportion of kids have obesity rather than eating disorders, but in terms of what we're teaching children it shouldn't be focused on calorie-counting. ""Teaching them that that's normal is not healthy or sustainable and to those pre-disposed to or with eating disorders, of course it's harmful."" PHE figures show that 34% of children aged 10 and 11 in England are overweight and obese, while 1.3% are underweight. Almost two-thirds of adults (61%) are overweight or obese and 2% are underweight. Tallulah says calorie-counting shouldn't be normalised PHE hopes its campaign will empower parents to make healthier snacking choices for their children, as childhood obesity continues to be a problem. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, says: ""There's no doubt people coping with the difficulty of an eating disorder require additional support. ""But with more than a third of children leaving primary school overweight or obese, Change4Life was developed to help tackle the childhood obesity crisis gripping our nation. ""This particular campaign responds directly to parents' concerns about unhealthy snacks and provides tips to help them choose healthier options."" You're losing everything - but you don't understand why 'Emotional support peacock' barred from United Airlines plane Skywatchers see 'super blue blood Moon' Tallulah hopes her video will make policymakers think twice about the messages they send out. ""I hope the film creates an impact - ultimately reaching PHE,"" she says. ""Hopefully they will reconsider the campaign and future campaigns, in the messages they are sending out, how they can be misinterpreted or harmful and how they can affect wider audiences."" She also hopes that by speaking out about her own struggle, she can help others talk about mental health issues. ""I hope that I can turn my personal battle into something positive by inspiring others, showing them they aren't alone and also using film and my creativity to challenge stigmas and create conversation. ""As daunting as it is speaking out so publicly - when I've held it very close to me and privately for so long - I hope to show others that it's OK to talk and encourage others to speak out too, as we shouldn't be embarrassed or ashamed by mental health issues.""

Treating boy's mystery illness 'futile',"Alfie Evans suffers from a progressive neurological degenerative condition The father of a seriously ill 20-month-old boy broke down in tears as a court was told further hospital treatment would be ""futile"". Tom Evans and Kate James, both 20 and from Bootle, want to take their son Alfie abroad for treatment. The hearing to decide if life support should be withdrawn from Alfie, who has a mystery illness, was stopped briefly while Mr Evans was comforted by family. UK doctors said continuing treatment was unkind, the court heard. Alfie is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" and has a degenerative neurological condition that has not been precisely diagnosed. Mr Justice Hayden, who told the court he himself had had the ""privilege"" of visiting Alfie in hospital, said: ""Everybody in this court shares the same objectives, everybody wants the best for Alfie."" Alfie's parents believe he responds to them, and his father told reporters outside court he was ""improving healthwise"". But the High Court, sitting in Liverpool, heard any movements by the child are spontaneous seizures as a result of touching.

Sick boy's treatment 'inhumane',"Alfie Evans suffers from a progressive neurological degenerative condition The father of a seriously ill 20-month-old boy broke down in tears as a court was told further hospital treatment would be ""futile"". Tom Evans and Kate James, both 20 and from Bootle, want to take their son Alfie abroad for treatment. The hearing to decide if life support should be withdrawn from Alfie, who has a mystery illness, was stopped briefly while Mr Evans was comforted by family. UK doctors said continuing treatment was unkind, the court heard. Alfie is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" and has a degenerative neurological condition that has not been precisely diagnosed. Mr Justice Hayden, who told the court he himself had had the ""privilege"" of visiting Alfie in hospital, said: ""Everybody in this court shares the same objectives, everybody wants the best for Alfie."" Alfie's parents believe he responds to them, and his father told reporters outside court he was ""improving healthwise"". But the High Court, sitting in Liverpool, heard any movements by the child are spontaneous seizures as a result of touching. Michael Mylonas QC, representing the hospital, said: ""One of the problems of this case is they look at him and, barring the paraphernalia of breathing and feeding, he's a sweet, lovely, normal-looking boy who opens his eyes, [and] will smile...""

Fox: End obsession with Europe,"Liam Fox has called for an end to the ""obsession with Europe"" in economic matters, saying the focus should be on ""growing markets"" around the world. The international trade secretary said because the proportion of the UK's exports that go to the EU was falling, ""we've got to be focussing on the growing bits of the global economy"". He was speaking to the BBC during a visit to China alongside Theresa May. Mr Fox also defended Mrs May from the recent criticism she has faced. The prime minister has come under pressure from Eurosceptics worried about concessions in the Brexit talks, while other MPs have called for more direction on domestic policies. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Fox praised the prime minister's ""vision"" and said he wished people saw her the way she was perceived around the world, rather than by ""internal tea room discussions in the UK"". Kuenssberg: Fox's message for the UK UK exports and imports in charts May to fight EU residence plan As International Trade Secretary, Mr Fox is responsible for striking international trade deals that will come into force when the UK leaves the EU. He said the UK would be able to ""roll over"" 40 existing trade deals it is part of as an EU member, as well as reaching its own arrangements with the likes of the United States, India and China. China, Mr Fox said, was a ""real success story"" for the UK, with exports rising by 25% in the past year. ""All of this adds up to a much improved trading performance,"" he said. And while the UK wants an ""open and liberal partnership"" with the EU, he added: ""We've got to get away from our obsession with Europe in terms of its relation to the global economy - according to the IMF - in fact according to the European Commission - 90% of global growth in the next 10 to 15 years will be outside the European continent, clearly that's where we have to focus our attention.""

EU sets out transition demands,"Chief negotiator Michel Barnier set out the EU's negotiating stance for the transition period The European Union has set out its demands for the temporary transition period after the UK leaves in March 2019. The EU wants the UK to continue to follow its rules but not be involved in making decisions. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK wanted a ""right to object"" to new laws passed by the EU during this time. Downing Street said there would ""naturally"" be differences between the sides ahead of negotiations. Reality Check: What's the EU's transition stance? Brexit bill flawed, peers say The UK hopes the two sides can reach agreement by March. The transition period - also referred to as an implementation period - is seen as a way to minimise disruption when the UK leaves the EU for things like business, holidaymakers and security. It will also allow more time to finalise the terms of the UK's post-Brexit relations with the EU. In their guidelines, the EU say: Transition should run from Brexit in March 2019 to 31 December 2020 All EU rules and regulations - as well as EU rule changes adopted after March 2019 - should apply in the UK during the transition phase There can be no ""cherry picking"" on the single market - so free movement into the UK should continue The UK will not be involved in the decision-making of EU bodies It cannot implement its own international agreements unless the EU agrees Work should continue on finding a solution to the Northern Ireland border question, one of the main sticking points in the first round of negotiations Speaking at a press conference after EU ministers agreed the negotiating guidelines, chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK would be allowed to attend decision-making meetings on a ""limited, exceptional, case  by case basis."" It would be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries but the deals could not come into force until the transition period was over, he added. This is in line with the UK's negotiating stance, as set out by Mr Davis in a speech on Friday. May urged to 'see off' hard Brexiteers Brexit: All you need to know Mr Davis also said existing international agreements - which include trade deals with other countries and agreements on aviation and nuclear power - should continue to apply during the period. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee on Monday, Mr Davis said the UK wanted a ""right to object"" to new laws passed by the EU during the transition phase over which it had no say and disagreed with. ""It's not particularly democratic practice to just have the country accept without any say-so, anything - particularly if... the European Union takes it on itself to do something which is actively disadvantageous to a major British industry or something like that,"" he said. ""So that's why we've raised the matter, and let's see how it goes."" Asked what legal status this would have, he said he wanted such a safeguard included in the withdrawal agreement. It's the sort of amazing coincidence that the Brexit process throws up all the time. Minutes after the Brexit Secretary David Davis laid out his concerns about the EU's transition proposals to a House of Lords Committee, Michel Barnier held a press conference where he knocked them down. For example, David Davis wants a mechanism where the UK has a say on new European laws that might affect Britain while it's not in the club but still subject to the rules. The best Mr Barnier was prepared to offer was consultation ""on an exceptional, case-by-case basis agreed by the 27 remaining member states"". And don't dare call it anything as grand as ""observer status"", he warned. He dismissed the Brexit secretary's demands that Britain be allowed to negotiate trade deals with other countries during the transition period. Of course they can, Mr Barnier said. In fact, Britain had better get a move on if it wants to replicate the 750 international agreements that come with EU membership. True, this is the start of a negotiation but it is not clear that the EU sees anything to negotiate. Mr Barnier feels that he has already made the UK a generous offer that's in Britain's economic interest. Plus, there was a reminder that the deal on the transition period is linked to a deal on everything else: no agreement on a final Brexit treaty means no transition. Some in the UK are unhappy at the idea that the UK will have to follow the rules of the single market and the customs union, including freedom of movement for EU citizens, but will lose its voting rights. Mrs May's Brexit ''inner circle'' of senior ministers met in sub-committee on Monday morning to discuss how the transitional phase could work, including the UK's demand that it be free to negotiate trade deals with other countries during the period. Earlier a Downing Street spokesman said: ''There is obviously going to be a negotiation on what the implementation period looks like. ''The formal directives will be released this afternoon. This will be a negotiation and there will naturally be some distance in the detail of our starting positions.""

More Brits become millionairesA total of 3.6 million households in Britain held wealth of more than Â£1m by June 2016.1han hour agoBusinessComments,"The number of British households that could consider themselves as millionaires rose by nearly a third in two years, official figures show. A total of 3.6 million households in Britain held wealth of more than Â£1m by June 2016, up 29% in two years, the Office for National Statistics said. Wealth includes pension savings, investments, belongings, and property values less any outstanding mortgage. Campaigners argue that the figures expose wealth inequality. The median wealth per British household, after borrowing is taken into account, was Â£259,400 by July 2016. This was 15% higher compared with two years earlier, theofficial figures,externalshow. The figures do not account for the rising cost of living over that time. The figures show the amount of wealth held by each of Britain's 26 million households as a whole, irrespective of whether there is one or several occupants. While the wealth of those at the top end of the scale has risen, driven by the growth of private pensions and property values, those at the other end have suffered a fall over the same period. The poorest fifth of households, less likely to own a home or a private pension, saw their wealth diminish. For the bottom one in 10 households, that meant a typical fall of Â£3,000 to Â£32,000. Your biggest financial decision - in charts The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Conor D'Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, which lobbies for low-income groups, said: ""Britain is very good at generating wealth, but terrible at spreading it around the country and even worse at taxing it properly. As a result, we have unacceptably high levels of wealth inequality. ""Young people in particular are feeling the effects of Britain's wealth divide. Our large millennial generation own just 2% of the nation's wealth. This stems from their struggle get on the housing ladder, boosting other's people wealth in the private rented sector, rather than build assets of their own."" The data does show that there was little change in the proportion of wealth held by those at the top and those at the bottom over the period covered by the figures. The key factors behind the rise in wealth has been more people seeing their pension pots expand, as well as the rise in property values. There was a 20% rise in private pension wealth by July 2016 compared with two years earlier, to Â£5.3 trillion, primarily the result of workplace final-salary pensions growing in value, or amid pensions already being paid to those who are retired. This total was slightly ahead of the 17% rise in property wealth, which grew to Â£4.6 trillion over the same period. This increase in property wealth was reflected in the regional breakdown of wealth. Median net property wealth in London was Â£351,000 by June 2016 - a third higher than two years earlier. There were signs of Londoners choosing to put money into a deposit for a home, rather than into savings or shares. The amount of financial wealth in London fell the sharpest compared with other areas of Britain. Median household total wealth, which includes everything from cars to cash, was highest in the South East of England at Â£381,000 by June 2016, followed by the South West of England (Â£336,000). The lowest was in the North East of England, with median household wealth of Â£163,000. Your biggest financial decision - in charts Has your pay outperformed inflation?

Fake porn videos deleted from internetThe Gyfcat video clip hosting service says the computer-generated clips are objectionable.11m12 minutes agoTechnology,"Emma Watson is among several actresses who have had their faces merged with pornography as seen in this screenshot Pornographic videos that used new software to replace the original face of an actress with that of a celebrity are being deleted by a service that hosted much of the content. San Francisco-based Gfycat has said it thinks the clips are ""objectionable"". The creation of such videos has become more common after the release of a free tool earlier this month that made the process relatively simple. The developer says FakeApp has been downloaded more than 100,000 times. It works by using a machine-learning algorithm to create a computer-generated version of the subject's face. To do this it requires several hundred photos of the celebrity in question for analysis and a video clip of the person whose features are to be replaced. The results - known as deepfakes - differ in quality. FakeApp's creator says a single button press is required to generate the videos once a computer has been given source material But in some cases, where the two people involved are of a similar build, they can be quite convincing. Some people have used the technology to create non-pornographic content. These include a video in which the face of Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has been replaced with that of US President Donald Trump, and several in whichone movie star's features,externalhave been swapped with those of another.

But the most common use of the tool has apparently been to reversion pornography to feature popular female actresses and singers. Many of these clips have subsequently been shared online and critiqued by others. Many creators uploaded their clips to Gfycat. The service is commonly used to host short videos that are then posted to social website Reddit and elsewhere. Gfycat allows adult content, but began deleting some of the deepfakes earlier this week, a matter that was first reported by the news site Motherboard. ""Our terms of service allow us to remove content that we find objectionable. We are actively removing this content,"" Gfycat said in a brief statement. Photos of the singer Ariana Grande have been used to replace the features of one pornographic actress Reddit has yet to comment on the matter. It still provides access to clips that Gfycat has yet to delete, as well as deepfakes hosted by others. Itscontent policy prohibits,external""involuntary pornography"". Fake Obama created using AI tool But it is not clear whether it would recognise the deepfakes as such. Moreover, it requires the subjectinvolved to make a complaint,external. However, Gfycat is not the only party to have forced some of the material offline. The owner to the rights of some of the explicit content has demanded that clips be blocked on copyright grounds. In addition, the chat service Discord closed down a group dedicated to sharing the clips, saying that they had violated its rules on non-consensual pornography.

3 million homes to get ultrafast broadband,"Openreach, the BT-owned firm that manages the UK's broadband infrastructure, has vowed to introduce ""ultrafast"" internet connections to three million premises by 2020. The company said it was accelerating its plan to run fibre connections directly to homes and businesses. It will increase internet speeds from 24 megabits a second under superfast broadband to 100 megabits. The first phase will begin this year, targeting eight cities across the UK. Openreach, which operates independently from BT, said Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool, London and Manchester would form the first phase of the programme that will connect ""up to 40 UK towns, cities and boroughs"". Too little, too late. That is how BT's many critics will characterise the plan to bring full fibre connections into as many as 10 million homes by 2025. They have always argued that the UK should have opted long ago for a national future-proof fibre-to-the-home network. Instead, BT's approach has been to lay fibre to cabinets on the street and then rely on good old copper cables to take broadband into the home. But that was driven by the government's order to make ""superfast"" broadband - a modest 24 megabits a second - available to 95% premises by the end of 2017. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the successful completion of that target this week. That superfast target had some advantages: it got reasonably good and reasonably cheap broadband to many people in a hurry. In Hull, where the monopoly provider KCom opted instead to go straight to fibre to the home the rollout has been slow and the prices have been high. But with the government switching tack and insisting ""full fibre"" is now the answer, BT has seen the light - though as its statement makes clear the speed of the rollout will depend on an ""acceptable"" return on its investment. Alex Neill of consumer group Which?, said that the UK was far behind other countries in offering high speed internet access through fibre connections directly to homes or businesses. She said: ""When you look that 79% of people in Spain have got access to full fibre and yet only 3% of British homes have, clearly consumers will be asking why that is happening, especially when the majority of them have experienced a problem with their broadband in the last year."" Openreach said it already provided fibre connections 500,000 homes, mostly in rural areas. Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach, said: ""Our focus over the last two years has been to achieve the government's target of getting 95% superfast coverage. ""Now having got to 95% the mandate is twofold: fix the last 5% and move on to the upgrade from superfast to ultrafast speeds."" While the Federation of Small Businesses welcomed investment in ultrafast broadband, its national chairman Mike Cherry said that ""too many small firms across the UK are still coming up against poor coverage and slow speeds"". ""Official Ofcom figures released last month show a shocking 230,000 small businesses are unable to access a decent connection of 10Mbps. In addition, around half a million small firms don't have access to a superfast connection. They cannot be left behind due to poor digital connectivity."" Openreach's Mr Selley said that homes and businesses would be connected using a ""hybrid"" of the existing copper-based network and fibre. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I'm glad that Openreach have begun to make this shift in strategy, away from reliance on copper based systems and in favour of the best modern technology. ""We want to encourage a competitive market to rollout this technology and we will work with Openreach, Virgin, CityFibre, Gigaclear, TalkTalk and the growing number of full fibre broadband providers to build a Britain fit for the future."" Rival CityFibre, which is working with Vodafone to deliver fibre to the premises of five million homes and businesses by 2025, said: ""It is recognised by government and Ofcom that the time has come to reduce the public's dependency on Openreach. It is not in the UK's best interest to encourage further entrenchment of the incumbent monopoly.""

Banned Kenyan TV stations win reprieve,"Raila Odinga declared himself the ""people's president"" in Nairobi on Tuesday Three of Kenya's largest private TV channels remain off the air, despite an order by the country's High Court suspending a shutdown. The government cut off KTN, NTV, and Citizen TV over plans to broadcast opposition leader Raila Odinga's unofficial ""inauguration"" on Tuesday. The court suspended the ban for 14 days while the case is heard. There is no sign the government will comply with the court ruling, the BBC's Gladys Kigo reports from Nairobi. Mr Odinga lost last year's election and his ""swearing-in"" was widely seen as a publicity stunt, but the authorities said it was an act of treason. Opposition groups have accused the Kenyan government of violating the public's right to information about important events. When asked about the matter, Joseph Mucheru, the minister of information, communication and technology, told the BBC it was a security issue and that only the security minister could answer the question of when the stations would be able to broadcast again. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Legitimacy of Kenya re-run unclear Kenya's Odinga holds rival 'inauguration' The High Court also ordered the state not to interfere with the operation of KTN, NTV, and Citizen TV pending a full hearing. The channels were taken off the air on Tuesday morning ahead of the ""swearing-in"", but continue to stream their content online. Kenyan news broadcasters were taken off-air but were live streaming their coverage online The interior ministry said in a statement circulating on social media that broadcasting the event - described as an attempt to ""subvert or overthrow"" the government - ""would have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent Kenyans"". Kenyan journalists denounced the move as outrageous and in a statement called for ""respect of the constitution"" and an end to the ""unprecedented intimidation of journalists"". Some journalists have been camping out in their newsrooms for fear of being arrested. Linus Kaikai, the head of NTV, said: ""We were informed by very reliable sources that policemen were downstairs and what they wanted to do was to arrest us when we leave the building, so we have since that time not left the building."" BBC analysts say KTN, NTV and Citizen TV are perceived to offer relatively independent and balanced news coverage, though they have been criticised by the opposition in the past. In their absence, some Kenyans are turning to newspapers and social media for their news. Others are going to the state-owned KBC and the private K24 TV. The two stations usually attract low viewership due to their pro-government bias. Analysis: Ferdinand Omondi, BBC News Kenyans have been fuming at their inability to watch news and their favourite programmes for three days, and will welcome the court's decision. The affected media companies have suffered losses measured in the millions of dollars. The TV stations depend on advertising, so they could not make money during the period they have been off-air. Human rights activist Okiya Omtatah, who petitioned the court, asked the government to pay for the financial losses that Citizen TV, KTN and NTV have incurred. A Kenyan electronics dealer stands by blank screens that should be playing the three suspended channels An empty studio belonging to the NTV channel The stations command nearly two-thirds of Kenya's TV audience. But the emergence of alternate advertising platforms, including social media, was already hurting their revenue streams. The three companies have been forced to lay off hundreds of workers in the past year to balance their books. The Kenyan government had wanted the stations to remain shut indefinitely as police investigated Tuesday's ceremony. President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term last November after winning an election re-run in October that Mr Odinga boycotted. Mr Kenyatta's initial victory was overturned by the Supreme Court, which cited ""irregularities and illegalities"". The inauguration event in Nairobi's Uhuru park on Tuesday was attended by thousands of Odinga supporters, and passed off peacefully.

May holds talks with Chinese president,"Theresa May has agreed a joint trade and investment review with China as the first step towards an ""ambitious"" post-Brexit deal, Downing Street said. The prime minister said ""we will be free to strike our own trade deals"" after leaving the EU, following talks with China's President Xi Jinping. Mr Xi said China's markets would be further opened to the UK, including in beef, dairy and other food products. Mrs May said Â£9bn in business deals would be signed on her three-day trip. There was no specific discussion of a particular model for a trade deal between the two countries after Brexit during the two leaders' 80 minute meeting, Downing Street said. But the point of the review agreed by the two countries was to look at what model could work best, a spokesman said. Mrs May and Mr Xi also discussed their shared determination to end illegal nuclear activity by North Korea and agreed that denuclearisation was the objective, Downing Street said. May to fight post-Brexit residency move I'm not a quitter, says Theresa May as China visit begins China thrilled over 'Auntie May' visit In the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong, they restated their commitment to the ""One Country, Two Systems"" arrangement in place since the former colony was handed back by the UK to China in 1997. Stressing that he was looking forward to building on the success of the UK-China relationship, Mr Xi quoted Shakespeare, saying: ""What's past is prologue."" Mrs May ""pointed to the joint trade and investment review which will now take place as the first step towards delivering ambitious future trade arrangements"", Downing Street said. The two leaders also agreed to hold more talks on China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative at their meeting, which was also attended by the UK's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Mrs May and Mr Xi agreed the importance of having frank conversations in areas where the two countries do not see eye-to-eye, Downing Street said in a statement. Talks between the two leaders were followed by a traditional Chinese tea ceremony for Mrs May and husband Philip, hosted by President Xi and China's First Lady Madame Peng and a dinner at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. The UK prime minister is in China at the head of a 50-strong business delegation. Theresa May outside the British Embassy in Beijing Mrs May is understood to have raised environmental issues with Mr Xi - and she presented him with a box-set of the BBC's Blue Planet II series, with a personal message from presenter Sir David Attenborough. The show examined the effect of human behaviour on the environment and was referenced by Mrs May last month when she pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042as part of a 25-year green strategy. On the first day of her trip the prime minister announced a UK-China effort to strengthen international action against the illegal trade in ivory. UK-China trade is currently worth a Â£59bn a year. One of the UK companies travelling with the PM, health-tech firm Medopad, has said it signed more than Â£100m of commercial projects and partnerships with organisations including China Resources, GSK China, Peking University and Lenovo. By Laura Kuenssberg, political editor International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is in China and wants his restive colleagues at home to focus on the big picture. Listing the number of deals that have been done already this week during the prime minister's visit he told me that building levels of trade with China is a real ""success story"". No 10 is confident that by the end of this marathon trip well over Â£9bn of new contracts will have been secured - such a high profile political investment edging deals over the line.

Cats and dogs? Weather forecasters consider slang,"It might be ""chucking it down"" in Leeds and Newcastle, but it is ""bucketing"" in the Black Country. That is according to research for the Met Office, as it considers introducing regional terms to weather forecasts. A survey of 2,000 people in January found a variety of slang words were used to describe UK weather. The Met Office said regions tended to interpret the same information differently and using regional slang could help people's understanding. Now it is appealing to the public to help them identify the words used to describe weather in their area and it has launched a #3wordweather on Twitter so words can be submitted.

Derrick Ryall, head of the public weather service at the Met Office, said: ""We're always looking to improve the way weather forecasts are communicated, to make them as useful as possible and increase their understanding. ""Ultimately we hope to use the insights from our research to tap into local dialects and vocabulary to make it easier for people across the UK to understand the forecast and make informed decisions based on it."" Researchers found that more than half of people in the Black Country reported that they used ""bucketing"" to describe heavy rain, but in Leeds and Newcastle, most would use ""chucking it down"". Those in Birmingham and Bristol use ""tipping it down"" and Londoners say ""caning it"". Hangry and ransomware added to dictionary 10 slang phrases that perfectly sum up their era A fifth of people in Southampton claim to break into song when it rains heavily, performing renditions of ""it's raining, pouring, the old man is snoring"". But ""pouring"" was found to be the most popular term to describe heavy rain nationally.

An expression in this area; now I suspect hardly ever used is ""it's black orr Bill's mothers"". This was when the sky was darkening ahead of a thunderstorm. I have met people who also knew this who lived in Leicester and another from Humberside. My wife's family from County Durham used the term ""it's stotting it down"" to describe rain that was so heavy the rain was bouncing off the ground.Stephen Veasey, Nottingham We have some excellent terms for weather up here in the north-east of Scotland from ""driech"", ""smirrie rain"", ""it's fair dinging doon"", ""blawing a hoolie"", ""it's minging outside"" and probably heaps more.Sarah Kirkwood, Aberdeen I have lived in York for more than 21 years (born in Sussex) and a word which is commonly used to describe the weather being exceptionally cold here is ""nithering"". York is nithering for much of the year.Claire Sansford, York I've lived in London for almost 30 years and have never heard ""caning it"". Where I'm from in Cheshire, we'd say ""slinging it down"" or ""tipping it down"".  I wonder if the British have as many words for rain as Eskimos famously have for snow?Paula Dempsey, London In Scarborough, heavy rain is often ""siling"" - this may have Norse origins. If it's hot, it's ""mafting"" and you may be said to be ""mafted"". And if it's miserable - or if someone you know is - ""dowly "".Mat Watkinson, Scarborough I don't know where it comes from but we always said ""it is raining stair rods"" when it was really heavy. Another which is I assume is more common is ""good weather for ducks"". As a child I have heard but not actually used it much in anger is the term ""Noah's day"" if it rained or was forecast to rain heavy for all or most of the day.Philip Robinson, Lincolnshire Hangry and ransomware added to dictionary 10 slang phrases that perfectly sum up their era Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Judge to decide sick boy's treatment,"Alfie Evans suffers from a progressive neurological degenerative condition The father of a seriously ill 20-month-old boy broke down in tears as a court was told further hospital treatment would be ""futile"". Tom Evans and Kate James, both 20 and from Bootle, want to take their son Alfie abroad for treatment. The hearing to decide if life support should be withdrawn from Alfie, who has a mystery illness, was stopped briefly while Mr Evans was comforted by family. UK doctors said continuing treatment was unkind, the court heard. Alfie is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" and has a degenerative neurological condition that has not been precisely diagnosed. Mr Justice Hayden, who told the court he himself had had the ""privilege"" of visiting Alfie in hospital, said: ""Everybody in this court shares the same objectives, everybody wants the best for Alfie."" Alfie's parents believe he responds to them, and his father told reporters outside court he was ""improving healthwise"". But the High Court, sitting in Liverpool, heard any movements by the child are spontaneous seizures as a result of touching. Michael Mylonas QC, representing the hospital, said: ""One of the problems of this case is they look at him and, barring the paraphernalia of breathing and feeding, he's a sweet, lovely, normal-looking boy who opens his eyes, [and] will smile..."" Tom Evans and Kate James want to take their son Alfie abroad for treatment Mr Mylonas said scans of Alfie had shown ""catastrophic degradation of his brain tissue"" which was getting worse. He said that, at the request of the parents, three medical experts from the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome had visited Alfie in Alder Hey. They had reached the same conclusions in terms of the ""complete futility"" of trying to find a cure or alleviating his seizures. The Italian experts had suggested operations to help Alfie breathe and feed and keep him alive for an ""undefined period"". But Dr Martin Samuels, an expert in the ventilation of children, believed such operations were ""inappropriate"". Supporters of Tom Evans and Kate James outside Liverpool Family Court ""I think we are all agreed from the medical perspective that life expectancy is limited,"" he said. Prof Helen Cross told the court that tests showed Alfie only displayed brain activity when he was having seizures. She said Alfie's scans were ""highly abnormal"" with an estimated loss of 70% of his brain nerve fibre. This was not reversible, she said. ""Prolonging his life unnecessarily is not a way to go considering his brain is being progressively destroyed and there is no prospect of recovery,"" she added. Supporters wearing T-shirts saying ""release Alfie Evans"" are also at the two-day hearing. Despite mediation between the parents and specialists caring for Alfie at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, the city's family court will decide the child's fate. It follows apreliminary hearing at the High Courtin London last year when Mr Justice Hayden said everyone wanted what was best for Alfie, but ruled he would make a decision if agreement could not be reached after hearing from both sides. Doctors at Alder Hey believe they should stop ""mechanical ventilation"" for Alfie, who was born in May 2016. Alfie with his father and mother Kate James The Bambino Gesu Hospital was also involved in the case of terminally-ill Charlie Gard, asking British doctors if he could be transferred to their care. It came afterPope Francis calledfor his parents to be allowed to ""accompany and treat their child until the end"". Charlie had mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness,and died in a hospice at 11-months-old. The hearing will continue with more expert evidence on Friday.

Ratings show improvement in Wales schools,"This video can not be played Jackie Parker, head of Crickhowell High School in Powys, says all schools look to improve There has been an improvement in school performance, according to annual categorisation ratings. Hundreds of schools are placed into colour-coded support categories - green, yellow, amber and red. Two thirds of secondary and more than 85% of primary schools are green and yellow, which the education secretary says ""continues with the upward trend we have seen over the past few years."" But there are slightly more schools in red than last year. A county-by-county list of green schools The list of yellow rated schools Amber rated schools Red schools A full breakdown which shows which of Wales' 1,547 schools are in each category has also been publishedon the My Local Schools website.,external Green schools require just four days worth of support to improve and yellow schools receive up to 10 days of support. There are 56 schools in the red category - judged to need the most help, up to 25 days of support. This is 10 more schools than last year. OVERALL SCHOOL PERFORMANCE - AT A GLANCE: This year, the system has been fine-tuned so rather than just performance measures such as key GCSE results, there is a broader look at how schools are doing and the quality of teaching and learning. The findings include: 85.3% of primary schools and 68.3% of secondary schools are now in the green and yellow categories There has been a 29% rise in the number of green schools, compared to last year There are 17 schools which have stayed in the red category (seven secondary and 10 primary) from last year Two areas have no red schools at all for a successive year - Merthyr and Swansea Pembrokeshire has the most schools - six - in the red category, including four of its high schools. Four areas have no green secondary schools  - Anglesey, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire and Torfaen Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said there was ""real strength"" in primary schools and she wanted to see improvements in the secondary sector, with help targeted for those schools in the red category. ""Parents should know and have confidence that those schools will have support from their local education authority, their regional consortia and those schools around them doing well,"" she said. Digital learning 'not keeping pace with technology' GCSE results gap grows Plaid Cymru education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd called for a reform of the ""crude traffic light system"" and said also the Welsh Government needed to tackle the basic issues of school underfunding and recruitment. ""They also need to explain why there is continued disparity between the categorisation of schools and the outcome of Estyn inspections, which can still contradict each other,"" he added. Darren Millar, Conservative education spokesman said many of the schools rated green would not have been in the green category had they been consistent with last year's scoring tool. ""If we want an education system that competes with the best in the world, then we must be honest about the failings in Welsh schools - and work with the teaching profession and other stakeholders to solve them,"" he said.

Wales bans intimate piercings for under-18s,"This video can not be played Young people outside a piercing studio in Cardiff had mixed views about the new law Wales has become the first UK nation to ban intimate piercing for under 18s in a bid to prevent potential related health problems. The new law makes it an offence to pierce or arrange to pierce the tongue, genitals and nipples of those under 18. It follows concerns they can cause medical complications as well as worries over child protection issues. But young people have had mixed reactions to the ban. Speaking outside a piercing studio in Cardiff, Lauren, 19, agreed with the move, saying: ""Once you've got something you can't take it back, it's on you forever."" But Joseph, 17, said: ""Whatever makes everybody else happy, I don't mind either way."" Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said the move would better protect young people. 'Most pierced' among Guinness World Records Tattoo and piercing ban for police Genital piercing rules 'undermine' FGM The change, under thePublic Health (Wales) Act 2017,external, calls on piercers to ask customers to prove their age and get signed consent for procedures to avoid prosecution and a fine. Council enforcement officers and police have been trained on how to enforce the new law. This video can not be played As a new law comes into force in Wales, BBC Radio Wales asked - how young is too young for piercing? A study in England found complications were reported by a third of all 16-24 who had all types of piercings. Of those, 50% of people with a tongue piercing reported a problem, followed by 45% with genital piercings and 35% with nipple piercings. The Welsh Government said young people were particularly at risk of further complications because their bodies were still developing. It also said young people may be less likely to have the experience or knowledge of how to clean or maintain an intimate piercing, leading to a higher risk of infection. This video can not be played Jessica Anne Nicholas said under 18s were not adult enough for genital piercings Dr Atherton said: ""It's concerning that a third of young people with intimate piercings have reported complications following a procedure. ""The child protection issues that could also arise from this scenario highlight even further, the importance of implementing such a law. ""I hope this piece of legislation will help to reduce these issues, and that practitioners understand the importance of obtaining proof of age beforehand."" Some councils in London and Scotland have already imposed restrictions The move was also backed by Chief Dental Officer for Wales, Dr Colette Bridgman, who said tongue piercings could damage teeth and gums, and cause serious swelling in the mouth that could affect breathing. Wales is the first UK country to issue a nationwide ban but some councils in London and Scotland have imposed restrictions. Mixed views on piercing ban in Wales.

Stroke patients 'getting younger',"Rob Goodwin had none of the risk factors associated with stroke before he became ill The average age of people in England who have a stroke for the first time has fallen over the past decade, new figures show. It dropped from 71 to 68 for men and 75 to 73 for women between 2007 and 2016, Public Health England data shows. Over the same period, the proportion of first-time strokes suffered by 40 to 69-year-olds rose from 33% to 38%. PHE said the data showed strokes do not just affect the elderly and urged more people to be aware of the symptoms. It said the drop in the average age of first strokes was because of a fall in the proportion of strokes suffered by over-70s. This appeared to be due to better healthcare for the elderly, including health checks, that are helping them to monitor stroke risk factors, PHE said. The Act FAST campaign,externalis calling on people to phone 999 if they spot any signs of the condition in the face, arms or in speech to reduce the risk of disability or death caused by delayed treatment. Rob Goodwin, from Nottingham, had been a fit 48-year-old when he had a stroke in 2016. A keen cyclist, Mr Goodwin had none of the risk factors associated with stroke, such as high blood pressure, when he suddenly fell to the floor while getting dressed. It was because of his partner quickly recognising his symptoms and his 17-year-old stepdaughter phoning 999 that he was able to receive treatment within 40 minutes of his stroke and make an almost full recovery, he said. ""If my partner and stepdaughter hadn't acted quickly then I would undoubtedly be in a very different situation. That fast acting is essential."" Philippa Haslehurst said her stroke could have killed her were it not for her daughter Philippa Haslehurst, from Chingford, north London, was 47 when she suffered a major stroke in 2014, caused by a hole in her heart. She said it could have killed her were it not for her teenage daughter Beth, who recognised her symptoms from a previous Act FAST TV advert, enabling her mother to receive treatment quickly. Mrs Haslehurst said awareness of stroke symptoms was as important as recognising a heart attack. ""It could happen to anybody. It happens to young people, it happens to children. I was a healthy person and I had a hole in my heart."" Strokes, which occur when the blood supply to the brain is cut off, are the third most common cause of premature death and a leading cause of disability in the UK. It is estimated some 57,000 people in England suffered their first stroke in 2016. PHE found the rate of first-time strokes in the population had fallen by 8% since 2007. During that time, the percentage of first-time strokes suffered by over-70s went from 64% to 59%, while for those aged 40 to 59 it increased from 15.3% to 20%. Prof Julia Verne, Public Health England's director, said the findings showed ""everyone needs to be aware of the signs"". ""Calling 999 as soon as you see even one of the symptoms develop - in the face, arms and speech - is essential. Speedy treatment will help prevent deaths and disability."" PHE called on more people between the ages of 40 and 74 to get an NHS health check, which can identify early signs and those who are at risk of a stroke. Health Minister Steve Brine said: ""Strokes still claim thousands of lives each year, so the message of this Act FAST campaign remains as relevant as ever."" The campaign will feature in TV and radio adverts and posters on buses. Face - Has their face fallen on one side? Can they smile? Arms - Can they raise both their arms and keep them there?

Millionaire numbers rise by a third,"The number of British households that could consider themselves as millionaires rose by nearly a third in two years, official figures show. A total of 3.6 million households in Britain held wealth of more than Â£1m by June 2016, up 29% in two years, the Office for National Statistics said. Wealth includes pension savings, investments, belongings, and property values less any outstanding mortgage. Campaigners argue that the figures expose wealth inequality. The median wealth per British household, after borrowing is taken into account, was Â£259,400 by July 2016. This was 15% higher compared with two years earlier, theofficial figures,externalshow. The figures do not account for the rising cost of living over that time. The figures show the amount of wealth held by each of Britain's 26 million households as a whole, irrespective of whether there is one or several occupants. While the wealth of those at the top end of the scale has risen, driven by the growth of private pensions and property values, those at the other end have suffered a fall over the same period. The poorest fifth of households, less likely to own a home or a private pension, saw their wealth diminish. For the bottom one in 10 households, that meant a typical fall of Â£3,000 to Â£32,000. Your biggest financial decision - in charts The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Conor D'Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, which lobbies for low-income groups, said: ""Britain is very good at generating wealth, but terrible at spreading it around the country and even worse at taxing it properly. As a result, we have unacceptably high levels of wealth inequality. ""Young people in particular are feeling the effects of Britain's wealth divide. Our large millennial generation own just 2% of the nation's wealth. This stems from their struggle get on the housing ladder, boosting other's people wealth in the private rented sector, rather than build assets of their own."" The data does show that there was little change in the proportion of wealth held by those at the top and those at the bottom over the period covered by the figures. The key factors behind the rise in wealth has been more people seeing their pension pots expand, as well as the rise in property values. There was a 20% rise in private pension wealth by July 2016 compared with two years earlier, to Â£5.3 trillion, primarily the result of workplace final-salary pensions growing in value, or amid pensions already being paid to those who are retired. This total was slightly ahead of the 17% rise in property wealth, which grew to Â£4.6 trillion over the same period. This increase in property wealth was reflected in the regional breakdown of wealth. Median net property wealth in London was Â£351,000 by June 2016 - a third higher than two years earlier. There were signs of Londoners choosing to put money into a deposit for a home, rather than into savings or shares. The amount of financial wealth in London fell the sharpest compared with other areas of Britain. Median household total wealth, which includes everything from cars to cash, was highest in the South East of England at Â£381,000 by June 2016, followed by the South West of England (Â£336,000). The lowest was in the North East of England, with median household wealth of Â£163,000. Your biggest financial decision - in charts Has your pay outperformed inflation?

Betting firms to stop 'unfair' promotions,"Betting firms Ladbrokes, William Hill, and PT Entertainment have agreed to change online games promotions after pressure from the regulator. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said punters must be able to cash out when they want, and not have to play more to release winnings. It said that ""gambling firms must now stop unfair online promotions that trap players' money"". The changes will apply to all promotions. After aCMA investigation into whether the sector was breaking consumer protection law, three companies - Ladbrokes, William Hill, and PT Entertainment - will make changes to bonus promotions for online games such as roulette and poker. Players will not be required to play multiple times before they can withdraw their own money Gambling firms must ensure that any restrictions on gameplay are made clear to players, and cannot rely on vague terms to take players' money Gambling firms must not make players take part in publicity to collect winnings The Gambling Commission, which worked with the CMA on its investigation, said companies across the whole sector must ""promptly adopt similar changes"". ""Firms not doing so will face regulatory action from the Gambling Commission,"" the CMA said in its statement. Guidance for gambling firms will be published later this year. Gambling Commission executive director, Sarah Gardner, said: ""Gambling firms must treat their customers fairly and not attach unreasonable terms and conditions to their promotions and offers."" Brian Wright, director of business for the Remote Gambling Association said: ""There are clearly lessons to be learned for some companies and we will work with the Gambling Commission and others to raise standards wherever necessary. ""We have already held productive discussions with the CMA and the Commission to consider how best to achieve that."" A Ladbrokes Coral statement said the company recognised that ""things had unintentionally gone too far"" and that the new rules would improve transparency. ""It is never comfortable being in the spotlight on these sorts of issues but we are pleased that a way forward has now been identified and are committed to ensuring we meet the standards set,"" the company said. William Hill said in a statement: ""As one of the largest online betting and gaming brands in the UK, William Hill has worked with the CMA to ensure that its concerns have been fully met. ""We welcome the standards and principles that the CMA has outlined and we look forward to their adoption across the industry.""

Taser use revealed in mental health cases,"Police drew, aimed or fired Tasers in mental health hospitals, wards, and clinics 58 times in the first six months of figures being recorded. The government says a Taser should be a last resort - but campaigners say they should never be used in such settings. The data, from 43 UK area forces, covers the six months to September 2017, when Tasers were fired 22 times. Three used Tasers on people under 17. On two of those occasions the Taser was fired, once at a 15-year-old girl. The Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Met Police were the only UK area forces that failed to respond to BBC Radio 5 live's Freedom of Information request. Pat Kenny said he was treated like a criminal The private security company at Pat Kenny's hostel called the police when he was self-harming in the reception area. ""I was at a stand-off with the police for about 15 minutes,"" he says. ""After 15 minutes they didn't know how to deal with it, so they Tasered me. ""I won't say it's painful but extremely uncomfortable and it's like you seize up. You can't move. ""And the officer started shouting at me aggressively, 'On the ground, on the ground.' ""And I was like, 'No, I'm still standing,' while I was trying to get to the cables to get them out and that's when they hit me with a second Taser."" Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb said: ""It's not appropriate to use this technology in a mental health settingâ¦ particularly when it's used against young people. ""There are circumstances in which force is necessary - when there is an immediate threat to life, either to the life of the individual concerned or to someone else's life,"" he said. But, he added: ""It's very hard to imagine the circumstances in which Tasers are necessary in any situation in mental health settings. ""Before they were designed and invented we got by without them, so is it not possible to get by without them in this day and age?"" The government said recording data on Taser usage should provide more accountability The government said Tasers were ""an important tactical option for specially trained police officers, but their use in mental health settings should only be a last resort and, where possible, staff trained in de-escalation techniques should always be the first response"". A spokesman added officers who used them had to complete a comprehensive training process. For Pat Kenny, although he believes a Taser shouldn't have been fired at him, he does think it led to him getting the help he needed. ""It finally got me into a proper assessment,"" he says. ""I'd been falling through the net for years. ""Now, I had the diagnosis of depression and PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] and borderline personality disorder. ""If anything, it did stop me falling through the net."" You can hear more onBBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast programmeon Thursday 1 February from 06:00 GMT and on the BBC iPlayer.

Cats and dogs? Forecasters consider slang,"It might be ""chucking it down"" in Leeds and Newcastle, but it is ""bucketing"" in the Black Country. That is according to research for the Met Office, as it considers introducing regional terms to weather forecasts. A survey of 2,000 people in January found a variety of slang words were used to describe UK weather. The Met Office said regions tended to interpret the same information differently and using regional slang could help people's understanding. Now it is appealing to the public to help them identify the words used to describe weather in their area and it has launched a #3wordweather on Twitter so words can be submitted.

""Ultimately we hope to use the insights from our research to tap into local dialects and vocabulary to make it easier for people across the UK to understand the forecast and make informed decisions based on it."" Researchers found that more than half of people in the Black Country reported that they used ""bucketing"" to describe heavy rain, but in Leeds and Newcastle, most would use ""chucking it down"".

An expression in this area; now I suspect hardly ever used is ""it's black orr Bill's mothers"". This was when the sky was darkening ahead of a thunderstorm. I have met people who also knew this who lived in Leicester and another from Humberside. My wife's family from County Durham used the term ""it's stotting it down"" to describe rain that was so heavy the rain was bouncing off the ground.Stephen Veasey, Nottingham We have some excellent terms for weather up here in the north-east of Scotland from ""driech"", ""smirrie rain"", ""it's fair dinging doon"", ""blawing a hoolie"", ""it's minging outside"" and probably heaps more.Sarah Kirkwood, Aberdeen I have lived in York for more than 21 years (born in Sussex) and a word which is commonly used to describe the weather being exceptionally cold here is ""nithering"". York is nithering for much of the year.Claire Sansford, York I've lived in London for almost 30 years and have never heard ""caning it"". Where I'm from in Cheshire, we'd say ""slinging it down"" or ""tipping it down"".  I wonder if the British have as many words for rain as Eskimos famously have for snow?Paula Dempsey, London In Scarborough, heavy rain is often ""siling"" - this may have Norse origins. If it's hot, it's ""mafting"" and you may be said to be ""mafted"". And if it's miserable - or if someone you know is - ""dowly "".Mat Watkinson, Scarborough I don't know where it comes from but we always said ""it is raining stair rods"" when it was really heavy. Another which is I assume is more common is ""good weather for ducks"".

"Wales bans intimate piercings for under-18sIt is now an offence to pierce or arrange to pierce the tongue, genitals and nipples of under 18s in Wales.","This video can not be played Young people outside a piercing studio in Cardiff had mixed views about the new law Wales has become the first UK nation to ban intimate piercing for under 18s in a bid to prevent potential related health problems. The new law makes it an offence to pierce or arrange to pierce the tongue, genitals and nipples of those under 18. It follows concerns they can cause medical complications as well as worries over child protection issues. But young people have had mixed reactions to the ban. Speaking outside a piercing studio in Cardiff, Lauren, 19, agreed with the move, saying: ""Once you've got something you can't take it back, it's on you forever."" But Joseph, 17, said: ""Whatever makes everybody else happy, I don't mind either way."" Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said the move would better protect young people. 'Most pierced' among Guinness World Records Tattoo and piercing ban for police Genital piercing rules 'undermine' FGM The change, under thePublic Health (Wales) Act 2017,external, calls on piercers to ask customers to prove their age and get signed consent for procedures to avoid prosecution and a fine. Council enforcement officers and police have been trained on how to enforce the new law. This video can not be played As a new law comes into force in Wales, BBC Radio Wales asked - how young is too young for piercing? A study in England found complications were reported by a third of all 16-24 who had all types of piercings. Of those, 50% of people with a tongue piercing reported a problem, followed by 45% with genital piercings and 35% with nipple piercings. The Welsh Government said young people were particularly at risk of further complications because their bodies were still developing. It also said young people may be less likely to have the experience or knowledge of how to clean or maintain an intimate piercing, leading to a higher risk of infection. This video can not be played Jessica Anne Nicholas said under 18s were not adult enough for genital piercings Dr Atherton said: ""It's concerning that a third of young people with intimate piercings have reported complications following a procedure. ""The child protection issues that could also arise from this scenario highlight even further, the importance of implementing such a law. ""I hope this piece of legislation will help to reduce these issues, and that practitioners understand the importance of obtaining proof of age beforehand."" Some councils in London and Scotland have already imposed restrictions The move was also backed by Chief Dental Officer for Wales, Dr Colette Bridgman, who said tongue piercings could damage teeth and gums, and cause serious swelling in the mouth that could affect breathing. Wales is the first UK country to issue a nationwide ban but some councils in London and Scotland have imposed restrictions. Mixed views on piercing ban in Wales.

"Pay gap figures spark 'fake data' fearsThe government brands some firms' claims of a 50/50 gender divide ""statistically improbable"".11h11 hours agoEngland","About 750 companies have so far revealed their gender pay gap Gender pay gap figures reported by some firms have been called into question, prompting concerns about ""fake data"" from campaigners. In response to new rules requiring businesses to publish pay figures, a number claimed to have 50% male and 50% female staff. The government said this was ""statistically improbable"" and called on firms to check their information. The Fawcett Society called for a clampdown on potential ""fake data"". Companies with 250 or more workers will have to calculate their gender pay gap and publish it on a government website. About 9,000 employers have to publish their data by 4 April 2018, or 30 March for the public sector. So farabout 750, including the BBC, have done so. Two dozen companies say they have a gender pay gap of zero, with 10 of them claiming that precisely 50% of lower, middle, upper and higher wage earners are female and 50% are male. McDonald's said the figures were being updated Catharine Clark, from Finchley-based Fore Street Employment Agency, one of the companies that reported absolute equality, said: ""I don't think we've filled this out right and we are going to look at it again. Although we're not wrong in saying we have no gender pay gap."" A Khan Ltd, which is the franchise holder for McDonald's in Newcastle's Northumberland Street,is another of the companies reporting a 0% gap.,external A spokeswoman said the figures were ""entered in error"" because numbers had to be added to complete the registration for the government system. She said McDonald's themselves would be providing the correct figures as they use their payroll for staff. McDonald's said the figures ""are in the process of being updated"". What is the gender pay gap where you are? Try the pay calculator BBC review finds ""no gender bias in on-air pay decisions"" Andrew Bazeley, from the Fawcett Society, said: ""The gender pay gap reporting deadline in April is a vital moment for businesses to look at their pay data, correct pay discrimination where it exists, and take action to reduce the gap overall. ""But it looks like some of these businesses have missed that opportunity. It's possible that we are looking at fake data in some cases. ""The government needs to act urgently and give the Equality and Human Rights Commission the power and resources to effectively crack down on businesses who don't comply with the law."" Anthony Horrigan, from workforce analytics company Staffmetrix, said: ""Companies with modern data-collection processes will find this easier. Some companies will have some of their data, such as the payroll, on one system and other data on different systems. However, everyone has to get on and do this."" A Government Equalities Office spokesman said the department would be following up with employers where ""statistically improbable data has been reported"" to help them get it right. He added: ""Employers have until 4 April 2018, or 30 March 2018 for the public sector, to report their gender pay gap. They must also ensure that the information they publish is accurate. This is not an option, it is the law, so they need to get on and do it. ""Any evidence that employers are breaching the law can be investigated and they risk being subject to enforcement by the Equality and Human Rights Commission."" The employer to publish the biggest gender pay gap so far is women's fashion chain Phase Eight - with a 64.8% gap between male and female staff. Phase Eight said the figure did not reflect the ""true story"" of the business as most male employees are in higher-paid head office roles rather than in shops. The pay gap is calculated based on the difference in the mean hourly rate earned by male and female staff. Gender pay gap revealed at 500 UK firms What is the pay gap like where you are?

Republicans 'tampered with memo on FBI',"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The US House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat has accused Republicans of amending a memo about claims of FBI surveillance at the 2016 election. Adam Schiff said Republicans had changed the text after it was voted on. The secret document was passed by the Republican-dominated committee but needs approval from President Donald Trump to be made public. It is believed to accuse the FBI of abusing its surveillance powers to target the Trump campaign. The four-page document was compiled by staffers for House Intelligence Committee head Devin Nunes, a member of Mr Trump's Republican party. Concerns about its contents were raised by the FBI itself which complained of ""material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy"". Democrats fear the document may be an attempt to discredit the inquiry into Trump campaign links to Russia, which is being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. If Mr Trump gives his approval, the memo may be released later on Thursday. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Staffers for Republican Devin Nunes wrote the secret memo It apparently accuses the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) of abusing a programme known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) during the presidential election campaign. The allegation is that the FBI spied on a member of Mr Trump's campaign on the basis of unproven accusations against Mr Trump known as the ""Russian dossier"". That dossier was compiled by former UK intelligence agent Christopher Steele with money financed in part from Hillary Clinton's campaign. Following his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, Mr Trump was heard telling a Republican lawmaker he was ""100%"" for releasing the document. The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington Why attacks on Mueller are mounting According to Mr Schiff, the text approved by the committee on Monday is not the same as that given to the White House.

Mr Nunes sent a version of the memo that was ""materially altered"", the Democrat said. He gave no details. Quoted by Reuters news agency, a spokesman for Mr Nunes described the changes to the memo as minor, including two edits requested by the FBI and Democrats themselves. Mr Schiff's allegation was, the spokesman added, an ""increasingly strange attempt to thwart publication"". In a rare statement, the agency said it had had ""limited opportunity"" to review the document,externalbefore the committee voted to release it on Monday. ""We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the Fisa process,"" it added. The DoJ has said it would be ""extraordinarily reckless"" to release the memo. Trump officials say the memo proves his allegation that he has been treated unfairly by the FBI. Devin Nunes, who served on the Trump team during his White House transition, described the FBI's objections as ""spurious"". After firing FBI director James Comey last year, Mr Trump reportedly asked his temporary replacement, Andrew McCabe, how he had voted in the 2016 presidential election. Mr McCabe resigned last month as Mr Trump accused him of pro-Democratic bias. He had been planning to retire in March.

""This is not about the facts,"" he said. ""This is about a narrative the chairman [Mr Nunes] wants to put out - a misleading narrative, to undermine the FBI, undermine the [justice] department and ultimately undermine Bob Mueller."" However, Mr Nunes said it was clear that top officials had used ""unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign"".

Murder arrests over prison stabbing,"Khader Saleh was pronounced dead at the scene Four men have been arrested on suspicion of murdering an inmate who was stabbed to death at Wormwood Scrubs prison. Police said Khader Saleh was found with stab wounds at the west London jail at about 15:19 GMT on Wednesday. Mr Saleh's family said they thought the 25-year-old, who had a son, would have been safe in the prison. Two men aged 21, a 20-year-old and a 23-year-old man, who are all prisoners at the jail, remain in police custody. Khader Saleh's mother Amina Dualeh and brother Said Yusuf said they felt ""devastated"" by his death Said Yusuf, Khader's older brother, said the family had been left ""devastated"" by the attack. ""He was a young man trying to move on in his life. He recently got married and had a one-year-old son,"" he said. He said police had told them his brother, who was on remand and awaiting trial, had been stabbed seven times with a metal blade. ""We thought he was in a safe place in prison."" Khader Saleh was stabbed at the jail in west London on Wednesday Built during the Victorian era, Wormwood Scrubs is a Category B prison with a capacity of 1,279 inmates. Records from December last year show 1,131 prisoners were being held at the jail, based in East Acton. An inspection report published in the same monthfound the jail had chronic staff shortages, food supply issues and a surge in violence. HM Inspectorate of Prisons warned that Wormwood Scrubs was ""still not safe enough"". A spokesperson for the the Ministry of Justice said ""decisive action to reduce violence"" had been taken since the inspection and a ""full review of safety and security"" had been conducted. ""The prison has now introduced body-worn cameras, additional CCTV and patrol dogs, and will be recruiting 120 extra officers to further improve safety,"" they said.

Pay gap figures spark 'fake data' fears,"About 750 companies have so far revealed their gender pay gap Gender pay gap figures reported by some firms have been called into question, prompting concerns about ""fake data"" from campaigners. In response to new rules requiring businesses to publish pay figures, a number claimed to have 50% male and 50% female staff. The government said this was ""statistically improbable"" and called on firms to check their information. The Fawcett Society called for a clampdown on potential ""fake data"". Companies with 250 or more workers will have to calculate their gender pay gap and publish it on a government website. About 9,000 employers have to publish their data by 4 April 2018, or 30 March for the public sector. So farabout 750, including the BBC, have done so. Two dozen companies say they have a gender pay gap of zero, with 10 of them claiming that precisely 50% of lower, middle, upper and higher wage earners are female and 50% are male. McDonald's said the figures were being updated Catharine Clark, from Finchley-based Fore Street Employment Agency, one of the companies that reported absolute equality, said: ""I don't think we've filled this out right and we are going to look at it again. Although we're not wrong in saying we have no gender pay gap."" A Khan Ltd, which is the franchise holder for McDonald's in Newcastle's Northumberland Street,is another of the companies reporting a 0% gap.,external A spokeswoman said the figures were ""entered in error"" because numbers had to be added to complete the registration for the government system. She said McDonald's themselves would be providing the correct figures as they use their payroll for staff. McDonald's said the figures ""are in the process of being updated"". What is the gender pay gap where you are? Try the pay calculator BBC review finds ""no gender bias in on-air pay decisions"" Andrew Bazeley, from the Fawcett Society, said: ""The gender pay gap reporting deadline in April is a vital moment for businesses to look at their pay data, correct pay discrimination where it exists, and take action to reduce the gap overall. ""But it looks like some of these businesses have missed that opportunity. It's possible that we are looking at fake data in some cases. ""The government needs to act urgently and give the Equality and Human Rights Commission the power and resources to effectively crack down on businesses who don't comply with the law."" Anthony Horrigan, from workforce analytics company Staffmetrix, said: ""Companies with modern data-collection processes will find this easier. Some companies will have some of their data, such as the payroll, on one system and other data on different systems. However, everyone has to get on and do this."" A Government Equalities Office spokesman said the department would be following up with employers where ""statistically improbable data has been reported"" to help them get it right. He added: ""Employers have until 4 April 2018, or 30 March 2018 for the public sector, to report their gender pay gap. They must also ensure that the information they publish is accurate. This is not an option, it is the law, so they need to get on and do it. ""Any evidence that employers are breaching the law can be investigated and they risk being subject to enforcement by the Equality and Human Rights Commission."" The employer to publish the biggest gender pay gap so far is women's fashion chain Phase Eight - with a 64.8% gap between male and female staff. Phase Eight said the figure did not reflect the ""true story"" of the business as most male employees are in higher-paid head office roles rather than in shops. The pay gap is calculated based on the difference in the mean hourly rate earned by male and female staff. Gender pay gap revealed at 500 UK firms What is the pay gap like where you are?

Facebook tweaks prompt fall in user time,"Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wants users to interact more Facebook users spent less time on the site even before it announced major changes to its News Feed in January. Measures such as showing fewer viral videoscut time spent on the social network by about 5%, or roughly 50 million hours a day, in the last three months of 2017. However, Facebook reported better than expected results despite the fall. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the priority was encouraging more personal interaction among  users. ""Helping people connect is more important than maximising the time they spend on Facebook,"" he said. ""We can make sure the service is good for people's well-being and for society overall."" In January,Facebook said it would make changesto news feeds to prioritise posts from friends and family and make content from businesses and news outlets less prominent. Mark Zuckerberg vows to 'fix' Facebook Facebook - the secret election weapon The number of monthly active users rose 14% to 2.13 billion in the three months to December, although that was slightly lower growth than the previous quarter. In the US and Canada, which generates a sizeable proportion of Facebook's advertising revenues - the number of daily users fell about 700,000 to 184 million in the quarter. Facebook said annual revenues soared 47% last year to more than $40bn (Â£28.2bn), while profits jumped 56% to nearly $16bn. The gains came despite a $2.3bn payment triggered by recent changes to US tax law. There are politicians, academics and even former executives lining up to tell Facebook what's wrong with it, but Mark Zuckerberg has only ever trusted his own data. And so these tweaks to the News Feed, above all else, are a result of what Facebook's engineers have seen for themselves. Mr Zuckerberg's (pretty convincing) argument is that by not fixing the News Feed, the long-term health of the company could be in jeopardy - not because of Russian propaganda or fake news, but because it just won't be fun or useful to use. The 33-year-old is again warning investors that it's going to take time to heal the News Feed, making it a better place for you and for me - and then eventually, he hopes, advertisers and businesses. What we need to look out for is investors' patience with him. Over the past two years Facebook has consistently beat expectations, and it did again today, even with the caveats. Will Wall Street cut him some slack as a result? Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, said the firm's financial results were ""robust"" and described Facebook's strategy as ""the right medicine at the right time"". ""We believe this strategy will drive higher advertising pricing monetisation trends in the long-term for Facebook and was a move Zuckerberg & Co needed to make,"" he said. Facebook shares initially fell by more than 4% in after-hours trading, but rebounded quickly following the results call.

BT's Openreach in faster broadband push,"Openreach, the BT-owned firm that manages the UK's broadband infrastructure, has vowed to introduce ""ultrafast"" internet connections to three million premises by 2020. The company said it was accelerating its plan to run fibre connections directly to homes and businesses. It will increase internet speeds from 24 megabits a second under superfast broadband to 100 megabits. The first phase will begin this year, targeting eight cities across the UK. Openreach, which operates independently from BT, said Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool, London and Manchester would form the first phase of the programme that will connect ""up to 40 UK towns, cities and boroughs"". Too little, too late. That is how BT's many critics will characterise the plan to bring full fibre connections into as many as 10 million homes by 2025. They have always argued that the UK should have opted long ago for a national future-proof fibre-to-the-home network. Instead, BT's approach has been to lay fibre to cabinets on the street and then rely on good old copper cables to take broadband into the home. But that was driven by the government's order to make ""superfast"" broadband - a modest 24 megabits a second - available to 95% premises by the end of 2017. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the successful completion of that target this week. That superfast target had some advantages: it got reasonably good and reasonably cheap broadband to many people in a hurry. In Hull, where the monopoly provider KCom opted instead to go straight to fibre to the home the rollout has been slow and the prices have been high. But with the government switching tack and insisting ""full fibre"" is now the answer, BT has seen the light - though as its statement makes clear the speed of the rollout will depend on an ""acceptable"" return on its investment. Alex Neill of consumer group Which?, said that the UK was far behind other countries in offering high speed internet access through fibre connections directly to homes or businesses. She said: ""When you look that 79% of people in Spain have got access to full fibre and yet only 3% of British homes have, clearly consumers will be asking why that is happening, especially when the majority of them have experienced a problem with their broadband in the last year."" Openreach said it already provided fibre connections 500,000 homes, mostly in rural areas. Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach, said: ""Our focus over the last two years has been to achieve the government's target of getting 95% superfast coverage. ""Now having got to 95% the mandate is twofold: fix the last 5% and move on to the upgrade from superfast to ultrafast speeds."" While the Federation of Small Businesses welcomed investment in ultrafast broadband, its national chairman Mike Cherry said that ""too many small firms across the UK are still coming up against poor coverage and slow speeds"". ""Official Ofcom figures released last month show a shocking 230,000 small businesses are unable to access a decent connection of 10Mbps. In addition, around half a million small firms don't have access to a superfast connection. They cannot be left behind due to poor digital connectivity."" Openreach's Mr Selley said that homes and businesses would be connected using a ""hybrid"" of the existing copper-based network and fibre. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I'm glad that Openreach have begun to make this shift in strategy, away from reliance on copper based systems and in favour of the best modern technology. ""We want to encourage a competitive market to rollout this technology and we will work with Openreach, Virgin, CityFibre, Gigaclear, TalkTalk and the growing number of full fibre broadband providers to build a Britain fit for the future."" Rival CityFibre, which is working with Vodafone to deliver fibre to the premises of five million homes and businesses by 2025, said: ""It is recognised by government and Ofcom that the time has come to reduce the public's dependency on Openreach. It is not in the UK's best interest to encourage further entrenchment of the incumbent monopoly.""

FBI and White House clash on secret memo,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The FBI has questioned moves to release a secret memo said to accuse it of abusing surveillance powers to target Donald Trump's presidential campaign. ""We have grave concerns about the material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy,"" the agency said. There are suggestions the Congressional memo may be published on Thursday. Democrats fear the document may be an attempt to discredit the inquiry into Trump campaign links to Russia. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff accused his Republican counterparts of altering the text of the document after it was voted on. He said it should be withdrawn and reviewed again prior to any possible public release. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading the investigation into alleged Russian meddling and possible obstruction of justice by members of the Trump administration.

According to lawmakers who saw the memo, it says the FBI obtained a warrant to spy on the campaign aide on the basis of unproven accusations against Mr Trump known as the ""Russian dossier"".

MPs to see Brexit report,"Brexit minister Robin Walker made the announcement in Parliament Leaked studies on the economic impact of Brexit will be made available to MPs to read, ministers have said. No 10 said it would allow MPs and peers to see the report on a confidential basis after a Commons debate. Ministers decided not to oppose a Labour motion urging its publication, amid signs they would lose the vote. The leaked study suggests that in three different scenarios the UK economy would grow more slowly than it would if it stayed in the European Union The government had previously argued that the document's immediate publication could damage UK negotiations with the EU. Theresa May earlier told reporters en route to China, where she is on a trade mission, that making the analysis public before it was fully completed would be ""wrong"". The key Brexit dates in 2018 EU sets out Brexit transition demands But with the government facing potential defeat in the vote on Wednesday afternoon, Brexit minister Robin Walker told MPs a copy of the report would be given to Hilary Benn, the Labour chairman of the Commons Brexit committee. He added: ""And a confidential reading room can be provided for other MPs and peers a copy of this analysis to view the material on a confidential basis. This will happen only when arrangements can be made."" The minister did not clearly specify a timeframe on when these arrangements can be made. Labour have called for the report to be released since details of its existence first emerged in a Buzzfeed article on Monday. Several Tories also said the material should be made public. Former Chancellor Ken Clarke, a leading supporter of a soft Brexit in which the UK maintains existing links with the EU, said there was a ""rather curious cult of secrecy"" around the government's approach to the issue. Sir Keir Starmer says ministers cannot sideline Parliament to hide their party's ""deep divisions"" ""A leak is a very serious matter and I deplore leaks when documents are revealed whose contents compromise the national interest, or are loaded with party political or other significance,"" he said. ""But an objective analysis of the economic consequences of various options which the government is at the moment looking at and considering, it's impossible to see how that compromises the national interest. ""A properly open government should make that sort of information freely available to all those, including MPs, with a legitimate interest in the subject."" Tory MP Anna Soubry suggested it was a ""farce"" for the document to be released confidentially for only a few hundred people to see when it was likely to end up all over the internet. She said ministers must get a grip on the EU negotiations, warning of ""a collective outbreak in the government of a form of madness"". Speaking before the government concession was announced, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament was entitled to know the likely impact of the government's approach and to hold it to account. ""What we need now from the government is clarity about when the documents will be handed over and a guarantee they will be so in an unedited and unredacted form,"" he said.

PM rejects lord's lateness resignation,"This video can not be played Minister Lord Bates 'quits' for being late to debate The prime minister has refused to accept the resignation of a lord who offered to leave his post after being late to the chamber. Lord Bates stunned colleagues in the House of Lords by stating his intention to resign after the ""discourtesy"" of arriving late to a session. A spokesman for Number 10 said the resignation was ""unnecessary"" and he had decided to continue in his role. Lord Bates could not immediately be contacted for comment. The international development minister and former Conservative MP should have answered the first oral question of the session which began at 15:00 GMT on Wednesday. A spokesman for the prime minister said: ""With typical sincerity, Lord Bates today offered to tender his resignation, but his resignation was refused as it was judged this was unnecessary. ""As a hard-working and diligent minister, it is typical of his approach that he takes his responsibilities to Parliament so seriously. ""He has received support from across the House and we are pleased he has decided to continue in his important roles at the Department for International Development and HM Treasury."" Lord Bates, speaking to the Lords at the end of the questions session, described himself as ""ashamed"" to not have been in his place to answer a question from Labour's Baroness Lister. ""It's been my privilege to answer questions from this despatch box on behalf of the government,"" he told peers. ""I've always believed we should rise to the highest possible standards of courtesy and respect in responding on behalf of the government to the legitimate questions of the legislature. ""I'm thoroughly ashamed of not being in my place and therefore I shall be offering my resignation to the prime minister with immediate effect."" He then walked out of the chamber despite colleagues urging him to stay.

Psychosis patients 'not getting best care',"Ali Mousa experienced an episode of psychosis A key government target for caring for people with severe mental health conditions in England is being missed due to underfunding, research suggests. People experiencing a first episode of psychosis should be seen within two weeks and get a quality care package. But Liberal Democrat research indicates that while more people are being seen on time, few get the right treatment. NHS England said ""the analysis inevitably gives only a partial and dated picture of progress"". New care and treatment standards for psychosis were introduced by the Department of Health in April 2016. The rules state at least 50% of people experiencing their first episode of psychosis should start a package of care recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) within a fortnight of being referred. Norman Lamb, the former Mare Minister who established the care standards, said responses to Freedom of Information requests he had made suggested ""the treatment programme is not being properly delivered"" in most parts of England. While official figures show 72% of patients started their treatment within the two-week target in November 2017, Mr Lamb's figures indicate that fewer than a third of mental health trusts in England were able to offer patients the full NICE package of care. Of the 45 mental health trusts that responded: 12 said they were able to provide the full NICE approved treatment 24 said they were not five said they were making progress Four didn't provide the information Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem Young people explain psychosis on film 'I was offered help two years later' The typical treatment involves a combination of anti-psychotic medication, psychological therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and family or social support. ""Could we ever imagine a situation where a cancer patient doesn't get the full treatment that the evidence says they need?"" asks Mr Lamb rhetorically. ""The impact on peoples' lives of not making this investment is profound. ""You are left with - potentially - a miserable life, a life on benefits, a life with difficult relationships.  And yet if we make that investment, we can transform lives."" Ali Mousa was arrested Ali Mousa's first episode of psychosis lasted a fortnight. ""I thought musicians were trying to induct me into some sort of secret society,"" he says. ""I thought I was the next Messiah. It felt bizarre, but very real."" His behaviour, including walking down the middle of busy road, led to him being arrested and spending six months in a psychiatric hospital. The 28-year-old praises the hospital, but says what made the real difference to his recovery was the support of his local early intervention in psychosis (EIP) team. ""If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have been able to stand up on my own two feet again,"" he says. ""I didn't think I'd get support, to get housing, to get me a job, for someone to help build relations with my mum."" Ali says he is now fully recovered, and has been in a job, proof, he says, of the value of good care. NHS England has calculated that a proper care package will cost about Â£8,250 per patient. But of the 17 trusts that answered Mr Lamb's question on funding, all but two (Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber, and Oxleas) said they were spending less than that amount. The pressure on budgets indicated by the responses is reflected in a report looking at the performance of EIP teams in the south of England. Thereport,externalsays that of the 16 trusts providing EIP services in the region, not one is receiving the recommended level of investment. If the expected investment in the service had been realised, says the document, an extra Â£15m would have been spent in 2017-18; the real increase has been Â£3.5m. ""There continues to be a gap between the rhetoric and investment reaching the front line,"" says the report. The increasing demand for EIP services and the pressures it's putting on staff ""is demoralising and driving many away from joining and staying within the clinical workforce"", it says. A member of Dorset Healthcare NHS Trust's Early Intervention Team was recently assaulted, the BBC has learned, after assessing a new patient alone. The standard is for two staff members to initially meet new people, in part to protect them. Evidence seen by BBC News indicates the trust is struggling to provide EIP services - with staff carrying higher caseloads than other nearby trusts and, in a number of areas, delivering fewer types of treatment such as CBT sessions. Mike Kelly, Dorset Healthcare's head of mental health services, said: ""We know there is work to do and we are recruiting staff to fill the vacant posts to enable the team to provide more support to people who use the service. ""Additional funding will also be required going forward to keep pace with demand."" NHS England said total mental health funding has risen faster than overall NHS budgets in recent years. An official said: ""10,000 people each year are now receiving treatment through the early intervention in psychosis programme, with over three-quarters of patients getting treatment within two weeks. ""The analysis inevitably gives only a partial and dated picture of progress in these services.""

Record deadline-day Premier League spend,"This video can not be played Wright on Aubameyang, Giroud and transfer spending Premier League clubs spent a January transfer deadline-day record Â£150m on Wednesday to take their overall outlay for the month to Â£430m, according to analysis by Deloitte's Sports Business Group. The most expensive move on the final day of the winter transfer window came whenPierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Arsenalfrom Borussia Dortmund for a club record Â£56m. Elsewhere,Tottenham signed Lucas Mourafor Â£23m, andOlivier GiroudandAndre Ayewmade Â£18m moves - to Chelsea and Swansea respectively - as deadline-day spending passed the record set in 2011. Announcements continued to trickle in long after the 23:00 GMT deadline, withEliaquim Mangala's loan move from Manchester City to Evertonmade public at 00:53 on Thursday. The top-flight clubs had already made this a record January transfer window, beating another record set in 2011 by Â£205m. Then, Chelsea completed a Â£50m move for Liverpool's Fernando Torres, and the Reds recruited Â£22.7m Ajax striker Luis Suarez and paid Newcastle Â£35m for Andy Carroll to take the deadline-day spend to Â£135m. Seven years on, three other strikers made the headlines, with Aubameyang's move reliant on Dortmund taking Chelsea forward Michy Batshuayi on loan, and the Blues replacing him with Arsenal's Giroud. Check out all the transfer deadline-day deals in one place What happens when fans get it painfully wrong in the transfer window? This video can not be played Pundits debate winner of 'transfer triangle' Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang [Borussia Dortmund - Arsenal] Â£56m Lucas Moura [Paris St-Germain - Tottenham] Â£23m Olivier Giroud [Arsenal - Chelsea] Â£18m Andre Ayew [West Ham - Swansea] Â£18m Badou Ndiaye [Galatasaray - Stoke City] Â£14m Jordan Hugill [Preston - West Ham] Â£10m The most expensive Premier League signing of the January transfer window actually went through on the opening day of the month, whenLiverpool signed defender Virgil van Dijkfrom Southampton for Â£75m. Leicester's protracted move for midfielder Adrien Silvaalso went through on the same day, and before the week was out Everton had paid a club record Â£27m to sign Besiktas forward Cenk Tosun. Later in the window, the Toffees made a second Â£20m-plus signing in wingerTheo Walcott. Alexis Sanchezswapped Arsenal for Manchester United as one of the window's most-talked-about deals went through on 22 January, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan going the other way - although Deloitte have not included any fees from this deal in their total for January. Manchester City had been heavily linked with Sanchez, but switched their attention to a move for Leicester's Riyad Mahrez, which they walked away from on deadline day, 24 hours after paying Â£57m to make defenderAymeric Laportetheir club record signing. The 10 most expensive deals of the January transfer window According to Deloitte, the Premier League clubs' total spending for the 2017-18 season is an estimated Â£1.9bn. ""While another record-breaking season catches the eye, Premier League clubs' expenditure continues to be well within their means in the context of revenue generated,"" said Dan Jones, partner in the company's Sports Business Group. ""Estimated 2017-18 net spend of Â£755m represents just 17% of forecast 2017-18 Premier League revenue, in line with the average over the 15 years since the first transfer window in January 2003, as clubs increase investment in players in proportion to the overall growth of the football business."" With competition for the Champions League places heating up, Chelsea brought in Giroud and defender Emerson Palmieri from Roma - the latter for Â£17.6m - while Spurs added PSG winger Moura. The last of those deals meant spending by the so-called 'big six' - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - went from just Â£40,000 in January 2017 to Â£265m this year. Those six clubs have traditionally set the tone for spending, but in the past two January windows it is the rest of the division that has been busy, perhaps influenced the league's Â£5.136bn TV rights deal. Jones added: ""Such is the level of competition for a coveted top-four position in the Premier League, as well as ongoing European battles, that top clubs have been willing to break with more traditional summer investment strategies to steal a march on their rivals mid-season, with several club transfer records being broken in this window."" The graph shows how much Premier League players moved for in January compared to the value of their previous transfer Arsenal completed the most expensive deadline-day deal when they signed Aubameyang, sparking a peak of 1,639 tweets per minute and more than 280,000 in total about him. The north London club announced the signing on Twitter using #YoPierre, which was retweeted 77,000 times. Tweets mentioning 'Aubameyang' peaked shortly after Arsenal announced the forward's signing at 11:13 GMT So is it good business for Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, who - after signing Â£46.5m striker Alexandre Lacazette from Lyon in the summer - has broken the club's transfer record twice in successive windows? ""In the current climate, if you can get someone of his quality, that's not bad value,"" said former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright. ""Obviously the proof is in the pudding. Once he starts to get his feet in the Premier League, hopefully he will score the goals Arsenal desperately need at the moment. ""He's got to be excited about what's going on. There shouldn't be a shortage of ammunition."" German football expert Raphael Honigstein added: ""Aubameyang is somebody who will definitely add goals for Arsenal, but I don't know if individually he will lift the team to another level. He's not that kind of player. ""He definitely brings pace, finishing and movement. I think he's been criminally overlooked by some of the bigger clubs who might have wanted a more orthodox number nine."" The majority of tweets referencing Aubameyang's move came from Europe, and London in particular, though the map below shows there was plenty of activity in Nigeria and Thailand. Having broken their transfer record to sign Aubameyang, the Gunners secured perhaps one of the most important deals of the window later on deadline day when playmaker Ozil agreed a new three-and-a-half-year contract. The German, 29, was due to be out of contract in the summer and could have left for free, before signing a new deal worth about Â£350,000 a week before tax. Transfer deadline day is becoming a lonely place for Mahrez. The Leicester winger has a long-standing desire to join a bigger club, and spent the 31 August deadline in a Paris airport waiting for a deal that never materialised. He asked to leave the Foxes last May, and Italian club Roma had three bids rejected, opting not to increase their offer with Mahrez having stayed behind from international duty in the hope of completing a move. On Wednesday, 24 hours after handing in a transfer request, the 2016 PFA Players' Player of the Year learned Manchester City were walking away from a deal after refusing to spend more than Â£60m on him. So Mahrez remains a Leicester player, but did not travel with Claude Puel's side for their defeat at Everton on Wednesday. Manchester City baulked at the Â£95m package Leicester wanted for the 26-year-old. The Premier League leaders have spent Â£272m on new players this season, and Â£418m since manager Pep Guardiola's arrival in summer 2016. ""Maybe in the future we are able to buy one player for Â£100m or something like that,"" said Guardiola. ""Maybe it is going to happen. But if it happens it will be for a special, special player. At the moment we cannot afford that."" Premier League clubs' spending far outweighed that of their European counterparts, despite La Liga side Barcelona paying the biggest fee of the January window when they bought Brazil playmakerPhilippe Coutinho from Liverpoolin a deal that could be worth Â£142m.

May to hold talks with Chinese president,"Theresa May has agreed a joint trade and investment review with China as the first step towards an ""ambitious"" post-Brexit deal, Downing Street said. The prime minister said ""we will be free to strike our own trade deals"" after leaving the EU, following talks with China's President Xi Jinping. Mr Xi said China's markets would be further opened to the UK, including in beef, dairy and other food products. Mrs May said Â£9bn in business deals would be signed on her three-day trip. There was no specific discussion of a particular model for a trade deal between the two countries after Brexit during the two leaders' 80 minute meeting, Downing Street said. But the point of the review agreed by the two countries was to look at what model could work best, a spokesman said. Mrs May and Mr Xi also discussed their shared determination to end illegal nuclear activity by North Korea and agreed that denuclearisation was the objective, Downing Street said. May to fight post-Brexit residency move I'm not a quitter, says Theresa May as China visit begins China thrilled over 'Auntie May' visit In the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong, they restated their commitment to the ""One Country, Two Systems"" arrangement in place since the former colony was handed back by the UK to China in 1997. Stressing that he was looking forward to building on the success of the UK-China relationship, Mr Xi quoted Shakespeare, saying: ""What's past is prologue."" Mrs May ""pointed to the joint trade and investment review which will now take place as the first step towards delivering ambitious future trade arrangements"", Downing Street said. The two leaders also agreed to hold more talks on China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative at their meeting, which was also attended by the UK's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Mrs May and Mr Xi agreed the importance of having frank conversations in areas where the two countries do not see eye-to-eye, Downing Street said in a statement. Talks between the two leaders were followed by a traditional Chinese tea ceremony for Mrs May and husband Philip, hosted by President Xi and China's First Lady Madame Peng and a dinner at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. The UK prime minister is in China at the head of a 50-strong business delegation. Theresa May outside the British Embassy in Beijing Mrs May is understood to have raised environmental issues with Mr Xi - and she presented him with a box-set of the BBC's Blue Planet II series, with a personal message from presenter Sir David Attenborough. The show examined the effect of human behaviour on the environment and was referenced by Mrs May last month when she pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042as part of a 25-year green strategy. On the first day of her trip the prime minister announced a UK-China effort to strengthen international action against the illegal trade in ivory. UK-China trade is currently worth a Â£59bn a year. One of the UK companies travelling with the PM, health-tech firm Medopad, has said it signed more than Â£100m of commercial projects and partnerships with organisations including China Resources, GSK China, Peking University and Lenovo. By Laura Kuenssberg, political editor International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is in China and wants his restive colleagues at home to focus on the big picture. Listing the number of deals that have been done already this week during the prime minister's visit he told me that building levels of trade with China is a real ""success story"". No 10 is confident that by the end of this marathon trip well over Â£9bn of new contracts will have been secured - such a high profile political investment edging deals over the line.

Bafta stars 'to wear black' over harassment,"Penelope Cruz, Mariah Carey and Clare Foy were among celebrities who wore black at the Golden Globes Britain's biggest stars are expected to wear black on the red carpet at this year's Bafta Film awards. The choice of attire is in support of the Time's Up initiative, the movement against sexual harassment founded by several Hollywood figures. A letter circulated around the British film and TV industry invited those attending the Baftas to take part. It follows a similar demonstration of support at the Golden Globe Awards earlier this year. The request has already gathered support from UK stars expected to attend the awards and other industry figures. The list is understood to include Emma Thompson, Daisy Ridley, Emma Watson, Gemma Arterton, Keira Knightley, Jodie Whittaker, Emilia Clarke, Noma Dumezweni, Natalie Dormer and Felicity Jones. The letter urged guests ""to wear black to the awards ceremony, to follow suit from our sisters who attended the Golden Globes"". It invited men attending the Baftas who wish to show their support for the Time's Up movement to wear ""special pins and/or a button hole"". The female industry figures behind the initiative continued: ""More than half of all women and nearly two-thirds of women [in the UK] aged 18 to 24 have experienced sexual harassment at work. ""We hope that those of us privileged enough to have a platform can use it to raise awareness of the experiences of women beyond our industry, whose experiences are often silenced and marginalized."" Joanna Lumley is the presenter of this year's award ceremony. It will be the first time in over a decade that the Baftas have been hosted by a woman. The event will take place at the Royal Albert Hall on 18 February.

Kuenssberg: Fox warns restive MPs,"International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is in China and wants his restive colleagues at home to focus on the big picture. Listing the number of deals that have been done already this weekduring the prime minister's visit he told me that building levels of trade with China is a real ""success story"". No 10 is confident that by the end of this marathon trip well over Â£9bn of new contracts will have been secured - such a high profile political investment edging deals over the line. Mr Fox accepts it will take some to get trade deals done in the longer term. The UK will be limited not just before Brexit, but also during the transition period, in how much can get done. But for him this is a vital time, working to dismantle existing barriers to doing business and preparing for bigger deals, whether ""gold standard"", or not, that can be concluded over time. And while to some ears, it might sound ironic for a senior Tory politician to be making such a request, he suggested that Britain needed to get over its obsession with Europe. And as for hisbickering colleagues, they needed to get over their focus on what's happening in Westminster. Dr Fox told me: ""I sometimes wish that first of all people could see the prime minister the way that she's seen in other countries in terms of the vision that she's put forward for Britain. ""Secondly I wish they could see Britain in the way that the rest of the world sees us and not the some of the internal commentators in the UK."" Many Tory MPs would agree with Dr Fox that focusing on internal manoeuvres hinders the Tory cause. But it is almost impossible for a politician to create completely different personas at home and abroad. That's not withstanding the Chinese state TV reporting that theprime minister is supposedly becoming affectionately known as Auntie May. Whether it's Beijing, Brussels or back home, it's hard for Theresa May to hide from the doubts.

What now for EU citizens in UK?,"The rights of the three million EU citizens living in the UK and the million Britons living in the EU will be protected post-Brexit, according to the latest deal between the UK government and the EU. Ajoint document,externalsaid both EU Citizens and UK nationals can continue ""to live, work or study as they currently do under the same conditions as under Union law"". The report confirms that EU and UK citizens have free movement of rights until the day the UK withdraws from the EU - 29 March 2019. This, in effect, is the cut-off date for EU citizens moving to the UK. Anyone who arrives before Brexit day will have the right to stay. Those who are yet to be granted permanent residency in the UK will have their rights protected, so they  can still acquire it after withdrawal. LIVE: Latest updates from Brussels Full text of the EU-UK statement,external The latest deal also includes reunification rights for relatives who do not live in the UK, to join them in the future. These rights extend to future spouses or partners of EU citizens. Those EU citizens living in the UK will have their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts, though the European Court of Justice will have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights for eight years after the withdrawal day. EU citizens in the UK will have equal access to social security, health care, education and employment. But they - and UK citizens in the EU - would lose their rights to residency if they are out of the country for five or more years. This video can not be played Olga Garcia, who is Spanish, reacts to the Brexit agreement to protect EU citizens living in Britain The process for giving EU citizens residency rights in the UK will be under a new procedure, referred to as ""settled status"". The document has sought to make assurances that the administrative process ""will be transparent, smooth and streamlined"". The cost of the process is more unclear, with reports stating it will be ""free of charge"" or ""for a charge not exceeding that imposed on nationals for the issuing of similar"". Criminal background checks can be carried out ""on all applicants"", but the report adds the process should have a ""proportionate approach"". Those who already have residency rights in the UK will have their document ""converted"" free of charge, but will be subject to identity, criminality and security checks. Nicolas Hatton, chairman of the3million, a campaign group representing EU citizens living in the UK, expressed concerns about the deal. He said: ""Our rights should not have an expiry date. ""More worryingly, there is still no clarity around the registration criteria for these rights. There are a huge number of people still in the dark about whether they will qualify or not."" ""Hundreds and thousands of them might get a letter that they have to go"" he added. UK citizens who move elsewhere in the EU before Brexit day will have the right to stay in that country. However after the UK withdraws, the freedom of movement principles will not be the same for UK citizens living in the EU as EU citizens living in Britain. As Jon Worth,a UK citizen living in Germany,external, said: ""I can still go and take a day trip to (Poland), or go on holiday to (Italy) unrestricted, after Brexit day. ""But I could not move to live in Italy or Poland without restriction."" So for people like Mr Worth, the only way to keep this freedom of movement would be to apply for a passport in the European country they are currently residing in. British in Europe, a group which represents UK citizens in the EU, said both sides had ""negotiated away"" their rights. Jane Golding, chair woman of the group, said the deal was ""a double disaster"" for Britons in the EU. She said it was unclear whether automatic residency rights would be upheld and that many people who work across Europe rely on free movement. Issues that affect UK citizens in EU member states, like whether their rights are protected if they move to another member state after the withdrawal date or their ability to work cross-border in the EU, have been deferred to the second round of negotiations.

FBI warns against Republican memo release,"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation The FBI has questioned moves to release a secret memo said to accuse it of abusing surveillance powers to target Donald Trump's presidential campaign. ""We have grave concerns about the material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy,"" the agency said. There are suggestions the Congressional memo may be published on Thursday. Democrats fear the document may be an attempt to discredit the inquiry into Trump campaign links to Russia. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff accused his Republican counterparts of altering the text of the document after it was voted on. He said it should be withdrawn and reviewed again prior to any possible public release. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading the investigation into alleged Russian meddling and possible obstruction of justice by members of the Trump administration. The White House has to approve the memo's release but its chief of staff, John Kelly, told Fox News Radio it would be ""released here pretty quick"" for the ""whole world"" to see. The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington All you need to know about Trump Russia story The four-page document was compiled by staffers for House Intelligence Committee (HIE) head Devin Nunes, a member of Mr Trump's Republican party. Staff of Republican Devin Nunes wrote the secret memo It apparently accuses the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) of abusing a surveillance programme known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) during the 2016 presidential election campaign. The allegation is that the FBI ran surveillance on a member of Mr Trump's campaign. According to lawmakers who saw the memo, it says the FBI obtained a warrant to spy on the campaign aide on the basis of unproven accusations against Mr Trump known as the ""Russian dossier"". That dossier was compiled by former UK intelligence agent Christopher Steele with money financed in part from Hillary Clinton's campaign. The HIE voted to release the memo on Monday and Mr Trump has until the weekend to decide whether to clear it for public release. Following his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, Mr Trump was heard telling a Republican lawmaker he was ""100%"" for releasing the document. As of Wednesday however, he had still not read the memo, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. Mr Kelly said Mr Trump wanted ""everything out so the American people can make up their own minds and if there's people to be held accountable, then so be it"". Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words In a rare statement, the agency said it had had ""limited opportunity"" to review the document,externalbefore the HIE voted to release it on Monday. ""We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the Fisa process,"" the FBI statement added. The US Department of Justice has said it would be ""extraordinarily reckless"" to release the memo. Trump officials say the memo proves his allegation that he has been treated unfairly by the FBI. Devin Nunes, who served on the Trump team during his White House transition, said it was ""no surprise"" the FBI had objected to the memo's release. Mr Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller to lead the Russia inquiry ""Having stonewalled Congress' demands for information for nearly a year, it's no surprise to see the FBI and DoJ issue spurious objections to allowing the American people to see information related to surveillance abuses at these agencies,"" he said. After firing FBI director James Comey last year, Mr Trump reportedly asked his temporary replacement, Andrew McCabe, how he had voted in the 2016 presidential election. Mr McCabe resigned last month as Mr Trump accused him of pro-Democratic bias. He had been planning to retire in March. In December, Mr Trump reportedly challenged Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mr Mueller, over his loyalties. He wanted to know whether Mr Rosenstein was ""on my team"", CNN reports.,external Democrats on the HIE accused Republicans of having secretly altered the memo before giving it to the White House.

Mr Schiff said that releasing the memo increased ""the risk of a constitutional crisis by setting the stage for subsequent actions by the White House to fire Mueller or, as now seems more likely, Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein"". Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who serves on the Senate Intelligence committee, said the Republicans were clearly trying to ""undermine the special counsel's investigation"". ""There's no excuse for playing politics with highly classified information,"" she added. A counter-memo drafted by Democrats was blocked by Republicans.

Osborne urges action on north-south divide,"The former chancellor, George Osborne, has urged the prime minister to focus on poor education attainment in the north to boost British growth. Mr Osborne said that the project he launched whilst he was still at the Treasury - the Northern Powerhouse - was still vital for the economy. Concerns arose in 2017 that the project had been sidelined by Theresa May. His comments come as a new report says there is a major education divide between the north and the south. The study by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership says pupils in the North of England are on average one GCSE grade behind comparable pupils in the south. It also reveals that one quarter of secondary schools in the north are judged by Ofsted to be inadequate or in need of improvement. A lack of skills training is also holding back the region's economy, the report argues. MPs launch Northern Powerhouse campaign Northern schools 'need urgent attention' What is the Northern Powerhouse? ""In the work we have done consulting with businesses in the north, poor skills and inadequate training come across consistently as the major issues,"" Mr Osborne said in a foreword to the report by the Partnership, of which he is a board member. ""Too many children in the north aren't getting the education they need or deserve."" The report demands Â£300m in new funding for disadvantaged areas; reform of the Pupil Premium funding mechanism for children from low income families; a new Northern Powerhouse Schools Improvement Board and a commitment from local firms to provide 900,000 young people with ""meaningful"" work experience. ""I urge the government to play its part in implementing it,"" Mr Osborne said. Mr Osborne, who is also the editor of the Evening Standard in London, has rarely spoken in public after he was sacked by Theresa May following the Brexit referendum. There is known to be tension between the prime minister and him and it was reported earlier this year that Number 10 had ""snubbed"" the former chancellor by not offering him a peerage. Mr Osborne has regularly used the pages of the Standard to attack the Prime Minister over her approach to the Brexit negotiations. The Northern Powerhouse aims to encourage growth outside London and South East England The government says it is fully focused on the Northern Powerhouse and recently appointed Jake Berry, the MP for Rossendale and Darwen, as the ""Powerhouse Minister"". Mr Berry told the BBC that supporting the north was a long term project and that powers had been devolved to local mayors and money was being spent on schools and new transport links. Lord O'Neill of Gatley, the former Treasury minister who was instrumental in setting up the Northern Powerhouse with Mr Osborne, told the BBC that although the Northern Powerhouse had dropped out of the ""top five"" government priorities, there did appear to be a fresh focus on the project. ""It's not as big,"" he admitted when I asked him if Theresa May placed as much emphasis on the Powerhouse as Mr Osborne had done. ""What I would say more encouragingly, it seems pretty clear to me that attention on the Northern Powerhouse has increased. ""If you go right back to the prime minister's first speech on the Downing Street steps it is very clear that she's sympathetic to the whole goal of doing something like the Northern Powerhouse."" Lord O'Neill said that supporting the economy in the north was important for the whole of Britain. ""For the past couple of years the north west part of the Powerhouse has been outperforming the whole country and that outperformance is accelerating. ""If you look at the past 20 years around the world, over 60% of all economic growth is being driven by bigger urban places and the UK only has one in the world's top 50 - London. ""London is a huge contributor financially to the rest of the country - it's not really ultimately that good for London or the rest of the country if they're dependent on handouts from London. ""If you have your own local engine that is economically as powerful as London, you know it's a game changer for the nation.""

Brexit transition not a deferral - Davis,"This video can not be played David Davis v Jacob Rees-Mogg on Brexit transition David Davis insists the transition period after the UK leaves the EU is not a ""deferral"" of Brexit, even though the UK will follow Brussels' rules. He rejected claims by Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg it would be ""more honest"" to say the UK was effectively staying in the EU for two years after Brexit day. The Brexit Secretary confirmed the UK would be subject to European Court of Justice rulings during the transition. But he said it would be free to strike trade deals with other countries. This was something it was not allowed to do while still a member of the EU, he told a committee of MPs. The UK will officially leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but will continue to allow free movement of people, goods and money for about two years to allow businesses to adjust. The EU is seeking to tighten the conditions which will apply to the UK during the transitional period, according a draft of revised EU guidelines. It would further restrict the UK's freedom to determine its own rules on immigration, trade and fishing and see full freedom of movement extended until the start of 2021. EU 'tightens terms of Brexit transition' Why are there no Brexit talks? UK growth upgrade could 'dwarf' Brexit hit Mr Rees-Mogg said the UK would be a ""vassal state"" of the EU - subject to its rules without any say over how they are made. Mr Davis said that would be the case if that arrangement continued ""in perpetuity"" but he insisted that would not happen, telling the Commons Brexit committee: ""No vassal state, us"". He told the MPs: ""I don't want the country to be sucked into something that is not an implementation period but an extension."" But he also said he expected a clash with some EU nations over whether the UK will be able to seek its own trade deals during the transition period. ""Firstly, we will not be members of the union. We will be replicating to a very large extent the operations of the single market and customs union in order to make sure there is a single change, from the point of view of businesses in particular,"" he said. ""We will not be subject to the duty of sincere co-operation, which is what stops us arriving at trade deals now [and] negotiating and signing trade deals now. So that freedom will exist."" But he added: ""There may be an argument over the issue of doing outside negotiations. There may well be an argument over that."" The UK's approach was one that ""visibly does no harm to the European Union"" but ""there are people within the union who want to restrict any advantage for us"", he added. Mr Davis said he expected to reach a deal on a transition period by March - and he wanted it to last between 21 and 27 months after Brexit day. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said the transition should end after 19 months, in December 2020. Mr Davis said it was not a deal breaker that EU wanted a shorter transition period but he thought two years was ""about right"" for the UK. He also hit back at theCBI's call for the UK to stay in the EU customs union, a view he had shared before becoming Brexit secretary, saying business groups were being ""small-C conservative"" about Brexit. He said they were focused on trying to protect their existing members without thinking enough about ""future trade"", adding that the companies that will benefit from new markets opened up by Brexit ""don't even exist"" yet.

Mosque suspect's defence 'conjured up'Prosecutors question Darren Osborne's claim that a man called Dave drove a van into worshippers in June.4h4 hours agoUK,"A man accused of driving a van into a group of people outside a London mosque in June ""conjured up a defence out of thin air"", prosecutors have said. Darren Osborne had intended to kill as many Muslims as possible, said Jonathan Rees QC in his closing statement. Mr Osborne, 48, who denies murder and attempted murder, says a friend called Dave was driving the van when it hit people in Finsbury Park, killing one. But Mr Rees said Dave's participation was ""plainly fabricated"". ""You know why he is lying, because despite all of his talk, the defendant doesn't have the courage of his convictions. He has sought to blame someone whose involvement he's invented,"" he told Woolwich Crown Court. Mr Rees said Mr Osborne's two contradictory statements during his trial told the jurors ""everything you need to know about the defendant's approach to these proceedings"". He urged jurors not to allow Mr Osborne to ""pull the wool over your eyes"", adding the defendant's motivation had been ""a warped hatred of all Muslims with its roots in material he had watched on TV and online"". ""His chosen weapon was a large van, capable of inflicting fatal injuries if driven into a crowd of pedestrians."" Earlier, Mr Rees challenged the defendant to explain why Dave had not been seen on CCTV getting out of the van after the collision, in which nine people were also injured. Mr Osborne said: ""He's like Dynamo, an illusion. An illusionist. He can make himself vanish perhaps. I don't know."" And he insisted that Dave had not been made up. Mr Osborne denies the murder of Makram Ali, 51, and the attempted murder of ""persons at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Whadcoat Street, London"".

Police Tasered man with mental age of 7He was also charged with assaulting an officer but the case collapsed when CCTV of the incident emerged.6h6 hours agoBristol,"This video can not be played Max, now 28, has a mental age of seven and also has autism A disabled man was Tasered by police and charged with assaulting an officer in a case that collapsed when his mother discovered CCTV of the incident. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the footage showed ""rather different"" events to those claimed by Avon and Somerset Police. The police watchdog said failure to gather the CCTV ""fell below standard"" but there was no wrongdoing. Avon and Somerset Police has issued a partial apology over the case. But the police force said the incident had been subject to a ""detailed and robust investigation"" by the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) and there was no case to answer for misconduct. Police statements said Max stepped ""towards them and pushed"" a PC Officers were called to The Laurels, a supported housing unit for vulnerable adults in Bristol, in August 2015 after reports of a cracked window. Max, who has the mental age of a seven-year-old and whose name has been changed, had been drinking. The audio recording of the radio call between the control room and the officers revealed they were told Max had ""smashed a window at the location causing a bit of a disturbance, apparently he's intoxicated"". A transcript of a 999 call to police at the time, released on Wednesday, said ""we don't feel safe, some of the clients don't feel safe and are vulnerable here, so it's best probably take him off the premises as soon as possible"". The IOPC report references a radio call where the operator advises officers that there was a marker for violence on Max's record. However, statements from officers reveal they were unable to hear this information before he was Tasered as Max was talking to them ""in close proximity"". The 28-year-old was arrested and charged with assaulting an officer after police said he pushed them. Police statements said a bare-chested Max, who also has autism, stepped towards them and pushed a PC ""double-handed in the chest with open palms"" and the officer ""stumbled back two foot"" before the Taser was used. The officers said they were in danger and did not know if he was carrying a weapon. Staff later said the ""damage was caused accidentally"" and those at the housing said they did not want to press charges. 12 August 2015: Police are called to a disturbance at The Laurels in St Pauls. They arrest and use a Taser on Max, then aged 24 November 2015: Trial at Bristol Magistrates' Court collapses after defence lawyers provide CCTV of the alleged assault to prosecutors Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy writes to Avon and Somerset's Police and Crime Commissioner who orders an investigation into the case Superintendent Pete Warren reports back Max's mother takes case to IOPC, then called the IPCC 6 October 2017: IOPC finds no evidence of misconduct The case at Bristol Magistrates' Court collapsed in November 2015 when Max's mother, Margaret secured CCTV footage and handed it to the defence. The CPS prosecutor that day, Kevin Withey, said the footage ""shows an incident rather different to that described in the statements of the PCs"". The case was investigated after calls by MP Kerry McCarthy and Avon and Somerset's Police and Crime Commissioner but the force backed its officers, saying one had been kicked and they were unaware of Max's learning difficulties. A further investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, now the IOPC, found ""inaccuracies"" in the officers' accounts but did not find evidence of any misconduct. It recommended further disability awareness training for officers. Max's mother Margaret feared her son would go to prison Margaret is now urging the force to review its use of Tasers. ""If Max had been found guilty on the basis of their evidence, he would have been sent to prison,"" she said. The IOPC said that although the actions of the officer who failed to gather the CCTV evidence ""fell below the standard expected"", they did not amount to misconduct. Supt Richard Corrigan, from the force, said the decision to arrest Max ""was necessary"" and the IOPC report stated the arrest and use of Taser were reasonable. ""I am very happy to acknowledge the failures and to extend an apology to the family over two elements,"" he said. ""This is the failure in relation to the letter that was submitted to the police and crime commissioner which contained information that wasn't accurate. ""The second element was our absolute responsibility to secure the CCTV, which wasn't secured."" He added: ""The IOPC identified a performance issue relating to a separate officer in relation to securing and preserving of CCTV evidence in connection with this case and a management plan was put in place to address this issue. ""Unfortunately, inaccurate information about the assault on an officer was initially given to the police and crime commissioner. The IOPC concluded this mistake had no influence on the way we dealt with this case, but we'd like to apologise for the error."" The force now has a ""dedicated lead for autism"" and all new officers and civilian investigators undergo training covering ""autism spectrum conditions and other non-visible disabilities"".

"PM rejects lord's lateness resignationLord Bates told fellow peers he intended to resign after the ""discourtesy"" of arriving late to a session.11m12 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Minister Lord Bates 'quits' for being late to debate The prime minister has refused to accept the resignation of a lord who offered to leave his post after being late to the chamber. Lord Bates stunned colleagues in the House of Lords by stating his intention to resign after the ""discourtesy"" of arriving late to a session. A spokesman for Number 10 said the resignation was ""unnecessary"" and he had decided to continue in his role. Lord Bates could not immediately be contacted for comment. The international development minister and former Conservative MP should have answered the first oral question of the session which began at 15:00 GMT on Wednesday. A spokesman for the prime minister said: ""With typical sincerity, Lord Bates today offered to tender his resignation, but his resignation was refused as it was judged this was unnecessary. ""As a hard-working and diligent minister, it is typical of his approach that he takes his responsibilities to Parliament so seriously. ""He has received support from across the House and we are pleased he has decided to continue in his important roles at the Department for International Development and HM Treasury."" Lord Bates, speaking to the Lords at the end of the questions session, described himself as ""ashamed"" to not have been in his place to answer a question from Labour's Baroness Lister. ""It's been my privilege to answer questions from this despatch box on behalf of the government,"" he told peers. ""I've always believed we should rise to the highest possible standards of courtesy and respect in responding on behalf of the government to the legitimate questions of the legislature. ""I'm thoroughly ashamed of not being in my place and therefore I shall be offering my resignation to the prime minister with immediate effect."" He then walked out of the chamber despite colleagues urging him to stay.
