Philip's funeral 'opportunity' to end royal 'rifts',"This video can not be played Sir John Major: ""I hope it's possible to mend any rifts"" Shared grief over the death of the Duke of Edinburgh is an ""ideal opportunity"" to mend any rifts within the Royal Family, ex-PM Sir John Major has said. Sir John, who was guardian to Princes William and Harry following their mother's death, said he hoped it would end any ""friction"" between the pair. He also said the Queen needed time to grieve for her husband. His comments came as the Archbishop of Canterbury paid tribute to the duke in a remembrance service. The Queen has described the death of her husbandas ""having left a huge void in her life"", the Duke of York has said. Special service to remember Prince Philip Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh During aservice at Canterbury Cathedralearlier, which was also streamed online, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said that ""for the Royal Family, as for every other, no words can reach into the depth of sorrow that goes into bereavement"". The archbishop is also expected to lead the duke's funeral on Saturday, which Princes William and Harry are both due to attend. The Duke of Sussex will fly from the US for the service, though it is not clear when. His wife the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors. Members of the Royal Familywill walk behind the coffin,externalahead of the funeral at Windsor Castle. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, has suggested that coming together for Philip's funeral could help to heal any tensions. Sir John, who was appointed a special guardian to the princes after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, died in 1997, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""The friction that we are told has arisen is a friction better ended as speedily as possible."" He added: ""They shared emotion. They share grief at the present time because of the death of their grandfather. I think [this] is an ideal opportunity. ""I hope very much that it is possible to mend any rifts that may exist."" Harry and Meghan, who have stepped back from frontline royal duties, gave an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month. In it, Harry said of his older brother: ""The relationship is 'space' at the moment. And time heals all things, hopefully."" Sir John also told Andrew Marr the Duke of Edinburgh would ""still be there in [the Queen's] memory"" and that she would ""hear his voice"". Being head of state was a ""lonely position in many ways"" for the Queen, and the duke was ""the person to whom she could unburden herself"", he added. A period of national mourning will end after 17 April, when Prince Philip's funeral takes place at Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel. A national minute's silence will be held to coincide with the start of the service at 15:00 BST. Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday, aged 99. In an interview at a service in Windsor, Prince Andrew said he loved his father, who was ""always somebody you could go to"" - and that his death was a ""terrible loss"". He added: ""We've lost the grandfather of the nation."" Members of the public have continued laying flowers outside the castle, although the new government guidance asks the public to refrain from doing so and give to charity instead. A spokesman for Windsor Great Park said on Saturday that tributes would be removed ""respectfully"" and displayed within the castle grounds. Royal household staff were photographed on Sunday placing bouquets on the ground outside St George's Chapel.

Nomadland takes top honours at Bafta Film Awards,"Nomadland star Frances McDormand (left) and director Chloe Zhao Nomadland, a drama about a woman who lives in a van in the American West after the financial crash, has taken top honours at the Bafta Film Awards. It scooped four prizes including best film, best actress for its star Frances McDormand and best director. That made Chloe Zhao only the second woman to win best director in the 53 years of the category's history. Meanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins won best actor for The Father, 27 years after his last competitive Bafta win. Olivia Colman stars with Sir Anthony Hopkins in The Father The 83-year-old, who won for playing a man losing his grip on reality, is the oldest ever winner of the award. But he was not watching Sunday's ceremony and later said he only found out he'd won when he heard cheering from the next room. ""I was sitting here painting, and I heard this cheer go off next door,"" he said after the ceremony. ""I thought, what the hell's happened? I thought they were watching a football match. And they came in and said I'd won."" Best film - Nomadland Best British film - Promising Young Woman Best actress - Frances McDormand, Nomadland Best actor - Sir Anthony Hopkins, The Father Best supporting actress - Yuh-Jung Youn, Minari Best supporting actor - Daniel Kaluuya, Judas and the Black Messiah Best director - Chloe Zhao, Nomadland The winners and nominees in full Five takeaways from this year's Baftas Red carpet in pictures Most winners were watching live and delivered acceptance speeches remotely, with none of the nominees at the Royal Albert Hall in person. Zhao, who was born in China and is based in the US, referred to her education in the UK when she told the ceremony: ""I think I just made my teacher at Brighton College very proud."" Her win comes 11 years after Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win best director for The Hurt Locker, and Zhao's victory means she is the first woman of colour to pick up the prize. Nomadland will be released in the UK on Disney+ on 30 April. South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn won best supporting actress British star Daniel Kaluuya was named best supporting actor for playing Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. The supporting actress trophy went to South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn for playing a grandmother in Korean-American drama Minari. Giving her speech in broken English, the 73-year-old said the award meant a lot because Brits were ""snobbish"" people. ""Every award is meaningful, but this one especially recognised by British people, known as very snobbish people, and they approved me as a good actor so I'm very, very privileged,"" she said. Emerald Fennell said the reception for Promising Young Woman had been ""completely incredible"" The prize for best British film went to Promising Young Woman, a revenge thriller about a woman, played by Carey Mulligan, who pretends to be blind drunk when men pick her up in bars and clubs. Its writer and director Emerald Fennell also won best original screenplay. She joked that everyone involved in the film had made it for ""a packet of crisps"", and said the experience was ""the greatest thing in my life"". Fennell is best known to viewers for her acting as Patsy in BBC drama Call the Midwife and for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles in Netflix's The Crown. Other Bafta winners included Bukky Bakray. The 18-year-old was named rising star following her first ever acting role in Rocks, in which she played a teenage schoolgirl abandoned by her mother. The low-budget film, set in east London, was the joint highest nominee along with Nomadland, with seven nominations each. Rocks also won the casting award for finding its group of largely novice young stars. Many of the young stars of Rocks, which won best casting, had not acted before Other films to win two prizes included Disney/Pixar's animated hit Soul; Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, adapted from August Wilson's play about a 1920s blues band; and Sound of Metal, which stars Riz Ahmed as a rock drummer who loses his hearing. This year's shortlists includeda diverse line-up of talent, following an outcry last year when voters only nominated white actors. This time 16 of the 24 acting contenders came from minority ethnic backgrounds, while 21 were first-time nominees.

Co-host Edith Bowman said Prince Philip ""occupies a very special place in Bafta's history, and our thoughts are with the Royal Family"". Edith Bowman and Dermot O'Leary hosted Sunday's ceremony The Duke of Cambridge had been due to appear in a pre-recorded segment, but pulled out following the death of his grandfather. This year's Baftas were delayed by two months because of the pandemic, and come two weeks before the awards season reaches its climax with the Academy Awards. Unlike the Baftas, Oscars organisers want nominees to appear in person and will have a London venue for the first time for UK-based contenders.

'Terrorist act' at Iranian nuclear facility,"Natanz is an uranium enrichment facility about 250km south of the Iranian capital Tehran A nuclear facility in Iran was hit by ""sabotage"" a day after it unveiled new uranium enrichment equipment, the country's top nuclear official says. Ali Akbar Salehi did not say who was to blame for the ""terrorist act"", which caused a power failure at the Natanz complex south of Tehran on Sunday. Israeli public media, however, cited intelligence sources who said it was the result of an Israeli cyber-attack. Israel has not commented on the incident directly. But in recent days it has ramped up its warnings about Iran's nuclear programme. The latest incident comes as diplomatic efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal - abandoned by the US under the Trump administration in 2018 - have resumed. Why Iran's nuclear facilities are still vulnerable to attack Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? Iran's nuclear crisis in 300 words On Saturday, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated new centrifuges at the Natanz site in a ceremony that was broadcast live on television. Centrifuges are devices needed to produce enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel as well as nuclear weapons. It represented another breach of the country's undertakings in the 2015 deal, which only permits Iran to produce and store limited quantities of enriched uranium to be used to produce fuel for commercial power plants. On Sunday, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI), Behrouz Kamalvandi, said an ""incident"" had occurred in the morning involving the nuclear facility's power network. Mr Kamalvandi did not provide further details but told Iran's Fars news agency there there had been ""no casualties or leaks"". Later state TV read out a statement by AEOI head Ali Akbar Salehi, in which he described the incident as ""sabotage"" and ""nuclear terrorism"". ""Condemning this despicable move, the Islamic Republic of Iran emphasises the need for the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to deal with this nuclear terrorism,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Iran reserves the right to take action against the perpetrators,"" he added. The IAEA said it was aware of the reports of an incident but would not comment. Last July,sabotage was blamed for a fire at the Natanz sitewhich hit a central centrifuge assembly workshop. World powers don't trust Iran:Some countries believe Iran wants nuclear power because it wants to build a nuclear bomb - it denies this. So a deal was struck:In 2015, Iran and six other countries reached a major agreement. Iran would stop some nuclear work in return for an end to harsh penalties, or sanctions, hurting its economy. What is the problem now?Iran re-started banned nuclear work after former US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. Even though new leader Joe Biden wants to rejoin, both sides say the other must make the first move. Israeli public broadcaster Kan, citing unnamed intelligence sources, said the apparent power cut at the facility was caused by an Israeli cyber operation. The Haaretz newspaper also said the incident could be assumed to be an Israeli cyber-attack. Ron Ben-Yishai, a defence analyst at the Ynet news website, said that with Iran progressing towards nuclear weapons capability it was ""reasonable to assume that the problem... might not have been caused by an accident, but by deliberate sabotage intended to slow the nuclear race accelerated by the negotiations with the US on removing sanctions"". Later on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""the struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission"". ""The situation that exists today will not necessarily be the situation that will exist tomorrow,"" he added, without referencing the Iran incident directly. This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? The Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has been in intensive care since Donald Trump pulled the US out of it. Under the Biden administration diplomatic efforts have been redoubled to revive it. But Mr Netanyahu has warned against a return to the deal, and declared last week that Israel would not be bound by a new agreement with Tehran. The nuclear deal only allows Iran to produce and store limited quantities of uranium enriched up to 3.67% concentration. Uranium enriched to 90% or more can be used to make nuclear weapons. Mr Trump said the accord was based on ""a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy programme"" and reinstated crippling economic sanctions in an attempt to compel Iran to negotiate a replacement. Iran, which insists it does not want nuclear weapons, refused to do so and retaliated by rolling back a number of key commitments under the accord. It has since accelerated the breaches in an attempt to increase pressure on the US. They have included operating advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, resuming enrichment to 20% concentration of the most fissile U-235 isotope, and building a stockpile of that material. US joins talks aimed at reviving Iran nuclear deal Iran in biggest breach of nuclear deal to date Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Japan's Matsuyama wins historic Masters,"This video can not be played The moment Hideki Matsuyama becomes first Japanese men's major winner Masters final leaderboard -10H Matsuyama (Jpn);-9W Zalatoris (US);-7J Spieth (US), X Schauffele (US);-6J Rahm (Spa), M Leishman (Aus);-5J Rose (Eng);-4P Reed (US), C Conners (Can) Selected others: -2R MacIntyre (Sco);-1T Hatton (Eng);LevelS Lowry (Ire);+1P Casey (Eng), I Poulter (Eng);+2M Fitzpatrick (Eng), M Wallace (Eng);+5B DeChambeau (US) Hideki Matsuyama held off the field to win the Masters by one stroke at Augusta National and become the first Japanese man to claim a major title. Matsuyama had a four-shot lead heading into the final day and, despite some nervy moments on Sunday, shot a one-over 73 to win on 10 under par. American debutant Will Zalatoris was his closest challenger on nine under. England's Justin Rose, who led for two rounds, faded in the final 18 holes with a two-over 74 to end five under. Xander Schauffele, playing with Matsuyama, birdied the 15th to close to within two shots, but hit his tee shot in the water on the 16th as his challenge finished with a triple-bogey six. He ended on seven under in a share of third with fellow American and 2015 champion Jordan Spieth. Spanish world number three Jon Rahm posted a final-day 66 to come in a further stroke back, alongside Australia's Marc Leishman. Scotland's Robert MacIntyre impressed on his debut and finished joint 12th at two under to secure his place at next year's Masters. This video can not be played Masters winner Hideki Matsuyama receives his Green Jacket in Butler Cabin A decade since Matsuyama was awarded the Silver Cup as the leading amateur at the 2011 Masters, the 29-year-old returned to record a victory that will resonate hugely in his home nation. Japan has boasted major champions in 1977 LGPA Championship winner Hisako Higuchi and Hinako Shibuno, who won the Women's Open two years ago, but the closest a male player had previously come to golf's most sought-after prizes was Isao Aoki with a runner-up finish at the 1980 US Open. ""I am really happy. My nerves really didn't start on the back nine, it was right from the start and right until the very last putt,"" said Matsuyama. ""I was thinking about them [friends and family] all the way around. I am really happy I played well for them. Hopefully I will be a pioneer and many other Japanese players will follow and I am glad to open the floodgates."" The foundations for Matsuyama's success were laid on Saturday, returning from an hour-long delay for storms to shoot six under par through his final eight holes. It meant the world number 25, who passed the time by sitting in his car playing games on his phone, signed for a stunning 65 that put him four strokes clear of the field on 11 under. There were some early nerves on Sunday as Matsuyama sent his opening drive into the trees and watched his lead cut to one after Zalatoris made a birdie-birdie start to climb to nine under. The 24-year-old American, who was aiming to become the first debutant to win since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979, emerged as a surprise challenger but Matsuyama birdied the second, made smart par-saves at three and five and then completed the front nine with successive birdies. After Zalatoris dropped shots at 10 and the Golden Bell 12th, Matsuyama's advantage was stretched to six strokes. Matsuyama, who had not won on the PGA Tour since 2017, could afford to cautiously bogey the par-three 12th but was fortunate to avoid sending his approach to the par-five 13th green into the azaleas and he went on to birdie the hole. Playing partner Schauffele looked to have blown his challenge with four dropped shots in three holes through three, four and five. But a run of four birdies that started on the 12th suddenly put the pressure on Matsuyama, especially when the leader hit his second shot on the par-five 15th over the green and into the water on the nearby 16th. That resulted in a dropped shot and his advantage was down to two. Schauffele's grandparents live in Japan and he says he knows enough of the language to share a joke with Matsuyama, but the American was is no mood for that when his tee shot on the par-three 16th dropped into the water as he recorded a triple-bogey six. That handed Matsuyama the initiative once more, despite carding a bogey himself, and he held a two-shot lead heading down the 18th, where he converted a bogey putt to clinch the Green Jacket in front of the patrons gathered around the green. The former world number two becomes the second Japanese player to enjoy a victory at the iconic Georgia venue in eight days, after Tsubasa Kajitani won the Augusta National Women's Amateur last week. This video can not be played The Masters 2021: Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose & Tommy Fleetwood feature in the shots of the tournament Two-time runner-up Rose opened the tournament with a seven-under 65 and held on to that lead through the second round after a level-par 72. He shot 72 on Saturday to be in the group starting Sunday four behind Matsuyama. But he could not sustain his bid for a first Green Jacket as he faded to finish five back. ""I enjoyed the week and it's a bit more evidence that I love playing this golf course and I know how to play it,"" 40-year-old Rose said after a round that featured six bogeys and four birdies. ""Weirdly I felt I played better than I had all week. Just the putter went cold. ""I say that nothing really important happens before April. The major season is when it really counts. This is the start of it. ""Every month there is one to prepare for and work for and that is what I will be doing. This is a confidence boost and gives plenty of evidence that things are going in the right direction."" MacIntyre will be back next year after a level-par 72 on the final day, with the top 12 and ties getting invites to return. ""I have to take the positives,"" he said. ""I have played great on a golf course I have never seen. I have only played it on computer games with my pals. If I had known this golf course more I could have been up there competing."" Zalatoris was also making his debut and continued his impressive rise by ending the week as runner-up for his sixth top-10 finish in 15 starts on the PGA Tour this season, including a tie for sixth at the US Open last September. ""I am speechless,"" he said. ""To come one shot short is motivating, but for it to come at the Masters where I have been coming since I was nine years old is exciting,"" he said. ""I will come back next year and hopefully go one better."" Rahm, who became a father last week, carded the round of the day with an impressive bogey-free 66 to move to six under and post his fourth successive top-10 finish at Augusta. The 26-year-old Spaniard is still searching for his first major title but is a combined 37 under par at the venue in that period, better than any other player. American Patrick Reed, the 2018 champion, and Australia's Cameron Smith, five months after his runner-up finish, also enjoyed top-10 finishes at four under and three under respectively.

Nomadland takes top honours at Bafta Awards,"Nomadland star Frances McDormand (left) and director Chloe Zhao Nomadland, a drama about a woman who lives in a van in the American West after the financial crash, has taken top honours at the Bafta Film Awards. It scooped four prizes including best film, best actress for its star Frances McDormand and best director. That made Chloe Zhao only the second woman to win best director in the 53 years of the category's history. Meanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins won best actor for The Father, 27 years after his last competitive Bafta win. Olivia Colman stars with Sir Anthony Hopkins in The Father The 83-year-old, who won for playing a man losing his grip on reality, is the oldest ever winner of the award. But he was not watching Sunday's ceremony and later said he only found out he'd won when he heard cheering from the next room. ""I was sitting here painting, and I heard this cheer go off next door,"" he said after the ceremony. ""I thought, what the hell's happened? I thought they were watching a football match. And they came in and said I'd won."" Best film - Nomadland Best British film - Promising Young Woman Best actress - Frances McDormand, Nomadland Best actor - Sir Anthony Hopkins, The Father Best supporting actress - Yuh-Jung Youn, Minari Best supporting actor - Daniel Kaluuya, Judas and the Black Messiah Best director - Chloe Zhao, Nomadland The winners and nominees in full Five takeaways from this year's Baftas Red carpet in pictures Most winners were watching live and delivered acceptance speeches remotely, with none of the nominees at the Royal Albert Hall in person. Zhao, who was born in China and is based in the US, referred to her education in the UK when she told the ceremony: ""I think I just made my teacher at Brighton College very proud."" Her win comes 11 years after Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win best director for The Hurt Locker, and Zhao's victory means she is the first woman of colour to pick up the prize. Nomadland will be released in the UK on Disney+ on 30 April. South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn won best supporting actress British star Daniel Kaluuya was named best supporting actor for playing Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. The supporting actress trophy went to South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn for playing a grandmother in Korean-American drama Minari. Giving her speech in broken English, the 73-year-old said the award meant a lot because Brits were ""snobbish"" people. ""Every award is meaningful, but this one especially recognised by British people, known as very snobbish people, and they approved me as a good actor so I'm very, very privileged,"" she said. Emerald Fennell said the reception for Promising Young Woman had been ""completely incredible"" The prize for best British film went to Promising Young Woman, a revenge thriller about a woman, played by Carey Mulligan, who pretends to be blind drunk when men pick her up in bars and clubs. Its writer and director Emerald Fennell also won best original screenplay. She joked that everyone involved in the film had made it for ""a packet of crisps"", and said the experience was ""the greatest thing in my life"". Fennell is best known to viewers for her acting as Patsy in BBC drama Call the Midwife and for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles in Netflix's The Crown. Other Bafta winners included Bukky Bakray. The 18-year-old was named rising star following her first ever acting role in Rocks, in which she played a teenage schoolgirl abandoned by her mother. The low-budget film, set in east London, was the joint highest nominee along with Nomadland, with seven nominations each. Rocks also won the casting award for finding its group of largely novice young stars. Many of the young stars of Rocks, which won best casting, had not acted before Other films to win two prizes included Disney/Pixar's animated hit Soul; Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, adapted from August Wilson's play about a 1920s blues band; and Sound of Metal, which stars Riz Ahmed as a rock drummer who loses his hearing. This year's shortlists includeda diverse line-up of talent, following an outcry last year when voters only nominated white actors. This time 16 of the 24 acting contenders came from minority ethnic backgrounds, while 21 were first-time nominees. More on the winning films: Promising Young Woman: Carey Mulligan film 'deeply troubling' Why The Father will leave you disorientated Unknown schoolgirl actresses on 'life-changing' film Rocks Will Gompertz reviews Ma Rainey's Black Bottom Riz Ahmed on Sound of Metal: 'Listening is not just with your ears' The night began with a tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, who was Bafta's first president between 1959 and 1966. Co-host Edith Bowman said Prince Philip ""occupies a very special place in Bafta's history, and our thoughts are with the Royal Family"". Edith Bowman and Dermot O'Leary hosted Sunday's ceremony The Duke of Cambridge had been due to appear in a pre-recorded segment, but pulled out following the death of his grandfather. This year's Baftas were delayed by two months because of the pandemic, and come two weeks before the awards season reaches its climax with the Academy Awards. Unlike the Baftas, Oscars organisers want nominees to appear in person and will have a London venue for the first time for UK-based contenders. Sir Anthony, however, said he would stay in Wales, where he is having ""a quiet time"", rather than travelling to take part in the Oscar ceremony.

""I was sitting here painting, and I heard this cheer go off next door,"" he said after the ceremony. ""I thought, what the hell's happened? I thought they were watching a football match. And they came in and said I'd won."" Best film - Nomadland Best British film - Promising Young Woman Best actress - Frances McDormand, Nomadland Best actor - Sir Anthony Hopkins, The Father Best supporting actress - Yuh-Jung Youn, Minari Best supporting actor - Daniel Kaluuya, Judas and the Black Messiah Best director - Chloe Zhao, Nomadland The winners and nominees in full Five takeaways from this year's Baftas Red carpet in pictures Most winners were watching live and delivered acceptance speeches remotely, with none of the nominees at the Royal Albert Hall in person. Zhao, who was born in China and is based in the US, referred to her education in the UK when she told the ceremony: ""I think I just made my teacher at Brighton College very proud."" Her win comes 11 years after Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win best director for The Hurt Locker, and Zhao's victory means she is the first woman of colour to pick up the prize. Nomadland will be released in the UK on Disney+ on 30 April. South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn won best supporting actress British star Daniel Kaluuya was named best supporting actor for playing Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. The supporting actress trophy went to South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn for playing a grandmother in Korean-American drama Minari. Giving her speech in broken English, the 73-year-old said the award meant a lot because Brits were ""snobbish"" people. ""Every award is meaningful, but this one especially recognised by British people, known as very snobbish people, and they approved me as a good actor so I'm very, very privileged,"" she said. Emerald Fennell said the reception for Promising Young Woman had been ""completely incredible"" The prize for best British film went to Promising Young Woman, a revenge thriller about a woman, played by Carey Mulligan, who pretends to be blind drunk when men pick her up in bars and clubs. Its writer and director Emerald Fennell also won best original screenplay. She joked that everyone involved in the film had made it for ""a packet of crisps"", and said the experience was ""the greatest thing in my life"". Fennell is best known to viewers for her acting as Patsy in BBC drama Call the Midwife and for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles in Netflix's The Crown. Other Bafta winners included Bukky Bakray. The 18-year-old was named rising star following her first ever acting role in Rocks, in which she played a teenage schoolgirl abandoned by her mother. The low-budget film, set in east London, was the joint highest nominee along with Nomadland, with seven nominations each. Rocks also won the casting award for finding its group of largely novice young stars. Many of the young stars of Rocks, which won best casting, had not acted before Other films to win two prizes included Disney/Pixar's animated hit Soul; Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, adapted from August Wilson's play about a 1920s blues band; and Sound of Metal, which stars Riz Ahmed as a rock drummer who loses his hearing. This year's shortlists includeda diverse line-up of talent, following an outcry last year when voters only nominated white actors. This time 16 of the 24 acting contenders came from minority ethnic backgrounds, while 21 were first-time nominees.

Co-host Edith Bowman said Prince Philip ""occupies a very special place in Bafta's history, and our thoughts are with the Royal Family"". Edith Bowman and Dermot O'Leary hosted Sunday's ceremony The Duke of Cambridge had been due to appear in a pre-recorded segment, but pulled out following the death of his grandfather. This year's Baftas were delayed by two months because of the pandemic, and come two weeks before the awards season reaches its climax with the Academy Awards. Unlike the Baftas, Oscars organisers want nominees to appear in person and will have a London venue for the first time for UK-based contenders. Sir Anthony, however, said he would stay in Wales, where he is having ""a quiet time"", rather than travelling to take part in the Oscar ceremony.

Shoppers 'must respect staff' when retail reopens,"People are being asked to be respectful to shop workers as thousands of non-essential retail stores prepare to reopen across England and Wales. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) is calling on shoppers to adhere to social-distancing rules and ""queue considerately"" as curbs ease on Monday. The Co-op reported a rise in abuse and assaults involving staff during Covid. Home Secretary Priti Patel said last year she ""will not tolerate"" abuse against shop workers. The latest step in the government's roadmap in England sees non-essential retail such as clothes and technology shops reopen on Monday alongside hairdressers, beauty salons and gyms. In Wales, all shops will reopen as every pupil returns to the classroom. How are the rules changing where you live? What's happening with pools, haircuts and gyms? England's lockdown to ease as planned on 12 April The BRC, which represents big chain stores, said the public ""have a key part to play in creating a safe and enjoyable retail environment"". It estimates the three national lockdowns in England since March 2020 have cost non-food stores about Â£30bn in lost sales - but an initial sales surge is expected as restrictions ease. Chief executive Helen Dickinson said it was vital retailers ""are able to make their contribution to the UK's economic recovery"". She said: ""Many of us will be looking forward to returning to our favourite shop in the coming weeks, and we all have a duty to keep each other safe. Everyone should be considerate and respectful to their fellow shoppers and hard-working shop staff. ""This way we can all enjoy shopping and support our local communities."" Among its pleas to the public, the BRC asked people to ""shop alone where possible"", ""follow instructions"", and observe hygiene measures. This video can not be played A shop manager has described the abuse she's experienced at work during the pandemic. The Co-op said last year that violence, abuse and anti-social behaviour had become ""normalised"" and was at ""unprecedented levels"" during the pandemic. Co-op food boss Jo Whitfield said face-covering requirements and social-distancing rules had led to shop workers being ""spat at and threatened"". ""The reality is that shop workers are facing levels of violence for just doing their job: they have been spat at and threatened just because they've asked customers to respect social distancing,""she wrote in the Daily Telegraph,external. Speaking on the launch of a consultation over new legislation to protect shop staff, Ms Patel said last July: ""I will not tolerate violence and abuse against any shopworker and it's right that those who commit these crimes must be caught and punished.""

Monday will see more businesses begin trading once more, with restaurants and pubs able to serve food and alcohol outside, theme parks and self-contained overnight accommodation for single households reopen.

Lessons to be learnt over lobbying role - Cameron,"David Cameron has said he should have contacted the government âthrough only the most formal of channels"" when lobbying for a financial firm. The former prime minister has faced criticism for contacting ministers on behalf of Greensill Capital. In his first statement on the issue, he said he should have left ""no room for misinterpretation"". But Mr Cameron reiterated that he had broken no codes of conduct or government rules on lobbying. He added: ""However, I have reflected on this at length. There are important lessons to be learnt."" The Labour Party said Mr Cameron's statement had left ""many serious questions"" unanswered, and called for him to answer them before Parliament. Hancock 'had drink' with Cameron and Greensill It was revealed earlier that Health Secretary Matt Hancock had met Mr Cameron and financier Lex Greensill for a ""private drink"" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for the NHS. An ally of Mr Hancock said he had ""acted in entirely the correct way"". The meeting is the latest in a series of Sunday Times disclosures about Mr Cameron's lobbying work since leaving office, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak - whom he texted - among the ministers contacted. For three weeks the headlines kept coming. For three weeks David Cameron said nothing. And now this - the former prime minister admits he made a dud judgement call. Forget the rules; this is about the sniff test. Does it smell bad? Does it feel right? Plenty had been saying no it doesn't, and now David Cameron appears to agree. It's a lengthy statement from him, worthy of detailed examination. But it boils down to this: he acknowledges texting and ringing the chancellor and going for a private drink with the health secretary, as part of his paid work for a private company, was a bad idea. There's another point worth making too: journalism matters. The work of the Financial Times and the Sunday Times, ferreting out awkward truths, is what has prompted this. Mr Greensill, an Australian, worked as an unpaid adviser to Mr Cameron's government, and the former prime minister went on to be employed by his company - Greensill Capital - in 2018, two years after leaving Downing Street. In his statement, Mr Cameron said: ""In my representations to government, I was breaking no codes of conduct and no government rules. ""Ultimately, the outcome of the discussions I encouraged about how Greensill's proposals might be included in the government's CCFF (Covid Corporate Financing Facility) initiative - and help in the wake of the coronavirus crisis - was that they were not taken up. ""So, I complied with the rules and my interventions did not lead to a change in the government's approach to the CCFF."" He added: ""As a former prime minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation."" Mr Cameron added that he had worked for Greensill Capital in the belief that there ""would be a material benefit for UK businesses at a challenging time"". ""That was, in large part, my reason for working for Greensill in the first place,"" he said. Lex Greensill was an unpaid government adviser The company recently collapsed, with the loss of 440 jobs. Mr Cameron said: ""I completely understand the public interest in this issue, given the impact of Greensill's collapse on the hundreds of people who worked for the company and on other businesses and livelihoods. I feel desperately sorry for those affected."" He added that Mr Greensill had been brought in as a government adviser by then-Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, in 2011. ""He was not a political appointee,"" Mr Cameron said, ""but part of the Civil Service drive to improve government efficiency."" He continued: ""The false impression has been created that Lex Greensill was a close member of my team, meeting with me on a regular basis. ""The truth is, I had very little to do with Lex Greensill at this stage - as I recall, I met him twice at most in the entirety of my time as prime minister."" Mr Cameron - who was in Downing Street from 2010 to 2016 - is reported to have told friends he was set to earn as much as Â£60m from shareholdings in Greensill Capital prior to its collapse, although this has since been disputed. Shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Rachel Reeves said: ""The events unfolding over the last few weeks stretch across government and affect thousands of people. ""Transparency and accountability are crucial and that requires the utmost openness from government to establish the full facts behind this scandal.""

Philip's death has 'left huge void' for Queen,"This video can not be played ""A huge void in her life"": Prince Andrew describes the Queen's feelings of loss The Queen has described the death of the Duke of Edinburgh as ""having left a huge void in her life"", her son the Duke of York has said. Prince Andrew said his father's death was a ""terrible loss"", and his family was ""rallying round"" to help the Queen. ""We've lost the grandfather of the nation,"" he added, as he left a service at Windsor. Earlier, ex-PM Sir John Major said the Royal Family'sshared grief was an ""ideal opportunity"" to mend any rifts. And duringa special service at Canterbury Cathedral, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby paid tribute to Prince Philip, saying that ""for the Royal Family, as for every other, no words can reach into the depth of sorrow that goes into bereavement"". The archbishop, who is expected to lead the duke's funeral service at Windsor Castle on Saturday, said Prince Philip showed ""a remarkable willingness to take the hand he was dealt in life and straightforwardly to follow its call, to search its meaning, to go out and on as sent to inquire and think, to trust and to pray"". Philip's funeral 'opportunity' to end royal 'rifts' Prince Philip: A simple, family farewell What are the plans for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral? Prince Andrew was joined by the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their daughter Lady Louise Windsor at a separate service at Windsor's Royal Lodge. He said the Royal Family was grateful for all the ""absolutely amazing tributes"" to Prince Philip. He added: ""The Queen, as you would expect, is an incredibly stoic person. ""She described it as having left a huge void in her life but we, the family, the ones that are close, are rallying round to make sure that we're there to support her."" Speaking of his love for his father, Prince Andrew said: ""He was so calm. If you had a problem, he would think about it. ""He was always somebody you could go to and he would always listen so it's a great loss. ""We've lost almost the grandfather of the nation. And I feel very sorry and supportive of my mother who's feeling it probably more than everybody else."" He added: ""I know there is a huge amount of support, not just for her (the Queen) but for everybody as we go through this enormous change."" Prince Andrewstepped back from royal duties in 2019after criticism of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein intensified following a BBC interview. The Earl of Wessex, the Queen's youngest son, said: ""However much one tries to prepare oneself for something like this, it's still a dreadful shock. ""And we're still trying to come to terms with that. And it's very, very sad. ""But I have to say that the extraordinary tribute and the memories that everybody has had and been willing to share has been so fantastic."" The Earl and Countess of Wessex attended the service with their daughter Lady Louise Windsor The Countess of Wessex said the Queen was ""thinking of others before herself"". Speaking to members of the congregation outside the chapel, Sophie said that Prince Philip's death was ""very peaceful"". ""It was right for him. It was so gentle. It was just like somebody took him by the hand and off he went. ""Very, very peaceful and that's all you want for somebody isn't it?"" She added: ""I think it's so much easier for the person that goes than the people that are left behind."" Remembering Prince Philip's popularity on the Windsor estate, she said: ""He always exchanged words with everybody because it didn't matter what anybody was doing in and around the estate here, and everywhere else - they all meant a lot to him and he always took a very personal interest in everything that they were doing. ""So they all have got stories to tell, and most of them are quite funny as well."" Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales paid tribute to his ""dear papa"" on Saturday, sayinghe and the Royal Family would miss him ""enormously"". He said the duke,who died at Windsor Castle on Friday, aged 99,had given the ""most remarkable, devoted service"" to the Queen, the Royal Family, the country, and the Commonwealth. Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures What are the plans for his funeral? How does the Royal Family work? A ceremonial royal funeral will be held for the duke at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on Saturday, 17 April. The event will be televised. Members of the Royal Family will walk behind the coffin ahead of the funeral at Windsor Castle.

His wife, Meghan, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors. It will be the first time Prince William and Prince Harry will meet face to face sincethe Sussexes aired criticisms of the Royal Family in an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month. Earlier, Sir John, who was appointed a special guardian to the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, said the ""shared grief"" over the death of Prince Philip is an ""ideal opportunity"" to mend any rifts in the Royal Family. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""They shared emotion. They share grief at the present time because of the death of their grandfather. I think [this] is an ideal opportunity.

Our coronavirus live page will return tomorrow. The writers today were Victoria Lindrea, Alex Therrien and  Sarah Collerton. Weâll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main stories from today.  The Tea Room in Knutsford will reopen its outdoor seating area on Monday Coronavirus restrictions in England are slowly being lifted. From tomorrow, non-essential shops, gyms and libraries will reopen; family groups will be able to rent holiday accommodation. All the lockdown easing steps in England are dependent on four key tests being met at each stage. These tests include whether the vaccine rollout is going as planned and whether deaths and cases are coming down. We've created a countdown to freedom to keep you going - and guide you along that roadmap: For example:  See for yourself!   The Alma Inn near Halifax, West Yorkshire, has invested heavily in converting an overflow area by the car park Pubs have been upgrading their outdoor areas ahead of lockdown restrictions being eased in England. From Monday, venues with outdoor seating will reopen for the first time since the beginning of January. Half of Britons are planning to visit a pub or restaurant when the rules ease, a recent poll by investment bank Jefferies found. The Alma Inn near Halifax, West Yorkshire, has invested heavily in converting an overflow area by the car park to make what its Instagram account dubbed a ""second pub"". The new area includes a mobile bar, food truck and new benches, while the land also had to be levelled. John Priest, 38, one of the pub's managers, said: ""We have to be ready for the demand. ""If we get to a point next week or the week after where we didn't have anywhere for people to sit, then we would have failed as a business in our eyes. ""If we can't satisfy the demand that's there, then we've got it wrong."" The Cornubia Inn in Hayle, West Cornwall, has added wi-fi and a new payment system for its outdoor area In Hayle, Cornwall, Damian Knight, 45, who runs the Cornubia Inn with his wife Miranda, said the pandemic has changed the ""traditional"" pub model. While they have spent money on a covered shelter, heating and updated furniture, the addition of wi-fi and a new ordering and payment system are important updates that customers may not notice at a glance. ""If you open your doors with what you had before, you're going to get left behind."" The number of deaths recorded in today's figures is the lowest since 13 September, when five were reported. It is the lowest number of cases since 2 September, when 1,508 were reported. We look at the trends in the numbers in the following charts. The daily figures also show that the number of people in the UK to have had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine is now 32,121,353 - up 111,109 on yesterday. The number of people to have two doses is now 7,466,540 - up 475,230. A further 221 patients were admitted into hospital. A further seven people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were also a further 1,730 cases reported. Celeste said there was an ""allure"" to performing in an empty Royal Albert Hall Brit award winner Celeste has said performing at the Bafta film awards in an empty Royal Albert Hall is a ""unique opportunity"". The singer was speaking as she arrived at the second of the two ceremonies for this year's awards, which is going ahead without winners and nominees present. She is due to perform Hear My Voice from best film nominee The Trial Of The Chicago 7. Speaking ahead of the ceremony, she said: ""I think it has such an allure to be able to perform without an audience and I was saying earlier that it's such a unique opportunity to be able to perform in a place like this, sort of fully ready to go, dressed, without a crowd so I look forward to that, and hopefully I'll come back another time where I can have a big audience."" You can see the full list of nominees and winnershere. The group has been giving performances on doorsteps rather at venues Women who have given birth during the pandemic say a wellbeing project has given them the ""human connection"" they have missed during lockdown. Art and music group Can't Sit Still organises Covid-safe mother and baby group meet-ups and music gigs on people's doorsteps in Gloucestershire and Bristol to give support to mums ""isolated"" at home. Lucy Warren-Swettenham, from Gloucestershire, said it was the first time she had connected with other mums and her daughter Lily had seen other babies. ""I had never been a mum in public so being able to talk mother-to-mother made me feel stronger,"" she says. ""There's a mum who I met nearby so I've organised a doorstep gig for her to come and watch and for my daughter to experience the music."" Bristol mum Natalie Sparnon said the wellbeing sessions and doorstep performance brought her the ""human connection"" that she had not been able to access. ""It was nice to have something special to remember just for me and my daughter,"" she says. ""We have missed out on so much being isolated during the pandemic."" Read more here Lucy Warren-Swettenham said it was nice to ""finally"" be able to do something just for mums Lockdown restrictions in Jersey are also to be eased from tomorrow, paving the way for more people to meet up. Events such as weddings will also see larger numbers as the island moves to stage five of its lockdown roadmap. Testing is being made available free for all office workers and employees in various sectors. The 2m social distancing rule is also changing from law to guidance. But Minister for Health and Social Services Richard Renouf says people ""should still make every effort to maintain distance from those they don't live with wherever possible"". He says he hopes islanders ""enjoy meeting again and respect the subtle but important measures that remain"". Find out moreabout the key changes here. From tomorrow people in England will be able to visit shops, gyms and hairdressers, as well as the outdoor spaces of pubs and restaurants. So with the next stages of lockdown easing on the horizon, how can you keep yourself and others safe from transmitting coronavirus in these new locations? The BBCâs science editor David Shukman explains the risks and what to look out for. This video can not be played Lockdown easing: What to watch for when youâre out and about The government should give greater support to those most at risk of Covid-19 and protection to prevent them being forced back into workplaces, disability charity Scope has said. It comes after shielding advice for the most clinically vulnerable in England and Walesended at the beginning of the month. Executive director James Taylor said: ""Nobody should be forced to choose between their life and their livelihood. ""Without proper protections in place for those most at risk, that's exactly what's going to happen."" The High Court in Dublin directed that there should be an inquiry into Mr Jennings' mandatory quarantine, national media reported An Irish man who flew home from Israel to be with his dying father is to be released from quarantine after launching a legal challenge. Derek Jennings, 47, had been in mandatory quarantine after flying into Ireland on Friday. His father, who was diagnosed with cancer, is in intensive care. Earlier on Sunday, the High Court in Dublin had heard his father was in a critical condition and might die at any stage. The Republic of Ireland introduced hotel quarantine last monthto restrict international travel. Currently people travelling from one of more than 30 countries must undergo mandatory hotel quarantine for 14 days at their own cost. The court directed that there should be an inquiry into Mr Jennings' mandatory quarantine,RTÃ reports,external.

But there are fears thatwon't be enough for some pubs hit by huge losses due to lockdown. Managing director of the Bath Pub Company Joe Cussens says its four pubs have been refitted with outside bars and seating areas in preparation for outdoor dining. ""We are spending now hoping we will recoup over the summer,"" he says.

Graham Anderson and Sharon Stanton ran the Eastfield Inn for almost a decade From Monday pubs and restaurants can open in England, with customers ordering food and drink while remaining seated outside. Despite this, Bath Pub Company managing director Joe Cussens fears some pubs will not be able to stay open following lockdown. ""Every pub has had to take on a mountain of debt,"" he says.

Graham Anderson and Sharon Stanton have decided not to reopen one of their two pubs in Bristol - the Eastfield Inn, which they ran for nine years.

LiveLiveAs it happened: England and Wales prepare for shops reopening27 minutes ago,"Non-essential shops are preparing to open their doors on Monday in England and Wales England's gyms, zoos and hairdressers will also reopen, while restaurants and pubs will welcome customers outdoors The public have been urged to respect staff and follow Covid guidelines - with retail sales predicted to surge Buckingham Palace repeats appeal for public not to go there to pay tribute to Prince Philip Covid rules mean UK PM Boris Johnson is to miss the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral, allowing family to attend A further 2,589 coronavirus cases are reported across the UK on Saturday alongside another 40 deaths That's it from us today - thanks for joining us. Our coronavirus live page will return tomorrow. The writers today were Victoria Lindrea, Alex Therrien and  Sarah Collerton. Weâll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main stories from today.  The Tea Room in Knutsford will reopen its outdoor seating area on Monday Coronavirus restrictions in England are slowly being lifted. From tomorrow, non-essential shops, gyms and libraries will reopen; family groups will be able to rent holiday accommodation. All the lockdown easing steps in England are dependent on four key tests being met at each stage. These tests include whether the vaccine rollout is going as planned and whether deaths and cases are coming down. We've created a countdown to freedom to keep you going - and guide you along that roadmap: For example:  See for yourself!   The Alma Inn near Halifax, West Yorkshire, has invested heavily in converting an overflow area by the car park Pubs have been upgrading their outdoor areas ahead of lockdown restrictions being eased in England. From Monday, venues with outdoor seating will reopen for the first time since the beginning of January. Half of Britons are planning to visit a pub or restaurant when the rules ease, a recent poll by investment bank Jefferies found. The Alma Inn near Halifax, West Yorkshire, has invested heavily in converting an overflow area by the car park to make what its Instagram account dubbed a ""second pub"". The new area includes a mobile bar, food truck and new benches, while the land also had to be levelled. John Priest, 38, one of the pub's managers, said: ""We have to be ready for the demand. ""If we get to a point next week or the week after where we didn't have anywhere for people to sit, then we would have failed as a business in our eyes. ""If we can't satisfy the demand that's there, then we've got it wrong."" The Cornubia Inn in Hayle, West Cornwall, has added wi-fi and a new payment system for its outdoor area In Hayle, Cornwall, Damian Knight, 45, who runs the Cornubia Inn with his wife Miranda, said the pandemic has changed the ""traditional"" pub model. While they have spent money on a covered shelter, heating and updated furniture, the addition of wi-fi and a new ordering and payment system are important updates that customers may not notice at a glance. ""If you open your doors with what you had before, you're going to get left behind."" The number of deaths recorded in today's figures is the lowest since 13 September, when five were reported. It is the lowest number of cases since 2 September, when 1,508 were reported. We look at the trends in the numbers in the following charts. The daily figures also show that the number of people in the UK to have had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine is now 32,121,353 - up 111,109 on yesterday. The number of people to have two doses is now 7,466,540 - up 475,230. A further 221 patients were admitted into hospital. A further seven people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were also a further 1,730 cases reported.

She is due to perform Hear My Voice from best film nominee The Trial Of The Chicago 7. Speaking ahead of the ceremony, she said: ""I think it has such an allure to be able to perform without an audience and I was saying earlier that it's such a unique opportunity to be able to perform in a place like this, sort of fully ready to go, dressed, without a crowd so I look forward to that, and hopefully I'll come back another time where I can have a big audience.""

Art and music group Can't Sit Still organises Covid-safe mother and baby group meet-ups and music gigs on people's doorsteps in Gloucestershire and Bristol to give support to mums ""isolated"" at home. Lucy Warren-Swettenham, from Gloucestershire, said it was the first time she had connected with other mums and her daughter Lily had seen other babies. ""I had never been a mum in public so being able to talk mother-to-mother made me feel stronger,"" she says. ""There's a mum who I met nearby so I've organised a doorstep gig for her to come and watch and for my daughter to experience the music."" Bristol mum Natalie Sparnon said the wellbeing sessions and doorstep performance brought her the ""human connection"" that she had not been able to access.

Executive director James Taylor said: ""Nobody should be forced to choose between their life and their livelihood.

""We have never given up on finding out what exactly happened to Stuart and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends,"" Det Supt Morris said. Mr Lubbock, a butcher from Harlow, was described by neighbours at the time of his death as a ""pleasant, sociable"" man.

Shoppers 'must respect staff' when retail reopensPeople are urged to be considerate when non-essential retail rules ease in England and Wales on Monday.UK,"People are being asked to be respectful to shop workers as thousands of non-essential retail stores prepare to reopen across England and Wales. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) is calling on shoppers to adhere to social-distancing rules and ""queue considerately"" as curbs ease on Monday. The Co-op reported a rise in abuse and assaults involving staff during Covid. Home Secretary Priti Patel said last year she ""will not tolerate"" abuse against shop workers. The latest step in the government's roadmap in England sees non-essential retail such as clothes and technology shops reopen on Monday alongside hairdressers, beauty salons and gyms. In Wales, all shops will reopen as every pupil returns to the classroom. How are the rules changing where you live? What's happening with pools, haircuts and gyms? England's lockdown to ease as planned on 12 April The BRC, which represents big chain stores, said the public ""have a key part to play in creating a safe and enjoyable retail environment"". It estimates the three national lockdowns in England since March 2020 have cost non-food stores about Â£30bn in lost sales - but an initial sales surge is expected as restrictions ease. Chief executive Helen Dickinson said it was vital retailers ""are able to make their contribution to the UK's economic recovery"". She said: ""Many of us will be looking forward to returning to our favourite shop in the coming weeks, and we all have a duty to keep each other safe. Everyone should be considerate and respectful to their fellow shoppers and hard-working shop staff. ""This way we can all enjoy shopping and support our local communities."" Among its pleas to the public, the BRC asked people to ""shop alone where possible"", ""follow instructions"", and observe hygiene measures. This video can not be played A shop manager has described the abuse she's experienced at work during the pandemic. The Co-op said last year that violence, abuse and anti-social behaviour had become ""normalised"" and was at ""unprecedented levels"" during the pandemic. Co-op food boss Jo Whitfield said face-covering requirements and social-distancing rules had led to shop workers being ""spat at and threatened"". ""The reality is that shop workers are facing levels of violence for just doing their job: they have been spat at and threatened just because they've asked customers to respect social distancing,""she wrote in the Daily Telegraph,external. Speaking on the launch of a consultation over new legislation to protect shop staff, Ms Patel said last July: ""I will not tolerate violence and abuse against any shopworker and it's right that those who commit these crimes must be caught and punished.""

LiveLiveEngland and Wales prepare for shops reopening9 minutes ago,"Non-essential shops are preparing to open their doors on Monday in England and Wales England's gyms, zoos and hairdressers will also reopen, while restaurants and pubs will welcome customers outdoors The public have been urged to respect staff and follow Covid guidelines - with retail sales predicted to surge Buckingham Palace repeats appeal for public not to go there to pay tribute to Prince Philip Covid rules mean UK PM Boris Johnson is to miss the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral, allowing family to attend A further 2,589 coronavirus cases are reported across the UK on Saturday alongside another 40 deaths That's it from us today - thanks for joining us. Our coronavirus live page will return tomorrow. The writers today were Victoria Lindrea, Alex Therrien and  Sarah Collerton. Weâll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main stories from today.  The Tea Room in Knutsford will reopen its outdoor seating area on Monday Coronavirus restrictions in England are slowly being lifted. From tomorrow, non-essential shops, gyms and libraries will reopen; family groups will be able to rent holiday accommodation. All the lockdown easing steps in England are dependent on four key tests being met at each stage. These tests include whether the vaccine rollout is going as planned and whether deaths and cases are coming down. We've created a countdown to freedom to keep you going - and guide you along that roadmap: For example:  See for yourself!   The Alma Inn near Halifax, West Yorkshire, has invested heavily in converting an overflow area by the car park Pubs have been upgrading their outdoor areas ahead of lockdown restrictions being eased in England. From Monday, venues with outdoor seating will reopen for the first time since the beginning of January. Half of Britons are planning to visit a pub or restaurant when the rules ease, a recent poll by investment bank Jefferies found. The Alma Inn near Halifax, West Yorkshire, has invested heavily in converting an overflow area by the car park to make what its Instagram account dubbed a ""second pub"". The new area includes a mobile bar, food truck and new benches, while the land also had to be levelled. John Priest, 38, one of the pub's managers, said: ""We have to be ready for the demand. ""If we get to a point next week or the week after where we didn't have anywhere for people to sit, then we would have failed as a business in our eyes. ""If we can't satisfy the demand that's there, then we've got it wrong."" The Cornubia Inn in Hayle, West Cornwall, has added wi-fi and a new payment system for its outdoor area In Hayle, Cornwall, Damian Knight, 45, who runs the Cornubia Inn with his wife Miranda, said the pandemic has changed the ""traditional"" pub model. While they have spent money on a covered shelter, heating and updated furniture, the addition of wi-fi and a new ordering and payment system are important updates that customers may not notice at a glance. ""If you open your doors with what you had before, you're going to get left behind."" The number of deaths recorded in today's figures is the lowest since 13 September, when five were reported. It is the lowest number of cases since 2 September, when 1,508 were reported. We look at the trends in the numbers in the following charts. The daily figures also show that the number of people in the UK to have had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine is now 32,121,353 - up 111,109 on yesterday. The number of people to have two doses is now 7,466,540 - up 475,230. A further 221 patients were admitted into hospital. A further seven people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were also a further 1,730 cases reported. Celeste said there was an ""allure"" to performing in an empty Royal Albert Hall Brit award winner Celeste has said performing at the Bafta film awards in an empty Royal Albert Hall is a ""unique opportunity"". The singer was speaking as she arrived at the second of the two ceremonies for this year's awards, which is going ahead without winners and nominees present. She is due to perform Hear My Voice from best film nominee The Trial Of The Chicago 7. Speaking ahead of the ceremony, she said: ""I think it has such an allure to be able to perform without an audience and I was saying earlier that it's such a unique opportunity to be able to perform in a place like this, sort of fully ready to go, dressed, without a crowd so I look forward to that, and hopefully I'll come back another time where I can have a big audience."" You can see the full list of nominees and winnershere. The group has been giving performances on doorsteps rather at venues Women who have given birth during the pandemic say a wellbeing project has given them the ""human connection"" they have missed during lockdown. Art and music group Can't Sit Still organises Covid-safe mother and baby group meet-ups and music gigs on people's doorsteps in Gloucestershire and Bristol to give support to mums ""isolated"" at home. Lucy Warren-Swettenham, from Gloucestershire, said it was the first time she had connected with other mums and her daughter Lily had seen other babies. ""I had never been a mum in public so being able to talk mother-to-mother made me feel stronger,"" she says. ""There's a mum who I met nearby so I've organised a doorstep gig for her to come and watch and for my daughter to experience the music."" Bristol mum Natalie Sparnon said the wellbeing sessions and doorstep performance brought her the ""human connection"" that she had not been able to access. ""It was nice to have something special to remember just for me and my daughter,"" she says. ""We have missed out on so much being isolated during the pandemic."" Read more here Lucy Warren-Swettenham said it was nice to ""finally"" be able to do something just for mums Lockdown restrictions in Jersey are also to be eased from tomorrow, paving the way for more people to meet up. Events such as weddings will also see larger numbers as the island moves to stage five of its lockdown roadmap. Testing is being made available free for all office workers and employees in various sectors. The 2m social distancing rule is also changing from law to guidance. But Minister for Health and Social Services Richard Renouf says people ""should still make every effort to maintain distance from those they don't live with wherever possible"". He says he hopes islanders ""enjoy meeting again and respect the subtle but important measures that remain"". Find out moreabout the key changes here. From tomorrow people in England will be able to visit shops, gyms and hairdressers, as well as the outdoor spaces of pubs and restaurants. So with the next stages of lockdown easing on the horizon, how can you keep yourself and others safe from transmitting coronavirus in these new locations? The BBCâs science editor David Shukman explains the risks and what to look out for. This video can not be played Lockdown easing: What to watch for when youâre out and about The government should give greater support to those most at risk of Covid-19 and protection to prevent them being forced back into workplaces, disability charity Scope has said. It comes after shielding advice for the most clinically vulnerable in England and Walesended at the beginning of the month. Executive director James Taylor said: ""Nobody should be forced to choose between their life and their livelihood. ""Without proper protections in place for those most at risk, that's exactly what's going to happen."" The High Court in Dublin directed that there should be an inquiry into Mr Jennings' mandatory quarantine, national media reported An Irish man who flew home from Israel to be with his dying father is to be released from quarantine after launching a legal challenge. Derek Jennings, 47, had been in mandatory quarantine after flying into Ireland on Friday. His father, who was diagnosed with cancer, is in intensive care. Earlier on Sunday, the High Court in Dublin had heard his father was in a critical condition and might die at any stage.

But there are fears thatwon't be enough for some pubs hit by huge losses due to lockdown. Managing director of the Bath Pub Company Joe Cussens says its four pubs have been refitted with outside bars and seating areas in preparation for outdoor dining. ""We are spending now hoping we will recoup over the summer,"" he says.

Graham Anderson and Sharon Stanton ran the Eastfield Inn for almost a decade From Monday pubs and restaurants can open in England, with customers ordering food and drink while remaining seated outside. Despite this, Bath Pub Company managing director Joe Cussens fears some pubs will not be able to stay open following lockdown. ""Every pub has had to take on a mountain of debt,"" he says. ""Some pubs will not survive. Pubs that were on the edge before Covid will not think it's worth reopening - this will have accelerated their demise. ""The market will come out strongly but there will be some casualties."" Graham Anderson and Sharon Stanton have decided not to reopen one of their two pubs in Bristol - the Eastfield Inn, which they ran for nine years. ""From our customers' point of view it's hard to believe because we had the footfall, but the costs were astronomical and there's a fine margin of error,"" Graham says. ""Covid was the nail in the coffin."" Read more here From tomorrow, more lockdown restrictions are being eased in England, including the long-awaited reopening of pubs. We answer some of our readers' questions on what happens now: When pubs and restaurants open outside in England, can I only go with people I live with or does the rule of six apply? Therule of sixwill apply at cafes, pubs and restaurants in England from tomorrow. So you can meet up outside with five other people, and you donât have to live with any of them. Or you can meet up with any number of people from two households. When pubs open, will bar staff have to wear face masks and or visors when serving? Yes, they will. By law, staff working in venues that provide food and drink are required to wear face coverings (similar to masks), unless they have an exemption. Thegovernment guidance for the hospitality sector in England,externalsays a face visor or shield may be worn in addition to a face covering - but not instead of one.

Matsuyama takes four-shot Masters lead,"This video can not be played Matsuyama opens four-shot lead at Masters with 65 Masters third-round leaderboard -11H Matsuyama (Jpn);-7X Schauffele (US), M Leishman (Aus), J Rose (Eng), W Zalatoris (US);-6C Conners (Can);-5J Spieth (US);-4B Harman (US) Selected others: -2R MacIntyre (Sco);+1M Laird (Sco), T Fleetwood (Eng), M Fitzpatrick (Eng), M Wallace (Eng);+3I Poulter (Eng), T Hatton (Eng);+4P Casey (Eng) Hideki Matsuyama hit a seven-under 65 to take a four-shot lead into the final day of the Masters as he aims to become the first Japanese man to win a major. The 29-year-old posted the first bogey-free round at Augusta National this week to leapfrog England's Justin Rose into top spot and lead on 11 under. Overnight leader Rose scrambled to a 72 and is one of four at seven under. Americans Xander Schauffele and Will Zalatoris and Australia's Marc Leishman are also tied with Rose. Schauffele had four birdies, an eagle and two bogeys in his 68, while Leishman had four birdies in his 70. Jordan Spieth, the 2015 champion, is two further back after recovering from a double bogey at seven to card a level-par 72 that leaves him at five under. Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, on his Masters debut, sits at two under par in joint 10th after a second successive 70, trading six birdies with four bogeys. ""When the wind calmed down you could kind of get at it. I am happy enough with the last couple of days' play,"" said the 24-year-old. World number two Justin Thomas began the day three shots back and birdied the second and third but made three bogeys and a triple-bogey eight at 13 between the ninth and the 14th to slip to one under par. Play was suspended for more than an hour on Saturday because of a storm passing through Georgia. Matsuyama posted rounds of 69 and 71 to keep himself within touching distance heading into the weekend and he started the day three off the pace set by Rose. The world number 25 made a steady start with pars on his opening six holes before a birdie at seven preceded an impressive run. With Rose dropping shots at the fourth and fifth, the former world number two carded two successive birdies on 11 and 12 to move into a share of the lead with the Englishman. That became a three-way tie for top spot when Zalatoris, playing in the final pairing alongside Rose, birdied the 10th. Schauffele briefly made it four players in a share of the lead with an eagle at the par-five 15th, only for Rose to birdie 12 moments later and edge clear again at eight under. But it was Matsuyama who jumped into the outright lead seconds later with an eagle of his own at the 15th to go nine under. Matsuyama, who has occupied a top-10 spot entering the final round of a major on eight previous occasions, extended his lead to two after landing his tee shot at the par-three 16th four feet from the pin, before prodding in for birdie. He stretched that advantage to three shots with a 10-foot birdie putt at 17, and made a smart up-and-down to save par on 18 and set the clubhouse lead. Matsuyama, who has two top-10 finishes at Augusta National, becomes the first Japanese player to lead a round at the Masters. ""Before the horn blew I didn't hit a very good drive but after the restart I hit practically every shot exactly how I wanted to,"" he said after playing the last eight holes in six under par. ""It will be a new experience for me, being a leader going into the final round of a major. All I can do is relax, prepare well and do my best."" Justin Rose has led a round at the Masters on seven previous occasions Rose's struggles during the opening two rounds had come in the first seven holes, while he had not made a bogey on either day beyond that. The 40-year-old made a birdie-birdie start on Saturday before being pegged back with successive bogeys on four and five, but it meant he still held a one-stroke lead when the hooter sounded while he was on the seventh green. An hour and 18 minutes later, the Englishman returned and completed the front nine with a run of pars. Rose looked to be in trouble on 11 after finding the trees down the right and then the bunker, but splashed out to within a foot for a tap-in par and then made birdie at 12. He made two excellent pars on the 14th and 15th holes after hitting his approach shots through the green. The two-time Masters runner-up dropped back to seven under when he bogeyed 16 but finished with two more scrambling pars, including holing a 10-foot putt on the last, to keep himself in contention. ""It was a tricky day, when the storm was approaching it was really windy,"" said Rose. ""When we came back out it felt there was a period of time to make a score, but then the greens slowed up a lot. ""There was definitely some tricky moments out there. I had to work hard and after 12 holes I thought I was in a nice spot. Hideki hit the jets and I hit the brakes a bit, that was the difference. ""A lot is to do with how Hideki plays, but there is a big chasing pack waiting. We are in a good spot.""

"Dear papa was very special, says Charles","This video can not be played ""My family and I miss my father enormously,"" said Prince Charles at his Highgrove home The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to his ""dear papa"", the Duke of Edinburgh, saying that he and the Royal Family miss him ""enormously"". He said the duke, whodied at Windsor Castle on Friday, aged 99, had given the ""most remarkable, devoted service"" to the Queen, the Royal Family, the country, and the Commonwealth. Prince Charles said his father was a ""much loved and appreciated figure"". His comments came after details of Prince Philip's funeral were announced. Speaking from his Highgrove home in Gloucestershire, Prince Charles said over the last 70 years his father had ""given the most remarkable, devoted service to the Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth"". The prince said the Royal Family were ""deeply touched"" by the number of people in the UK, around the world and the Commonwealth, who he said shared ""our loss and our sorrow"". He added his ""dear papa"" was a ""very special person who... above all else would have been amazed by the reaction and the touching things that have been said about him"". The prince said he and his family were ""deeply grateful"" for this, adding: ""It will sustain us in this particular loss and at this particularly sad time."" Latest updates: Military leads tributes to duke In pictures: Tributes continue for Duke of Edinburgh Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh Buckingham Palace has announced that a national minute's silence will mark the start of the duke's funeral next Saturday at 15:00 BST at St George's Chapel, in Windsor. The arrangements, which ""very much"" reflect Prince Philip's wishes, have been adapted in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The Duke of Sussex will fly in from his home in the US to join other members of the Royal Family at the ceremony. But his wife the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant with their second child, has been advised by her doctor not to travel, the spokesman added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not attend the ceremony to allow for the attendance of ""as many family members as possible"" during coronavirus restrictions, No 10 said. Earlier,royal gun salutesacross the UK and at sea marked the duke's death. This video can not be played ""A loss to us all"" read one of the tributes to Prince Philip There will be eight days of national mourning - to end on 17 April - ahead of the televised funeral, which will be a ceremonial event rather than a large state affair usually associated with the death of a monarch. Prince Philip will also not lie in state - where members of the public would have been able to view his coffin. His coffin will instead lay at rest in the private chapel at Windsor Castle and will be draped with the duke's personal standard with a wreath of flowers on top. The Royal Family will observe two weeks of mourning, although royal engagements will continue where appropriate. Union flags will remain at half mast and the Royal Standard will be at full mast. The funeral will take place at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle A spokesman for the Palace said: ""Whilst this is a time of sadness and mourning the coming days will be an opportunity to celebrate a remarkable life."" Only 30 people - expected to be the duke's children, grandchildren and other close family - will attend the ceremony as guests. On the day of the funeral, Prince Philip's coffin will be transported from Windsor Castle to St George's Chapel in a specially modified Land Rover he helped to design. Members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales will walk behind the coffin, and the Queen will travel separately to the chapel. Guests will socially distance and wear face coverings in line with coronavirus restrictions. Jockeys, owners and trainers marked a two-minute silence in tribute to the duke at Aintree Racecourse, Liverpool on Saturday Military guns will fire during the procession, which will take eight minutes, and the curfew bell will toll. Eight pallbearers will carry the coffin, draped with duke's standard, with a wreath and the duke's naval cap and sword on top, up the west steps into the chapel. It will be greeted by the Dean of Windsor and the Archbishop of Canterbury. These 10 people are not included in the number of attendees allowed. A guest list will be released on Thursday. After the service, the duke will be interred in the Royal Vault of the chapel. This video can not be played The Earl and Countess of Wessex spent about an hour at Windsor Castle on Saturday morning. Members of the Royal Family have visited the Queen at Windsor Castle following the duke's death on Friday. The Countess of Wessex said ""the Queen has been amazing"" as she left the castle with the Earl of Wessex on Saturday. The Duke of York also visited on Saturday, while the Prince of Wales travelled there on Friday afternoon. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, paid tribute to Prince Philip's ""righteous impatience"" and ""gift of moral imagination"" in an online memorial service from the crypt at Lambeth Palace on Saturday evening. Mr Welby will lead a live service at Canterbury Cathedral in memory of the duke on Sunday at 10:30. An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life How the navy shaped the duke's life Members of the public have been asked not to attend any of the funeral events, in line with public health advice, and the Royal Family has asked people not to leave flowers and tributes at royal residences. Onthe Royal Family website,external, members of the public are asked to consider making a donation to a charity instead of leaving floral tributes in memory of the duke. Anonline book of condolence,externalis also available for the public to post their personal tributes. All UK government buildings have been told to fly official flags at half-mast in tribute to the duke until 08:00 on the day after the duke's funeral. Under earlier arrangements for the days after the duke's death, codenamed Forth Bridge, thousands of people would have been expected to gather in London and Windsor, with some even camping out to get a vantage point to watch the military procession. But since the pandemic began, organisers have been working on contingency plans which would avoid attracting mass gatherings in the event that the duke died. The Duke of Cambridge has withdrawn from giving a speech at the Bafta Awards ceremony on Sunday night, Kensington Palace said. His grandfather was Bafta's first president. Meanwhile, the Football League has announced that matches scheduled to begin at the same time as Prince Philip's funeral will be rearranged ""as a mark of respect"". This video can not be played Prince Philip: Officer, husband, father Announcing the duke's death on Friday, Buckingham Palace said: ""It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty the Queen announces the death of her beloved husband. ""The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss."" In tribute to the duke, saluting batteries fired 41 rounds on Saturday in cities including London, Edinburgh and Cardiff, and at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. Guns were also fired in Gibraltar. Royal Navy ships at sea, including HMS Diamond and HMS Montrose, also fired the salute in honour of the duke, who served as a naval officer during World War Two and held the office of Lord High Admiral.
