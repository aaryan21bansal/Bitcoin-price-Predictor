Two household limit at Christmas to be made law,"This video can not be played Shopers react to the news of limits for people meeting over the Christmas holidays changing. Only two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone - will be able to meet in Wales over Christmas under new laws. The Welsh Government had previously joined with the three other UK nations inagreeing that three households could meetbetween 23 and 27 December. But as Covid cases rise, First Minister Mark Drakeford has changed his plans. England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are sticking to the three household rule. Opposition parties accused the Welsh Government of causing confusion. But Mr Drakeford said he was giving ""just a single message in Wales"" that over that ""five day period, only two households, together with a single person household, should be meeting together"".Â ""We'll bring the regulations and the guidance into alignment with one another because it is only a single message,"" he told BBC Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said Wales had taken a ""big step"" breaking away from the UK ""settlement"" on Christmas rules. ""We've done that because of the evidence, because the advice we've had internally about the fact that we can save more lives to do so,"" he said during a BBC Wales Live debate. He added the decision will be unpopular with ""those who want the rules to stay as they were, and also those who want to go much further"", but that ""ultimately, the government has to decide"". What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live How will Wales' new lockdown work? Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told the Commons ""there had been unanimous agreement"" with the devolved administrations over the three household rule. But Mr Drakeford announced his change to the plan in Wales on Wednesday afternoon followingmounting pressure from medical professionals-  now it will be illegal for three households to join together over the festive period. This video can not be played The first minister said people in Wales should do the least they need to do this Christmas Despite the variation to the rules, the UK, Welsh and Scottish governmentsissued a joint statement,externalsaying ""a smaller Christmas is a safer Christmas"". It urged people to ""think carefully"" about the risks of forming a bubble, take precautions to minimise risk by stopping unnecessary social contact and to not stay overnight ""unless absolutely unavoidable"". The governments warned against travelling from areas where rates are high to areas where rates are low. Earlier Mr Drakeford said the situation in Wales was ""extremely serious"" with one in five tests in the country coming back positive. The two household guidance was announced by Mr Drakeford at the Welsh Government press conference on Wednesday lunchtime, but it did not become clear until later in the afternoon that the change would be made law. It followed a call between ministers of the four nations earlier in the day. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the announcement that about the two household limit was ""the right decision"". But he added: ""The way the Welsh Government has arrived at this I think will have led to confusion. ""This is confusion all the way round and that's very, very bad news in terms of public health policy, because we know that public trust and a sense the government is in control is absolutely essential - and the last 24 hours won't have instilled any confidence at all."" Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, accused the first minister of causing confusion earlier in the day. ""A consistent approach for Christmas across the UK should have been adopted by Mark Drakeford,"" he said. Mandy Jones from the Independent Reform Alliance in the Senedd said any new law on Christmas restrictions ""must be put to a vote of the Senedd"". ""This week the health minister complained about UK government information being given to the press, yet again members of the Senedd find out through the media."" Given how strong his message about limiting Christmas contact to two households was, the first minister told me it was ""sensible"" to be consistent by bringing the law into alignment with that message. It does mean more variation than many expected between the approach of the four nations during the festive period, but Mark Drakeford insists they're united in their central message which is to keep celebrations small, short and safe. After the concerns expressed by the medical profession, if this puts Mark Drakeford top of the cautious list of UK leader - even if he's not being as cautious as some were calling for - he won't mind that. But opposition parties are less impressed with the way the announcement was made. Plaid called for consistency at lunchtime and the Welsh Conservatives, seem less concerned with the departure from the legal approach in the rest of the UK than in it taking ""too long"" to get clarity on what the approach would be in Wales.

"Johnson calls for shorter, smaller Christmas","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'A shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas' Boris Johnson has urged people to keep Christmas celebrations ""short"" and ""small"" to reduce the risk of spreading Covid over the festive period. Restrictions will still be relaxed between 23 and 27 December - but the PM said people should ""think hard"" before meeting friends and family. Three households will be allowed to meet - apart from in Waleswhere a law change will allow just two households. And in Scotlandpeople are being asked to only meet on one of the five days,external. It comes as the UK recorded a further 25,161 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, along with 612 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Patients face 12-hour wait as hospital struggles UK coronavirus cases up by 18,450 on Tuesday Mr Johnson said the law was remaining the same in England but ""a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas"". Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, he said the rules allowing three households to meet over five days were ""maximums, not targets to aim for"". ""It's always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet,"" he said. After the news conference, the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments issued a joint statement saying this ""cannot be a normal Christmas"" and that they ""strongly"" recommended people stayed at home. They advised people who were visiting others to stop unnecessary social contact as soon as possible and for at least five days before travelling. No one should visit another household if they were ill or self-isolating, they said. Mr Johnson also advised people to avoid travelling from ""high prevalence"" areas to those with lower rates of coronavirus and not to stay away from home overnight if possible. This video can not be played Professor Whitty: 'You wouldn't drive down an icy road at 70 mph' Mr Johnson urged caution over seeing elderly or vulnerable relatives, saying that since the vaccine was being rolled out to these groups ""by the early months of the new year"", they would be able to meet people more safely soon. ""Whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales, and no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the new year,"" he added. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned: ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean it's sensible in any way."" ""Any kind of period where people come together in groups that otherwise wouldn't meet leads to an increase in risks and that will lead to an increase in hospitalisations and deaths,"" he said. He urged people to keep their Christmas celebrations small, short and local to reduce these risks. The four UK nations previously agreed a set of rules for the festive period, which has been set down in legislation and is not expected to change in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland - even though the guidance has been updated. Between 23 and 27 December, you can form a""Christmas bubble"",externalcomprised of people from three households You can travel between tiers and between UK nations to meet your bubble You can only meet in homes, places of worship or public outdoor spaces - not pubs or restaurants You can meet people outside your bubble according to your local rules But in Wales new guidance on households mixing will be put into law, meaning only two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone - will be able to form a Christmas bubble. UK leaders had come under pressure to review the guidance for Christmas amid rising infections. In November, all four nations agreed that three households would be able to form a Christmas bubble between 23 and 27 December, allowing them to mix indoors and stay overnight. However, the Welsh government has now decided Christmas bubbles should be limited to two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced the country wouldhead back into a stay-at-home lockdownas soon as the Christmas period was over. RESTRICTIONS LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, saidher ""strong recommendation"" was to ""spend Christmas in your own home with your own household"", She added: ""We will set out advice if you are living in any of the nations in one of the highest level of protection - which in England and London is tier three - then we don't think you should be travelling to other parts of the UK."" Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said the public must take ""all and every precaution"" at Christmas and proposals for further restrictions would be brought forward on Thursday. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised governments needed to provide ""flexibility"" over Christmas and that people needed to take personal responsibility for their actions. As families decide what to do this Christmas, legally the options are - for the most part - the same. However, the reality feels very different following today's stern warnings and with a changing health picture. And while there have been variations in terms of detail and emphasis from UK leaders, the overall memo was essentially this: be very careful, be very cautious. And just because you can take advantage of an easing in the rules doesn't mean you should. The planned relaxation was never meant to be a free-for-all. But with this toughened guidance many may feel their options have narrowed. And for the politicians - they now have to a sell a more complicated public health message. You can take advantage of a relaxation in the rules. But maybe, please - don't. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour would support tougher restrictions over Christmas. ""We would have liked to have seen a toughening up today from the prime minister - perhaps something like what we've seen in Wales, reducing households,"" he told the BBC. ""I think he's going to have to go further in the coming days."" An information campaign is expected to be launched in the days running up to Christmas, with people being urged to think carefully before bubbling with elderly or at-risk relatives. Scientists at the University of Bristol studied the implications - and early results, yet to be formally published, indicate the fewer people the better, from the point of view of containing the disease. If a single-person household joins another household of any size, the impact on infection rates would be marginal, they suggest. But if all households in the UK paired up with one other, each bubble would contain an average of 4.7 people. That would lead to a reproduction (R) number within households of between 1.9-2.4. And an R number is above one means the disease is escalating.

In a joint editorial, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal said demand on the NHS was increasing, adding that a newstrain of coronavirushad introduced ""further potential jeopardy"". Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the ""major driver"" for how much the disease spread over the  Christmas period was the infection prevalence - and that the current prevalence had started to rise ""really quite rapidly in some places"". ""When the rules were made about Christmas, we didn't know what that prevalence was going to be,"" Prof Medley told the Today programme. As for the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed, he said: ""We don't have much headroom.""

How will Wales' new lockdown work?,"All the UK's rules requiring people to wear masks in indoor spaces like shops and restaurants have come to an end. But guidance remains in place for some settings. Covid: Five things we still need to keep an eye on Are we ready for last Covid rule to be ditched? End of Covid regulations: What if I'm still worried? Scotland's legal restrictions on face coverings have come to an end - but the Scottish government says itstrongly recommends wearing a mask,externalin indoor public spaces and on public transport.

Masks are no longer required in shops or on public transport - although they are recommended - but they remain compulsory in health and social care settings. The legal requirement for people to self-isolate if they have Covid has also ended - although doing so is strongly advised.

"130,000 vaccinated in first week","More than 130,000 people have been vaccinated in the first week of the UK's vaccination programme. Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is in charge of vaccine rollout, tweeted 137,897 people had been given their first doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech jab between 8 and 15 December. He described it as a ""really good start"" for the programme. The figure only captures the start of the community vaccination programme run by GPs which launched on Monday. About 200 of these local vaccination clinics are expected to be up and running by the end of the week. They will be followed by another 1,000 in the coming weeks. Who will get the vaccine first? What you need to know about vaccine safety How close is light at end of Covid tunnel? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? A rapid expansion will be needed. The government wants to offer everyone over 50 and younger adults with health conditions a vaccine - about 25 million people. But the National Audit Office has warned ""complex logistical challenges"" remain. It said thousands of extra staff would be needed to deliver vaccinations on the scale being talked about - the government has committed to offering all over 50s and younger adults with health conditions a vaccine. It said hospitals and GP-run local clinics would not be able to do this on their own. But it added the government had worked ""quickly and effectively"" to secure access to vaccines - contracts have been signed giving priority access to five different jabs. It estimated the vaccination programme, including manufacturing, purchasing and delivering the jabs, could cost up to Â£12bn. During the first week, more than 70 hospitals took part in the vaccination programme - with another 10 starting this week. Mr Zahawi said the figures were provisional and from next week there would be published data available. The breakdown for individual nations showed: 108,000 vaccinated in England 7,897 in Wales 4,000 in Northern Ireland 18,000 in Scotland ""Transparency is vital as we deliver vaccines across the UK,"" Mr Zahawi added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is just the start and we will steadily expand our vaccination programme - ultimately helping everyone get back to normal life."" The over-80s have been invited for vaccination first, along with some health and care staff. But the highest priority group, care-home residents, have only just started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. It has to be kept in in large batches in ultra-cold storage. And the NHS had been waiting for guidance on how it can be safely taken into care homes. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Boxing Day sales off ahead of new Wales lockdown,"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford announced new restrictions at a press conference on Wednesday Non-essential shops in Wales will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with an alert level four lockdown starting four days later. Close-contact services, such as hair salons, will also have to shut before Christmas, First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced. All pubs, cafes and restaurants will close at 18:00 GMT on Christmas Day. Meanwhile Mr Drakeford said only two households can meet during the festive period. It comes despite a previous agreement between the UK nationsto stick to plans to allow three households to mixbetween 23 and 27 December. Now in Walesthe number will be reduced to two households- plus an additional single person who lives alone - and this will become law. The other nations will stick to the three households rule. The UK leaders had come under pressure to revise the plans amid rising cases. The situation in Wales was ""extremely serious"", Mr Drakeford said, with one in five Covid-19 tests returning a positive result. More than 2,100 people, ""equivalent to five full general hospitals"" were being treated in the NHS with Covid, he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there was a ""very strong case"" for going into lockdown now, while Paul Davies, of the Welsh Conservatives, said ""doing nothing is not an option"". Wales will go into a level four lockdown, the highest possible, from 28 December, with some sectors closing during the Christmas period. Under the recently-published planspeople will be expected to stay at home, with travel only allowed for essential reasons. From 28 December, public facilities and holiday accommodation must be shut, and wedding receptions and wakes will need to be called off. How will Wales' new lockdown work? Pubs and restaurants had already been told not to sell alcohol earlier in December, and outdoor and indoor attractions - such as cinemas - are closed now. But schools and higher education establishments will remain open. The lockdown has no end date and will be reviewed every three weeks, beginning in January. As well as non-essential retail, leisure and fitness centres will have to shut after Christmas Eve. Lucy Evans said no sales will leave her with ""a huge stock pile"" Lucy Evans, co-owner of Me & Luce boutique in Carmarthen, said her family-run business is ""at a standstill"" with the news of the lockdown as she tries to navigate Christmas and stock levels under the new rules. ""We've had such a difficult year already. Obviously it is understandable that people's health and welfare comes first and I completely agree with that,"" she said. ""But in terms of business it is devastating."" Economy Minister Ken Skates said there would be an announcement later this week about a ""significant sum of money"" to provide more support for businesses, including the retail sector, affected by the further restrictions. ""But equally, we're asking businesses, we're asking citizens to put off some of the activities that they would normally undertake just after Christmas until, hopefully, later in January or perhaps a little later after that depending on the three-week review,"" he told BBC News. ""We do not underestimate the terrible strain that businesses are facing right now."" The change in the rules will mean Boxing Day sales cannot take place at many shops Mr Drakeford defended allowing hospitality businesses to stay open until 18:00 on Christmas Day. ""We are anxious not to face that industry with additional difficulties at this point,"" he said. ""We know that many people who live alone arrange their Christmas by booking a meal on Christmas Day, so that they can be in the company of other people. ""I wanted to be able to honour that so that those people do not face an even bleaker Christmas, even more alone and they otherwise would be with all the other harms that come from that."" Nine council areas have more than 20% of tests coming back positive in the last week. The World Health Organisation has recommended this should be below 5% for places to come out of restrictions. NHS Wales has again reported record numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds. This amounted to 2,143 on Tuesday, 17% more than a week before, and included 614 patients still recovering from the virus but not well enough to be discharged. Under-pressure hospitals in the Aneurin Bevan health board have the most Covid patients - 620, which is 45% of all patients in its beds. Numbers of Covid patients in critical care across Wales are also at their highest since the end of April. Meanwhile, the latest R-number - the rate at which the virus is estimated to be transmitting - is estimated to have increased to a range between 0.9 and 1.2 in Wales. Anything above 1 indicates Covid is increasing. The Sage scientific body estimates the virus could be shrinking or growing by between -1% and 4% a day in Wales. Later Mr Drakeford told the Senedd that despite the fact there is variation of coronavirus in parts of Wales, the whole country will be subjected to the highest restrictions. ""Coronavirus is rising in every part of our country and we have an obligation to take the action which will protect all parts of our country"". ""If some parts of Wales demonstrate in a reliable and sustainable way that they are in a different part of the spectrum to other parts of Wales, well that can be recognised but we are not in that position today"", he said. Plaid Cymru's Adam Price told a BBC Wales Live debate: ""If you follow the logic of the government's own scientific advice, if you're in an emergency situation where you have to pull the emergency cord, if you like, then you're better off doing that earlier. ""Because if you do that earlier that means that the period of lockdown is shorter, so all the other harms are reduced because you intervene earlier and it has greater impact."" Paul Davies, Welsh Conservatives leader in the Welsh Parliament, called for greater clarity regarding Christmas arrangements and urged minsters to keep the situation under review ""in order that the restrictions can be lifted as soon as it is safe to do so, including on a regional and local basis where possible."" ""We now need a fire blanket, not a firebreak, to put out the flames of infection that are raging in some parts of the country,"" he added. ""While nobody wants to see further restrictions imposed, in the face of some of the highest rates of coronavirus infection in Western Europe and with rates rising in all parts of Wales, doing nothing is not an option.""

Lockerbie bombing: 'New suspect to be charged',"A total of 270 people died in the Lockerbie bombing on 21 December 1988 The US will soon announce charges against a Libyan suspected of making the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, US media say. Prosecutors will soon seek the extradition of Abu Agila Mohammad Masud to stand trial in the US, reports say. He is currently being held in Libya, according to the Wall Street Journal. This has not been confirmed by the Libyan authorities. The blast on board a Boeing 747 over the Scottish town left 270 people dead. Most of the victims on board the flight from London to New York were American citizens. Eleven people on the ground were also killed. It remains the deadliest terrorist incident ever to have taken place on British soil. The town scarred by Pan Am flight 103 Wreaths laid to mark Lockerbie bombing 30th anniversary Timeline: Lockerbie bombing Libyan national Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was the only man convicted, in 2001, over the bombing. Megrahi, who always proclaimed his innocence, launched two appeals against his 27-year sentence, one was unsuccessful and the other was abandoned. Megrahi was released from prison in Scotland and allowed to return to Libya on compassionate grounds in 2009 after it emerged that he had terminal cancer. He died three years later. A Scottish court is now considering a posthumous appealagainst his conviction by his family. This video can not be played The BBC's Mike Wooldridge reports on the life of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi The US Department of Justice is expected to unseal a criminal complaint against Abu Agila Mohammad Masud in the coming days, the Wall Street Journal reports, quoting senior department officials. It says this will open a new chapter in one of the world's longest and most sprawling terrorism investigations. The new charges are expected to be announced by outgoing US attorney-general, William Barr. He held the same position when the US announced its first charges against Megrahi and another Libyan suspect, later acquitted, in 1991. ""We will not rest until all those responsible are brought to justice. We have no higher priority,"" Mr Barr said at the time. The Wall Street Journal reports that Mr Masud is being held in Libya, although the New York Times says his exact whereabouts are unknown. But it adds that he was jailed in Libya at one point for unrelated crimes. Mr Masud is alleged to have been a top bomb-maker for late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Neither the US justice department nor the Libyan authorities have commented on the issue. Journalist Ken Dornstein, whose brother David was on board the Pan Am plane, went to Libya to track down Mr Masud as part of a 2015 TV documentary by US network PBS called My Brother's Bomber. This video can not be played Ken Dornstein on how he tracked down new Lockerbie suspects He told the BBC at the time that the Libyan national was ""a mystery figure"" who was named in the initial investigation and ""was said to have been a technical expert"". The documentary alleged that Mr Masud had also been linked to a bombing at a disco in West Berlin in 1986, which killed three people. It also reported that he was imprisoned in Libya over his role in the 2011 uprising that ousted Gaddafi. Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent The images from Lockerbie were searing. The jumbo jet's shattered nose, resting on its side in a Scottish field. The disaster became known, simply, as Lockerbie - by far the worst act of terrorism the UK had ever seen. It spawned any number of theories about who was responsible, with fingers pointing, at one time or another, at Iran, Syria, Palestinian militants and, finally, Libya. The most persistent of those theories is that Iran was bent on revenge after one of its civilian airliners, Iran Air 655, was brought down over the Persian Gulf by a surface-to-air missile, fired in error by an American warship just five months earlier. Iran, it was said, employed the services of bomb-makers from the Palestinian militant group, the PFLP-GC. British officials have never believed this version of events and remain convinced Lockerbie was the work of Libyan agents, working under orders from the country's former dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. News that the US authorities are on the verge of unveiling charges against a second Libyan, someone whose name was mentioned in the original investigation, would seem to bolster this belief. It could, finally, lay other theories to rest. If the US case against Mr Masud is based on a confession made to Libyan interrogators in 2012 and handed over to the Scottish authorities in 2017, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, then it could also affect legal proceedings in Scotland. A third, posthumous appeal against Abdelbaset al-Megrahi's 2001 conviction began at the High Court in Edinburgh last month. US and British investigators indicted Megrahi in 1991 but he was not handed over by the Libyans until April 1999. May 2000- A special trial under Scots law starts on neutral ground at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. 31 January 2001- Former Libyan intelligence officer Megrahi is found guilty of mass murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 27 years. March 2002- Megrahi loses an appeal against his conviction. September 2003- The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) is asked to investigate Megrahi's conviction. June 2007- The SCCRC recommends that Megrahi is granted a second appeal against his conviction. 18 August 2009- Megrahi's move to drop his second appeal is accepted by judges at The High Court in Edinburgh. 20 August 2009- Megrahi, who has terminal prostate cancer,is released from prison on compassionate grounds,external. May 2012- Megrahi dies at his home in Tripoli, aged 60. July 2015- Scottish judges rule that relatives of the Lockerbie bombing victims shouldnot be allowed to pursue an appealon Megrahi's behalf. Courts had previously ruled that only next of kin could proceed with a posthumous application. July 2017- Megrahi's familylaunched a new bid to appeal against his conviction. March 2020- The Scottish Criminal Case Review Commission said Megrahi's convictioncan be taken to a fresh appeal. November 2020- Five Scottish judges hear thethird appeal against Megrahi's convictionon grounds of possible miscarriage of justice Lockerbie bomber conviction to be reviewed Megrahi family lodge appeal bid Timeline: Lockerbie bombing SCCRC At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Q&A: Which rules are changing and when?,"Face masks are no longer legally required in Welsh shops The last Covid restrictions are set to end in Wales on Monday after 26 months. The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in health and social care services from Monday 30 May. It will be the first time there will be no Covid restrictions in Wales since the first lockdown in March 2020. The country is currently atalert level zero,external, the lowest tier of Covid rules, with numbers testing positive having fallen in recent weeks. The UK's last remaining Covid restrictions New Zealand to scrap some Covid vaccine mandates The lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic. We were last in alert level zero at Christmas. Under it, most curbs to our daily life have been removed, and all businesses have been allowed to reopen. Self-isolation rules did still apply, but were scrapped from 28 March. It is no longer a legal requirement but people are still strongly recommended to use face coverings in any health setting to protect the most vulnerable. The Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Since 22 December, those identified as being a close contact of someone who tests positive for Covid-19 in Wales have not had to self-isolate automatically, if they are fully vaccinated, aged between five and 18, or participating in a vaccine clinical trial. Instead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests. Since 28 January, people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests required on days five and six. Until then, the self-isolation period was seven days,down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on days six and seven. The Welsh government put the measures in place on 26 December to protect customers and staff in businesses The Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive. It advised meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated. People, it said, should leave at least a day between social events. From 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. But under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January. The rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended. People are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped. While wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing. Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August and remain the same Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August. For important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. All guests will need to take a lateral flow test. People attending weddings, civil partnerships or alternative wedding ceremonies or receptions, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero. The Welsh government advised people to wear face coverings indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing. You can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply. On 25 January 2022, theWelsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidaysfor the first time since the start of the pandemic. Nightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four-stage plan, they have been allowed to open since 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. Covid passes were scrapped on 18 February for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. As cases continued to remain low, sports fans were allowed to return to events From 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500. On 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. Gyms, swimming pools, leisure centres, community centres and fitness facilities are open Pupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January. From 18 February, they were no longer required to wear face coverings and schools could decide their own rules. Working from home is no longer law in Wales A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with Â£60 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, was scrapped on 28 January. You have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April 2021, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations. It also means people from other parts of the UK can come here. All holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May.

WHO to investigate Covid origins in China's Wuhan,"This video can not be played Covid-19: How everyday life has changed in Wuhan A team of 10 international scientists will travel to the Chinese city of Wuhan next month to investigate the origins of Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Beijing has been reluctant to agree to an independent inquiry and it has taken many months of negotiations for the WHO to be allowed access to the city. The virus is thought to have come from a market in the city selling animals. But the search for the source has led to tensions, notably with the US. President Donald Trump's administration has accused China of trying to conceal the initial outbreak. A biologist on the team travelling to Wuhan told the Associated Press news agency that the WHO was not seeking to apportion blame, but rather to prevent future outbreaks. ""It's really not about finding a guilty country,"" Fabian Leendertz of Germany's Robert Koch Institute said. ""It's about trying to understand what happened and then see if, based on those data, we can try to reduce the risk in the future."" Wuhan: Looking for answers in a city of silence China pushes for QR code based global travel Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Dr Leendertz said the aim was to find out when the virus began circulating and whether or not it originated in Wuhan. The mission was expected to last four or five weeks, he added. In the early days of the virus, it was traced to a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan, Hubei province, and it was suggested that this was where it made the leap from animals to humans. But experts now believe it may simply have been amplified there. Research suggests that coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades. Last December, a Chinese doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital - Li Wenliang - tried to warn fellow medics about a possible outbreak of a new disease, but was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and was investigated for ""spreading rumours"". Dr Li died in February after contracting the virus while treating patients in the city. It was initially believed that the virus originated at a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan In April, suspicions and allegations emerged that the virus might have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan. US State Department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. The office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. Recent reports in Chinese media have suggested that Covid-19 could have started outside China. But analysts say the reports are without foundation, and the campaign reflects anxiety within the leadership in Beijing about damage to the country's international reputation from the pandemic. Analysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent The question of an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus has become embroiled in international geopolitics and rows about the WHO. The Trump administration has always taken a hard line, arguing that the WHO has been too soft on China and citing examples of officials praising the Chinese regime for its actions such as locking down Wuhan, mass testing and its publication of the genetic code of the virus. However, lots of other countries also said there needed to be a proper inquiry - including Australia and the UK. The Associated Press revealed transcripts of video calls from WHO officials complaining back in January that they had not received the right data they needed from the Chinese authorities. A two-man WHO team that visited China this summer had difficulty negotiating access to Wuhan. This trip, when it does happen, will probably concentrate on fundamental biological questions: did the virus originally come from bats? Was there an ""intermediate host"" linking bats to humans? And were Wuhan wet markets at the centre of the initial outbreak? China's tackling of the developing crisis was praised in January by the head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan, who said the ""challenge is great but the response has been massive"". Beijing had helped slow the spread of the virus, the WHO said, by quickly volunteering to share its knowledge of the virus's genetic code. However, the US - among a number of other countries - raised questions about whether China was fully transparent when the virus first emerged there. Timeline: What did China do about early outbreak? In March, the head of the WHO in China, Dr Gauden Galea, told the BBC there were ""shortcomings"" in tackling the outbreak in the early days, but that experts would look at how issues could be avoided in the future. This video can not be played Dr Gauden Galea, WHO head in China: ""The country itself has already announced that there were shortcomings"" Mr Trump later attacked the WHO itself for being too ""China-centric"" in praising Beijing, saying the organisation ""really blew it"" with its early guidance during the outbreak. He announced that he was pulling the US out of the body and said funding would be redirected elsewhere. Trump's charges against the WHO However, US President-elect Joe Biden, who is due to be sworn in on 20 January, has since set up a foreign policy team tasked with keeping America in the WHO.

"11,000 positive Covid tests missing from Welsh data","A delay in reporting an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests in Wales has led to a big jump in case rates. Public Health Wales (PHW) said planned IT maintenance meant there was a ""significant under-reporting"" but anyone who tested positive had been contacted in the usual way. The delayed results came from Lighthouse Laboratories, which process about 70% of Wales' tests. The Welsh Conservatives said the news was ""staggering"". The 11,000 extra positive tests were taken between 9 and 15 December. PHW said the ""vast majority"" have been added to itsdashboard,,externalwhich records the figures, on Thursday. 52 more Covid deaths reported in Wales Covid: You asked and we answered How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The figures show an additional 4,221 cases have been added to the total for the week ending 11 December, an adjustment to what was reported on Wednesday. A total of 11,250 - including the usual daily cases - have been added, meaning the latest weekly case rates have increased as a result. Wales, already at its highest case rate so far, saw a jump to 530.2 cases per 100,000 for the most recent seven days, to 12 December. The case rate stood at 377.8 on Wednesday, although PHW warned this was an underestimation of what we should expect. The new figures showed the case rate for Merthyr Tydfil - already the highest in the UK - is now 1,032.7 cases per 100,000 - with 623 positive tests in the past seven days. Eight council areas in Wales are in the 10 hardest-hit areas in the UK for case rates in latest comparison. There are 14 out of 22 council areas which have their highest case rates so far - including Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. Three others would have reported their highest figures on Wednesday, had all the figures been available. PHW said its previous data collection system was ""on its last legs"". ""The system would collapse very frequently and it was proving to be unsustainable to run with its existing system,"" said PHW incident director Dr Giri Shankar. ""This was not an unplanned activity. We knew it was going to have an impact, therefore weconstantly communicated before it actually happened,externaland while it was happening and even after it had happened, to say that this is affecting the results."" The planned maintenance of the NHS Welsh Laboratory Information Management System (WLMS) ""has not affected individuals receiving their results"", PHW insisted. First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""The story is not about missing data or computer problems, it's about the seriousness of the situation. ""You were told in advance that this was going to happen. The data was never missing it was always there, waiting to be uploaded into the system."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""With positive cases in Wales rising to record levels it is crucial that the reporting of data is both timely and robust. ""The public need a complete and current picture of the situation to realise the gravity of what we are facing. ""We need urgent reassurance that the failings have been addressed.""

Fourteen guilty in 2015 Paris terror attacks trial,"This video can not be played The supermarket attacker's partner was caught on CCTV at an Istanbul airport days before the January 2015 attacks A Paris court has found 14 people guilty of involvement in a series of deadly militant Islamist attacks. The January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine, a policewoman and a Jewish supermarket left 17 people dead. Eleven defendants appeared in court for the verdict on Wednesday, and three were tried in absentia. One of those not in court wasHayat Boumeddiene, the fugitive partner of Amedy Coulibaly who was killed in the attack on the supermarket. Boumeddiene, who fled to Syria a week before the attacks, was found guilty of financing terrorism and belonging to a criminal terrorist network. She was handed a 30-year jail sentence. The main defendant in court,Ali Riza Polat,was found guilty of complicity in terrorist crime and also given a 30-year jail term. Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror Seven people detained over Paris knife attack Fourteen on trial over Charlie Hebdo massacre All 14 accomplices were found guilty on various charges, ranging from belonging to a criminal network to direct complicity in the January 2015 attacks. Terrorism charges were dropped for six of the 11 defendants in court who were found guilty of lesser crimes. The three men who carried out the 7-9 January 2015 attacks were killed and the accomplices, who first went on trial in early September, were accused of obtaining weapons or providing logistical support. They all denied the charges. The trial, which was delayed repeatedly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, came during a period when France once again faced a series of militant Islamist attacks and renewed debate over cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Polat, described as Coulibaly's right-hand man, had a pivotal role in preparing the attacks and a ""precise knowledge of the terrorist plan"", prosecutors said. The 35-year-old admitted taking part in ""scams"" but denied any knowledge of the plot. It is unknown whether the three who were tried in absentia are even alive.Boumeddienewas thought to have died in a US air strike, but a female jihadist told French security services she had escaped from a camp for militant detainees late last year. Boumeddiene took part in preparing the attacks and used a variety of methods to buy the weapons, prosecutors said. Boumeddiene was Coulibaly's partner who fled to Syria days before the January 2015 attacks Mohamed Belhoucine, a close friend of Coulibaly, was also tried in absentia and given life in jail.  He was accused of giving the killer the most significant operational support as well as acting as his religious mentor. His younger brother,Mehdi, also stood trial in absentia for helping Hayat Boumeddiene escape but was not sentenced after the court ruled he had already been judged in an earlier trial. The two brothers are believed to be dead. Several others, includingAmar RamdaniandNezar MickaÃ«l Pastor Alwatik, were found guilty of belonging to a criminal terrorist network. Alwatik was with Coulibaly in jail and his DNA was found on two pistols at his home, while Ramdani was accused of providing weapons. Both men, along withSaÃ¯d Makhlouf, were described as being part of a support group based in Lille in northern France. Four others, based in the Ardennes area of Belgium, were found guilty of being part of a criminal network and given sentences of between five and 10 years. These proceedings have been filmed for posterity, and the stories told by survivors and the bereaved will shape France's memory of these terrible events. But in other ways the country's biggest ever terrorist trial has failed to live up to its billing. Weeks of exhaustive examination of evidence has left too many questions unanswered. All those charged were allegedly involved in networks that led up to Amedy Coulibaly, the supermarket attacker. But what of the brothers SaÃ¯d and ChÃ©rif Kouachi - the Charlie Hebdo gunmen? How did they get their weapons? What was the role of far-right militant Claude Hermant, who has been tried separately on non-terrorist charges? Or the three absentees who fled to Syria just before the attacks? And who from al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group actually ordered the attacks, if anyone? Those on trial came across as petty criminals. They either knew nothing or were well practised in the art of obfuscation. All said they were completely unaware of Coulibaly's jihadist intentions, and the prosecution found it hard to prove otherwise. Cathartic the trial may have been - especially for those who still suffer from the memory of these events - the fact remains that not much light has been shed. On 7 January 2015, the two Kouachi brothers stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in the Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff and murdering 11 people including five of the satirical magazine's cartoonists. A police officer was murdered outside the building. The Kouachis were killed in a shootout with police two days later. Editor StÃ©phane Charbonnier was among five cartoonists On 8 January Coulibaly shot dead a woman police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. The next day he took hostages in Hyper Cacher, a kosher supermarket, killing an employee and three customers. Coulibaly was eventually shot dead in a police raid. Charlie Hebdo marked the start of the trial in September 2020 by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries. The following month, teacher Samuel Paty was murdered near his school by a Chechen, days after the teacher showed some of the cartoons to a class on free speech.

MI6 'may be committing crimes in UK',"MI6 has its headquarters in Vauxhall, London MI6 agents and informants may be committing crimes in the UK, a watchdog has revealed. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal disclosed the ruling despite government attempts to keep the matter secret. It also said questions raised should be disclosed to campaigners, who have been asking for greater legal clarity over what the intelligence agencies can do. It comes a day after the intelligence services watchdog raised its own questions about some MI6 activities. Since 1994, MI6 - the UK's foreign intelligence service - has been able to authorise people that it recruits to help the UK overseas to commit crimes as part of its targeting of threats to the UK. That power has long-been dubbed the ""James Bond clause,external"" - but it does not explicitly permit criminal operations in the UK. Unprecedented legislation that clarifies how agencies recruiting undercover informants can authorise them to commit crimes is reaching its final stages in Parliament. The disclosure of crimes potentially committed by people supplying MI6 with intelligence has come amid a long-running court battle over whether such secret undercover activity can ever be legal. New rules for MI5 and police to authorise crimes Power for MI5 informants to commit crimes 'lawful' While the legal battle has revealed details of how MI5, the domestic security service, authorises crimes by its informants, Wednesday's disclosure by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) is the first indication that MI6 may be doing the same. In the ruling, the IPT rejected secret submissions from the government to keep the entire matter behind closed doors. The disclosure came the day after the annual report of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, the watchdog that oversees the secret agencies, revealed that one of MI6's agents overseas may have gone rogue and committed serious crimes. The report says,externalthat in 2019 the secret agency had recruited a potential agent overseas and had sought a standard authorisation from the foreign secretary for the individual to potentially commit crimes as part of their work for the UK. The report does not state which foreign secretary it was. ""The Secret Intelligence Service [MI6] identified a risk that the agent may be involved in serious criminality overseas,"" said the report. ""SIS did not encourage, condone or approve any such criminality on the part of their agent. ""In their submission, SIS set out that they had secured the agent's cooperation on terms of full transparency about the activities in which the agent was involved. ""It included some clear 'red lines', setting out conduct that was not authorised and would result in the termination of SIS's relationship with the agent."" Six months later, when the authorisation had to be reviewed, it appeared that MI6 had concluded the asset had probably crossed those red lines - but they did not tell the foreign secretary, who had to sign off the continuing operation. ""We concluded that the renewal did not provide a comprehensive overview of available information which we believe would have provided the Secretary of State with a fuller and more balanced picture,"" said the watchdog. ""SIS immediately responded to these concerns by updating the FCO."" Campaigners behind the legal action say both revelations prove the public are being kept in the dark. But ministers saylegislation going through Parliamentwill provide clear safeguards for agents to commit crimes while undercover.

"'My season rail pass has risen Â£12,000 since 1997'","Rail fares will rise more than expected next year - although the new inflation-busting 2.6% increase is being delayed until 1 March. Regulated fares were expected to increase by 1.6% in January, as successive governments linked annual rises to July's RPI inflation rate. Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said the rise reflected ""unprecedented taxpayer support"" for rail this year. But unions said the rise was a ""kick in the teeth"" for passengers. An average increase of 2.6% across all fares will still be the lowest since 2017, and it will only last nine months, until the end of 2021. Had the rise come in in January it would have equated to a 1.95% jump across the whole year. Until 28 February season tickets holders can renew at existing prices and the cost of daily fares will stay the same. Rail travel has been badly hit during the coronavirus crisis, and Mr Heaton-Harris said delaying the price rise from January ""ensures passengers who need to travel have a better deal this year"". Regulated fares make up about half of fares and include season tickets on most commuter routes. But operators are expected to match their rises for unregulated fares. It means, for example, a Brighton-to-London annual season ticket going up by about Â£129 to Â£5,109, and a Manchester-to-Glasgow off-peak return rising by Â£2.30 to Â£90.60. Rail fares to rise despite passenger slump Government to cut Â£1bn from rail budget The rail minister said: ""By setting fares sensibly, and with the lowest actual increase for four years, we are ensuring that taxpayers are not overburdened for their unprecedented contribution, ensuring investment is focused on keeping vital services running and protecting frontline jobs."" The government took over rail franchise agreements from train operators in March, following the collapse in demand for travel caused by the virus crisis. This is expected to have cost about Â£10bn by mid-2021. The rise will help recover some of the significantly increased costs met by taxpayers to keep services running during the pandemic, Mr Heaton-Harris said. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators, acknowledged that ""passengers will be disappointed"" about the fares rise, adding that ""governments must ultimately decide the balance between how much farepayers and taxpayers pay to run the railway"". She added that industry was committed to working with the government to make the fares and ticketing system easier to use. The department has written to all operators telling them to begin immediate work on developing flexible season tickets, allowing people who travel two or three days a week to save money compared with buying daily tickets. Firms have been told these must be introduced across England by the end of next year. Anthony Smith, chief executive of consumer watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""This fare increase makes it even more important that, when travel restrictions start to be lifted, the industry is able to attract people back by offering fares that match how we know people hope to live, work and travel in future."" Union leaders condemned the rise, with Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association calling it a ""kick in the teeth for passengers"". He continued: ""Ministers are well aware that millions have suffered this year with the uncertainty of employment, a changing picture on furlough provision, pay cuts, wages freezes and lost jobs. So, to reach for a hike in fares of this size is both extortionate and plain daft."" Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said ticket prices were being ""forced up to subsidise private profit. The time is right for a publicly-owned railway system that delivers reasonable fares for our people as the public and the economy tries to recover and shake off the Covid crisis next year."" Update 8 January 2021: This story has been amended to remove an example of a season ticket price increase faced by one passenger. The example of a first class ticket was considered to be unrepresentative of the situation faced by the average commuter.

Fourteen guilty in 2015 Paris terror attacks trialThe deadly attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish supermarket shook France.Europe,"This video can not be played The supermarket attacker's partner was caught on CCTV at an Istanbul airport days before the January 2015 attacks A Paris court has found 14 people guilty of involvement in a series of deadly militant Islamist attacks. The January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine, a policewoman and a Jewish supermarket left 17 people dead. Eleven defendants appeared in court for the verdict on Wednesday, and three were tried in absentia. One of those not in court wasHayat Boumeddiene, the fugitive partner of Amedy Coulibaly who was killed in the attack on the supermarket. Boumeddiene, who fled to Syria a week before the attacks, was found guilty of financing terrorism and belonging to a criminal terrorist network. She was handed a 30-year jail sentence. The main defendant in court,Ali Riza Polat,was found guilty of complicity in terrorist crime and also given a 30-year jail term. Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror Seven people detained over Paris knife attack Fourteen on trial over Charlie Hebdo massacre All 14 accomplices were found guilty on various charges, ranging from belonging to a criminal network to direct complicity in the January 2015 attacks. Terrorism charges were dropped for six of the 11 defendants in court who were found guilty of lesser crimes. The three men who carried out the 7-9 January 2015 attacks were killed and the accomplices, who first went on trial in early September, were accused of obtaining weapons or providing logistical support. They all denied the charges. The trial, which was delayed repeatedly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, came during a period when France once again faced a series of militant Islamist attacks and renewed debate over cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Polat, described as Coulibaly's right-hand man, had a pivotal role in preparing the attacks and a ""precise knowledge of the terrorist plan"", prosecutors said. The 35-year-old admitted taking part in ""scams"" but denied any knowledge of the plot. It is unknown whether the three who were tried in absentia are even alive.Boumeddienewas thought to have died in a US air strike, but a female jihadist told French security services she had escaped from a camp for militant detainees late last year. Boumeddiene took part in preparing the attacks and used a variety of methods to buy the weapons, prosecutors said. Boumeddiene was Coulibaly's partner who fled to Syria days before the January 2015 attacks Mohamed Belhoucine, a close friend of Coulibaly, was also tried in absentia and given life in jail.  He was accused of giving the killer the most significant operational support as well as acting as his religious mentor. His younger brother,Mehdi, also stood trial in absentia for helping Hayat Boumeddiene escape but was not sentenced after the court ruled he had already been judged in an earlier trial. The two brothers are believed to be dead. Several others, includingAmar RamdaniandNezar MickaÃ«l Pastor Alwatik, were found guilty of belonging to a criminal terrorist network. Alwatik was with Coulibaly in jail and his DNA was found on two pistols at his home, while Ramdani was accused of providing weapons. Both men, along withSaÃ¯d Makhlouf, were described as being part of a support group based in Lille in northern France. Four others, based in the Ardennes area of Belgium, were found guilty of being part of a criminal network and given sentences of between five and 10 years. These proceedings have been filmed for posterity, and the stories told by survivors and the bereaved will shape France's memory of these terrible events. But in other ways the country's biggest ever terrorist trial has failed to live up to its billing. Weeks of exhaustive examination of evidence has left too many questions unanswered. All those charged were allegedly involved in networks that led up to Amedy Coulibaly, the supermarket attacker. But what of the brothers SaÃ¯d and ChÃ©rif Kouachi - the Charlie Hebdo gunmen? How did they get their weapons? What was the role of far-right militant Claude Hermant, who has been tried separately on non-terrorist charges? Or the three absentees who fled to Syria just before the attacks? And who from al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group actually ordered the attacks, if anyone? Those on trial came across as petty criminals. They either knew nothing or were well practised in the art of obfuscation. All said they were completely unaware of Coulibaly's jihadist intentions, and the prosecution found it hard to prove otherwise. Cathartic the trial may have been - especially for those who still suffer from the memory of these events - the fact remains that not much light has been shed. On 7 January 2015, the two Kouachi brothers stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in the Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff and murdering 11 people including five of the satirical magazine's cartoonists. A police officer was murdered outside the building. The Kouachis were killed in a shootout with police two days later.

"11,000 positive Covid tests missing from Welsh data30 more deaths and 530 cases were reported on Wednesday despite the delay of accurate data.Wales","A delay in reporting an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests in Wales has led to a big jump in case rates. Public Health Wales (PHW) said planned IT maintenance meant there was a ""significant under-reporting"" but anyone who tested positive had been contacted in the usual way. The delayed results came from Lighthouse Laboratories, which process about 70% of Wales' tests. The Welsh Conservatives said the news was ""staggering"". The 11,000 extra positive tests were taken between 9 and 15 December. PHW said the ""vast majority"" have been added to itsdashboard,,externalwhich records the figures, on Thursday. 52 more Covid deaths reported in Wales Covid: You asked and we answered How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The figures show an additional 4,221 cases have been added to the total for the week ending 11 December, an adjustment to what was reported on Wednesday. A total of 11,250 - including the usual daily cases - have been added, meaning the latest weekly case rates have increased as a result. Wales, already at its highest case rate so far, saw a jump to 530.2 cases per 100,000 for the most recent seven days, to 12 December. The case rate stood at 377.8 on Wednesday, although PHW warned this was an underestimation of what we should expect. The new figures showed the case rate for Merthyr Tydfil - already the highest in the UK - is now 1,032.7 cases per 100,000 - with 623 positive tests in the past seven days. Eight council areas in Wales are in the 10 hardest-hit areas in the UK for case rates in latest comparison. There are 14 out of 22 council areas which have their highest case rates so far - including Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. Three others would have reported their highest figures on Wednesday, had all the figures been available. PHW said its previous data collection system was ""on its last legs"". ""The system would collapse very frequently and it was proving to be unsustainable to run with its existing system,"" said PHW incident director Dr Giri Shankar. ""This was not an unplanned activity. We knew it was going to have an impact, therefore weconstantly communicated before it actually happened,externaland while it was happening and even after it had happened, to say that this is affecting the results."" The planned maintenance of the NHS Welsh Laboratory Information Management System (WLMS) ""has not affected individuals receiving their results"", PHW insisted. First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""The story is not about missing data or computer problems, it's about the seriousness of the situation. ""You were told in advance that this was going to happen. The data was never missing it was always there, waiting to be uploaded into the system."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""With positive cases in Wales rising to record levels it is crucial that the reporting of data is both timely and robust. ""The public need a complete and current picture of the situation to realise the gravity of what we are facing. ""We need urgent reassurance that the failings have been addressed.""

Tom Cruise 'shouts at film crew' over Covid safetyA recording emerges of the Mission: Impossible star apparently letting fly about social distancing.,"A recording has emerged of Tom Cruise apparently shouting at workers on the set of Mission: Impossible 7 and threatening to fire them if they broke Covid-19 guidelines.

'Narrow path' available for Brexit deal - EU chief,"This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not"". A ""narrow path"" has opened up for the UK and EU to strike a post-Brexit trade deal, the president of the European Commission has said. Ursula von der Leyen said the ""next few days are going to be decisive"", with just two weeks left before the UK quits EU trading rules. She said differences over enforcing a deal are ""largely being resolved,"" but talks over fishing remain ""difficult"". PM Boris Johnson told MPs there was ""every opportunity"" to reach a deal. Officials from both sides are continuing talks in Brussels, as they race to strike a deal before the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Despite weeks of intensive talks, they have remained stuck over fishing rights and how far the UK should be able to depart from EU rules. UK wants EU trade deal but not 'at any cost' - PM What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Updating the European Parliament on an EU leaders' summit last week, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""As things stand, I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not. ""But there is a path to an agreement now - the path may be very narrow, but it is there."" She said that negotiators had agreed a ""strong mechanism"" to ensure neither side lowers their environmental or social standards, which was a ""big step forwards"". But she added differences remained over how to ""future proof"" rules in this area, although disagreements over how to enforce a deal ""by now are largely being resolved"". On Wednesday Mr Johnson's spokesman said: ""We have made some progress in some areas, but it still remains that there are some significant gaps."" He added that it is ""still the case"" the prime minister views no deal as ""the most likely outcome"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Speaking after Mrs von der Leyen, Mr Johnson said: ""There's every opportunity, every hope I have, that our friends and partners across the Channel will see sense and do a deal. ""All that it takes is for them to understand that the UK has a natural right, like every other country, to be able to want to control its own laws and its own fishing grounds."" He told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions that ""whatever happens in the next few days,"" the UK will ""prosper mightily"" whether a deal is found or not. Mrs von der Leyen also reported progress in another area which has proved contentious - agreed rules on how and when each side can give government subsidies to private firms. She confirmed the two sides were now trying to agree ""common principles"" for when subsidies could be offered. At an earlier stage in talks, the EU had insisted the UK should follow its current and future ""state aid"" rules in this area - a demand rejected by the UK. The German politician added that there had been progress on ""guarantees of domestic enforcement"" of the rules, as well as allowing both sides to ""autonomously"" take action where disagreements arise. However, she was more downbeat on fishing, where the two sides are haggling over access to each other's waters for their fishermen after 1 January. ""In all honesty, it sometimes feels that we will not be able to resolve this question,"" she said, but added that continuing the talks was the ""only responsible"" course of action. She added the EU respected British ""sovereignty"" over its waters, but needed ""predictability and stability"" for European fishing fleets. Meanwhile, it has been announced that both Houses of Parliament will begin their Christmas recess at the end of Thursday's sitting. But No 10 said MPs and peers could be recalled to Westminster to vote on legislation to implement a deal before the end of the Brexit transition. On Tuesday, Commons leader Jacob-Rees Mogg said Parliament would ideally need six days to pass any such law, but this period could be ""truncated"" if required. Any potential deal would also need to be voted on by the European Parliament and potentially EU national parliaments before it can fully come into force. EU leaders can in theory decide to provisionally apply any agreement and hold these votes after 31 December, but it would be unpopular among MEPs. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"Pollution a factor in girl's death, inquest finds","Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road in south-east London A nine-year-old girl who died following an asthma attack has become the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death. Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London, died in 2013. Southwark Coroner's Court found that air pollution ""made a material contribution"" to Ella's death. Prof Gavin Shaddick, a government adviser on air pollution, called it ""a landmark decision"". At the conclusion of the two-week inquest, coroner Philip Barlow said Ella had been exposed to ""excessive"" levels of pollution. The inquest heard that in the three years before her death, she had multiple seizures and was admitted to hospital 27 times. 'Did air pollution kill my daughter?' Girl with asthma 'living on knife edge' before death New inquest into girl's 'pollution' death Delivering a narrative verdict, Mr Barlow said levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) near Ella's home exceeded World Health Organization and European Union guidelines. He added: ""There was a recognised failure to reduce the levels of nitrogen dioxide, which possibly contributed to her death. ""There was also a lack of information given to Ella's mother that possibly contributed to her death."" Giving his conclusion over almost an hour, the coroner said: ""I will conclude that Ella died of asthma, contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution."" Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said she did not know how dangerous local levels of pollution were before her daughter's death Ella's mother Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, said: ""We've got the justice for her which she so deserved. ""But also it's about other children still, as we walk around our city of high levels of air pollution."" Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said she was ""shocked"" by how ""decisive and comprehensive"" the findings were. Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit, Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah had told the inquest. As a six-year-old, she had to be placed in a medically induced coma for three days to try to stabilise her condition. By the summer of 2012, Ella was classified as disabled and her mother said she often had to carry her by piggyback to get her around. Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said: ""I think people need to understand when Ella was rushed into hospital, a lot of the time she was barely breathing. ""It was an emergency, cardiac arrest."" Ella died in the early hours of 15 February 2013, following a severe asthma attack. Ella was classified as disabled due to her respiratory problems A 2018 report found unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack. The report's author Prof Sir Stephen Holgate said Ella had been ""living on a knife edge"" in the months before her death. The inquest heard Ella's family did not know of the risks posed by air pollution. This is an historic verdict. Typically, experts refer to air pollution being ""associated"" with premature deaths because they can't be sure any one individual's death was caused or partly caused by dirty air. This case pins Ella's untimely death partly on to the air she breathed. It will heighten the debate about social equity in the UK. The poorest tend to suffer the worst air, whilst - on a national basis - the richest tend to drive furthest. Campaigners now want emergency action - including expanding London's clean-air zone for vehicles out to the M25 and making Britain's streets better for walking and cycling. But there are myriad sources of pollution. Gas boilers, construction equipment, paint and dust from brakes and tyres all contribute. Ultimately, it won't be possible to completely clean the air in some of the UK's big cities. Ahead of the conclusion of the inquest, Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote to Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah calling her ""a hero"". The Hollywood actor and former governor of California, who has long been an advocate for better clean-air standards, thanked her for ""exposing air pollution for the killer it is"". Prof Shaddick, who leads Exeter University's data science department, said he hoped the inquest ruling ""makes improving the air we breathe easier to achieve in the future"". ""It's just regrettable it's taken this case to achieve it,"" he added. Sadiq Khan, who as mayor of London was named as an interested party in the inquest, called the result ""a landmark moment"". Mr Khan said: ""Today must be a turning point so that other families do not have to suffer the same heartbreak as Ella's family. ""Ministers and the previous mayor have acted too slowly in the past, but they must now learn the lessons from the coroner's ruling."" Ella lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road, one of the capital's busiest roads Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, called on the government to outline a public health plan to protect against ""toxic air"" immediately. She said: ""Our hearts go out to Ella's family who have fought tirelessly for today's landmark outcome. ""Today's verdict sets the precedent for a seismic shift in the pace and extent to which the government, local authorities and clinicians must now work together to tackle the country's air pollution health crisis."" Responding to the verdict, a government spokesman said: ""Our thoughts remain with Ella's family and friends. ""We are delivering a Â£3.8bn plan to clean up transport and tackle NO2 pollution and going further in protecting communities from air pollution."" The mayor of Lewisham, Damien Egan, said Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah's campaign for clean air had been ""hugely impactful"". He added: ""Our hope is that today's ruling is the evidence needed to effect lasting change, to finally secure a national commitment to tackling air pollution in a meaningful way.""

"Paris authorities fined for hiring too many womenCity mayor Anne Hidalgo mocks the ""absurd"" penalty for breaking equal employment rules.","Anne Hidalgo - ""joy"" at being fined ""Too feminist"" - Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo's mocking response after being told she had broken the law by naming too many women to senior posts. Eleven women and five men had been promoted in 2018, breaching a national 2013 rule designed to bring about gender parity in employment. The Paris authorities are being fined â¬90,000 ($109,000; Â£81,000) by the public service ministry. ""I am happy to announce we have been fined,"" Ms Hidalgo said. The 2013 rule meant no more than 60% of new appointments to management positions in public service should go to one sex. Ms Hidalgo's recruitment drive saw 69% of the jobs go to women. Addressing a council meeting, the Socialist mayor joked: ""The management of the city hall has, all of a sudden, become far too feminist."" Feminine job titles get go-ahead in France Covid has 'devastating' impact on gender equality BBC 100 Women 2020: Who is on the list?

This video can not be played Paris Deputy Mayor Audrey Pulvar says it ""will be an honour to pay the fine"" ""This fine is obviously absurd, unfair, irresponsible and dangerous,"" she said. France's Public Service Minister AmÃ©lie de Montchalin responded on Twitter, pointing out that the law had been changed since 2018. In 2019, fines were dropped for appointing too many women or too many men to new jobs, as long as the overall gender balance was not affected.

WhatsApp rumours fear over BAME vaccine take up,"Waiting to get the Covid vaccine in Barnet, north London People from ethnic minorities in the UK are significantly less likely to take the coronavirus vaccine - with warnings of targeted online scaremongering. A study from the Royal Society for Public Health found 57% of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people said they would take the vaccine. This compared with 79% of white people who would take a Covid vaccine. Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi warned of the impact of conspiracy theories being shared online. ""Anti-vaccination messages have been specifically targeted"" at some ethnic and religious communities, said Christina Marriott, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH). Dame Donna Kinnair saw first-hand the impact of Covid on BAME communities ""People send WhatsApps, videos, all kinds of messages - if you don't know where that's coming from then it is very likely to be inaccurate,"" said the vaccine deployment minister, Mr Zahawi, asking people to look at health information from official sources rather than rumours. ""This is an incredibly well developed scientific endeavour and I would urge everyone to take the information, read it and then make your mind up,"" he said. BBC Asian Network: Vaccine advice in South Asian languages Why are there higher Covid death rates among BAME people? Vaccine rumours debunked on 'altering DNA' Vaccines: Your questions answered by an expert Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said the apparent reluctance among BAME communities flew in the face of those most in need of vaccinations - which she had seen first-hand. ""For someone like me, who stood in the Nightingale, and saw row after row of BAME patients being ventilated - and seeing how it disproportionately affected people from the BAME community - I'd be urging everybody to take the vaccine,"" she said. Among thevaccine rumours, rejected as groundless by independent health experts, have been suggestions that vaccines could change someone's DNA or that it would inject a microchip. Rumours about vaccines is a problem for many online platforms, not just WhatsApp, - but the messaging service is using spam detection technology to control how information is shared and has partnered with reliable sources of information, including the World Health Organization, on a chatbot for Covid questions. Jabeer Butt, head of the Race Equality Foundation, said the findings on a lower ethnic minority take up were ""particularly worrying"". He warned the ""Covid vaccine may not reach the communities"" who had been worst affected and most ""disproportionately impacted"" by the virus. The study, based on a survey of more than 2,000 adults across the UK, revealed different levels of trust in the vaccination process among social and ethnic groups. On average, more than three-quarters of people would take a coronavirus vaccine if they were advised to by a doctor or health professional. People on lower incomes also seemed less confident about a vaccine, with a wealth gap in take-up: 84% of high earners planning to get vaccinated, compared with 70% of low earners. 55% of the Asian community would take a vaccine, the lowest acceptance 14% in London were ""very unlikely"" to get vaccinated, the highest region for rejections Women more reluctant to take the vaccine than men Ms Marriott, chief executive of the RSPH, said the findings were ""highly concerning"" that people from ethnic minorities and on low incomes were less willing to be vaccinated. ""These are exactly the groups which have suffered most through Covid. ""They continue to be most at risk of getting ill and most at risk of dying. So the government, the NHS and local public health must rapidly and proactively work with these communities,"" she said.

MI6 'may be committing crimes in UK'A watchdog discloses the ruling despite government attempts to keep the matter secret.UK,"MI6 has its headquarters in Vauxhall, London MI6 agents and informants may be committing crimes in the UK, a watchdog has revealed. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal disclosed the ruling despite government attempts to keep the matter secret. It also said questions raised should be disclosed to campaigners, who have been asking for greater legal clarity over what the intelligence agencies can do. It comes a day after the intelligence services watchdog raised its own questions about some MI6 activities. Since 1994, MI6 - the UK's foreign intelligence service - has been able to authorise people that it recruits to help the UK overseas to commit crimes as part of its targeting of threats to the UK. That power has long-been dubbed the ""James Bond clause,external"" - but it does not explicitly permit criminal operations in the UK. Unprecedented legislation that clarifies how agencies recruiting undercover informants can authorise them to commit crimes is reaching its final stages in Parliament. The disclosure of crimes potentially committed by people supplying MI6 with intelligence has come amid a long-running court battle over whether such secret undercover activity can ever be legal. New rules for MI5 and police to authorise crimes Power for MI5 informants to commit crimes 'lawful' While the legal battle has revealed details of how MI5, the domestic security service, authorises crimes by its informants, Wednesday's disclosure by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) is the first indication that MI6 may be doing the same. In the ruling, the IPT rejected secret submissions from the government to keep the entire matter behind closed doors. The disclosure came the day after the annual report of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, the watchdog that oversees the secret agencies, revealed that one of MI6's agents overseas may have gone rogue and committed serious crimes. The report says,externalthat in 2019 the secret agency had recruited a potential agent overseas and had sought a standard authorisation from the foreign secretary for the individual to potentially commit crimes as part of their work for the UK. The report does not state which foreign secretary it was. ""The Secret Intelligence Service [MI6] identified a risk that the agent may be involved in serious criminality overseas,"" said the report. ""SIS did not encourage, condone or approve any such criminality on the part of their agent. ""In their submission, SIS set out that they had secured the agent's cooperation on terms of full transparency about the activities in which the agent was involved. ""It included some clear 'red lines', setting out conduct that was not authorised and would result in the termination of SIS's relationship with the agent."" Six months later, when the authorisation had to be reviewed, it appeared that MI6 had concluded the asset had probably crossed those red lines - but they did not tell the foreign secretary, who had to sign off the continuing operation. ""We concluded that the renewal did not provide a comprehensive overview of available information which we believe would have provided the Secretary of State with a fuller and more balanced picture,"" said the watchdog. ""SIS immediately responded to these concerns by updating the FCO."" Campaigners behind the legal action say both revelations prove the public are being kept in the dark. But ministers saylegislation going through Parliamentwill provide clear safeguards for agents to commit crimes while undercover.

"Hyde Park bomb family awarded Â£715k damagesThe ruling follows a civil case brought against John Downey, who was involved in the 1982 attack.Northern Ireland","Four Household Cavalry soldiers died in the IRA's Hyde Park bomb attack as they rode to the Changing of Guard ceremony in Whitehall The family of one of the four soldiers killed in the Hyde Park bombing in July 1982 has been awarded Â£715,000 in damages. The ruling followed a civil case brought against John Downey, one of those involved in the IRA attack. Four members of the Household Cavalry died in the blast in London. Last year, a High Court judge ruled that John Downey was an""active participant""in the bombing. On Wednesday, the court ruled that an award of ""substantial damages"" to ""mark society's condemnation"" of the bombing can only be made if either parliament or the supreme court allowed it. However, the court awarded Â£715,000  in the case of Sarah Jane Young, daughter of one of the soldiers, L/Cpl Jeffrey Young, who was 20 when he was killed. This is in recognition of her father's loss of earnings in what is known as a dependency claim. Most of the amount will go to Ms Young's mother for her past care. A judge ruled John Downey was an ""active participant"" in the bombing A criminal case against Mr Downey in relation to the bombingcollapsed in 2014after it emerged he had received a guarantee that he would not face trial. Mr Downey, who is from Donegal, has denied murdering the soldiers and conspiring to cause an explosion. Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, 36, Lt Anthony Daly, 23 and Trooper Simon Tipper, 19, were also killed by the car bomb as they rode through central London to attend the Changing the Guard ceremony. Two of the soldiers died instantly in the blast, while L/Cpl Young and Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Bright died within days. Sarah Jane Young as a child pictured alongside her father, L/Cpl Jeffrey Young Earlier this month, a remote High Court hearing considered how much compensation the families of the victims should be awarded. A lawyer for Ms Young told the court that relatives had been ""failed"" by the state in their search for justice. She argued that Ms Young, who was four at the time, had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression as a result of the bombing.

Dutch prosecutors find Trump Twitter was hacked,"Dutch prosecutors have found a hacker did successfully log in to Donald Trump's Twitter account by guessing his password - ""MAGA2020!"" But they will not be punishing Victor Gevers, who was acting ""ethically"". Mr Gevers shared what he said were screenshots of the inside of Mr Trump's account on 22 October, during the final stages of the US presidential election. But at the time, the White House denied it had been hacked and Twitter said it had no evidence of it. In reference to the latest development, Twitter said: ""We've seen no evidence to corroborate this claim, including from the article published in the Netherlands today. We proactively implemented account security measures for a designated group of high-profile, election-related Twitter accounts in the United States, including federal branches of government."" The White House has not responded to a request for further comment. Mr Gevers had previously shared this screenshot that appeared to show him editing Donald Trump's Twitter profile information Mr Gevers said he was very happy with the outcome. ""This is not just about my work but all volunteers who look for vulnerabilities in the internet,"" he said. The well respected cyber-security researcher said he had been conducting a semi-regular sweep of the Twitter accounts of high-profile US election candidates, on 16 October, when he had guessed President Trump's password. Victor Gevers has been discovering security flaws in software and websites for 22 years Dutch police said: ""The hacker released the login himself.

Hyde Park bomb family awarded Â£715k damages,"Four Household Cavalry soldiers died in the IRA's Hyde Park bomb attack as they rode to the Changing of Guard ceremony in Whitehall The family of one of the four soldiers killed in the Hyde Park bombing in July 1982 has been awarded Â£715,000 in damages. The ruling followed a civil case brought against John Downey, one of those involved in the IRA attack. Four members of the Household Cavalry died in the blast in London. Last year, a High Court judge ruled that John Downey was an""active participant""in the bombing. On Wednesday, the court ruled that an award of ""substantial damages"" to ""mark society's condemnation"" of the bombing can only be made if either parliament or the supreme court allowed it. However, the court awarded Â£715,000  in the case of Sarah Jane Young, daughter of one of the soldiers, L/Cpl Jeffrey Young, who was 20 when he was killed. This is in recognition of her father's loss of earnings in what is known as a dependency claim. Most of the amount will go to Ms Young's mother for her past care. A judge ruled John Downey was an ""active participant"" in the bombing A criminal case against Mr Downey in relation to the bombingcollapsed in 2014after it emerged he had received a guarantee that he would not face trial. Mr Downey, who is from Donegal, has denied murdering the soldiers and conspiring to cause an explosion. Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, 36, Lt Anthony Daly, 23 and Trooper Simon Tipper, 19, were also killed by the car bomb as they rode through central London to attend the Changing the Guard ceremony. Two of the soldiers died instantly in the blast, while L/Cpl Young and Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Bright died within days. Sarah Jane Young as a child pictured alongside her father, L/Cpl Jeffrey Young Earlier this month, a remote High Court hearing considered how much compensation the families of the victims should be awarded. A lawyer for Ms Young told the court that relatives had been ""failed"" by the state in their search for justice. She argued that Ms Young, who was four at the time, had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression as a result of the bombing. The court was told she had heard the explosion from a nearby nursery and saw injured soldiers returning to Knightsbridge barracks.

Heathrow wins court battle to build third runway,"The Supreme Court has breathed new life into plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport. The scheme was previously blocked by the Court of Appeal, who said the governmentâs airports strategy didnât meet up-to-date UK climate targets. But the Supreme Court has ruled the strategy was legitimately based on previous, less stringent, climate targets at the time it was agreed. The firm behind Heathrow can now seek planning permission for the runway. But it still faces major obstacles, including having to persuade a public enquiry of the case for expansion. And if planning inspectors approve the scheme, the government will still have the final say. What are the Heathrow third runway plans? Ministers have been advised by their Climate Change Committee that, in order to keep emissions down, Heathrow should only expand if regional airports contract. This will pose a problem for a government thatâs committed to improving infrastructure away from the South-East. And a full application from Heathrow Airport may still be more than a year away as the airport re-assembles a planning team and strives to cope with Covid. A Heathrow spokesman called the decision to lift the ban ""the right result for the country"". ""Only by expanding the UK's hub airport can we connect all of Britain to all of the growing markets of the world, helping to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in every nation and region of our country. ""Demand for aviation will recover from Covid-19, and the additional capacity at an expanded Heathrow will allow Britain as a sovereign nation to compete for trade and win against our rivals in France and Germany."" The business coalition Back Heathrow said it would boost the UK once it stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. âIt is a huge moment for the UK as it moves towards an uncertain Brexit, but now with the confidence that international trade could be boosted by additional capacity at the countryâs only hub airport,"" said executive director Parmjit Dhanda. âWe believe this news reflects a unity of purpose between the highest court in the land and our parliament â which has already delivered a majority of 296 for sustainable expansion at Heathrow,â he added. The ruling is a blow for campaigners whoâve been hounding the runway project in the courts because they say it breaches the governmentâs policy of removing almost all carbon emissions from the economy by 2050 â the so-called Net Zero commitment. But environmentalists still plan to challenge every stage of the planning application in the courts â including at the European Court of Human Rights, where campaigners will argue that relying on outdated emissions targets is inconsistent with the right to life. The old UK emissions strategy was based on the target of holding global temperature rise to 2C, whereas the latest government aim is a maximum temperature rise of 1.5C. This means emissions must be cut by more than previously thought. On the back of the previous Appeal Court ruling in their favour, environmentalists have launched copy-cat legal actions against plans for other government projects that will fuel climate change. These include the Â£27bn roads programme; expanding North Sea oil and gas; and a proposed Cumbria coal mine. They fear the Supreme Court ruling signals that judges arenât willing to hold the governmentâs feet to the fire on climate policy - as the Dutch Supreme Court did last year, when it ruled that the countryâs failure to act urgently against climate changeconstituted a violation of human rights. Similar cases are underway in several other nations where citizens want politicians to keep promises to tackle emissions. The Supreme Court case was taken by Friends of the Earth in conjunction with a tiny NGO called Plan B. Its founder Tim Crosland told BBC News: âThis is a terrible verdict â the runway plan is in clear breach of climate change targets and it canât be allowed to go ahead. I canât imagine how the judges came to this decision.â Paul McGuinness from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, said before the court ruling that a decision in favour of Heathrow wouldnât change the underlying case against the proposed runway. He argued: âHeathrow expansion canât proceed. Putting aside investors' lack of appetite to find new money - even to maintain the airport as a going concern through the pandemic - expanding Heathrow no longer ticks any boxes. âSince the Airports Commission recommended Heathrow expansion, five years ago, the world has changed and the assessments on noise, air quality and carbon have been exposed as inadequate.â Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a long-term opponent of Heathrow expansion, and significantly, his government didnât join the appeal against the previous Appeal Court verdict, which was made by Heathrow Airport plc. A government spokesperson said before the verdict: âWe have always been clear that Heathrow expansion is a private sector projectâ¯which must meetâ¯strict criteria on air quality, noise and climate change, as well as being privatelyâ¯financed, affordable, and delivered in the best interest of consumersâ.

"Johnson urges shorter, smaller Christmas""Just because you can do something doesn't mean it's sensible in any way,"" Prof Chris Whitty warns.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'A shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas' Boris Johnson has urged people to keep Christmas celebrations ""short"" and ""small"" to reduce the risk of spreading Covid over the festive period. Restrictions will still be relaxed between 23 and 27 December - but the PM said people should ""think hard"" before meeting friends and family. Three households will be allowed to meet - apart from in Waleswhere a law change will allow just two households. And in Scotlandpeople are being asked to only meet on one of the five days,external. It comes as the UK recorded a further 25,161 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, along with 612 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Patients face 12-hour wait as hospital struggles UK coronavirus cases up by 18,450 on Tuesday Mr Johnson said the law was remaining the same in England but ""a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas"". Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, he said the rules allowing three households to meet over five days were ""maximums, not targets to aim for"". ""It's always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet,"" he said. After the news conference, the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments issued a joint statement saying this ""cannot be a normal Christmas"" and that they ""strongly"" recommended people stayed at home. They advised people who were visiting others to stop unnecessary social contact as soon as possible and for at least five days before travelling. No one should visit another household if they were ill or self-isolating, they said. Mr Johnson also advised people to avoid travelling from ""high prevalence"" areas to those with lower rates of coronavirus and not to stay away from home overnight if possible. This video can not be played Professor Whitty: 'You wouldn't drive down an icy road at 70 mph' Mr Johnson urged caution over seeing elderly or vulnerable relatives, saying that since the vaccine was being rolled out to these groups ""by the early months of the new year"", they would be able to meet people more safely soon. ""Whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales, and no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the new year,"" he added. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned: ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean it's sensible in any way."" ""Any kind of period where people come together in groups that otherwise wouldn't meet leads to an increase in risks and that will lead to an increase in hospitalisations and deaths,"" he said. He urged people to keep their Christmas celebrations small, short and local to reduce these risks. The four UK nations previously agreed a set of rules for the festive period, which has been set down in legislation and is not expected to change in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland - even though the guidance has been updated. Between 23 and 27 December, you can form a""Christmas bubble"",externalcomprised of people from three households You can travel between tiers and between UK nations to meet your bubble You can only meet in homes, places of worship or public outdoor spaces - not pubs or restaurants You can meet people outside your bubble according to your local rules But in Wales new guidance on households mixing will be put into law, meaning only two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone - will be able to form a Christmas bubble. UK leaders had come under pressure to review the guidance for Christmas amid rising infections. In November, all four nations agreed that three households would be able to form a Christmas bubble between 23 and 27 December, allowing them to mix indoors and stay overnight. However, the Welsh government has now decided Christmas bubbles should be limited to two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced the country wouldhead back into a stay-at-home lockdownas soon as the Christmas period was over. RESTRICTIONS LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, saidher ""strong recommendation"" was to ""spend Christmas in your own home with your own household"", She added: ""We will set out advice if you are living in any of the nations in one of the highest level of protection - which in England and London is tier three - then we don't think you should be travelling to other parts of the UK."" Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said the public must take ""all and every precaution"" at Christmas and proposals for further restrictions would be brought forward on Thursday. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised governments needed to provide ""flexibility"" over Christmas and that people needed to take personal responsibility for their actions. As families decide what to do this Christmas, legally the options are - for the most part - the same. However, the reality feels very different following today's stern warnings and with a changing health picture. And while there have been variations in terms of detail and emphasis from UK leaders, the overall memo was essentially this: be very careful, be very cautious. And just because you can take advantage of an easing in the rules doesn't mean you should. The planned relaxation was never meant to be a free-for-all. But with this toughened guidance many may feel their options have narrowed. And for the politicians - they now have to a sell a more complicated public health message. You can take advantage of a relaxation in the rules. But maybe, please - don't. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour would support tougher restrictions over Christmas. ""We would have liked to have seen a toughening up today from the prime minister - perhaps something like what we've seen in Wales, reducing households,"" he told the BBC. ""I think he's going to have to go further in the coming days."" An information campaign is expected to be launched in the days running up to Christmas, with people being urged to think carefully before bubbling with elderly or at-risk relatives. Scientists at the University of Bristol studied the implications - and early results, yet to be formally published, indicate the fewer people the better, from the point of view of containing the disease. If a single-person household joins another household of any size, the impact on infection rates would be marginal, they suggest. But if all households in the UK paired up with one other, each bubble would contain an average of 4.7 people. That would lead to a reproduction (R) number within households of between 1.9-2.4. And an R number is above one means the disease is escalating. Read more here The latest advice comes aftertwo leading journals said the ""rash"" decision to ease restrictions would ""cost many lives"". In a joint editorial, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal said demand on the NHS was increasing, adding that a newstrain of coronavirushad introduced ""further potential jeopardy"". Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the ""major driver"" for how much the disease spread over the  Christmas period was the infection prevalence - and that the current prevalence had started to rise ""really quite rapidly in some places"". ""When the rules were made about Christmas, we didn't know what that prevalence was going to be,"" Prof Medley told the Today programme. As for the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed, he said: ""We don't have much headroom.""

Appeals refused in PC Andrew Harper death case,"PC Andrew Harper got married four weeks before he was killed The killers of PC Andrew Harper will not have their sentences increased after judges rejected the attorney general's case that they were ""unduly lenient"". Suella Braverman QC had argued Henry Long, Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole should be handed longer jail terms. She said the sentences of the three menhad caused ""widespread public concern"". PC Harper died after he was dragged for more than a mile behind a car driven by Long, 19, in Berkshire in August 2019. The Thames Valley Police officer became tangled in a strap attached to the back of the car as he tried to apprehend the teenagers, who were suspected of stealing a quad bike. Following a trial at the Old Bailey, Long, Bowers and Cole were allcleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter. Long was jailed for 16 years, while getaway car passengers Bowers and Cole, both 18, were sentenced to 13 years each. Dame Victoria Sharp said at the hearing earlier that their applications to reduce their sentences had also been refused. Jessie Cole (l) and Albert Bowers (r) were convicted along with Henry Long (centre) in July Cole and Bowers launched separate appeals against their convictions for manslaughter, which were also rejected. Following the judgement, a spokesman for the attorney general said she believed the sentences should be increased, but ""respects the decision of the Court of Appeal"". PC Harper, 28, from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, had been married to his wife Lissie for four weeks when he died. Mrs Harper, 29, said in a statement she was ""disappointed"" and the sentences ""do not reflect the severity and barbarity of the crimes they committed"". ""I continue to feel let down by our justice system and the inadequate laws that we have in place,"" she said. Mrs Harper has been campaigningfor a change to the lawto increase the sentences of those who kill emergency services workers. This video can not be played Lissie Harper gives a statement after the decision In their judgement, Dame Victoria Sharp, Lord Justice Holroyde and Mr Justice William Davis said PC Harper's family had the ""profound sympathy of the nation"". They said ""no one"" doubted the ""seriousness of the offending in this case"", the ""importance of the fact that the victim was a police officer engaged in performing his duty"" and the ""gravity of the harm caused"". But they added that trial judge Mr Justice Edis ""had to sentence three young offenders for manslaughter, not for murder"" and that ""mere disagreement with his decisions as to the nature and length of the appropriate sentences provides neither a ground for finding the sentencing to have been unduly lenient nor a ground for finding a sentence to have been wrong in principle or manifestly excessive"". The judges said the attorney general's argument, that the sentences of Bowers and Cole were unduly lenient because the judge did not ""depart"" from the sentencing guidelines, was ""to say the least, an unusual submission"".

"'Narrow path' available for Brexit deal - EU chiefThe president of the EU Commission says the ""next few days"" will be decisive for trade negotiations.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not"". A ""narrow path"" has opened up for the UK and EU to strike a post-Brexit trade deal, the president of the European Commission has said. Ursula von der Leyen said the ""next few days are going to be decisive"", with just two weeks left before the UK quits EU trading rules. She said differences over enforcing a deal are ""largely being resolved,"" but talks over fishing remain ""difficult"". PM Boris Johnson told MPs there was ""every opportunity"" to reach a deal. Officials from both sides are continuing talks in Brussels, as they race to strike a deal before the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Despite weeks of intensive talks, they have remained stuck over fishing rights and how far the UK should be able to depart from EU rules. UK wants EU trade deal but not 'at any cost' - PM What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Updating the European Parliament on an EU leaders' summit last week, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""As things stand, I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not. ""But there is a path to an agreement now - the path may be very narrow, but it is there."" She said that negotiators had agreed a ""strong mechanism"" to ensure neither side lowers their environmental or social standards, which was a ""big step forwards"". But she added differences remained over how to ""future proof"" rules in this area, although disagreements over how to enforce a deal ""by now are largely being resolved"". On Wednesday Mr Johnson's spokesman said: ""We have made some progress in some areas, but it still remains that there are some significant gaps."" He added that it is ""still the case"" the prime minister views no deal as ""the most likely outcome"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Speaking after Mrs von der Leyen, Mr Johnson said: ""There's every opportunity, every hope I have, that our friends and partners across the Channel will see sense and do a deal. ""All that it takes is for them to understand that the UK has a natural right, like every other country, to be able to want to control its own laws and its own fishing grounds."" He told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions that ""whatever happens in the next few days,"" the UK will ""prosper mightily"" whether a deal is found or not. Mrs von der Leyen also reported progress in another area which has proved contentious - agreed rules on how and when each side can give government subsidies to private firms. She confirmed the two sides were now trying to agree ""common principles"" for when subsidies could be offered. At an earlier stage in talks, the EU had insisted the UK should follow its current and future ""state aid"" rules in this area - a demand rejected by the UK. The German politician added that there had been progress on ""guarantees of domestic enforcement"" of the rules, as well as allowing both sides to ""autonomously"" take action where disagreements arise. However, she was more downbeat on fishing, where the two sides are haggling over access to each other's waters for their fishermen after 1 January. ""In all honesty, it sometimes feels that we will not be able to resolve this question,"" she said, but added that continuing the talks was the ""only responsible"" course of action. She added the EU respected British ""sovereignty"" over its waters, but needed ""predictability and stability"" for European fishing fleets. Meanwhile, it has been announced that both Houses of Parliament will begin their Christmas recess at the end of Thursday's sitting. But No 10 said MPs and peers could be recalled to Westminster to vote on legislation to implement a deal before the end of the Brexit transition. On Tuesday, Commons leader Jacob-Rees Mogg said Parliament would ideally need six days to pass any such law, but this period could be ""truncated"" if required. Any potential deal would also need to be voted on by the European Parliament and potentially EU national parliaments before it can fully come into force. EU leaders can in theory decide to provisionally apply any agreement and hold these votes after 31 December, but it would be unpopular among MEPs. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"Burchill's book about cancel culture cancelledJulie Burchill's publisher says the writer ""crossed a line with regard to race and religion"".","The publisher of a book about cancel culture by Julie Burchill has cancelled it after the writer was accused of Islamophobia on Twitter. The book, Welcome to the Woke Trials, had been due to be published by Little, Brown in April. But Burchill got embroiled with a row with fellow writer Ash Sarkar. Little, Brown said her comments were ""not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint"" and ""crossed a line with regard to race and religion"". A statement from the company said: ""We will no longer be publishing Julie Burchill's book. This is not a decision we have taken lightly. ""We believe passionately in freedom of speech at Little, Brown and we have always published authors with controversial or challenging perspectives - and we will continue to do so. ""While there is no legal definition of hate speech in the UK, we believe that Julie's comments on Islam are not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint, that they crossed a line with regard to race and religion, and that her book has now become inextricably linked with those views."" Writing on Facebook, Burchill said the publishers had told her there was ""also a concern that the line might be crossed again during the promotion of the book"", to which she added: ""I'LL SAY!"" Sarkar accused Burchill of Islamophobia after the Sunday Telegraph columnist made comments about the age of one of the Prophet Muhammad's wives. According to Little, Brown's official description, Welcome to the Woke Trials was inspired by the ""vitriolic reaction"" Burchill received in response to an article she wrote for The Observer in 2013, after which she was ""pursued by the outrage mob"". The publisher billed it as ""part-memoir and part-indictment of what happened to Burchill between then and now, as the regiments of the woke took over"".

UK Christmas rules remain but guidance toughened,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'A shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas' Boris Johnson has urged people to keep Christmas celebrations ""short"" and ""small"" to reduce the risk of spreading Covid over the festive period. Restrictions will still be relaxed between 23 and 27 December - but the PM said people should ""think hard"" before meeting friends and family. Three households will be allowed to meet - apart from in Waleswhere a law change will allow just two households. And in Scotlandpeople are being asked to only meet on one of the five days,external. It comes as the UK recorded a further 25,161 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, along with 612 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Patients face 12-hour wait as hospital struggles UK coronavirus cases up by 18,450 on Tuesday Mr Johnson said the law was remaining the same in England but ""a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas"". Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, he said the rules allowing three households to meet over five days were ""maximums, not targets to aim for"". ""It's always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet,"" he said. After the news conference, the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments issued a joint statement saying this ""cannot be a normal Christmas"" and that they ""strongly"" recommended people stayed at home. They advised people who were visiting others to stop unnecessary social contact as soon as possible and for at least five days before travelling. No one should visit another household if they were ill or self-isolating, they said. Mr Johnson also advised people to avoid travelling from ""high prevalence"" areas to those with lower rates of coronavirus and not to stay away from home overnight if possible. This video can not be played Professor Whitty: 'You wouldn't drive down an icy road at 70 mph' Mr Johnson urged caution over seeing elderly or vulnerable relatives, saying that since the vaccine was being rolled out to these groups ""by the early months of the new year"", they would be able to meet people more safely soon. ""Whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales, and no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the new year,"" he added. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned: ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean it's sensible in any way."" ""Any kind of period where people come together in groups that otherwise wouldn't meet leads to an increase in risks and that will lead to an increase in hospitalisations and deaths,"" he said. He urged people to keep their Christmas celebrations small, short and local to reduce these risks. The four UK nations previously agreed a set of rules for the festive period, which has been set down in legislation and is not expected to change in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland - even though the guidance has been updated. Between 23 and 27 December, you can form a""Christmas bubble"",externalcomprised of people from three households You can travel between tiers and between UK nations to meet your bubble You can only meet in homes, places of worship or public outdoor spaces - not pubs or restaurants You can meet people outside your bubble according to your local rules But in Wales new guidance on households mixing will be put into law, meaning only two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone - will be able to form a Christmas bubble. UK leaders had come under pressure to review the guidance for Christmas amid rising infections. In November, all four nations agreed that three households would be able to form a Christmas bubble between 23 and 27 December, allowing them to mix indoors and stay overnight. However, the Welsh government has now decided Christmas bubbles should be limited to two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced the country wouldhead back into a stay-at-home lockdownas soon as the Christmas period was over. RESTRICTIONS LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, saidher ""strong recommendation"" was to ""spend Christmas in your own home with your own household"", She added: ""We will set out advice if you are living in any of the nations in one of the highest level of protection - which in England and London is tier three - then we don't think you should be travelling to other parts of the UK."" Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said the public must take ""all and every precaution"" at Christmas and proposals for further restrictions would be brought forward on Thursday. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised governments needed to provide ""flexibility"" over Christmas and that people needed to take personal responsibility for their actions. As families decide what to do this Christmas, legally the options are - for the most part - the same. However, the reality feels very different following today's stern warnings and with a changing health picture. And while there have been variations in terms of detail and emphasis from UK leaders, the overall memo was essentially this: be very careful, be very cautious. And just because you can take advantage of an easing in the rules doesn't mean you should. The planned relaxation was never meant to be a free-for-all. But with this toughened guidance many may feel their options have narrowed. And for the politicians - they now have to a sell a more complicated public health message. You can take advantage of a relaxation in the rules. But maybe, please - don't. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour would support tougher restrictions over Christmas. ""We would have liked to have seen a toughening up today from the prime minister - perhaps something like what we've seen in Wales, reducing households,"" he told the BBC. ""I think he's going to have to go further in the coming days."" An information campaign is expected to be launched in the days running up to Christmas, with people being urged to think carefully before bubbling with elderly or at-risk relatives. Scientists at the University of Bristol studied the implications - and early results, yet to be formally published, indicate the fewer people the better, from the point of view of containing the disease. If a single-person household joins another household of any size, the impact on infection rates would be marginal, they suggest. But if all households in the UK paired up with one other, each bubble would contain an average of 4.7 people. That would lead to a reproduction (R) number within households of between 1.9-2.4. And an R number is above one means the disease is escalating.

In a joint editorial, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal said demand on the NHS was increasing, adding that a newstrain of coronavirushad introduced ""further potential jeopardy"". Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the ""major driver"" for how much the disease spread over the  Christmas period was the infection prevalence - and that the current prevalence had started to rise ""really quite rapidly in some places"". ""When the rules were made about Christmas, we didn't know what that prevalence was going to be,"" Prof Medley told the Today programme. As for the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed, he said: ""We don't have much headroom.""

First care home residents in Wales get vaccine,"This video can not be played Glenda Waye says she feels fine after the vaccine and anyone refusing it is ""silly"" The first care home residents in Wales have been given the Covid vaccination as the rollout of the jab continues. A pilot for the Pfizer/BioNtech jab started at Bryn Yr Haul House care home in Mold, Flintshire, on Wednesday. Wales' health minister said ""if all goes well"" officials will widen the scheme before Christmas. Care home owners said it was ""early steps in a great journey"" but warned the vaccination did not mean an open door policy for families of residents. Initially, the vaccine will be given to care homes near hospital pharmacies before a possible rollout. Bryn yr Haul residents received the vaccine on Wednesday ""I didn't feel a thing,"" said Bryn Yr Haul House resident Glenda Waye, 86, who had the vaccine on Wednesday. ""It is very important that you have it, and anybody that doesn't, I think it would be silly. ""It is better than having that virus, isn't it."" Boxing Day sales off ahead of new Wales lockdown Q&A: Which rules are changing and when? Bryn Yr Haul House resident Glenda Waye, 86, had the vaccine on Wednesday She said she had not been worried about catching Covid-19 as she left safe in the home, but she had missed being able to see family and have a ""cuddle"". She said it was ""lovely"" to see her son and daughter-in-law last week and she was looking forward to a visit from her sister on Sunday - for the first time since July. ""It is the cuddle you miss. Talking through the window, on the phone, isn't quite the same,"" she said, adding it ""would be lovely"" when it becomes possible after more people have the jab. Care home manager Christine Whiteside said the vaccination meant ""the beginning of an end"" following a ""rollercoaster"" year for residents and staff. Care home manager Christine Whiteside said the vaccine means visitors will eventually be able to ""hug"" loved ones again ""This moment means now we will be open eventually to indoor visiting,"" she said. ""We will be able to have the opportunity for relatives to come in, to meet their loved ones, to hold them, to hug them, to kiss them. ""Having the opportunity to get back to a near normal is absolutely amazing, it really is."" James McGuigan, from Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said it was a ""day we have been looking forward to for many, many months"", with the vaccine able to ""protect some of the most vulnerable people in society"". Clive Nadin, the owner and manager of Abbey Dale House Care Home in Colwyn Bay, said he and a handful of his 30 staff were given the vaccine on Tuesday. He said two members of staff would not receive the vaccine - one is scared of needles and the other could not take it on medical grounds. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""I'm feeling fine, a slight sore arm which is one of the expected side effects. ""It's just a real game-changerâ¦ something we've got to do and I implore everybody to follow suit."" He said getting the vaccine to residents was a ""real logistical challenge"" as they ""come in large packs of 975â¦ the vaccine could be damaged if it's moved."" Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid tests The group that represents care homes in Wales said the rise in Covid rates across Wales - with some areas among the highest in the UK - meant homes would be ""careful"" and ""cautious"" with family visits to residents over the Christmas period. Latest figures show Wales has the worst infection rate of the four UK nations - with a case rate of 416.5 cases per 100,000 people over seven days - with Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend in the top four worst affected local authority areas. There are 1,055 care homes in Wales and 120 of them (11%) had notified one or more positive cases in staff or residents in the most recent week and 27% had within the past month, according to Care Inspectorate Wales Neath Port Talbot had 16 care homes which had notified at least one case in the week ending 6 December, Swansea was next with 13 care homes, Caerphilly and Cardiff were next highest, each with 11 Across Wales, 3,705 care home residents were tested in the most recent week and 265 (7.1%) were positive - fewer than the week before. But it has dropped from the numbers we saw at the end of October, Public Health Wales figures suggest There have been 950 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 4 December, making up 24.4% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales There were 42 care home deaths in Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest ONS weekly total in Wales, fewer than last week Ten of the deaths were in care homes in Swansea, six in Torfaen and five in Neath Port Talbot ""Nobody wants to be separated at Christmas,"" said Care Forum Wales chairman Mario Kreft. ""But there are rises in community transmission across Wales, so we must be very careful as we go forward in these next weeks and months. ""We could see all residents vaccinated by, let's say, February, so we're only weeks away."" But while Wales' Older People's Commissioner was ""delighted"" the pilot had started, she said it was ""crucial"" care home residents can have visits from loved ones. ""As it is likely to be some time before all older people living in care homes are protected by the vaccine, it is crucial that residents can stay in close contact with their loved ones,"" said Helena Herklots. She said she wanted ""safe visits can go ahead wherever possible, which will be particularly important over the Christmas period"". Welsh officialshad previously not been able to saywhen vaccination of care home residents would begin, despite the group being a priority for the vaccine programme. Health Minister Vaughan Gething initially said it would not be safe to get the jab to care homes because the vaccineneeds to be kept at -70cand health chiefs wanted to use a small number of hubs. But Pfizer has since confirmed thevaccine could be ""packed down"" into smaller pack sizes,,externalallowing it to go to care homes, which Mr Gething said can ""bring a new level of protection to some of our most vulnerable people"". Care home residents began to receive thevaccine in Scotland on Monday. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: First care home resident receives vaccine A report had saidcare homes had been ""badly let down""during the coronavirus pandemic with almost30,000 more residents in England and Walesdying during the the early part of the pandemic than during the same period in 2019. Thecoronavirus vaccine rollout in Walesstarted last week with front-line health care and social care workers prioritised. Mr Gething said: ""We need to continue to make sure we can safely transport the vaccine to people who can't come to clinics. ""If all goes well this week, we will roll out care home vaccination ahead of Christmas, bringing a new level of protection to some of our most vulnerable people.""

Europeans urged to wear masks for family Christmas,"The situation in Germany has been described by officials as ""more serious than it has ever been"" The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged Europeans to wear masks during family gatherings at Christmas. It said Europe was at ""high risk"" of a new wave of coronavirus infections in the early part of 2021, as transmission of the virus remained high. Countries across the continent have been registering thousands of daily cases and hundreds of deaths. Germany was among countries tightening restrictions on Wednesday, closing schools and non-essential businesses. Meanwhile European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the first Covid vaccine would be authorised for use within a week. A far from traditional Christmas as German cases surge What are the Christmas restrictions around Europe? Tracking the global coronavirus outbreak Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - developed in Germany - would be rolled out for the bloc immediately, more than a week earlier than originally envisaged. A statement from the WHO's European regional office,externalsaid that the massive increase in gatherings of families and friends across Europe during the winter holiday season brought a significant risk of increased Covid-19 transmission. It urged individuals, families and communities to play their part to prevent another resurgence of cases. Family gatherings should be held outside if possible, and if indoors participants should wear masks and practice social distancing, it said. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas ""It may feel awkward to wear masks and practise physical distancing when around friends and family, but doing so contributes significantly to ensuring that everyone remains safe and healthy,"" the WHO added. ""Vulnerable people and older friends or relatives may find it very difficult to ask loved ones to stay away physically, regardless of the anxieties or concerns they may have. Consider what others may be feeling and the difficult decisions they will be facing."" The statement also urges people to avoid crowded public transport, and suggests that countries with ski resorts take steps to adapt them to avoid crowding during the skiing season. Separately, the WHO said on Wednesday thata team of 10 international scientists would travel to the Chinese city of Wuhannext month to investigate the origins of Covid-19. Only essential businesses such as supermarkets and banks will be allowed to remain open in the new lockdown in Germany, which will be in place until 10 January. Christmas will see a slight easing, with one household allowed to host up to four close family members. Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have been shut since November and some areas of the country had imposed their own lockdowns. Hair salons are among the businesses which must close, while drinking alcohol in public places, such as at popular mulled wine stalls, is forbidden. Companies are being urged to allow employees to work from home. The 952 new fatalities and 27,728 cases announced on Wednesday are a new peak for Germany's pandemic, but may cover numbers that were not included in previous days' statistics. The German lockdown has left much of central Berlin deserted Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, which is overseeing the Covid-19 response, said the situation was ""more serious than it has ever been"". Deutsche Welle reported that while cases in the younger population were falling, they were still rising among older people who were more likely to suffer more serious problems from the virus. Numbers in intensive care are reported to have reached critical levels. Announcing the new measures over the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the ""lockdown light"" begun in November had not done enough to bring the virus under control. The figures are particularly shocking, as during the early months of the pandemic Germany was more successful than many other European countries in its handling of the crisis. What's gone wrong for the country that came so successfully through the first wave of the pandemic? Some blame Germany's regional leaders who, until now, have dithered, bickered and resisted Chancellor Merkel's calls for a tougher nationwide response. And Prof Iris Pigeot, director of the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, says that ""people do not follow all the regulations that they're told. We had to reduce our contacts by about 75% but I think that didn't work"". She's concerned.

"UK Christmas rules stay but nations toughen adviceScotland and Wales advise less social contact, as PM urges UK to celebrate with ""extreme caution"".UKCommentsQ&A: Which rules are changing and when?As a new set of rules is announced in Wales for Christmas and beyond, here's what you need to know.Wales","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'A shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas' Boris Johnson has urged people to keep Christmas celebrations ""short"" and ""small"" to reduce the risk of spreading Covid over the festive period. Restrictions will still be relaxed between 23 and 27 December - but the PM said people should ""think hard"" before meeting friends and family. Three households will be allowed to meet - apart from in Waleswhere a law change will allow just two households. And in Scotlandpeople are being asked to only meet on one of the five days,external. It comes as the UK recorded a further 25,161 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, along with 612 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Patients face 12-hour wait as hospital struggles UK coronavirus cases up by 18,450 on Tuesday Mr Johnson said the law was remaining the same in England but ""a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas"". Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, he said the rules allowing three households to meet over five days were ""maximums, not targets to aim for"". ""It's always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet,"" he said. After the news conference, the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments issued a joint statement saying this ""cannot be a normal Christmas"" and that they ""strongly"" recommended people stayed at home. They advised people who were visiting others to stop unnecessary social contact as soon as possible and for at least five days before travelling. No one should visit another household if they were ill or self-isolating, they said. Mr Johnson also advised people to avoid travelling from ""high prevalence"" areas to those with lower rates of coronavirus and not to stay away from home overnight if possible. This video can not be played Professor Whitty: 'You wouldn't drive down an icy road at 70 mph' Mr Johnson urged caution over seeing elderly or vulnerable relatives, saying that since the vaccine was being rolled out to these groups ""by the early months of the new year"", they would be able to meet people more safely soon. ""Whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales, and no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the new year,"" he added. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned: ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean it's sensible in any way."" ""Any kind of period where people come together in groups that otherwise wouldn't meet leads to an increase in risks and that will lead to an increase in hospitalisations and deaths,"" he said. He urged people to keep their Christmas celebrations small, short and local to reduce these risks. The four UK nations previously agreed a set of rules for the festive period, which has been set down in legislation and is not expected to change in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland - even though the guidance has been updated. Between 23 and 27 December, you can form a""Christmas bubble"",externalcomprised of people from three households You can travel between tiers and between UK nations to meet your bubble You can only meet in homes, places of worship or public outdoor spaces - not pubs or restaurants You can meet people outside your bubble according to your local rules But in Wales new guidance on households mixing will be put into law, meaning only two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone - will be able to form a Christmas bubble. UK leaders had come under pressure to review the guidance for Christmas amid rising infections. In November, all four nations agreed that three households would be able to form a Christmas bubble between 23 and 27 December, allowing them to mix indoors and stay overnight. However, the Welsh government has now decided Christmas bubbles should be limited to two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced the country wouldhead back into a stay-at-home lockdownas soon as the Christmas period was over.

"Q&A: Which rules are changing and when?As a new set of rules is announced in Wales for Christmas and beyond, here's what you need to know.Wales","Face masks are no longer legally required in Welsh shops The last Covid restrictions are set to end in Wales on Monday after 26 months. The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in health and social care services from Monday 30 May. It will be the first time there will be no Covid restrictions in Wales since the first lockdown in March 2020. The country is currently atalert level zero,external, the lowest tier of Covid rules, with numbers testing positive having fallen in recent weeks. The UK's last remaining Covid restrictions New Zealand to scrap some Covid vaccine mandates The lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic. We were last in alert level zero at Christmas. Under it, most curbs to our daily life have been removed, and all businesses have been allowed to reopen. Self-isolation rules did still apply, but were scrapped from 28 March. It is no longer a legal requirement but people are still strongly recommended to use face coverings in any health setting to protect the most vulnerable. The Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Since 22 December, those identified as being a close contact of someone who tests positive for Covid-19 in Wales have not had to self-isolate automatically, if they are fully vaccinated, aged between five and 18, or participating in a vaccine clinical trial. Instead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests. Since 28 January, people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests required on days five and six. Until then, the self-isolation period was seven days,down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on days six and seven. The Welsh government put the measures in place on 26 December to protect customers and staff in businesses The Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive. It advised meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated. People, it said, should leave at least a day between social events. From 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. But under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January. The rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended. People are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped. While wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing. Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August and remain the same Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August. For important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. All guests will need to take a lateral flow test. People attending weddings, civil partnerships or alternative wedding ceremonies or receptions, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero. The Welsh government advised people to wear face coverings indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing. You can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply. On 25 January 2022, theWelsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidaysfor the first time since the start of the pandemic. Nightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four-stage plan, they have been allowed to open since 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. Covid passes were scrapped on 18 February for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. As cases continued to remain low, sports fans were allowed to return to events From 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500. On 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. Gyms, swimming pools, leisure centres, community centres and fitness facilities are open Pupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January. From 18 February, they were no longer required to wear face coverings and schools could decide their own rules. Working from home is no longer law in Wales A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with Â£60 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, was scrapped on 28 January. You have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April 2021, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations. It also means people from other parts of the UK can come here. All holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May.

House mix risk 'hard to control',"If most UK households get together in ""bubbles"" for the Christmas break, coronavirus infection rates could be hard to control. That's the warning from scientists modelling the potential spread of the virus over the five-day period. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland the rule is that three different households can temporarily come together under one roof, while in Wales just two are allowed. But there is growing pressure on ministers to change that policy, amid fears of a spike in cases. How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? Leading journals warn over Christmas relaxation Last month, a report by the government's scientific advisers warned the number of infections could easily double over the course of the break. Studies have shown the coronavirus spreads most easily in packed, stuffy rooms where people are together for long periods of time - a typical scenario for Christmas gatherings. And the greater the spread of the virus in the community, the more the chance that someone in a household gathering will be infected, possibly without realising if they have no symptoms. In recent weeks, teams of scientists across the UK have been trying to get a more exact sense of the potential impact of relaxing restrictions. But it's a difficult task with no exact answers, because everything depends on how people choose to spend the coming days - and that's impossible to predict. Scientists at the University of Bristol studied the implications of the bubbles themselves and the effect of having different households come together. And early results, yet to be formally published, indicate the fewer people take up the option of forming a bubble with others, the better, from the point of view of containing the disease. If a single-person household joins another household of any size, the impact on infection rates would be marginal, they suggest. But if all households in the UK paired up with one other, each bubble would contain an average of 4.7 people. That would lead to a reproduction (R) number within households of between 1.9-2.4. And an R number is above one means the disease is escalating. If only half the UK's households join a bubble, that could still raise the R number by 30%. A modern browser with Javascript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. The Bristol modellers assessed the implications of all households across the country opting for the maximum Christmas mixing allowed - by forming a bubble with two other households. In that case, there would be an average of just over seven people in each bubble. And the R number would jump to 2.84-3.55, suggesting a rapid surge in infections. The research concludes everyone joining a Christmas bubble ""has the potential to make transmission extremely hard to control."" According to Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock, a member of the team, if people understand the scale of the risks, then it will help them work out how best to respond. ""It's important to be as honest as possible about results from the work from the analysis that we've done,"" she says. ""And it's easy to imagine a kind of terrible scenario. ""But actually, when you start modelling it, you can then start thinking about how you would balance these increased risks somewhere else."" Forming household bubbles ""should not be encouraged in general"", Dr Brooks-Pollock says. If people don't really need to get together with another household, it would really help if they didn't. And if they do, they should minimise contacts with people outside the bubble as much as possible - to prevent them  picking up infections while together at Christmas and then dispersing the virus to friends and colleagues when they return home to other parts of the UK. Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been investigating the likely scale of social mixing over the Christmas period. Having schools and many workplaces closed at that time should help reduce the number of infections overall. But increased social interaction in homes will have the opposite effect. Key to the effect on infection rates will be how well people limit their interactions before entering their Christmas bubble. ""There is a big risk over Christmas of essentially a transfer of infection from younger groups with more contacts into older age groups who might not usually have this level of mixing especially in this kind of year,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, an associate professor at the LSHTM, says. ""Even in normal years, we do see an increase in hospitalisations for things like pneumonia after the Christmas period. ""And it's likely the sort of inter-generational mixing we see over this Christmas break will be contributing to that, because essentially we have groups with very different risk profiles mixing in ways they don't usually. ""What happens when we get to January is very hard to predict because it's such an unusual year. ""But it all depends on how exclusive and large the gatherings are and how careful people are before and after Christmas.""

Patients face 12-hour hospital wait,"There were queues of ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital on Tuesday night Hospitals in Northern Ireland are continuing to face severe pressures after a night which saw queuing ambulances outside hospitals across NI. On Wednesday morning there were 48 people in the emergency department at Antrim Area hospital. On Tuesday night,doctors treated patients in ambulances with 17 vehicles outside the hospital at one point. An emergency department consultant from the Ulster Hospital said one patient there had waited 28 hours for a bed. Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra, Sean McGovern, said: ""That patient is still waiting, they're waiting within the emergency department. ""People are maybe waiting on a bed in a designated area within the emergency department, or waiting on a trolley."" At 11:25 GMT, there were 34 people waiting to be admitted to the Ulster Hospital, with 30 waiting more than 12 hours, according to a spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust. The spokesperson said there were 59 patients at the hospital's emergency department, with one waiting outside in an ambulance. Five of the patients had been in the department for between four and 12 hours. There have also been long waits at Antrim Hospital on Wednesday, with 48 people in the emergency department at 07:00 GMT. Of these, 43 were waiting to be admitted, with 29 of those people who have been waiting for more than 12 hours. Hundreds of hospital staff from across NI are also isolating for Covid-related reasons In a statement, the trust said it was ""not a situation that anyone wants to see"", adding that the hospital remained under ""severe pressure"". ""We sincerely apologise to the patients affected and their families. Staff are working very hard to try to manage the situation and maintain flow,"" the trust said. At hospitals in Belfast, 39 were awaiting admission - 29 more than 12 hours. In the Western Trust, 34 were awaiting admission - all 34 waiting more than 12 hours. In the Southern Trust hospitals, 60 were waiting admission but no figure for length of wait is known. The British Medical Association in Northern Ireland said the pressures on hospitals were ""extremely concerning"". A spokesperson said: ""I have spoken to many secondary care colleagues over the past few days who are very worried as to how hospitals are going to cope over the next few days and weeks, and the decisions they may have to take over how people are cared for."" Medical Director with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service Dr Nigel Ruddell said there had been 30 to 35 ambulances outside Emergency Departments across Northern Ireland on Tuesday night. He said they were ""the most significant queues"" he had seen in the 12 years he had worked for the ambulance service. ""What we are seeing reflects the pressure of the normal increase in illness, particularly among the elderly and, of course, the pressures of Covid,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Dr Ruddell thanked the hospital and ambulance staff, and said it had taken a ""massive effort overnight"" to clear queues outside hospitals. Speaking to RTÃ's Morning Ireland programme on Wednesday, Wendy Magowan, the Northern Health Trust operations director, said ""whilst it has improved dramatically overnight we are still starting out this morning with a very low base rate"". There are also hundreds of staff isolating for Covid-related reasons. So far, 366 staff from the Southern Trust are isolating as are 681 from Belfast Trust, 324 from the Western Trust, 307 from the South Eastern Trust and 289 from the Northern Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann is to bring new proposals about Covid restrictions to Thursday's executive meeting. The meeting will see ministers look at options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. There were 17 ambulances queued at Antrim Hospital at 17:00 GMT on Tuesday Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Sinn FÃ©in ""will support any proposals brought forward by the health minister to tackle the current situation."" Stronger guidance has been issued by London and the devolved governments about how people should celebrate Christmas this year. Relaxed rules between 23 December and 27 December are to stay in place. Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill spoke to leaders from the other governments earlier and more guidance from the executive is expected later in the week. The big issue is not so much what they agree when it comes to restrictions, but the fact that compliance is not where it should be. The health service has stepped forward and they're hoping that they're going to listen to the voices that we heard last night with ambulances queued outside the hospitals. Health Minister Robin Swann is going to be bringing recommendations to the executive on Thursday for a decision around restrictions and the likelihood is that we will see, perhaps, an partial lockdown started after Christmas. We could be looking at, maybe, 28 December. The key concern is that we may be heading for a third wave at a point when our hospitals are saturated.

What are the Christmas rules?,"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary. You cannot go to the pub with members of your Christmas bubble. In England, if you have formed asupport bubblewith another household, that counts as one household. In Scotland,guidance,externalsays any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"". People who are self-isolatingshould not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone has to self-isolate. Under-18s whose parents live apart can join two Christmas bubbles, so they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students whotravel homewill be counted as part of their family household straight away. But if a family has three or more grown-up children not at university, they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents, even in areas where mixing is still possible.

"More than 130,000 vaccinated in UK in first week","More than 130,000 people have been vaccinated in the first week of the UK's vaccination programme. Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is in charge of vaccine rollout, tweeted 137,897 people had been given their first doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech jab between 8 and 15 December. He described it as a ""really good start"" for the programme. The figure only captures the start of the community vaccination programme run by GPs which launched on Monday. About 200 of these local vaccination clinics are expected to be up and running by the end of the week. They will be followed by another 1,000 in the coming weeks. Who will get the vaccine first? What you need to know about vaccine safety How close is light at end of Covid tunnel? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? A rapid expansion will be needed. The government wants to offer everyone over 50 and younger adults with health conditions a vaccine - about 25 million people. But the National Audit Office has warned ""complex logistical challenges"" remain. It said thousands of extra staff would be needed to deliver vaccinations on the scale being talked about - the government has committed to offering all over 50s and younger adults with health conditions a vaccine. It said hospitals and GP-run local clinics would not be able to do this on their own. But it added the government had worked ""quickly and effectively"" to secure access to vaccines - contracts have been signed giving priority access to five different jabs. It estimated the vaccination programme, including manufacturing, purchasing and delivering the jabs, could cost up to Â£12bn. During the first week, more than 70 hospitals took part in the vaccination programme - with another 10 starting this week. Mr Zahawi said the figures were provisional and from next week there would be published data available. The breakdown for individual nations showed: 108,000 vaccinated in England 7,897 in Wales 4,000 in Northern Ireland 18,000 in Scotland ""Transparency is vital as we deliver vaccines across the UK,"" Mr Zahawi added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is just the start and we will steadily expand our vaccination programme - ultimately helping everyone get back to normal life."" The over-80s have been invited for vaccination first, along with some health and care staff. But the highest priority group, care-home residents, have only just started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. It has to be kept in in large batches in ultra-cold storage. And the NHS had been waiting for guidance on how it can be safely taken into care homes. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Tom Cruise 'shouts at film crew' over Covid safety,"A recording has emerged of Tom Cruise apparently shouting at workers on the set of Mission: Impossible 7 and threatening to fire them if they broke Covid-19 guidelines. The Sun,externalpublished the expletive-laden audio in which Cruise said: ""If I see you doing it again, you're... gone."" The paper said Cruise had seen two crew members ""standing too close to one another in front of a computer screen"".

The Mission: Impossible franchise is hugely successful at the box office, starring Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Cruise is also a producer on the series. The seventh movie had to pause filming in Italy in February due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, and The Sun said the actor had ""personally tried to ensure there are no more delays"". Mission Impossible halts filming over health fears In the recording, Cruise can be heard shouting: ""They're back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us.

Supreme Court lifts ban on Heathrow third runway,"The Supreme Court has breathed new life into plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport. The scheme was previously blocked by the Court of Appeal, who said the governmentâs airports strategy didnât meet up-to-date UK climate targets. But the Supreme Court has ruled the strategy was legitimately based on previous, less stringent, climate targets at the time it was agreed. The firm behind Heathrow can now seek planning permission for the runway. But it still faces major obstacles, including having to persuade a public enquiry of the case for expansion. And if planning inspectors approve the scheme, the government will still have the final say. What are the Heathrow third runway plans? Ministers have been advised by their Climate Change Committee that, in order to keep emissions down, Heathrow should only expand if regional airports contract. This will pose a problem for a government thatâs committed to improving infrastructure away from the South-East. And a full application from Heathrow Airport may still be more than a year away as the airport re-assembles a planning team and strives to cope with Covid. A Heathrow spokesman called the decision to lift the ban ""the right result for the country"". ""Only by expanding the UK's hub airport can we connect all of Britain to all of the growing markets of the world, helping to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in every nation and region of our country. ""Demand for aviation will recover from Covid-19, and the additional capacity at an expanded Heathrow will allow Britain as a sovereign nation to compete for trade and win against our rivals in France and Germany."" The business coalition Back Heathrow said it would boost the UK once it stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. âIt is a huge moment for the UK as it moves towards an uncertain Brexit, but now with the confidence that international trade could be boosted by additional capacity at the countryâs only hub airport,"" said executive director Parmjit Dhanda. âWe believe this news reflects a unity of purpose between the highest court in the land and our parliament â which has already delivered a majority of 296 for sustainable expansion at Heathrow,â he added. The ruling is a blow for campaigners whoâve been hounding the runway project in the courts because they say it breaches the governmentâs policy of removing almost all carbon emissions from the economy by 2050 â the so-called Net Zero commitment. But environmentalists still plan to challenge every stage of the planning application in the courts â including at the European Court of Human Rights, where campaigners will argue that relying on outdated emissions targets is inconsistent with the right to life. The old UK emissions strategy was based on the target of holding global temperature rise to 2C, whereas the latest government aim is a maximum temperature rise of 1.5C. This means emissions must be cut by more than previously thought. On the back of the previous Appeal Court ruling in their favour, environmentalists have launched copy-cat legal actions against plans for other government projects that will fuel climate change. These include the Â£27bn roads programme; expanding North Sea oil and gas; and a proposed Cumbria coal mine. They fear the Supreme Court ruling signals that judges arenât willing to hold the governmentâs feet to the fire on climate policy - as the Dutch Supreme Court did last year, when it ruled that the countryâs failure to act urgently against climate changeconstituted a violation of human rights. Similar cases are underway in several other nations where citizens want politicians to keep promises to tackle emissions. The Supreme Court case was taken by Friends of the Earth in conjunction with a tiny NGO called Plan B. Its founder Tim Crosland told BBC News: âThis is a terrible verdict â the runway plan is in clear breach of climate change targets and it canât be allowed to go ahead. I canât imagine how the judges came to this decision.â Paul McGuinness from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, said before the court ruling that a decision in favour of Heathrow wouldnât change the underlying case against the proposed runway. He argued: âHeathrow expansion canât proceed. Putting aside investors' lack of appetite to find new money - even to maintain the airport as a going concern through the pandemic - expanding Heathrow no longer ticks any boxes. âSince the Airports Commission recommended Heathrow expansion, five years ago, the world has changed and the assessments on noise, air quality and carbon have been exposed as inadequate.â Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a long-term opponent of Heathrow expansion, and significantly, his government didnât join the appeal against the previous Appeal Court verdict, which was made by Heathrow Airport plc. A government spokesperson said before the verdict: âWe have always been clear that Heathrow expansion is a private sector projectâ¯which must meetâ¯strict criteria on air quality, noise and climate change, as well as being privatelyâ¯financed, affordable, and delivered in the best interest of consumersâ.

Terminally-ill woman cancer free after new therapy,"This video can not be played ""I was told prepare my children for the worst"" A terminally ill cancer patient has been given the all-clear after becoming the first woman in Wales to be given a pioneering treatment. Helen Wynne Hughes, 32, was given CAR-T treatment that uses the body's own cells to fight cancer. The mother-of-three, from Denbighshire, had the therapy earlier this year after other treatments failed. ""When the doctor said it was clear... we were in tears. Finally, there was no cancer at all,"" she said. Whatever Covid restrictions may be in place this Christmas, it is set to be special for the Hughes family. It is a world away from a year ago when Helen was making memory boxes for her three young children - Aled, four, Tomos, two, and 19-month-old Beca. ""I had to tell them 'perhaps it is mummy's last Christmas',"" she recalled. ""They are so small, it was very hard. Making memory boxes, looking back thinking I might not get to do things with them again."" Helen feared last Christmas would be her last This festive period will also bring back memories of when this ordeal began. It was Christmas Eve 2018 when she was told scans had revealed a mass on her chest ""the size of a grapefruit"". She had felt unwell during her third pregnancy, only to be diagnosed with lymphoma. ""I was allowed to go home on Christmas Day to see the children open their presents and have lunch,"" she recalled. ""But I only managed two hours as I was so ill."" Living drug has cancer 'on the run' Pioneering cancer therapy for first child Helen, from Ruthin, started chemotherapy almost immediately and 10 weeks later, she gave birth to her ""bundle of joy"" Beca. However last autumn she was given the devastating news that the cancer was unresponsive and had spread to her bones, liver, lungs. ""I was told to prepare my children for the worst,"" she said.. Helen and Elgan were married in 2019 when she was told the treatments were not working Early this year, Helen was offered a glimmer of hope when she was told she qualified for the new Chimeric Antigen Receptors Cell Therapy (CAR-T) treatment that had just been approved by the NHS. ""CAR-T was the last hope for me. I'd do anything,"" she said. Helen and husband Elgan had looked into getting the treatment privately but the estimated Â£500,000 bill made it ""out of our reach"". CAR-T genetically reprograms the immune system to fight cancer. It is a ""living drug"" that is tailor-made for each patient using their body's own cells Firstly, parts of the immune system - specifically white blood cells called T-cells - are removed from the patient's blood, frozen in liquid nitrogen and sent to laboratories in the United States. There, the white blood cells are genetically reprogrammed so that rather than killing bacteria and viruses, they will seek out and destroy cancer. They are now ""chimeric antigen receptor T-cells"" - or CAR-T cells. Millions of the modified cells are grown in the lab, before being shipped back to the UK where they are infused into the patient's bloodstream. The whole process takes a month. As this is a ""living drug"", the cancer-killing T-cells stay in the body for a long time and will continue to grow and work inside the patient. Helen spent five weeks in hospital Helen spent five weeks at The Christie Hospital cancer centre in Manchester when the first coronavirus lockdown had just started. ""There were some quite shocking side effects,"" she said. ""I couldn't remember who I was, I couldn't eat and I couldn't walk properly but it was all worth it."" The family then faced an agonising six-month wait to learn whether the treatment had worked. Last week she was finally given the news she had craved, that the cancer ""had all gone"". Helen Wynne Hughes was diagnosed with lymphoma while pregnant with daughter Beca ""I was prepared for the worst but luckily CAR-T has saved my life,"" she said. ""I feel quite proud being the first female from Wales to have the treatment and hopefully many more after me will be allowed to have the treatment."" While she still receives monthly blood transfusions because her immune system is ""at rock bottom"", she is now also looking for a stem cell donor and hoping to go back to work as a primary school teacher later next year. ""The stem cell treatment will hopefully mean the cancer can't return,"" she said. ""So I'm looking for a match.""

Covid rules still to be relaxed over ChristmasBut details are yet to be confirmed on whether advice on household mixing will be toughened.,"This video can not be played Minister Robert Jenrick says people ""should use their own judgement at Christmas"" A relaxation of coronavirus rules over Christmas will still go ahead despite calls for them to be toughened, the four UK nations have agreed. But sterner warnings will be issued to urge people to keep social contact low. UK leaders have come under pressure to review the five-day plan as Covid infections continue to rise in Wales and parts of south-east England. Only two households are advised to mix in Wales,under new stricter advice. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the House of Commons: ""We should exercise extreme caution in the way we celebrate Christmas."" He said discussions on Wednesday morning had resulted in ""unanimous agreement"" between the four UK nations ""that we should proceed in principle with the existing regulations because we don't want to criminalise people's long-made plans"". However, he added it was ""absolutely vital that people should, at this very, very tricky time, exercise a high degree of personal responsibility"". He urged people to be particularly careful when they come into contact with vulnerable people - and should avoid contact with elderly people ""wherever possible"". A statement is expected soon to confirm the details of Wednesday morning's talks. Between 23 and 27 December, you can form a""Christmas bubble"",externalcomprised of people from three households You can travel between tiers and between UK nations to meet your bubble You can only meet in homes, places of worship or public outdoor spaces - not pubs or restaurants You can meet people outside your bubble according to your local rules Earlier, cabinet minister Robert Jenrick urged the public to ""use their own judgement"" on who to see over the five days of relaxed rules, from 23 to 27 December. Mr Jenrick said the government ""can't legislate for every eventuality"" so the law which sets out the Christmas relaxations ""remains unchanged"". However, Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that further guidance would be published to show infection rates are rising in many parts of the country, and to reflect thatCovid cases surged in parts of the US following the Thanksgiving holiday. How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? An information campaign is expected to be launched in the days running up to Christmas, with people being urged to think carefully about bubbling with elderly or at-risk relatives. Mr Jenrick said based on the further guidance, the government would ask people to ""weigh up the risks to their own loved ones"" and ""exercise their own good judgement"" about their Christmas plans. ""You can come together as three families and bubble for up to five days - but I suspect many, many people across the country will choose to do less than that, to protect themselves, their loved ones, and broader society,"" he said. The government's Christmas travel adviser, Sir Peter Hendy, said ministers' message to the public would be ""stay local if you can"". He told MPs on the Transport Committee he was confident there would be no overcrowding on trains during the festive period, but urged passengers to book tickets early. Labour has called for the measures over Christmas to be reviewed. Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed told BBC Breakfast that the four UK nations should reconsider whether the proposed easing of restrictions was safe, ""given what we now know about the failure of [England's] tiered system to control the rate of infection"". It comes aftertwo leading journals said the ""rash"" decision to ease restrictions would ""cost many lives"". In a joint editorial, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal stressed that demand on the NHS was increasing, adding that a newstrain of coronavirus- identified in both England and Wales - ""has introduced further potential jeopardy"". Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the ""major driver"" for how much the disease spreads over the five-day Christmas period was the infection prevalence - and that the current prevalence had started to rise ""really quite rapidly in some places"". ""When the rules were made about Christmas, we didn't know what that prevalence was going to be,"" Prof Medley told the Today programme. As for the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed, he said: ""We don't have much headroom."" Patients face 12-hour wait as hospital struggles New Covid strain: How worried should we be? After the first round of talks on Tuesday, a UK government source said they were ""keen to maintain a UK-wide approach"". Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had earlier told the Scottish Parliament there was a ""case"" for tightening the planned freedoms to combat a rise in infections. In Wales, First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said ""the choice is a grim one"", but the current plans were a ""hard-won agreement"" he would not put aside ""lightly"". A spokeswoman for Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said they would be holding discussions with their medical and scientific advisers. Despite the significant pressure for a rethink, leaders from the UK are likely to stick to the deal they agreed last month. There are no plans for a change of regulations in England - and it's unlikely Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland will make changes either. But there are real concerns among decision makers about the impact the relaxations could have - in particular the number of people who will be travelling across the UK. So you can expect to hear much stronger advice that just because you can mix, that doesn't mean you should. Ministers are preparing to warn people they should limit their interactions before forming a Christmas bubble, that they should think carefully before mixing with elderly or at-risk relatives, and that where possible people should stay local and avoid travel. Leaders are still trying to strike a balance between allowing people to visit relatives who they may not have seen for months, without allowing the virus to run rampant. But many still believe that relaxing rules just as many areas are seeing a significant increase in cases is too risky, and will lead to a considerably more difficult period at the start of next year. The resumption of talks comes as nearly 10.8 million people in London, and parts of Essex and Hertfordshirejoined England's toughest tier of restrictionsat 00:01 GMT. It means some 34 million people in England are now living under the toughest rules - around 61% of England's population. RESTRICTIONS LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Under tier three - very high alert - rules, pubs and restaurants must close, except for takeaway and delivery, and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas must remain shut. Ministers are also due to review other English tiers today - with an announcement due on Thursday. On Tuesday, theScottish government announced that three council areas- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian - are to have tougher restrictions imposed from Friday in a bid to reverse rising numbers of cases. It was also announced that a further 506 people in the UK had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 64,908. Another 18,450 infections were confirmed.

Covid rules still to be relaxed over ChristmasBut details are yet to be confirmed on whether advice on household mixing will be toughened.UK,"This video can not be played Minister Robert Jenrick says people ""should use their own judgement at Christmas"" A relaxation of coronavirus rules over Christmas will still go ahead despite calls for them to be toughened, the four UK nations have agreed. But sterner warnings will be issued to urge people to keep social contact low. UK leaders have come under pressure to review the five-day plan as Covid infections continue to rise in Wales and parts of south-east England. Only two households are advised to mix in Wales,under new stricter advice. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the House of Commons: ""We should exercise extreme caution in the way we celebrate Christmas."" He said discussions on Wednesday morning had resulted in ""unanimous agreement"" between the four UK nations ""that we should proceed in principle with the existing regulations because we don't want to criminalise people's long-made plans"". However, he added it was ""absolutely vital that people should, at this very, very tricky time, exercise a high degree of personal responsibility"". He urged people to be particularly careful when they come into contact with vulnerable people - and should avoid contact with elderly people ""wherever possible"". A statement is expected soon to confirm the details of Wednesday morning's talks. Between 23 and 27 December, you can form a""Christmas bubble"",externalcomprised of people from three households You can travel between tiers and between UK nations to meet your bubble You can only meet in homes, places of worship or public outdoor spaces - not pubs or restaurants You can meet people outside your bubble according to your local rules Earlier, cabinet minister Robert Jenrick urged the public to ""use their own judgement"" on who to see over the five days of relaxed rules, from 23 to 27 December. Mr Jenrick said the government ""can't legislate for every eventuality"" so the law which sets out the Christmas relaxations ""remains unchanged"". However, Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that further guidance would be published to show infection rates are rising in many parts of the country, and to reflect thatCovid cases surged in parts of the US following the Thanksgiving holiday. How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? An information campaign is expected to be launched in the days running up to Christmas, with people being urged to think carefully about bubbling with elderly or at-risk relatives. Mr Jenrick said based on the further guidance, the government would ask people to ""weigh up the risks to their own loved ones"" and ""exercise their own good judgement"" about their Christmas plans. ""You can come together as three families and bubble for up to five days - but I suspect many, many people across the country will choose to do less than that, to protect themselves, their loved ones, and broader society,"" he said. The government's Christmas travel adviser, Sir Peter Hendy, said ministers' message to the public would be ""stay local if you can"". He told MPs on the Transport Committee he was confident there would be no overcrowding on trains during the festive period, but urged passengers to book tickets early. Labour has called for the measures over Christmas to be reviewed. Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed told BBC Breakfast that the four UK nations should reconsider whether the proposed easing of restrictions was safe, ""given what we now know about the failure of [England's] tiered system to control the rate of infection"". It comes aftertwo leading journals said the ""rash"" decision to ease restrictions would ""cost many lives"". In a joint editorial, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal stressed that demand on the NHS was increasing, adding that a newstrain of coronavirus- identified in both England and Wales - ""has introduced further potential jeopardy"". Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the ""major driver"" for how much the disease spreads over the five-day Christmas period was the infection prevalence - and that the current prevalence had started to rise ""really quite rapidly in some places"". ""When the rules were made about Christmas, we didn't know what that prevalence was going to be,"" Prof Medley told the Today programme. As for the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed, he said: ""We don't have much headroom."" Patients face 12-hour wait as hospital struggles New Covid strain: How worried should we be? After the first round of talks on Tuesday, a UK government source said they were ""keen to maintain a UK-wide approach"". Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had earlier told the Scottish Parliament there was a ""case"" for tightening the planned freedoms to combat a rise in infections. In Wales, First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said ""the choice is a grim one"", but the current plans were a ""hard-won agreement"" he would not put aside ""lightly"". A spokeswoman for Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said they would be holding discussions with their medical and scientific advisers. Despite the significant pressure for a rethink, leaders from the UK are likely to stick to the deal they agreed last month. There are no plans for a change of regulations in England - and it's unlikely Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland will make changes either. But there are real concerns among decision makers about the impact the relaxations could have - in particular the number of people who will be travelling across the UK. So you can expect to hear much stronger advice that just because you can mix, that doesn't mean you should. Ministers are preparing to warn people they should limit their interactions before forming a Christmas bubble, that they should think carefully before mixing with elderly or at-risk relatives, and that where possible people should stay local and avoid travel. Leaders are still trying to strike a balance between allowing people to visit relatives who they may not have seen for months, without allowing the virus to run rampant. But many still believe that relaxing rules just as many areas are seeing a significant increase in cases is too risky, and will lead to a considerably more difficult period at the start of next year. The resumption of talks comes as nearly 10.8 million people in London, and parts of Essex and Hertfordshirejoined England's toughest tier of restrictionsat 00:01 GMT. It means some 34 million people in England are now living under the toughest rules - around 61% of England's population. RESTRICTIONS LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Under tier three - very high alert - rules, pubs and restaurants must close, except for takeaway and delivery, and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas must remain shut. Ministers are also due to review other English tiers today - with an announcement due on Thursday. On Tuesday, theScottish government announced that three council areas- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian - are to have tougher restrictions imposed from Friday in a bid to reverse rising numbers of cases. It was also announced that a further 506 people in the UK had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 64,908. Another 18,450 infections were confirmed.

"Europeans urged to wear masks for family ChristmasThe WHO says Europe is at ""high risk"" of a new wave of infections in the New Year.Europe","The situation in Germany has been described by officials as ""more serious than it has ever been"" The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged Europeans to wear masks during family gatherings at Christmas. It said Europe was at ""high risk"" of a new wave of coronavirus infections in the early part of 2021, as transmission of the virus remained high. Countries across the continent have been registering thousands of daily cases and hundreds of deaths. Germany was among countries tightening restrictions on Wednesday, closing schools and non-essential businesses. Meanwhile European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the first Covid vaccine would be authorised for use within a week. A far from traditional Christmas as German cases surge What are the Christmas restrictions around Europe? Tracking the global coronavirus outbreak Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - developed in Germany - would be rolled out for the bloc immediately, more than a week earlier than originally envisaged. A statement from the WHO's European regional office,externalsaid that the massive increase in gatherings of families and friends across Europe during the winter holiday season brought a significant risk of increased Covid-19 transmission. It urged individuals, families and communities to play their part to prevent another resurgence of cases. Family gatherings should be held outside if possible, and if indoors participants should wear masks and practice social distancing, it said. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas ""It may feel awkward to wear masks and practise physical distancing when around friends and family, but doing so contributes significantly to ensuring that everyone remains safe and healthy,"" the WHO added. ""Vulnerable people and older friends or relatives may find it very difficult to ask loved ones to stay away physically, regardless of the anxieties or concerns they may have. Consider what others may be feeling and the difficult decisions they will be facing."" The statement also urges people to avoid crowded public transport, and suggests that countries with ski resorts take steps to adapt them to avoid crowding during the skiing season. Separately, the WHO said on Wednesday thata team of 10 international scientists would travel to the Chinese city of Wuhannext month to investigate the origins of Covid-19. Only essential businesses such as supermarkets and banks will be allowed to remain open in the new lockdown in Germany, which will be in place until 10 January. Christmas will see a slight easing, with one household allowed to host up to four close family members. Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have been shut since November and some areas of the country had imposed their own lockdowns. Hair salons are among the businesses which must close, while drinking alcohol in public places, such as at popular mulled wine stalls, is forbidden. Companies are being urged to allow employees to work from home. The 952 new fatalities and 27,728 cases announced on Wednesday are a new peak for Germany's pandemic, but may cover numbers that were not included in previous days' statistics. The German lockdown has left much of central Berlin deserted Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, which is overseeing the Covid-19 response, said the situation was ""more serious than it has ever been"". Deutsche Welle reported that while cases in the younger population were falling, they were still rising among older people who were more likely to suffer more serious problems from the virus. Numbers in intensive care are reported to have reached critical levels. Announcing the new measures over the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the ""lockdown light"" begun in November had not done enough to bring the virus under control. The figures are particularly shocking, as during the early months of the pandemic Germany was more successful than many other European countries in its handling of the crisis. What's gone wrong for the country that came so successfully through the first wave of the pandemic? Some blame Germany's regional leaders who, until now, have dithered, bickered and resisted Chancellor Merkel's calls for a tougher nationwide response. And Prof Iris Pigeot, director of the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, says that ""people do not follow all the regulations that they're told. We had to reduce our contacts by about 75% but I think that didn't work"". She's concerned. ""New Year's Eve and Christmas could be a complete nightmare with increasing numbers, increasing numbers of deaths.""

What are the rules for Christmas?,"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary. You cannot go to the pub with members of your Christmas bubble. In England, if you have formed asupport bubblewith another household, that counts as one household. In Scotland,guidance,externalsays any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"". People who are self-isolatingshould not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone has to self-isolate. Under-18s whose parents live apart can join two Christmas bubbles, so they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students whotravel homewill be counted as part of their family household straight away.

Ethnic minorities 'less likely to take Covid vaccine',"Waiting to get the Covid vaccine in Barnet, north London People from ethnic minorities in the UK are significantly less likely to take the coronavirus vaccine - with warnings of targeted online scaremongering. A study from the Royal Society for Public Health found 57% of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people said they would take the vaccine. This compared with 79% of white people who would take a Covid vaccine. Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi warned of the impact of conspiracy theories being shared online. ""Anti-vaccination messages have been specifically targeted"" at some ethnic and religious communities, said Christina Marriott, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH). Dame Donna Kinnair saw first-hand the impact of Covid on BAME communities ""People send WhatsApps, videos, all kinds of messages - if you don't know where that's coming from then it is very likely to be inaccurate,"" said the vaccine deployment minister, Mr Zahawi, asking people to look at health information from official sources rather than rumours. ""This is an incredibly well developed scientific endeavour and I would urge everyone to take the information, read it and then make your mind up,"" he said. BBC Asian Network: Vaccine advice in South Asian languages Why are there higher Covid death rates among BAME people? Vaccine rumours debunked on 'altering DNA' Vaccines: Your questions answered by an expert Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said the apparent reluctance among BAME communities flew in the face of those most in need of vaccinations - which she had seen first-hand. ""For someone like me, who stood in the Nightingale, and saw row after row of BAME patients being ventilated - and seeing how it disproportionately affected people from the BAME community - I'd be urging everybody to take the vaccine,"" she said. Among thevaccine rumours, rejected as groundless by independent health experts, have been suggestions that vaccines could change someone's DNA or that it would inject a microchip. Rumours about vaccines is a problem for many online platforms, not just WhatsApp, - but the messaging service is using spam detection technology to control how information is shared and has partnered with reliable sources of information, including the World Health Organization, on a chatbot for Covid questions. Jabeer Butt, head of the Race Equality Foundation, said the findings on a lower ethnic minority take up were ""particularly worrying"". He warned the ""Covid vaccine may not reach the communities"" who had been worst affected and most ""disproportionately impacted"" by the virus. The study, based on a survey of more than 2,000 adults across the UK, revealed different levels of trust in the vaccination process among social and ethnic groups. On average, more than three-quarters of people would take a coronavirus vaccine if they were advised to by a doctor or health professional. People on lower incomes also seemed less confident about a vaccine, with a wealth gap in take-up: 84% of high earners planning to get vaccinated, compared with 70% of low earners. 55% of the Asian community would take a vaccine, the lowest acceptance 14% in London were ""very unlikely"" to get vaccinated, the highest region for rejections Women more reluctant to take the vaccine than men Ms Marriott, chief executive of the RSPH, said the findings were ""highly concerning"" that people from ethnic minorities and on low incomes were less willing to be vaccinated. ""These are exactly the groups which have suffered most through Covid. ""They continue to be most at risk of getting ill and most at risk of dying. So the government, the NHS and local public health must rapidly and proactively work with these communities,"" she said.

Allow pregnant women partner support 'at all times',"Pregnant women should be allowed to have one person alongside them during scans, appointments, labour and birth, under new NHS guidance sent to trusts in England. The chosen person should be regarded as ""an integral part of both the woman and baby's care"" - not just a visitor. But midwives are concerned safety is being sacrificed in favour of popularity. They say decisions on access should be left to local maternity staff. Since the first lockdown, individual hospitals have drawn up their own rules on partners being present, meaning some women have had to give birth unaccompanied. 'Covid meant I missed my daughter's birth' Birth in a pandemic: 'You are stronger than you think' 'It's our job to keep mothers and babies safe' The new guidance,externalsays pregnant women ""value the support from a partner, relative, friend or other person through pregnancy and childbirth, as it facilitates emotional wellbeing"". Women should therefore have access to support ""at all times during their maternity journey"". All trusts should now make it easy for this to happen, while keeping the risk of coronavirus transmission within NHS maternity services as low as possible. This video can not be played How has giving birth changed during the pandemic? The guidance says pregnant women should chose their support person, who does not need to be the co-parent or baby's father. Hospital trusts are being asked to reduce the risks of virus spread by: making changes to the space used to provide maternity care, to allow social distancing using rapid tests on women and their support person before they attend appointments The guidance says support people who test negative should be treated as part of the team supporting the woman. But Royal College of Midwives chief executive Gill Walton said: ""With more areas moving into tier-three restrictions, many will question the common sense of releasing this new guidance now. ""We support and trust local maternity and midwifery leaders to make decisions in the best interest of the women in their care. ""We trust them to work with health and safety representatives and to follow NHS England's own risk assessment process, which enables maternity services to make decisions about visiting and access for partners and families that are based on current, local information."" Pregnancy and childbirth doctors said they welcomed the new guidance, recognising how difficult restrictions on birth partners had been for women during the pandemic - but they queried the use of rapid tests to assess risk. ""We hope the roll-out of rapid testing will increase the time partners who test negative can spend with women and their babies on antenatal and postnatal wards, although we have concerns about the capacity and sensitivity of lateral flow testing to enable maternity services to reopen fully,"" said Dr Edward Morris, President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Dr Morris said decisions about visiting and access for partners and families would ""need to be based on local information and testing capacity, and clearly communicated to women and their families"".

""It's always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet,"" he said. After the news conference, the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments issued a joint statement saying this ""cannot be a normal Christmas"" and that they ""strongly"" recommended people stayed at home. They advised people who were visiting others to stop unnecessary social contact as soon as possible and for at least five days before travelling. No one should visit another household if they were ill or self-isolating, they said. Mr Johnson also advised people to avoid travelling from ""high prevalence"" areas to those with lower rates of coronavirus and not to stay away from home overnight if possible. This video can not be played Professor Whitty: 'You wouldn't drive down an icy road at 70 mph' Mr Johnson urged caution over seeing elderly or vulnerable relatives, saying that since the vaccine was being rolled out to these groups ""by the early months of the new year"", they would be able to meet people more safely soon. ""Whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales, and no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the new year,"" he added. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned: ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean it's sensible in any way."" ""Any kind of period where people come together in groups that otherwise wouldn't meet leads to an increase in risks and that will lead to an increase in hospitalisations and deaths,"" he said. He urged people to keep their Christmas celebrations small, short and local to reduce these risks. The four UK nations previously agreed a set of rules for the festive period, which has been set down in legislation and is not expected to change in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland - even though the guidance has been updated. Between 23 and 27 December, you can form a""Christmas bubble"",externalcomprised of people from three households You can travel between tiers and between UK nations to meet your bubble You can only meet in homes, places of worship or public outdoor spaces - not pubs or restaurants You can meet people outside your bubble according to your local rules But in Wales new guidance on households mixing will be put into law, meaning only two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone - will be able to form a Christmas bubble. UK leaders had come under pressure to review the guidance for Christmas amid rising infections. In November, all four nations agreed that three households would be able to form a Christmas bubble between 23 and 27 December, allowing them to mix indoors and stay overnight. However, the Welsh government has now decided Christmas bubbles should be limited to two households - plus an additional single person who lives alone. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced the country wouldhead back into a stay-at-home lockdownas soon as the Christmas period was over. RESTRICTIONS LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, saidher ""strong recommendation"" was to ""spend Christmas in your own home with your own household"", She added: ""We will set out advice if you are living in any of the nations in one of the highest level of protection - which in England and London is tier three - then we don't think you should be travelling to other parts of the UK."" Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said the public must take ""all and every precaution"" at Christmas and proposals for further restrictions would be brought forward on Thursday. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised governments needed to provide ""flexibility"" over Christmas and that people needed to take personal responsibility for their actions. As families decide what to do this Christmas, legally the options are - for the most part - the same. However, the reality feels very different following today's stern warnings and with a changing health picture. And while there have been variations in terms of detail and emphasis from UK leaders, the overall memo was essentially this: be very careful, be very cautious. And just because you can take advantage of an easing in the rules doesn't mean you should. The planned relaxation was never meant to be a free-for-all. But with this toughened guidance many may feel their options have narrowed. And for the politicians - they now have to a sell a more complicated public health message. You can take advantage of a relaxation in the rules. But maybe, please - don't. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour would support tougher restrictions over Christmas. ""We would have liked to have seen a toughening up today from the prime minister - perhaps something like what we've seen in Wales, reducing households,"" he told the BBC. ""I think he's going to have to go further in the coming days."" An information campaign is expected to be launched in the days running up to Christmas, with people being urged to think carefully before bubbling with elderly or at-risk relatives. Scientists at the University of Bristol studied the implications - and early results, yet to be formally published, indicate the fewer people the better, from the point of view of containing the disease. If a single-person household joins another household of any size, the impact on infection rates would be marginal, they suggest. But if all households in the UK paired up with one other, each bubble would contain an average of 4.7 people. That would lead to a reproduction (R) number within households of between 1.9-2.4. And an R number is above one means the disease is escalating.

In a joint editorial, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal said demand on the NHS was increasing, adding that a newstrain of coronavirushad introduced ""further potential jeopardy"". Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the ""major driver"" for how much the disease spread over the  Christmas period was the infection prevalence - and that the current prevalence had started to rise ""really quite rapidly in some places"". ""When the rules were made about Christmas, we didn't know what that prevalence was going to be,"" Prof Medley told the Today programme. As for the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed, he said: ""We don't have much headroom.""

It is still unclear what rules will apply to UK-EU trade after the transition period ends on 31 December, buttalks negotiations are continuing this weekafter the two sides failed to reach a deal by an agreed deadline on Sunday. However, time is running out and businesses say they need clarity. If a free trade deal can't be done, tariffs, extra taxes, are expected to be added to goods imported from the EU, and on British products exported to the bloc. Hornby boss Lyndon Davies said: ""Within Europe people are already asking us: 'If I buy something, are those tariffs already included in your pricing?'

Hornby also makes Scalextric racing sets There are also huge problems shipping products to the UK, because of bottlenecks at ports such Felixstowe and Southampton, Mr Davies said. Some shipping firms have been bypassing UK ports and unloading cargo in continental ports instead, to avoid the congestion and delays. ""I had a ship that should have arrived three weeks ago with Batman vs Joker Micro Scalextric sets. They've travelled the world. They've been to Rotterdam, Rotterdam was busy.

People who are having these talks just don't understand how the real world operates. They think at the last minute they can come up with a solution. People are going to be losing jobs."" Many UK companies have spent the last few months stockpiling goods and materials imported from abroad to mitigate against possible disruption to trade and supply chains at the end of the year. Mr Davies said he began ""over-shipping"" Hornby products months ago. But some business leaders say they don't expect much to change. Alex Baldock, the boss of Dixons Carphone, which owns Currys PC World, said: ""As far as Brexit is concerned, we're ready. ""We think there are about two days of supply delays that we're going to face and we can handle that. That's a reasonable worst case,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. With so many firms stockpiling though, demand for warehouse space in the UK is in danger of reaching full capacity, according to the logistic industry. ""In the run up to Brexit... importers have been getting stock in just to mitigate the risk of any potential disruption come January, the end of the transition period,"" said Peter Ward, chief executive of the UK Warehousing Association. ""The danger signs at the moment are that we're running at full capacity, in a bit of a perfect storm."" Mr Ward said that while the pandemic is still affecting supply chains, firms have been preparing for Brexit and there's been huge shipments of PPE.

"More than 130,000 vaccinated in UK in first weekHealth Minister Nadhim Zahawi says it is a ""really good start"" to the UK's programme.HealthComments","More than 130,000 people have been vaccinated in the first week of the UK's vaccination programme. Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is in charge of vaccine rollout, tweeted 137,897 people had been given their first doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech jab between 8 and 15 December. He described it as a ""really good start"" for the programme. The figure only captures the start of the community vaccination programme run by GPs which launched on Monday. About 200 of these local vaccination clinics are expected to be up and running by the end of the week. They will be followed by another 1,000 in the coming weeks. Who will get the vaccine first? What you need to know about vaccine safety How close is light at end of Covid tunnel? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? A rapid expansion will be needed. The government wants to offer everyone over 50 and younger adults with health conditions a vaccine - about 25 million people. But the National Audit Office has warned ""complex logistical challenges"" remain. It said thousands of extra staff would be needed to deliver vaccinations on the scale being talked about - the government has committed to offering all over 50s and younger adults with health conditions a vaccine. It said hospitals and GP-run local clinics would not be able to do this on their own. But it added the government had worked ""quickly and effectively"" to secure access to vaccines - contracts have been signed giving priority access to five different jabs. It estimated the vaccination programme, including manufacturing, purchasing and delivering the jabs, could cost up to Â£12bn. During the first week, more than 70 hospitals took part in the vaccination programme - with another 10 starting this week. Mr Zahawi said the figures were provisional and from next week there would be published data available. The breakdown for individual nations showed: 108,000 vaccinated in England 7,897 in Wales 4,000 in Northern Ireland 18,000 in Scotland ""Transparency is vital as we deliver vaccines across the UK,"" Mr Zahawi added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is just the start and we will steadily expand our vaccination programme - ultimately helping everyone get back to normal life."" The over-80s have been invited for vaccination first, along with some health and care staff. But the highest priority group, care-home residents, have only just started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. It has to be kept in in large batches in ultra-cold storage. And the NHS had been waiting for guidance on how it can be safely taken into care homes. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Breaking|Breaking newsMost Welsh shops to shut after Christmas EveA stay-at-home lockdown in Wales will then begin from 28 December.Wales,"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford announced new restrictions at a press conference on Wednesday Non-essential shops in Wales will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with an alert level four lockdown starting four days later. Close-contact services, such as hair salons, will also have to shut before Christmas, First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced. All pubs, cafes and restaurants will close at 18:00 GMT on Christmas Day. Meanwhile Mr Drakeford said only two households can meet during the festive period. It comes despite a previous agreement between the UK nationsto stick to plans to allow three households to mixbetween 23 and 27 December. Now in Walesthe number will be reduced to two households- plus an additional single person who lives alone - and this will become law. The other nations will stick to the three households rule. The UK leaders had come under pressure to revise the plans amid rising cases. The situation in Wales was ""extremely serious"", Mr Drakeford said, with one in five Covid-19 tests returning a positive result. More than 2,100 people, ""equivalent to five full general hospitals"" were being treated in the NHS with Covid, he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there was a ""very strong case"" for going into lockdown now, while Paul Davies, of the Welsh Conservatives, said ""doing nothing is not an option"". Wales will go into a level four lockdown, the highest possible, from 28 December, with some sectors closing during the Christmas period. Under the recently-published planspeople will be expected to stay at home, with travel only allowed for essential reasons. From 28 December, public facilities and holiday accommodation must be shut, and wedding receptions and wakes will need to be called off. How will Wales' new lockdown work? Pubs and restaurants had already been told not to sell alcohol earlier in December, and outdoor and indoor attractions - such as cinemas - are closed now. But schools and higher education establishments will remain open. The lockdown has no end date and will be reviewed every three weeks, beginning in January. As well as non-essential retail, leisure and fitness centres will have to shut after Christmas Eve. Lucy Evans said no sales will leave her with ""a huge stock pile"" Lucy Evans, co-owner of Me & Luce boutique in Carmarthen, said her family-run business is ""at a standstill"" with the news of the lockdown as she tries to navigate Christmas and stock levels under the new rules. ""We've had such a difficult year already. Obviously it is understandable that people's health and welfare comes first and I completely agree with that,"" she said. ""But in terms of business it is devastating."" Economy Minister Ken Skates said there would be an announcement later this week about a ""significant sum of money"" to provide more support for businesses, including the retail sector, affected by the further restrictions. ""But equally, we're asking businesses, we're asking citizens to put off some of the activities that they would normally undertake just after Christmas until, hopefully, later in January or perhaps a little later after that depending on the three-week review,"" he told BBC News. ""We do not underestimate the terrible strain that businesses are facing right now."" The change in the rules will mean Boxing Day sales cannot take place at many shops Mr Drakeford defended allowing hospitality businesses to stay open until 18:00 on Christmas Day. ""We are anxious not to face that industry with additional difficulties at this point,"" he said. ""We know that many people who live alone arrange their Christmas by booking a meal on Christmas Day, so that they can be in the company of other people. ""I wanted to be able to honour that so that those people do not face an even bleaker Christmas, even more alone and they otherwise would be with all the other harms that come from that."" Nine council areas have more than 20% of tests coming back positive in the last week. The World Health Organisation has recommended this should be below 5% for places to come out of restrictions. NHS Wales has again reported record numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds. This amounted to 2,143 on Tuesday, 17% more than a week before, and included 614 patients still recovering from the virus but not well enough to be discharged. Under-pressure hospitals in the Aneurin Bevan health board have the most Covid patients - 620, which is 45% of all patients in its beds. Numbers of Covid patients in critical care across Wales are also at their highest since the end of April. Meanwhile, the latest R-number - the rate at which the virus is estimated to be transmitting - is estimated to have increased to a range between 0.9 and 1.2 in Wales. Anything above 1 indicates Covid is increasing. The Sage scientific body estimates the virus could be shrinking or growing by between -1% and 4% a day in Wales. Later Mr Drakeford told the Senedd that despite the fact there is variation of coronavirus in parts of Wales, the whole country will be subjected to the highest restrictions. ""Coronavirus is rising in every part of our country and we have an obligation to take the action which will protect all parts of our country"". ""If some parts of Wales demonstrate in a reliable and sustainable way that they are in a different part of the spectrum to other parts of Wales, well that can be recognised but we are not in that position today"", he said. Plaid Cymru's Adam Price told a BBC Wales Live debate: ""If you follow the logic of the government's own scientific advice, if you're in an emergency situation where you have to pull the emergency cord, if you like, then you're better off doing that earlier. ""Because if you do that earlier that means that the period of lockdown is shorter, so all the other harms are reduced because you intervene earlier and it has greater impact."" Paul Davies, Welsh Conservatives leader in the Welsh Parliament, called for greater clarity regarding Christmas arrangements and urged minsters to keep the situation under review ""in order that the restrictions can be lifted as soon as it is safe to do so, including on a regional and local basis where possible."" ""We now need a fire blanket, not a firebreak, to put out the flames of infection that are raging in some parts of the country,"" he added. ""While nobody wants to see further restrictions imposed, in the face of some of the highest rates of coronavirus infection in Western Europe and with rates rising in all parts of Wales, doing nothing is not an option.""

Ferry stranded overnight after crew Covid outbreak,"Passengers spent the night on the Stena Edda ferry before disembarking in Birkenhead More than 300 passengers were stranded on a ferry overnight after crew members tested positive for Covid-19. The Belfast-bound Stena Line ferry was advised by Port Health Authorities not to leave Birkenhead after six members of staff were found to have coronavirus. All 322 passengers have now disembarked and the 53 crew members are being tested for Covid-19. Stena Line said passengers would travel to Belfast on another ferry. Passenger Alan Cogan said he was waiting for the replacement Stena Mersey vessel to take him home to Northern Ireland, but the delay meant he had to cancel a work video conference meeting. He said tensions were initially high when a public announcement was first made at about 03:30 GMT, more than five hours after the Stena Edda's departure time. ""I know there were a few irate people this morning,"" he said. ""We all had visions of what had happened to the crew ships around the world when passengers had tested positive and were left stranded and not allowed off. ""That would be a nightmare. It's not the most comfortable boat."" The 47-year-old, who is an area manager for a heating company, said staff had ""been friendly and supportive"". Alan Cogan said he was waiting for a replacement ferry to take him home to Northern Ireland Malcolm Sheen said he only realised the ferry had stayed in Birkenhead overnight when he woke up in the early hours. ""At 03:30, half asleep, I heard an announcement over the tannoy,"" he said. ""I didn't quite catch what had been said so assumed it was the announcement they make as we approach Belfast, which usually happens at 05:30. ""I looked out of the porthole and thought, that's not Belfast, that's Liverpool."" Mr Sheen, who is from Devon, said he had to wait in his van for almost two hours before he could disembark. ""At 10:00, I went down to my van and had to sit and wait in it for all the lorries to get backed up off the ferry,"" he said. ""At 11:45, I managed to get off and most passengers on board were transferred to the other ferry."" He added that he hoped he had not ""been in contact with any of the crew members that tested positive"". Passengers will be able to sail to Belfast on a replacement vessel - the Stena Mersey A woman who is travelling to Belfast with her three-year-old daughter for a funeral said she boarded ""with no problems"" and was not made aware of any risks about Covid-19. ""I went to my cabin and went to bed. We were not informed of any problems until 03:30 in the morning,"" she said. ""We had no further updates until 07:45 and that's when we where told that we would be moving to another ship to sail to Belfast. ""We were given a free cooked breakfast onboard, they were all giving free drinks to everyone onboard."" Stena Line said the six crew members were ""doing well"" and were showing mild symptoms. The company said another 15 people were self-isolating after being identified as ""close contacts"". ""The welfare of our passengers and crew is paramount at this time,"" it added.

First care home residents in Wales get vaccineA care home pilot for the Covid jab will begin later ahead of a possible rollout before Christmas.Wales,"This video can not be played Glenda Waye says she feels fine after the vaccine and anyone refusing it is ""silly"" The first care home residents in Wales have been given the Covid vaccination as the rollout of the jab continues. A pilot for the Pfizer/BioNtech jab started at Bryn Yr Haul House care home in Mold, Flintshire, on Wednesday. Wales' health minister said ""if all goes well"" officials will widen the scheme before Christmas. Care home owners said it was ""early steps in a great journey"" but warned the vaccination did not mean an open door policy for families of residents. Initially, the vaccine will be given to care homes near hospital pharmacies before a possible rollout. Bryn yr Haul residents received the vaccine on Wednesday ""I didn't feel a thing,"" said Bryn Yr Haul House resident Glenda Waye, 86, who had the vaccine on Wednesday. ""It is very important that you have it, and anybody that doesn't, I think it would be silly. ""It is better than having that virus, isn't it."" Boxing Day sales off ahead of new Wales lockdown Q&A: Which rules are changing and when? Bryn Yr Haul House resident Glenda Waye, 86, had the vaccine on Wednesday She said she had not been worried about catching Covid-19 as she left safe in the home, but she had missed being able to see family and have a ""cuddle"". She said it was ""lovely"" to see her son and daughter-in-law last week and she was looking forward to a visit from her sister on Sunday - for the first time since July. ""It is the cuddle you miss. Talking through the window, on the phone, isn't quite the same,"" she said, adding it ""would be lovely"" when it becomes possible after more people have the jab. Care home manager Christine Whiteside said the vaccination meant ""the beginning of an end"" following a ""rollercoaster"" year for residents and staff. Care home manager Christine Whiteside said the vaccine means visitors will eventually be able to ""hug"" loved ones again ""This moment means now we will be open eventually to indoor visiting,"" she said. ""We will be able to have the opportunity for relatives to come in, to meet their loved ones, to hold them, to hug them, to kiss them. ""Having the opportunity to get back to a near normal is absolutely amazing, it really is."" James McGuigan, from Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said it was a ""day we have been looking forward to for many, many months"", with the vaccine able to ""protect some of the most vulnerable people in society"". Clive Nadin, the owner and manager of Abbey Dale House Care Home in Colwyn Bay, said he and a handful of his 30 staff were given the vaccine on Tuesday. He said two members of staff would not receive the vaccine - one is scared of needles and the other could not take it on medical grounds. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""I'm feeling fine, a slight sore arm which is one of the expected side effects. ""It's just a real game-changerâ¦ something we've got to do and I implore everybody to follow suit."" He said getting the vaccine to residents was a ""real logistical challenge"" as they ""come in large packs of 975â¦ the vaccine could be damaged if it's moved."" Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Wales' schools and colleges to get Covid tests The group that represents care homes in Wales said the rise in Covid rates across Wales - with some areas among the highest in the UK - meant homes would be ""careful"" and ""cautious"" with family visits to residents over the Christmas period. Latest figures show Wales has the worst infection rate of the four UK nations - with a case rate of 416.5 cases per 100,000 people over seven days - with Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend in the top four worst affected local authority areas. There are 1,055 care homes in Wales and 120 of them (11%) had notified one or more positive cases in staff or residents in the most recent week and 27% had within the past month, according to Care Inspectorate Wales Neath Port Talbot had 16 care homes which had notified at least one case in the week ending 6 December, Swansea was next with 13 care homes, Caerphilly and Cardiff were next highest, each with 11 Across Wales, 3,705 care home residents were tested in the most recent week and 265 (7.1%) were positive - fewer than the week before. But it has dropped from the numbers we saw at the end of October, Public Health Wales figures suggest There have been 950 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 4 December, making up 24.4% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales There were 42 care home deaths in Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest ONS weekly total in Wales, fewer than last week Ten of the deaths were in care homes in Swansea, six in Torfaen and five in Neath Port Talbot ""Nobody wants to be separated at Christmas,"" said Care Forum Wales chairman Mario Kreft. ""But there are rises in community transmission across Wales, so we must be very careful as we go forward in these next weeks and months. ""We could see all residents vaccinated by, let's say, February, so we're only weeks away."" But while Wales' Older People's Commissioner was ""delighted"" the pilot had started, she said it was ""crucial"" care home residents can have visits from loved ones. ""As it is likely to be some time before all older people living in care homes are protected by the vaccine, it is crucial that residents can stay in close contact with their loved ones,"" said Helena Herklots. She said she wanted ""safe visits can go ahead wherever possible, which will be particularly important over the Christmas period"". Welsh officialshad previously not been able to saywhen vaccination of care home residents would begin, despite the group being a priority for the vaccine programme. Health Minister Vaughan Gething initially said it would not be safe to get the jab to care homes because the vaccineneeds to be kept at -70cand health chiefs wanted to use a small number of hubs. But Pfizer has since confirmed thevaccine could be ""packed down"" into smaller pack sizes,,externalallowing it to go to care homes, which Mr Gething said can ""bring a new level of protection to some of our most vulnerable people"". Care home residents began to receive thevaccine in Scotland on Monday. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: First care home resident receives vaccine A report had saidcare homes had been ""badly let down""during the coronavirus pandemic with almost30,000 more residents in England and Walesdying during the the early part of the pandemic than during the same period in 2019. Thecoronavirus vaccine rollout in Walesstarted last week with front-line health care and social care workers prioritised. Mr Gething said: ""We need to continue to make sure we can safely transport the vaccine to people who can't come to clinics. ""If all goes well this week, we will roll out care home vaccination ahead of Christmas, bringing a new level of protection to some of our most vulnerable people.""

Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor There was a muted atmosphere in the Commons for what might or might not be the final PMQs of the year. Boris Johnson trying as ever to be upbeat, focusing on the Covid vaccine and mass testing as reasons to be cheerful. But ministers know there are some difficult weeks ahead. Uncertainty remains over a Brexit deal too - MPs could find that their own Christmas plans are disrupted by business in the House of Commons as well as the pandemic.

By Ben Butcher Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer said that âIn three out of four tier two areas, infections are going up. In over half of the tier three areas, infections are going up.â When England exited its second national lockdown on December 2, 119 of the countryâs 316 local authorities were placed into tier three areas. Of these areas, rolling weekly case rates have increased in 61 of them (although the latest day the government has released these numbers for is December 10) â or just over a half. And case rates are increasing in an even higher proportion of tier two areas â 159 out of 195 local authorities placed in tier two areas have cases growing. So Mr Starmer is correct in both of his claims. Case rates are increasing in a higher proportion of local authorities in the South of England than those in the North or Midlands. Case rates show the proportion of the population who have tested positive for coronavirus in any given week. This can though be influenced by the amount of tests done in an area. However, weekly admissions to hospital, which can be a metric of serious coronavirus cases, have also started increasing again.  Allow Twitter content?

Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about the ongoing UK/EU trade talks and said the UK will âprosper mightily on the terms we agree with our European friends, whatever they may be, whether they're Australian or Canadian."" Itâs a phrase heâs used many times before. But Australian terms is a euphemism for having no trade deal with the UKâs largest trading partner, which accounted for 43% of the countryâs exports in 2019 and 51% of its imports. Australia trades with the EU on the basic rules of the World Trade Organisation, which means tariffs or taxes on goods crossing borders. The UK does far more trade with the EU than Australia does, so businesses would be faced with far more tariffs. Australia also has a series of separate deals with the EU which make trade easier. The UK would have no such agreements if its negotiations with the EU end without a deal being done. Canada terms refers to a basic free trade deal which the EU has with the country and which largely removed tariffs, but took a long time to negotiate. Read more here. Allow Twitter content?

And that ends the final Prime Minister's Questions of 2020. Or was it? With rumours swirling around Westminster that the House may still be sitting next week - if there is a deal done with the EU for a post-Brexit trade deal - will there be another PMQs next Wednesday too? Labour's Seema Malhotra says a constituent whose son had to miss school because of required self-isolation hasn't received compensation and urges the PM to change the rules in England. The PM says ministers are doing ""whatever we can"" to help parents during the Covid crisis. He adds that keeping children in school is a priority and that testing and the use of vaccines can help the country move forward. Conservative Mark Eastwood says Kirklees College, West Yorkshire, has opened a new campus despite the pandemic. He asks the PM to visit the ""iconic"" building and its ""amazing"" sculpture, on loan from artist Anthony Gormley. Boris Johnson says he admires Gormley's work ""greatly"" and will try to make it. Labour's Sharon Hodgson says engineers in her consistency working for Centrica British Gas have been told they have to sign new contracts before Christmas otherwise they will be fired and re-hired on worse terms. She urges the PM to condemn this practice and to ban firing and re-hiring practices. Boris Johnson says business must treat employees with ""fairness and respect"". However he also adds that ""it is vital that we have a flexible economy able to generate jobs particularly when we are going to be going through a difficult and bumpy time."" Conservative Huw Merriman says people offered the vaccine would be doing a ""civic duty"" to accept it, allowing the UK to return to a normal way of life. Mr Johnson says those who are offered the vaccine will be protecting themselves, and everyone else. Following a question from the SNP's Ronnie Cowanabout record deaths from drug misuse in Scotlandthe PM says the SNP government is responsible for ""failures"" on drug law enforcement in Scotland. Mr Cowan asks the PM if he supports the introduction of drug consumption rooms in Glasgow. Mr Johnson says he does not, and says adequate measures are in place, but need to be acted upon. Labour's Liz Twist says local pubs have been ""devastated"" and are ""at the heart of our communities"". She warns that compensation schemes are not giving enough to get pubs to survive. Mr Johnson says ""we are committed to doing everything we can"" including additional payments for pubs. He says areas should ""work together to reduce the virus through community testing in the way that Liverpool has succeeded in doing,"" he says this will allow pubs to reopen. Asked by Conservative Anthony Browne about schools in Cambridgeshire getting the ""resources they need"", the PM says it is the government's job to spend money ""responsibly"". He adds that funding per pupil is going up next year. Conservative James Davies welcomes the Â£14bn allocated for research and development at the last spending review. However he raises concern that charity-funded medical research - which he says has been hit hard by the pandemic - will be ""left behind"". He asks the PM to intervene to ensure some of the Â£14bn goes towards a life-sciences and charity partnership fund. Boris Johnson says his government is investing ""record amounts"" in the sector. The PM tells the SDLP's Colum Eastwood that the whole of the UK will take part in any trade deals done in future. He adds that Northern Ireland will continue to have ""full access"" to the rest of the UK internal market. Â© 2025 BBC.

'Large fire' breaks out at theme parkThe blaze happened in a changing block in the Thomas Land area of Drayton Manor theme park.,"The fire service was called at about 23:00 GMT on Tuesday A large fire has caused damage to a changing block at Drayton Manor theme park. The blaze took hold in the Thomas Land area on Tuesday night, Staffordshire Fire and Rescue said. The theme park confirmed no-one was injured and all of the animals at the park were safe. Currently closed due to Covid-19 restrictions, Drayton Manor keeps about 100 animals on its premises in Tamworth, Staffordshire. Incident commander Stuart Ruckledge said the whole changing block had been alight, but crews were able to stop the fire spreading to other areas of the park. Drayton Manor is currently closed and unable to hold Christmas events because of Covid restrictions The fire affected a toilet block in Thomas Land The park said it had been able to assess the damage and said it was ""relieved"" that it was ""limited to a toilet block and store cupboard, both within Thomas Land"". It said all of the rides ""remain intact with very limited damage"". The fire service is expected to start an investigation into the cause of the blaze. Staffordshire Fire and Rescue said 28 service personnel attended the scene from 22:30 GMT and the fire was put out after crews ""broke through the roof of an adjoining building"". A fire appliance remained at the site, damping down hotspots, all night and into the morning, the service said.

Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor There was a muted atmosphere in the Commons for what might or might not be the final PMQs of the year. Boris Johnson trying as ever to be upbeat, focusing on the Covid vaccine and mass testing as reasons to be cheerful. But ministers know there are some difficult weeks ahead. Uncertainty remains over a Brexit deal too - MPs could find that their own Christmas plans are disrupted by business in the House of Commons as well as the pandemic. Here's a quick reminder of what you can and can't do over Christmas  Find the details here in full. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Ben Butcher Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer said that âIn three out of four tier two areas, infections are going up. In over half of the tier three areas, infections are going up.â When England exited its second national lockdown on December 2, 119 of the countryâs 316 local authorities were placed into tier three areas. Of these areas, rolling weekly case rates have increased in 61 of them (although the latest day the government has released these numbers for is December 10) â or just over a half. And case rates are increasing in an even higher proportion of tier two areas â 159 out of 195 local authorities placed in tier two areas have cases growing. So Mr Starmer is correct in both of his claims. Case rates are increasing in a higher proportion of local authorities in the South of England than those in the North or Midlands. Case rates show the proportion of the population who have tested positive for coronavirus in any given week. This can though be influenced by the amount of tests done in an area. However, weekly admissions to hospital, which can be a metric of serious coronavirus cases, have also started increasing again.  Allow Twitter content?

Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about the ongoing UK/EU trade talks and said the UK will âprosper mightily on the terms we agree with our European friends, whatever they may be, whether they're Australian or Canadian."" Itâs a phrase heâs used many times before. But Australian terms is a euphemism for having no trade deal with the UKâs largest trading partner, which accounted for 43% of the countryâs exports in 2019 and 51% of its imports. Australia trades with the EU on the basic rules of the World Trade Organisation, which means tariffs or taxes on goods crossing borders. The UK does far more trade with the EU than Australia does, so businesses would be faced with far more tariffs. Australia also has a series of separate deals with the EU which make trade easier. The UK would have no such agreements if its negotiations with the EU end without a deal being done. Canada terms refers to a basic free trade deal which the EU has with the country and which largely removed tariffs, but took a long time to negotiate. Read more here. Allow Twitter content?

And that ends the final Prime Minister's Questions of 2020. Or was it? With rumours swirling around Westminster that the House may still be sitting next week - if there is a deal done with the EU for a post-Brexit trade deal - will there be another PMQs next Wednesday too? Labour's Seema Malhotra says a constituent whose son had to miss school because of required self-isolation hasn't received compensation and urges the PM to change the rules in England. The PM says ministers are doing ""whatever we can"" to help parents during the Covid crisis. He adds that keeping children in school is a priority and that testing and the use of vaccines can help the country move forward. Conservative Mark Eastwood says Kirklees College, West Yorkshire, has opened a new campus despite the pandemic. He asks the PM to visit the ""iconic"" building and its ""amazing"" sculpture, on loan from artist Anthony Gormley. Boris Johnson says he admires Gormley's work ""greatly"" and will try to make it. Labour's Sharon Hodgson says engineers in her consistency working for Centrica British Gas have been told they have to sign new contracts before Christmas otherwise they will be fired and re-hired on worse terms. She urges the PM to condemn this practice and to ban firing and re-hiring practices. Boris Johnson says business must treat employees with ""fairness and respect"". However he also adds that ""it is vital that we have a flexible economy able to generate jobs particularly when we are going to be going through a difficult and bumpy time."" Conservative Huw Merriman says people offered the vaccine would be doing a ""civic duty"" to accept it, allowing the UK to return to a normal way of life. Mr Johnson says those who are offered the vaccine will be protecting themselves, and everyone else. Following a question from the SNP's Ronnie Cowanabout record deaths from drug misuse in Scotlandthe PM says the SNP government is responsible for ""failures"" on drug law enforcement in Scotland. Mr Cowan asks the PM if he supports the introduction of drug consumption rooms in Glasgow. Mr Johnson says he does not, and says adequate measures are in place, but need to be acted upon. Labour's Liz Twist says local pubs have been ""devastated"" and are ""at the heart of our communities"". She warns that compensation schemes are not giving enough to get pubs to survive. Mr Johnson says ""we are committed to doing everything we can"" including additional payments for pubs. He says areas should ""work together to reduce the virus through community testing in the way that Liverpool has succeeded in doing,"" he says this will allow pubs to reopen. Asked by Conservative Anthony Browne about schools in Cambridgeshire getting the ""resources they need"", the PM says it is the government's job to spend money ""responsibly"". He adds that funding per pupil is going up next year. Conservative James Davies welcomes the Â£14bn allocated for research and development at the last spending review. However he raises concern that charity-funded medical research - which he says has been hit hard by the pandemic - will be ""left behind"". He asks the PM to intervene to ensure some of the Â£14bn goes towards a life-sciences and charity partnership fund. Boris Johnson says his government is investing ""record amounts"" in the sector. The PM tells the SDLP's Colum Eastwood that the whole of the UK will take part in any trade deals done in future. He adds that Northern Ireland will continue to have ""full access"" to the rest of the UK internal market. Â© 2025 BBC.

Breaking|Breaking newsMost Welsh shops to shut after Christmas Eve,"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford announced new restrictions at a press conference on Wednesday Non-essential shops in Wales will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with an alert level four lockdown starting four days later. Close-contact services, such as hair salons, will also have to shut before Christmas, First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced. All pubs, cafes and restaurants will close at 18:00 GMT on Christmas Day. Meanwhile Mr Drakeford said only two households can meet during the festive period. It comes despite a previous agreement between the UK nationsto stick to plans to allow three households to mixbetween 23 and 27 December. Now in Walesthe number will be reduced to two households- plus an additional single person who lives alone - and this will become law. The other nations will stick to the three households rule. The UK leaders had come under pressure to revise the plans amid rising cases. The situation in Wales was ""extremely serious"", Mr Drakeford said, with one in five Covid-19 tests returning a positive result. More than 2,100 people, ""equivalent to five full general hospitals"" were being treated in the NHS with Covid, he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there was a ""very strong case"" for going into lockdown now, while Paul Davies, of the Welsh Conservatives, said ""doing nothing is not an option"". Wales will go into a level four lockdown, the highest possible, from 28 December, with some sectors closing during the Christmas period. Under the recently-published planspeople will be expected to stay at home, with travel only allowed for essential reasons. From 28 December, public facilities and holiday accommodation must be shut, and wedding receptions and wakes will need to be called off. How will Wales' new lockdown work? Pubs and restaurants had already been told not to sell alcohol earlier in December, and outdoor and indoor attractions - such as cinemas - are closed now. But schools and higher education establishments will remain open. The lockdown has no end date and will be reviewed every three weeks, beginning in January. As well as non-essential retail, leisure and fitness centres will have to shut after Christmas Eve. Lucy Evans said no sales will leave her with ""a huge stock pile"" Lucy Evans, co-owner of Me & Luce boutique in Carmarthen, said her family-run business is ""at a standstill"" with the news of the lockdown as she tries to navigate Christmas and stock levels under the new rules. ""We've had such a difficult year already. Obviously it is understandable that people's health and welfare comes first and I completely agree with that,"" she said. ""But in terms of business it is devastating."" Economy Minister Ken Skates said there would be an announcement later this week about a ""significant sum of money"" to provide more support for businesses, including the retail sector, affected by the further restrictions. ""But equally, we're asking businesses, we're asking citizens to put off some of the activities that they would normally undertake just after Christmas until, hopefully, later in January or perhaps a little later after that depending on the three-week review,"" he told BBC News. ""We do not underestimate the terrible strain that businesses are facing right now."" The change in the rules will mean Boxing Day sales cannot take place at many shops Mr Drakeford defended allowing hospitality businesses to stay open until 18:00 on Christmas Day. ""We are anxious not to face that industry with additional difficulties at this point,"" he said. ""We know that many people who live alone arrange their Christmas by booking a meal on Christmas Day, so that they can be in the company of other people. ""I wanted to be able to honour that so that those people do not face an even bleaker Christmas, even more alone and they otherwise would be with all the other harms that come from that."" Nine council areas have more than 20% of tests coming back positive in the last week. The World Health Organisation has recommended this should be below 5% for places to come out of restrictions. NHS Wales has again reported record numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds. This amounted to 2,143 on Tuesday, 17% more than a week before, and included 614 patients still recovering from the virus but not well enough to be discharged. Under-pressure hospitals in the Aneurin Bevan health board have the most Covid patients - 620, which is 45% of all patients in its beds. Numbers of Covid patients in critical care across Wales are also at their highest since the end of April. Meanwhile, the latest R-number - the rate at which the virus is estimated to be transmitting - is estimated to have increased to a range between 0.9 and 1.2 in Wales. Anything above 1 indicates Covid is increasing. The Sage scientific body estimates the virus could be shrinking or growing by between -1% and 4% a day in Wales. Later Mr Drakeford told the Senedd that despite the fact there is variation of coronavirus in parts of Wales, the whole country will be subjected to the highest restrictions. ""Coronavirus is rising in every part of our country and we have an obligation to take the action which will protect all parts of our country"". ""If some parts of Wales demonstrate in a reliable and sustainable way that they are in a different part of the spectrum to other parts of Wales, well that can be recognised but we are not in that position today"", he said. Plaid Cymru's Adam Price told a BBC Wales Live debate: ""If you follow the logic of the government's own scientific advice, if you're in an emergency situation where you have to pull the emergency cord, if you like, then you're better off doing that earlier. ""Because if you do that earlier that means that the period of lockdown is shorter, so all the other harms are reduced because you intervene earlier and it has greater impact."" Paul Davies, Welsh Conservatives leader in the Welsh Parliament, called for greater clarity regarding Christmas arrangements and urged minsters to keep the situation under review ""in order that the restrictions can be lifted as soon as it is safe to do so, including on a regional and local basis where possible."" ""We now need a fire blanket, not a firebreak, to put out the flames of infection that are raging in some parts of the country,"" he added. ""While nobody wants to see further restrictions imposed, in the face of some of the highest rates of coronavirus infection in Western Europe and with rates rising in all parts of Wales, doing nothing is not an option.""

"MacKenzie Scott gives away $4.2bn in four monthsThe ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been focusing on women, people of colour and food banks.Business","Mackenzie Scott pictured with her ex-husband Jeff Bezos in 2017 MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has donated more than $4bn (Â£3bn) to food banks and emergency relief funds in four months. In a blog post, Ms Scott said she wanted to help Americans who were struggling because of the pandemic. Ms Scott is the world's 18th-richest person, having seen her wealth climb $23.6bn this year to $60.7bn. Much of her fortune comes from her divorce from Mr Bezos who is the world's richest man. ""This pandemic has been a wrecking ball in the lives of Americans already struggling,"",externalshe wrote in a blog post on Tuesday, adding that she had picked more than 380 charities to donate to having considered almost 6,500 organisations. ""Economic losses and health outcomes alike have been worse for women, for people of colour and for people living in poverty. Meanwhile, it has substantially increased the wealth of billionaires."" MacKenzie Scott donates $1.7bn since Bezos divorce Amazon spends $500m on bonuses for Christmas staff Ms Scott donated $1.7bn to 116 charities in July saying she wanted to call attention to ""organisations and leaders driving change."" This takes her total donations for the year to almost $6bn. Donations were focused on those ""operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates, and low access to philanthropic capital."" Last year she signed the Giving Pledge, promising to give away the majority of her fortune.The Giving Pledge,externalis a commitment by the world's wealthiest individuals and families to dedicate the majority of their wealth to giving back. ""I have a disproportionate amount of money to share,"" she wrote in her pledge. This video can not be played MacKenzie Scott is divorced from Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man Charity experts have applauded the amount she has given away and how she has done it. Ms Scott has worked with a team of advisers to research thousands of organisations. ""We leveraged this collective knowledge base in a collaboration that included hundreds of emails and phone interviews, and thousands of pages of data analysis on community needs, programme outcomes, and each non-profit's capacity to absorb and make effective use of funding,"" she wrote. This year Mr Bezos, who is the boss of Amazon, has also been active with philanthropy, committing $10bn to issues related to climate change. In November, he announced the first of those grants, handing out nearly $800m to 16 groups. Mr Bezos has seen his net worth increase $70bn this year to reach a fortune of $185bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. During the pandemic there has been a massive rise in online shopping benefitting online retailers such as Amazon. Swiss bank UBS said billionaires had done ""extremely well"" in the Covid crisis. This year there has been a relatively high number of mega-donations as celebrities, sports stars and business leaders respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and other causes. Among the most generous was Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey who announced in April that he was moving $1bn of his assets into a fund to support pandemic relief efforts and other causes. This represents about a quarter of his $3.9bn net worth. Bill Gates and his wife Melinda have committed $305m for vaccines, treatment and diagnostic development through their charitable foundation, while Harry Potter author JK Rowling donated Â£1m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the pandemic. On a different theme, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $300m to ""protect American elections"". The majority of the money went to the Centre for Tech and Civic Life, a non-profit organisation to recruit poll workers and supply them with personal protective equipment, and to set up drive-through voting. In June, basketball legend Michael Jordan announced he was donating $100m to Black Lives Matters and social injustice causes over the next decade.

House building plans revised after Tory backlash,"Proposals for controversial planning reforms in England have been revised, after new housing targets prompted a backlash amongst many Conservative MPs. A computer-based formula used to decide where houses should be located has been ""updated"" to focus more on cities and urban areas in the North and Midlands. Ministers said cash for brownfield sites would be distributed more fairly outside London and the South East. Some MPs in southern England said their areas risked being ""concreted over"". The government wants to 300,000 new homes to be built across England each year by the mid-2020s. In August, it proposed a new formula designed to provide a rough estimate to councils on how many properties needed to be built in their communities. May attacks 'ill-conceived' planning reforms Government won't cut 300,000 homes target, says housing secretary Johnson defends 'long overdue' planning overhaul Local authorities would have been expected to come forward with potential sites - taking into account constraints, such as areas protected by the green belt. But several senior Conservative MPs expressed concerns about relying on what one of them called a ""mutant algorithm"" to decide housing needs. Has the pandemic changed the housing supply equation for England? Working from home and shopping online have hollowed out many urban centres, with offices and shops empty and unused. Could our struggling High Streets and business zones be repurposed as residential neighbourhoods? Today's planning announcement suggests just that, shifting the housebuilding emphasis to brownfield urban sites in the West Midlands and northern England, away from rural and semi-rural communities in the South East. While that may please some of the government's critics on its own backbenches, the question is whether the change makes it harder for ministers to keep their promise to build enough affordable and beautiful homes where people want to live. There is a limited supply of brownfield sites and often they are difficult and expensive to develop - odd-shaped bits of land alongside a railway line or contaminated by industry. Recent experience of turning office blocks and shops into homes has seen concerns about quality standards. The greatest demand for housing is in the South East where affordability remains the biggest issue.  Today the ONS reported that the average house price in the region rose to a new high of Â£337,400 - almost two and a half times the average in north-east England. In October, former Prime Minister Theresa May called the plans ""ill-conceived"", while ex-Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt accused the government of risking ""undermining"" local democracy by pressing ahead. The 300,000 target, a Conservative manifesto commitment at the last election, remains in place and new homes will still be built in the South, but the government will prioritise brownfield sites in England's 20 largest cities and other urban areas. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said a consultation showed people ""strongly supported"" increased homebuilding. But they ""understandably wanted more homes to be built in urban areas"", as these were the ""most environmentally sustainable"" sites, with good transport links, he added. Mr Jenrick also said: ""They wanted to use housing to push private sector investment into the cities of the North and Midlands...that's what we've done in this update to the methodology."" A taskforce has been set up to advise on inner-city regeneration and how to respond to the fall in demand for office and retail space during the pandemic. The West Midlands and Greater Manchester Mayoral Combined Authorities will receive Â£67m in new funding between them for brownfield developments. A new Â£100m fund will be launched in January, giving councils across England the chance to pitch for money to support developments on public land and regeneration of council estates. Ministers have also pledged to think again about how up to Â£7bn in future funding is allocated across England so that it is not concentrated in the most prosperous areas in London and the South East. ""This is good news,"" said Isle of Wight Conservative MP Bob Seely, one of the most stringent critics of the algorithm. ""This is an initial victory for those who care about their communities. ""I, and I am sure many others, want to work supportively with the government to make sure we build the right homes in the right places.""

Clothing and food prices fall in November lockdown,"The UK's inflation rate fell dramatically to 0.3% in November from 0.7% in October, official figures show. Lower prices for clothing, food and non-alcoholic drinks made the biggest contribution to the fall, the Office for National Statistics said. However, games, toys and hobbies increased in price, partly offsetting those declines. The figures reflect the fact that most of the country was in some form of Covid lockdown during the month. Analysts also pointed to November's Black Friday sales, saying clothing retailers offered bigger discounts than usual this year. The ONS said there had been media reports that some Black Friday sales might have spread further across the month. Games and toys became more expensive as people tried to amuse themselves while their movements were restricted. Shops offer festive discounts in battle for survival Christmas comes early with 'record' grocery sales Normally, prices for clothes fall each year in summer sales before autumn ranges come in, then rise before further sales towards the end of the year, the ONS said. Clothes would usually go up in price in November, the ONS said. However, the coronavirus crisis has changed how prices move. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. The latest Consumer Prices Index figures come amid evidence that shop prices are falling in the run-up to Christmas, as retailers race to clear stock and deal with a ""deepening"" High Street crisis. ""With significant restrictions in place across the UK, inflation slowed, predominantly due to clothing and food prices. Also, after several months of buoyant growth, second-hand car prices fell back a little,"" said the ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics, Jonathan Athow. Discounts are most common at retailers selling fashion and DIY goods, according to the British Retail Consortium's (BRC) Shop Price Index. The sharp fall in inflation ""came as a bit of a surprise"", said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. ""What we hadn't anticipated was the slump in food inflation from 0.6% to -0.6%, which came despite the boost to demand for food in the supermarkets during the second Covid-19 lockdown."" However, she added: ""This does not change the big picture that inflation will start to rise more sharply from April when the temporary VAT cut for the hospitality sector is reversed and the downward drag from the previous plunge in fuel prices drops out of the annual comparison. ""Together these forces could lift inflation to 2% by the middle of next year. But given there will still be some spare capacity in the economy, there seems little danger of inflation rising sustainably above the 2% target unless there is a no-deal Brexit."" Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said there had been a Black Friday effect, with increased discounting by retailers pushing down the cost of clothing and footwear. ""Of course, Black Friday occurs every year, but this time around, discounts were particularly steep in clothing sales, which led to an unseasonal fall in prices,"" he said. ""That highlights the continued pressure on the retail sector, and while price cuts on the shelves are good for consumers, they don't bode well for profits."" Hannah Audino, economist at PwC, said: ""The acceleration of consumer price growth over the past two months has been cut short. ""Most of the main groups of goods and services experienced a fall in prices between October and November, including transport, health, recreation and culture. ""The largest drop in prices came from clothing and footwear as retailers discounted products for Black Friday.""

"Pollution a factor in girl's death, inquest findsIn the three years before her death, Ella Kissi-Debrah was admitted to hospital 27 times.London","Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road in south-east London A nine-year-old girl who died following an asthma attack has become the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death. Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London, died in 2013. Southwark Coroner's Court found that air pollution ""made a material contribution"" to Ella's death. Prof Gavin Shaddick, a government adviser on air pollution, called it ""a landmark decision"". At the conclusion of the two-week inquest, coroner Philip Barlow said Ella had been exposed to ""excessive"" levels of pollution. The inquest heard that in the three years before her death, she had multiple seizures and was admitted to hospital 27 times. 'Did air pollution kill my daughter?' Girl with asthma 'living on knife edge' before death New inquest into girl's 'pollution' death Delivering a narrative verdict, Mr Barlow said levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) near Ella's home exceeded World Health Organization and European Union guidelines. He added: ""There was a recognised failure to reduce the levels of nitrogen dioxide, which possibly contributed to her death. ""There was also a lack of information given to Ella's mother that possibly contributed to her death."" Giving his conclusion over almost an hour, the coroner said: ""I will conclude that Ella died of asthma, contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution."" Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said she did not know how dangerous local levels of pollution were before her daughter's death Ella's mother Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, said: ""We've got the justice for her which she so deserved. ""But also it's about other children still, as we walk around our city of high levels of air pollution."" Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said she was ""shocked"" by how ""decisive and comprehensive"" the findings were. Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit, Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah had told the inquest. As a six-year-old, she had to be placed in a medically induced coma for three days to try to stabilise her condition. By the summer of 2012, Ella was classified as disabled and her mother said she often had to carry her by piggyback to get her around. Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said: ""I think people need to understand when Ella was rushed into hospital, a lot of the time she was barely breathing. ""It was an emergency, cardiac arrest."" Ella died in the early hours of 15 February 2013, following a severe asthma attack. Ella was classified as disabled due to her respiratory problems A 2018 report found unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack. The report's author Prof Sir Stephen Holgate said Ella had been ""living on a knife edge"" in the months before her death. The inquest heard Ella's family did not know of the risks posed by air pollution. This is an historic verdict. Typically, experts refer to air pollution being ""associated"" with premature deaths because they can't be sure any one individual's death was caused or partly caused by dirty air. This case pins Ella's untimely death partly on to the air she breathed. It will heighten the debate about social equity in the UK. The poorest tend to suffer the worst air, whilst - on a national basis - the richest tend to drive furthest. Campaigners now want emergency action - including expanding London's clean-air zone for vehicles out to the M25 and making Britain's streets better for walking and cycling. But there are myriad sources of pollution. Gas boilers, construction equipment, paint and dust from brakes and tyres all contribute. Ultimately, it won't be possible to completely clean the air in some of the UK's big cities. Ahead of the conclusion of the inquest, Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote to Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah calling her ""a hero"". The Hollywood actor and former governor of California, who has long been an advocate for better clean-air standards, thanked her for ""exposing air pollution for the killer it is"". Prof Shaddick, who leads Exeter University's data science department, said he hoped the inquest ruling ""makes improving the air we breathe easier to achieve in the future"". ""It's just regrettable it's taken this case to achieve it,"" he added. Sadiq Khan, who as mayor of London was named as an interested party in the inquest, called the result ""a landmark moment"". Mr Khan said: ""Today must be a turning point so that other families do not have to suffer the same heartbreak as Ella's family. ""Ministers and the previous mayor have acted too slowly in the past, but they must now learn the lessons from the coroner's ruling."" Ella lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road, one of the capital's busiest roads Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, called on the government to outline a public health plan to protect against ""toxic air"" immediately. She said: ""Our hearts go out to Ella's family who have fought tirelessly for today's landmark outcome. ""Today's verdict sets the precedent for a seismic shift in the pace and extent to which the government, local authorities and clinicians must now work together to tackle the country's air pollution health crisis."" Responding to the verdict, a government spokesman said: ""Our thoughts remain with Ella's family and friends. ""We are delivering a Â£3.8bn plan to clean up transport and tackle NO2 pollution and going further in protecting communities from air pollution."" The mayor of Lewisham, Damien Egan, said Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah's campaign for clean air had been ""hugely impactful"". He added: ""Our hope is that today's ruling is the evidence needed to effect lasting change, to finally secure a national commitment to tackling air pollution in a meaningful way.""

Pregnant women allowed support of partners,"Pregnant women should be allowed to have one person alongside them during scans, appointments, labour and birth, under new NHS guidance sent to trusts in England. The chosen person should be regarded as ""an integral part of both the woman and baby's care"" - not just a visitor. But midwives are concerned safety is being sacrificed in favour of popularity. They say decisions on access should be left to local maternity staff. Since the first lockdown, individual hospitals have drawn up their own rules on partners being present, meaning some women have had to give birth unaccompanied. 'Covid meant I missed my daughter's birth' Birth in a pandemic: 'You are stronger than you think' 'It's our job to keep mothers and babies safe' The new guidance,externalsays pregnant women ""value the support from a partner, relative, friend or other person through pregnancy and childbirth, as it facilitates emotional wellbeing"". Women should therefore have access to support ""at all times during their maternity journey"". All trusts should now make it easy for this to happen, while keeping the risk of coronavirus transmission within NHS maternity services as low as possible. This video can not be played How has giving birth changed during the pandemic? The guidance says pregnant women should chose their support person, who does not need to be the co-parent or baby's father. Hospital trusts are being asked to reduce the risks of virus spread by: making changes to the space used to provide maternity care, to allow social distancing using rapid tests on women and their support person before they attend appointments The guidance says support people who test negative should be treated as part of the team supporting the woman. But Royal College of Midwives chief executive Gill Walton said: ""With more areas moving into tier-three restrictions, many will question the common sense of releasing this new guidance now. ""We support and trust local maternity and midwifery leaders to make decisions in the best interest of the women in their care. ""We trust them to work with health and safety representatives and to follow NHS England's own risk assessment process, which enables maternity services to make decisions about visiting and access for partners and families that are based on current, local information."" Pregnancy and childbirth doctors said they welcomed the new guidance, recognising how difficult restrictions on birth partners had been for women during the pandemic - but they queried the use of rapid tests to assess risk. ""We hope the roll-out of rapid testing will increase the time partners who test negative can spend with women and their babies on antenatal and postnatal wards, although we have concerns about the capacity and sensitivity of lateral flow testing to enable maternity services to reopen fully,"" said Dr Edward Morris, President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Dr Morris said decisions about visiting and access for partners and families would ""need to be based on local information and testing capacity, and clearly communicated to women and their families"".

MacKenzie Scott gives away $4.2bn in four months,"Mackenzie Scott pictured with her ex-husband Jeff Bezos in 2017 MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has donated more than $4bn (Â£3bn) to food banks and emergency relief funds in four months. In a blog post, Ms Scott said she wanted to help Americans who were struggling because of the pandemic. Ms Scott is the world's 18th-richest person, having seen her wealth climb $23.6bn this year to $60.7bn. Much of her fortune comes from her divorce from Mr Bezos who is the world's richest man. ""This pandemic has been a wrecking ball in the lives of Americans already struggling,"",externalshe wrote in a blog post on Tuesday, adding that she had picked more than 380 charities to donate to having considered almost 6,500 organisations. ""Economic losses and health outcomes alike have been worse for women, for people of colour and for people living in poverty. Meanwhile, it has substantially increased the wealth of billionaires."" MacKenzie Scott donates $1.7bn since Bezos divorce Amazon spends $500m on bonuses for Christmas staff Ms Scott donated $1.7bn to 116 charities in July saying she wanted to call attention to ""organisations and leaders driving change."" This takes her total donations for the year to almost $6bn. Donations were focused on those ""operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates, and low access to philanthropic capital."" Last year she signed the Giving Pledge, promising to give away the majority of her fortune.The Giving Pledge,externalis a commitment by the world's wealthiest individuals and families to dedicate the majority of their wealth to giving back. ""I have a disproportionate amount of money to share,"" she wrote in her pledge. This video can not be played MacKenzie Scott is divorced from Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man Charity experts have applauded the amount she has given away and how she has done it. Ms Scott has worked with a team of advisers to research thousands of organisations. ""We leveraged this collective knowledge base in a collaboration that included hundreds of emails and phone interviews, and thousands of pages of data analysis on community needs, programme outcomes, and each non-profit's capacity to absorb and make effective use of funding,"" she wrote. This year Mr Bezos, who is the boss of Amazon, has also been active with philanthropy, committing $10bn to issues related to climate change. In November, he announced the first of those grants, handing out nearly $800m to 16 groups. Mr Bezos has seen his net worth increase $70bn this year to reach a fortune of $185bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. During the pandemic there has been a massive rise in online shopping benefitting online retailers such as Amazon. Swiss bank UBS said billionaires had done ""extremely well"" in the Covid crisis. This year there has been a relatively high number of mega-donations as celebrities, sports stars and business leaders respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and other causes. Among the most generous was Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey who announced in April that he was moving $1bn of his assets into a fund to support pandemic relief efforts and other causes. This represents about a quarter of his $3.9bn net worth. Bill Gates and his wife Melinda have committed $305m for vaccines, treatment and diagnostic development through their charitable foundation, while Harry Potter author JK Rowling donated Â£1m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the pandemic. On a different theme, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $300m to ""protect American elections"". The majority of the money went to the Centre for Tech and Civic Life, a non-profit organisation to recruit poll workers and supply them with personal protective equipment, and to set up drive-through voting. In June, basketball legend Michael Jordan announced he was donating $100m to Black Lives Matters and social injustice causes over the next decade.

Rail fare rise a âkick in the teethâ for passengers,"Rail fares will rise more than expected next year - although the new inflation-busting 2.6% increase is being delayed until 1 March. Regulated fares were expected to increase by 1.6% in January, as successive governments linked annual rises to July's RPI inflation rate. Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said the rise reflected ""unprecedented taxpayer support"" for rail this year. But unions said the rise was a ""kick in the teeth"" for passengers. An average increase of 2.6% across all fares will still be the lowest since 2017, and it will only last nine months, until the end of 2021. Had the rise come in in January it would have equated to a 1.95% jump across the whole year. Until 28 February season tickets holders can renew at existing prices and the cost of daily fares will stay the same. Rail travel has been badly hit during the coronavirus crisis, and Mr Heaton-Harris said delaying the price rise from January ""ensures passengers who need to travel have a better deal this year"". Regulated fares make up about half of fares and include season tickets on most commuter routes. But operators are expected to match their rises for unregulated fares. It means, for example, a Brighton-to-London annual season ticket going up by about Â£129 to Â£5,109, and a Manchester-to-Glasgow off-peak return rising by Â£2.30 to Â£90.60. Rail fares to rise despite passenger slump Government to cut Â£1bn from rail budget The rail minister said: ""By setting fares sensibly, and with the lowest actual increase for four years, we are ensuring that taxpayers are not overburdened for their unprecedented contribution, ensuring investment is focused on keeping vital services running and protecting frontline jobs."" The government took over rail franchise agreements from train operators in March, following the collapse in demand for travel caused by the virus crisis. This is expected to have cost about Â£10bn by mid-2021. The rise will help recover some of the significantly increased costs met by taxpayers to keep services running during the pandemic, Mr Heaton-Harris said. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators, acknowledged that ""passengers will be disappointed"" about the fares rise, adding that ""governments must ultimately decide the balance between how much farepayers and taxpayers pay to run the railway"". She added that industry was committed to working with the government to make the fares and ticketing system easier to use. The department has written to all operators telling them to begin immediate work on developing flexible season tickets, allowing people who travel two or three days a week to save money compared with buying daily tickets. Firms have been told these must be introduced across England by the end of next year. Anthony Smith, chief executive of consumer watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""This fare increase makes it even more important that, when travel restrictions start to be lifted, the industry is able to attract people back by offering fares that match how we know people hope to live, work and travel in future."" Union leaders condemned the rise, with Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association calling it a ""kick in the teeth for passengers"". He continued: ""Ministers are well aware that millions have suffered this year with the uncertainty of employment, a changing picture on furlough provision, pay cuts, wages freezes and lost jobs. So, to reach for a hike in fares of this size is both extortionate and plain daft."" Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said ticket prices were being ""forced up to subsidise private profit. The time is right for a publicly-owned railway system that delivers reasonable fares for our people as the public and the economy tries to recover and shake off the Covid crisis next year."" Update 8 January 2021: This story has been amended to remove an example of a season ticket price increase faced by one passenger.

"Pregnant women allowed support of partnersThey should be regarded as an ""integral part of care"" and not as visitors, trusts in England are told.Health","Pregnant women should be allowed to have one person alongside them during scans, appointments, labour and birth, under new NHS guidance sent to trusts in England. The chosen person should be regarded as ""an integral part of both the woman and baby's care"" - not just a visitor. But midwives are concerned safety is being sacrificed in favour of popularity. They say decisions on access should be left to local maternity staff. Since the first lockdown, individual hospitals have drawn up their own rules on partners being present, meaning some women have had to give birth unaccompanied. 'Covid meant I missed my daughter's birth' Birth in a pandemic: 'You are stronger than you think' 'It's our job to keep mothers and babies safe' The new guidance,externalsays pregnant women ""value the support from a partner, relative, friend or other person through pregnancy and childbirth, as it facilitates emotional wellbeing"". Women should therefore have access to support ""at all times during their maternity journey"". All trusts should now make it easy for this to happen, while keeping the risk of coronavirus transmission within NHS maternity services as low as possible. This video can not be played How has giving birth changed during the pandemic? The guidance says pregnant women should chose their support person, who does not need to be the co-parent or baby's father. Hospital trusts are being asked to reduce the risks of virus spread by: making changes to the space used to provide maternity care, to allow social distancing using rapid tests on women and their support person before they attend appointments The guidance says support people who test negative should be treated as part of the team supporting the woman. But Royal College of Midwives chief executive Gill Walton said: ""With more areas moving into tier-three restrictions, many will question the common sense of releasing this new guidance now. ""We support and trust local maternity and midwifery leaders to make decisions in the best interest of the women in their care. ""We trust them to work with health and safety representatives and to follow NHS England's own risk assessment process, which enables maternity services to make decisions about visiting and access for partners and families that are based on current, local information."" Pregnancy and childbirth doctors said they welcomed the new guidance, recognising how difficult restrictions on birth partners had been for women during the pandemic - but they queried the use of rapid tests to assess risk. ""We hope the roll-out of rapid testing will increase the time partners who test negative can spend with women and their babies on antenatal and postnatal wards, although we have concerns about the capacity and sensitivity of lateral flow testing to enable maternity services to reopen fully,"" said Dr Edward Morris, President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Dr Morris said decisions about visiting and access for partners and families would ""need to be based on local information and testing capacity, and clearly communicated to women and their families"".

House building plans revised after Tory backlashUrban developments in the Midlands and north of England will now be prioritised in government U-turn.,"Proposals for controversial planning reforms in England have been revised, after new housing targets prompted a backlash amongst many Conservative MPs. A computer-based formula used to decide where houses should be located has been ""updated"" to focus more on cities and urban areas in the North and Midlands. Ministers said cash for brownfield sites would be distributed more fairly outside London and the South East. Some MPs in southern England said their areas risked being ""concreted over"". The government wants to 300,000 new homes to be built across England each year by the mid-2020s. In August, it proposed a new formula designed to provide a rough estimate to councils on how many properties needed to be built in their communities. May attacks 'ill-conceived' planning reforms Government won't cut 300,000 homes target, says housing secretary Johnson defends 'long overdue' planning overhaul Local authorities would have been expected to come forward with potential sites - taking into account constraints, such as areas protected by the green belt. But several senior Conservative MPs expressed concerns about relying on what one of them called a ""mutant algorithm"" to decide housing needs. Has the pandemic changed the housing supply equation for England? Working from home and shopping online have hollowed out many urban centres, with offices and shops empty and unused. Could our struggling High Streets and business zones be repurposed as residential neighbourhoods? Today's planning announcement suggests just that, shifting the housebuilding emphasis to brownfield urban sites in the West Midlands and northern England, away from rural and semi-rural communities in the South East. While that may please some of the government's critics on its own backbenches, the question is whether the change makes it harder for ministers to keep their promise to build enough affordable and beautiful homes where people want to live. There is a limited supply of brownfield sites and often they are difficult and expensive to develop - odd-shaped bits of land alongside a railway line or contaminated by industry. Recent experience of turning office blocks and shops into homes has seen concerns about quality standards. The greatest demand for housing is in the South East where affordability remains the biggest issue.  Today the ONS reported that the average house price in the region rose to a new high of Â£337,400 - almost two and a half times the average in north-east England. In October, former Prime Minister Theresa May called the plans ""ill-conceived"", while ex-Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt accused the government of risking ""undermining"" local democracy by pressing ahead. The 300,000 target, a Conservative manifesto commitment at the last election, remains in place and new homes will still be built in the South, but the government will prioritise brownfield sites in England's 20 largest cities and other urban areas. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said a consultation showed people ""strongly supported"" increased homebuilding. But they ""understandably wanted more homes to be built in urban areas"", as these were the ""most environmentally sustainable"" sites, with good transport links, he added. Mr Jenrick also said: ""They wanted to use housing to push private sector investment into the cities of the North and Midlands...that's what we've done in this update to the methodology."" A taskforce has been set up to advise on inner-city regeneration and how to respond to the fall in demand for office and retail space during the pandemic. The West Midlands and Greater Manchester Mayoral Combined Authorities will receive Â£67m in new funding between them for brownfield developments. A new Â£100m fund will be launched in January, giving councils across England the chance to pitch for money to support developments on public land and regeneration of council estates. Ministers have also pledged to think again about how up to Â£7bn in future funding is allocated across England so that it is not concentrated in the most prosperous areas in London and the South East. ""This is good news,"" said Isle of Wight Conservative MP Bob Seely, one of the most stringent critics of the algorithm. ""This is an initial victory for those who care about their communities. ""I, and I am sure many others, want to work supportively with the government to make sure we build the right homes in the right places.""

Cladding inspections uncover other fire risks,"Flat owners have been organising fire safety checks Fire safety inspections have uncovered hundreds of blocks of flats in England and Wales with faulty or missing fire prevention measures, the BBC has found. Flat owners have been looking for evidence of unsafe cladding in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire that killed 72 people in 2017. But many of the inspections have revealed problems inside the buildings. The government said it was introducing the biggest improvements to building safety for 40 years. When surveyors visited Lucy Seker's flat in central Manchester earlier this year, they found the cladding was compliant with safety standards. But other fire safety issues, such as missing fire barriers in some of the cavities inside the flat, have left her and her neighbours facing repair bills of more than Â£30,000. ""At first, I thought I'm ok, there are far worse off than me. But because of the cavity issues I'm just as much at risk from fire and living in an unsafe building,"" she said. Lucy Seker says she does not feel safe in her building ""The impact has been monumental - shattering. I've worked hard all of my life and I now have a worthless property. ""Where am I going to find Â£30,000?"" The fire issues have seen her insurance costs rise by 300%, as well as a 40% increase in her service charge and residents must now also pay for a fire warden to guard the block. ""I don't feel safe in the building,"" she added. ""If fire spread through the cavities, then how far could it get before anyone stops it?"" Many owners are now finding problems with ""compartmentation"" - the way their individual flat is sealed to stop fire and smoke spreading within a building. Typically, flats should have barriers inside the spaces between any cladding and the outside walls, and fire breaks in the internal walls to ensure flats are protected for as long as possible should a fire break out. Dorian Lawrence, whose company FaÃ§ade Remedial Consultants has been inspecting the cladding on hundreds of blocks across England and Wales, said he has found defective fire safety in 90% of the 2,000 buildings he has inspected and around 60% of those are not cladding related. ""Post-Grenfell we've only really started taking cladding off buildings and taking a look behind to see what's there,"" he said. ""The issue is the building may look fantastic on the outside with the cladding correctly fitted, but once you've taken the cladding off, what we uncover is quite a mess in many instances. ""After Grenfell everyone realised perhaps their buildings were not compliant with building regulations and found a necessity to undertake the intrusive works to make sure [whether] they're compliant or not, and in the majority of cases, they are not."" While statistics showing the extent of the problem nationwide are scarce, a picture of the scale of internal wall defects is emerging in Manchester and London. London Fire Brigade shared data with 5 Live Investigates showing that of the 576 blocks which have a ""waking watch"" - considered such a fire risk they need overnight fire wardens - more than 100 had compartmentation problems. In Manchester, the problems are even more stark. The Greater Manchester High-Rise Task Force, set up to assess fire safety in all of the city's tall residential blocks, has imposed ""interim"" safety measures such as fire wardens or extra fire alarms in around 100 buildings. Of those, around 70 have other serious defects like missing or incorrectly-fitted cavity barriers and, in some cases, inadequate fire protection on the frame of the building. Nigel Glen, of the Association of Residential Managing Agents, whose members are responsible for the day-to-day running of almost 1.5 million leasehold flats, said he had been trying to draw the government's attention to the problems. ""It is quite clear these defects are not the fault of the leaseholders and so they shouldn't be expected to pay for compartmentation failures,"" he said. ""The impact on residents and flat owners can only be that of yet more stress - both financial and mental. On property managers the emotional toll is proving to be massive - leaseholders are understandably frightened and angry and property managers are, in many cases, the only people that they have to hand to take matters out on."" Richard Beresford, chief executive of the National Federation of Builders, said the challenge is what to do with building work that was at the time within the rules, but now no longer meets safety standards. ""Government and industry know what needs to be done for future buildings and building work; ensuring a value-based rather than cost-based approach to buildings, the need for hand-in-glove working all along the supply chain on matters of safety, as well as much tighter building regulations and adequately funded and resourced building control. ""But what we still need is action for those who fall between the gap of legal and safe. Here the only answer is for government to intervene to resolve the ludicrous situation whereby remediation works fall on leaseholders and run to tens of thousands of pounds or more - rendering their flats unsellable."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Building owners are responsible for ensuring their buildings are safe and residents should speak to their building owner if they are concerned. ""If a building contains a hazard or the measures in place do not sufficiently mitigate the risk to life from a fire, both Fire and Rescue Authorities and councils are responsible for enforcement and can take action.""

Germany under tougher restrictions amid Covid rise,"Non-essential businesses are closed under the new restrictions Germany has entered a hard lockdown, closing schools and non-essential businesses in an attempt to stop a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections. The measures will be in place until 10 January. Christmas will see a slight easing, with one household allowed to host up to four close family members. The country reported another 952 deaths and 27,728 cases on Wednesday. Meanwhile EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said the first Covid vaccine would be authorised for use within a week. Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - developed in Germany - would be rolled out for the bloc the same day, more than a week earlier than originally envisaged. The news came after the German government said it was pressuring the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to speed up approval of the vaccine. It has already been approved by regulators in the UK and the US. The EMA is due to discuss the rollout next Monday. Germans start holiday lockdown amid Covid surge What are the restrictions around Europe? Germany plans ventilation blow to coronavirus Other European countries have joined Germany in tightening restrictions ahead of Christmas, and France has introduced a night-time curfew. Only essential businesses such as supermarkets and banks will be allowed to remain open. Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have been shut since November and some areas of the country had imposed their own lockdowns. Hair salons are among the businesses which must close, while drinking alcohol in public places, such as popular mulled wine stalls, is forbidden. Companies are being urged to allow employees to work from home. The 952 new fatalities announced on Wednesday are a new peak for Germany's pandemic, but may cover numbers that were not included in previous days. People were still out on the streets of Munich, Bavaria, on Tuesday Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, which is overseeing the Covid-19 response, said the situation was ""more serious than it has ever been"". ""The number of cases is higher than ever and they keep rising. There is the danger that the situation will keep getting worse and it will get harder and harder to deal with the pandemic and its consequences,"" he said. Deutsche Welle reported that while cases in the younger population were falling, they were still rising among older people who were more likely to suffer more serious problems from the virus. Numbers in intensive care are said to have reached alarming levels. Announcing the new measures over the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the ""lockdown light"" begun in November had not done enough to bring the virus under control. The figures are particularly shocking, as during the early months of the pandemic Germany was more successful than many other European countries in its handling of the crisis. What's gone wrong for the country that came so successfully through the first wave of the pandemic? Some blame Germany's regional leaders who, until now, have dithered, bickered and resisted Chancellor Merkel's calls for a tougher nationwide response. And Prof Iris Pigeot, director of the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, says that ""people do not follow all the regulations that they're told. We had to reduce our contacts by about 75% but I think that didn't work"". She's concerned. ""New Year's Eve and Christmas could be a complete nightmare with increasing numbers, increasing numbers of deaths."" Read more from Jenny This video can not be played Most Christmas markets have been cancelled but one in Bavaria is offering a ""drive-thru"" experience Francehas replaced its second national lockdown with a curfew from 20:00 to 06:00. People will not be allowed out of the house without an authorisation form. Christmas Eve will be exempt, but the rule will stay in place for New Year's Eve. Bars and restaurants are to remain closed until at least 20 January. The number of people in France who have died from coronavirus infections rose by 790 on Tuesday to a total of 59,072. People in France are no longer required to print or download an official justification for leaving their homes during the day. TheNetherlandsis currently under a five-week lockdown, the strictest set of measures announced in the country since the pandemic began. Non-essential shops, cinemas, hairdressers and gyms closed on Tuesday, and schools have now followed suit. People have also been told to refrain from booking non-essential travel abroad until mid-March. But restrictions will be eased slightly for three days over Christmas, when Dutch households are allowed three guests instead of two. This video can not be played How close are we to Covid immunisation? In theUK, London entered England's highest tier of lockdown rules on Wednesday. Pubs and restaurants must close, except for takeaway and delivery, and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas must remain shut. Meanwhile,Italy'sdaily death toll is still close to 500 and the government is considering a further tightening of measures over Christmas. The exact details are unclear, but a new lockdown could come into place between Christmas night and New Year. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described the potential lockdown as a ""new squeeze"". Lithuaniahas gone into lockdown, with a ban on non-essential movement between towns. Contact between separate households is also banned. Austriais to set out its plans for Christmas, including an extension of the rules on mask-wearing indoors and limits on meetings between households. AndDenmarkis extending its ""partial lockdown"" across the whole country. From Wednesday venues including restaurants and sports centres will be closed in areas until now unaffected by the restrictions. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Half of Singapore's migrant workers were Covid-positive,"While most Singaporeans were safe, half of the migrant workers were infected A rights group has said it is ""unsurprised"" after it was revealed almost half of Singapore's migrant workers have been infected with Covid-19 in the past nine months. New data shows that152,000 foreign workers - 47% - have been infected.,external In comparison, it is estimated less than 11% of London's population have been infected since the pandemic began. Without counting the migrant workers, fewer than 4,000 people have tested positive in Singapore. The men, the majority of whom live in large dormitories where several men share a room amid cramped facilities, have essentially been quarantined from the rest of the population since cases exploded in April. Over the past months, infections in both the general population and the migrant dormitories have dropped to almost zero and authorities have just announced a further easing of restrictions for the general population. But Singapore's foreign workers - typically low-wage migrant labourers from South Asia who largely work in the construction and manufacturing sectors - still face restrictions on their freedom of movement which will only be gradually lifted next year. ""There is no justification for Singapore to treat migrant workers like prisoners,"" Alex Au of the charity Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) told the BBC. ""Many have been locked in for eight months."" The new figure is a combination of the normal PCR coronavirus tests - which check whether a person currently has the virus - and a separate drive of serology tests which trace whether a person has had it in the past. Around 54,500 workers have tested positive in the PCR test while another 98,000 were found via the serology test. The previous number had been public before, while the latter was released only on Monday. How a pandemic exposed Singapore's inequalities Helping the migrant workers who pay to get jobs Singapore's Health Ministry said that by August, the entire worker population had been tested at least once, with either of the two types of tests. The ministry said anyone who tested positive was isolated including those that were found to only have carried the virus in the past. Authorities also said they provided the workers with medical care and assistance. The combined 152,000 cases among the foreign workers make up almost half of the 323,000 workers living in dormitories across the island state. But with some 65,000 workers' serology tests still pending, the percentage might still go up. ""These new figures don't surprise us,"" Mr Au said. ""During the middle of the year, workers who tested positive were telling us that they were told to stay in their rooms and not taken into isolation. They remained in contact with their room-mates."" Social distancing is almost impossible in the dorms ""But this is history,"" Mr Au said. ""We're more concerned that Singapore continues to treat the workers as prisoners even though the same statement by the ministry says that 'since October, no new cases were detected in the dormitories on many days'."" He argues that since the active infection rate is virtually zero and workers are tested regularly every two weeks, there is no reason to place such hard restrictions on them. The country's first coronavirus cases were were registered in January but a meticulous contact tracing programme managed to keep the infections in check initially. But when the virus began spreading among migrant workers, authorities struggled to trace and isolate all of the infected andnumbers began to skyrocket in that community. Out of Singapore's 58,341 total positive PCR tests to date, 93% have been among that migrant worker community. In response to the high infection rate, many of the dorms - often holding thousands of workers - were placed under quarantine in April, essentially locking the workers inside. This video can not be played Migrant workers said they were afraid for the future So far, even healthy workers are only allowed out to be taken to their work sites and occasionally to shop in designated shops near their dorms, Mr Au said. ""Workers are still interned and treated like prisoners, used for their labour with no freedom of movement."" On Monday, Singapore authorities said that given ""the outbreak in the dormitories is under control"", restrictions on migrant workers would be progressively eased. In the first quarter of the 2021, some workers will be allowed access to the general community once a month, wearing contract-tracing devices and adhering to the safety measures.

Lost Egyptian artefact found in cigar box,"This video can not be played Great Pyramid artefact found in Aberdeen cigar box A long-lost Egyptian artefact has been found in a cigar box in Aberdeen - and it is hoped it could shed new light on the Great Pyramid. The chance discovery was made by a member of staff at the University of Aberdeen during a collection review. The small fragment of 5,000-year-old wood - which is now in several pieces - is said to be ""hugely significant"". The engineer Waynman Dixon originally discovered it among items inside the pyramid's Queens Chamber in 1872. The piece of cedar - which it is believed may have been used during the pyramid's construction - was donated to the university in 1946 but then could not be located. Curatorial assistant Abeer Eladany found it while conducting a review of items housed in the university's Asia collection. Abeer Eladany made the find Abeer, who is originally from Egypt and spent 10 years working in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, cross-referenced it with other records. ""Once I looked into the numbers in our Egypt records I instantly knew what it was, and that it had effectively been hidden in plain sight in the wrong collection,"" she said. ""I'm an archaeologist and have worked on digs in Egypt but I never imagined it would be here in north-east Scotland that I'd find something so important to the heritage of my own country. ""It may be just a small fragment of wood, which is now in several pieces, but it is hugely significant given that it is one of only three items ever to be recovered from inside the Great Pyramid."" The wood was originally found in 1872 Museum in row over Great Pyramid stone Two other items found by Waynman Dixon - a ball and hook - are now housed in the British Museum, but the wood was missing. ""The university's collections are vast - running to hundreds of thousands of items - so looking for it has been like finding a needle in a haystack,"" Abeer added. ""I couldn't believe it when I realised what was inside this innocuous-looking cigar tin."" An illustration by Charles Piazzi Smyth of pyramid work Covid restrictions delayed the dating of the rediscovered cedar fragment. Results have recently been returned and show that the wood can be dated to somewhere in the period 3341-3094 BC. This is said to support the theory that, whatever their use, the so-called Dixon Relics were original to the construction of the Great Pyramid and not later artefacts left behind by those exploring the chambers. But the dating is also surprising as historical records have dated the pyramid itself to a period about 500 years later. Neil Curtis, head of museums and special collections at the University of Aberdeen, said: ""Finding the missing Dixon Relic was a surprise but the carbon dating has also been quite a revelation. It is even older than we had imagined. ""This may be because the date relates to the age of the wood, maybe from the centre of a long-lived tree. Alternatively, it could be because of the rarity of trees in ancient Egypt, which meant that wood was scarce, treasured and recycled or cared for over many years."" He added: ""It will now be for scholars to debate its use and whether it was deliberately deposited, as happened later during the New Kingdom, when pharaohs tried to emphasise continuity with the past by having antiquities buried with them. ""This discovery will certainly reignite interest in the Dixon Relics and how they can shed light on the Great Pyramid.""

Rail fares to rise more than expected next year,"Rail fares will rise more than expected next year - although the new inflation-busting 2.6% increase is being delayed until 1 March. Regulated fares were expected to increase by 1.6% in January, as successive governments linked annual rises to July's RPI inflation rate. Rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said the rise reflected ""unprecedented taxpayer support"" for rail this year. But unions said the rise was a ""kick in the teeth"" for passengers. An average increase of 2.6% across all fares will still be the lowest since 2017, and it will only last nine months, until the end of 2021. Had the rise come in in January it would have equated to a 1.95% jump across the whole year. Until 28 February season tickets holders can renew at existing prices and the cost of daily fares will stay the same. Rail travel has been badly hit during the coronavirus crisis, and Mr Heaton-Harris said delaying the price rise from January ""ensures passengers who need to travel have a better deal this year"". Regulated fares make up about half of fares and include season tickets on most commuter routes. But operators are expected to match their rises for unregulated fares. It means, for example, a Brighton-to-London annual season ticket going up by about Â£129 to Â£5,109, and a Manchester-to-Glasgow off-peak return rising by Â£2.30 to Â£90.60. Rail fares to rise despite passenger slump Government to cut Â£1bn from rail budget The rail minister said: ""By setting fares sensibly, and with the lowest actual increase for four years, we are ensuring that taxpayers are not overburdened for their unprecedented contribution, ensuring investment is focused on keeping vital services running and protecting frontline jobs."" The government took over rail franchise agreements from train operators in March, following the collapse in demand for travel caused by the virus crisis. This is expected to have cost about Â£10bn by mid-2021. The rise will help recover some of the significantly increased costs met by taxpayers to keep services running during the pandemic, Mr Heaton-Harris said. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators, acknowledged that ""passengers will be disappointed"" about the fares rise, adding that ""governments must ultimately decide the balance between how much farepayers and taxpayers pay to run the railway"". She added that industry was committed to working with the government to make the fares and ticketing system easier to use. The department has written to all operators telling them to begin immediate work on developing flexible season tickets, allowing people who travel two or three days a week to save money compared with buying daily tickets. Firms have been told these must be introduced across England by the end of next year. Anthony Smith, chief executive of consumer watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""This fare increase makes it even more important that, when travel restrictions start to be lifted, the industry is able to attract people back by offering fares that match how we know people hope to live, work and travel in future."" Union leaders condemned the rise, with Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association calling it a ""kick in the teeth for passengers"". He continued: ""Ministers are well aware that millions have suffered this year with the uncertainty of employment, a changing picture on furlough provision, pay cuts, wages freezes and lost jobs. So, to reach for a hike in fares of this size is both extortionate and plain daft."" Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said ticket prices were being ""forced up to subsidise private profit. The time is right for a publicly-owned railway system that delivers reasonable fares for our people as the public and the economy tries to recover and shake off the Covid crisis next year."" Update 8 January 2021: This story has been amended to remove an example of a season ticket price increase faced by one passenger. The example of a first class ticket was considered to be unrepresentative of the situation faced by the average commuter.

Patients face 12-hour wait as hospital struggles,"There were queues of ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital on Tuesday night Hospitals in Northern Ireland are continuing to face severe pressures after a night which saw queuing ambulances outside hospitals across NI. On Wednesday morning there were 48 people in the emergency department at Antrim Area hospital. On Tuesday night,doctors treated patients in ambulances with 17 vehicles outside the hospital at one point. An emergency department consultant from the Ulster Hospital said one patient there had waited 28 hours for a bed. Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra, Sean McGovern, said: ""That patient is still waiting, they're waiting within the emergency department. ""People are maybe waiting on a bed in a designated area within the emergency department, or waiting on a trolley."" At 11:25 GMT, there were 34 people waiting to be admitted to the Ulster Hospital, with 30 waiting more than 12 hours, according to a spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust. The spokesperson said there were 59 patients at the hospital's emergency department, with one waiting outside in an ambulance. Five of the patients had been in the department for between four and 12 hours. There have also been long waits at Antrim Hospital on Wednesday, with 48 people in the emergency department at 07:00 GMT. Of these, 43 were waiting to be admitted, with 29 of those people who have been waiting for more than 12 hours. Hundreds of hospital staff from across NI are also isolating for Covid-related reasons In a statement, the trust said it was ""not a situation that anyone wants to see"", adding that the hospital remained under ""severe pressure"". ""We sincerely apologise to the patients affected and their families. Staff are working very hard to try to manage the situation and maintain flow,"" the trust said. At hospitals in Belfast, 39 were awaiting admission - 29 more than 12 hours. In the Western Trust, 34 were awaiting admission - all 34 waiting more than 12 hours. In the Southern Trust hospitals, 60 were waiting admission but no figure for length of wait is known. The British Medical Association in Northern Ireland said the pressures on hospitals were ""extremely concerning"". A spokesperson said: ""I have spoken to many secondary care colleagues over the past few days who are very worried as to how hospitals are going to cope over the next few days and weeks, and the decisions they may have to take over how people are cared for."" Medical Director with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service Dr Nigel Ruddell said there had been 30 to 35 ambulances outside Emergency Departments across Northern Ireland on Tuesday night. He said they were ""the most significant queues"" he had seen in the 12 years he had worked for the ambulance service. ""What we are seeing reflects the pressure of the normal increase in illness, particularly among the elderly and, of course, the pressures of Covid,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Dr Ruddell thanked the hospital and ambulance staff, and said it had taken a ""massive effort overnight"" to clear queues outside hospitals. Speaking to RTÃ's Morning Ireland programme on Wednesday, Wendy Magowan, the Northern Health Trust operations director, said ""whilst it has improved dramatically overnight we are still starting out this morning with a very low base rate"". There are also hundreds of staff isolating for Covid-related reasons. So far, 366 staff from the Southern Trust are isolating as are 681 from Belfast Trust, 324 from the Western Trust, 307 from the South Eastern Trust and 289 from the Northern Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann is to bring new proposals about Covid restrictions to Thursday's executive meeting. The meeting will see ministers look at options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. There were 17 ambulances queued at Antrim Hospital at 17:00 GMT on Tuesday Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Sinn FÃ©in ""will support any proposals brought forward by the health minister to tackle the current situation."" Stronger guidance has been issued by London and the devolved governments about how people should celebrate Christmas this year. Relaxed rules between 23 December and 27 December are to stay in place. Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill spoke to leaders from the other governments earlier and more guidance from the executive is expected later in the week. The big issue is not so much what they agree when it comes to restrictions, but the fact that compliance is not where it should be. The health service has stepped forward and they're hoping that they're going to listen to the voices that we heard last night with ambulances queued outside the hospitals. Health Minister Robin Swann is going to be bringing recommendations to the executive on Thursday for a decision around restrictions and the likelihood is that we will see, perhaps, an partial lockdown started after Christmas. We could be looking at, maybe, 28 December. The key concern is that we may be heading for a third wave at a point when our hospitals are saturated.

"Ban gay conversion therapy, religious leaders say","Long-standing LGBT advocates such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu are among the signatories More than 370 religious leaders from around the world are calling for a ban on conversion therapy - the attempt to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The signatories to the declaration represent all the world's major faiths and many are known LGBT advocates. They include South African cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former Chief Rabbi of Ireland David Rosen. Other religious figures said a ban could risk criminalising pastors. A declaration calling for a ban will be launched at a conference sponsored by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) on Wednesday. The Anglican Bishop of Liverpool, Paul Bayes, and Mary McAleese, the former president of Ireland, are also among those who have signed the declaration. 'Gay cure' shock treatment man demands apology PM pledges ban on 'gay conversion therapy' The day I met a âgay conversion therapistâ Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeated a promise to ban conversion therapy, saying in July that the practice was ""absolutely abhorrent"" and ""has no place in this country"". The government has yet to publish details of the ban but said it had commissioned research and would outline its plans ""in due course"". The term ""conversion therapy"" refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or to suppress a person's gender identity. It can range from electric shock treatment to religious teachings or talking therapies designed to change someone's sexuality. The practice is already outlawed in Switzerland and areas of Australia, Canada and the US. Since 2018, two UK prime ministers have promised to ban ""conversion therapy"" but campaigners are still waiting for action. One of the potential hold ups concerns the definition of the term ""conversion therapy"" and how it relates to all LGBT people. Whilegovernment figures,externalhave shown that trans people undergo conversion therapy at the highest rate of any LGBT group, some campaigners fear that any government changes could exclude conversion therapy based on gender identity and only focus on sexuality. Others fear the changes will go too far. One therapist, who helps people to come to terms with their transgender identity, told me they are ""scared"" about what the government could ban. The therapist, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of ""losing"" their career, said their work helping trans young people come to terms with their acquired gender is legal. However, after advising young people to begin hormone treatments, the therapist has been accused of ""performing conversion therapy"" by some unsupportive parents. They added: ""If the government do finally ban conversion therapy, they need to be clear on what it means, because it could do more harm than good. Especially for trans healthcare."" A2018 survey,externalof 108,000 members of the LGBT community in the UK suggested 2% have undergone the practice, with another 5% having been offered it. Many global faiths, including Christianity, Islam and Judaism have traditionally taught that any sex outside of heterosexual marriage is wrong. Joe Hyman, 28, grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family in north London. He says he was a teenager when he was offered conversion therapies online. ""I wanted them to fix me,"" he told the BBC. ""I couldn't imagine a world where I was gay and I was Jewish. I didn't think my family would accept me. I was terrified."" He says he experienced talking therapies both online and in person designed to change his sexual desires. ""It left me feeling really empty, desexualised, constantly anxious and worried I wasn't doing the right thing,"" he says. Joe Hyman, who experienced conversion therapy, said it causes clear psychological and physical damage The declaration calls for ""all attempts to change, suppress or erase a person's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression - commonly known as 'conversion therapy' - to end, and for these harmful practices to be banned."" However, many conservative religious groups across different faiths say that a ban could infringe on religious freedom. They are concerned that a ban would mean the government legislating what faith leaders can and cannot teach. Peter Lynas, UK Director of the Evangelical Alliance which represents 3,000 churches in the UK, says he supports an ""end [to] extreme and coercive behaviour without banning change or conversion, which are central to Christianity"". He told the BBC a ban could risk ""criminalising counsellors, pastors and even those asked to pray with people."" Sheikh Ramzy, an Islamic scholar and founder of the Oxford Islamic Information Centre, said it was important imams were allowed to offer ""help"" if gay Muslims wanted to change their sexual orientation. ""We want to help them and not to damage them,"" he told the BBC. But for Joe, an immediate ban is necessary. ""I think that when religious institutions are causing clear psychological and physical damage to people that is when legislation needs to step in,"" he told the BBC. ""This is a really dangerous practice. There are countless testimonies from survivors, but sadly not as many as there might be - because people have died of suicide. ""That, for me, means it is no longer a matter of religious freedom or not.""

Facebook to move all UK users onto US agreements,"Facebook will shift its UK users onto agreements with the companyâs corporate headquarters in California. The move could put UK users out of reach of Europe's privacy laws. But Facebook said there will be no change to the privacy controls or the services it offers UK customers. Currently, UK users are governed by agreements with Facebookâs Irish headquarters, but this legal relationship will change following the UK's exit from the European Union (EU). âFacebook has had to make changes to respond to Brexit and will be transferring legal responsibilities and obligations for UK users from Facebook Ireland to Facebook Inc,"" the social media giant told Reuters, which first reported the story.

Privacy advocates have expressed concern that the UK might be tempted to water down its protections in the pursuit of free trade deals as it leaves the EU. In particular, they are worried about a possible deal with the US, which has weaker privacy laws. Already, the Cloud Act - a US law passed in 2018 - has made it easier for US and UK authorities to access data stored by digital service providers stored in each otherâs territory. However, Facebook has been under increasing pressure in the US. In a landmark lawsuit, US regulators have accused Facebook of buying up rivals in order to stifle competition.

Ambulance queues 'at all NI emergency departments'There were long queues at Antrim Hospital but the situation has now improved.Northern IrelandComments,"Some patients were being treated in ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital Ambulances queued outside all NI hospital emergency departments on Tuesday as they struggled with covid pressures, the ambulance service said. Doctors treated patients in ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital due to the hospital operating beyond capacity. At 17:00 GMT on Tuesday, 17 ambulances were queued outside, although this had dropped to four by 20:45. By 22:30 the ambulance service said it was not experiencing any major problems. Amid the pressure, politicians were urged to urgently rethink loosening covid rules over Christmas. Northern Health Trust operations director Wendy Magowan said it was the first time she had witnessed such a situation at Antrim Hospital. Speaking on Tuesday evening, Dr Nigel Ruddle, medical director of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, said: ""All of the emergency departments in Northern Ireland are seeing ambulances queued outside to various degrees. ""We are seeing the pressures right across Northern Ireland."" Health minister Robin Swann confirmed he would bring new proposals about restrictions to Thursday's executive meeting. The meeting will see ministers look at options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. Afurther six Covid-19 related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland by the Department of Health,external, taking its total to 1,135. There have been 59,121 positive tests after another 486 were recorded. There are 87 outbreaks of the virus in NI care homes, while hospital occupancy levels are at 104%. The reproduction rate of the virus in Northern Ireland remains at or slightly above 1, according to health chiefs. Northern Trust executive Ms Magowan said: ""This has never happened in Antrim hospital before in my memory, never. ""We got to a situation last night that we had so many people waiting in ED to get into beds that we simply had no room left. ""We haven't got out of the second surge, in fact, our numbers are rising. We have the highest number of inpatients today that we've ever had with Covid. ""If this doubles, I don't know how we're going to make it through."" There were 17 ambulances queued at Antrim Hospital at 17:00 GMT on Tuesday Pat Cullen from the Royal College of Nursing told the BBC's Evening Extra programme that nurses were exhausted from working ""excessive hours"". She said hospital nurses were treating patients in the back of ambulances and along corridors as well as on the wards and in the emergency departments, while the district nurses were trying to cope with ""60% vacancies"" in their workforce. She said: ""Speaking to many of our nurses today, there's no doubt that this is the closest I've ever seen nurses to being totally burnt out. ""Exhausted isn't even a word to describe how the nurses feel. ""At this moment in time, a 12-hour shift almost seems a luxury to them - they're working well beyond that."" Pat Cullen said nurses were facing burnuot At a briefing on Tuesday, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young told journalists that numbers were not where they would like them to be. They also gave a stark warning that any third wave would come on top of already ""stubbornly high"" hospital in-patient numbers. Prof Young said: ""The position is very different to what it was first wave and second wave of this virus. ""At the beginning of the first wave we had no hospital in patients with Covid. ""At the beginning of the second wave the numbers about 20. ""If we see an increase in numbers again as a consequence of the current position, then it will be an increase of numbers on top of a baseline of 300-400 people in hospital. And the numbers will only rise from there."" I was at Antrim Area Hospital this morning until about midday and what I witnessed was a system that is clearly just hanging together. I saw staff clearly exhausted and anxious and they were the staff who were outside in the ambulance bay. The problem is that the ambulances had nowhere to go, they couldn't unload their patients inside, so I also watched as doctors stepped inside ambulances, wearing their PPE, triaging those patients inside the ambulances, making decisions about who should be taken in first. The picture was a really sorry one, a stark one and this is really at the start of what could become an incredibly busy period. Prof Young urged people to stick with the guidelines over the festive period and said anyone who was forming a Christmas bubble should not see anyone else for the next 10 days. Dr McBride revealed he would not be hosting family or friends this Christmas - having discussed the issue with elderly parents and children. He said now was the ""best time for the virus"" but worst time for the health service. Dr McBride said he will not be hosting family this Christmas Health minister Robin Swann told the assembly the two-week limited lockdown which ended on 10 December had seen a ""stabilisation"" of the virus but the figures were still too high. He said he would not pre-empt Thursday's executive meeting and provide details of suggestions he would put forward. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Sinn FÃ©in ""will support any proposals brought forward by the health minister to tackle the current situation."" She added: ""It is clear we are facing a very dangerous situation with the spread of Covid-19, the rise in hospitalisations and, sadly, people losing their lives."" Allow Twitter content?

London to enter tier 3,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock confirms that Greater London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire are being moved into Tier 3 restrictions. London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire will move into Englandâs highest tier of Covid restrictions, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The areas join tier three at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday, meaning some 34 million people will face the toughest rules. Anew variant of coronavirushas been identified that ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in southern England, Mr Hancock added. Pubs and restaurants in tier three must close except for takeaway and delivery. Also under the rules, sports fans cannot attend events in stadiums, and indoor entertainment venues - such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas - must remain shut. London theatres 'devastated' to close again Capital could become 'ghost town' under tier 3 What are the rules if my area moves to tier three? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live The health secretary told a Downing Street briefing that action had to be taken immediately - before the next scheduled review of England's three-tier system on Wednesday - to slow ""sharp, exponential rises"" in infection, adding that in some areas the virus was doubling around every seven days. Speaking alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, Mr Hancock warned that hospitals across the capital and in Essex and Kent were already ""under pressure"". He described the rise in transmission and the new variant as ""a salutary warning for the whole country"". ""This isn't over yet,"" he said. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains what you can do under tier 3 restrictions in England With Kent, Medway and Slough already under tier three rules, it means large parts of south-east England will soon join much of the Midlands, north-west England and north-east England under the strictest curbs on social contacts. More than 34 million people in England will be in tier three when the changes come into effect: 21.5 million in tier two; and about 700,000 in tier one. The latest tier three areas include: Greater London The south and west of Essex (Basildon, Brentwood, Harlow, Epping Forest, Castle Point, Rochford, Maldon, Braintree and Chelmsford, along with Thurrock and Southend-On-Sea borough councils) The south of Hertfordshire (Broxbourne, Hertsmere, Watford and the Three Rivers local authority) The move comes as another 20,263 cases have been recorded and a further 232 people have died in the UK, the government said on Monday. You cannot mix indoors, in private gardens or in most outdoor venues, except with your household or bubble You can meet in a group of up to six in other outdoor spaces, such as parks, beaches or countryside Shops, gyms and personal care services (such as hairdressing) can stay open Bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway Sports fans cannot attend events in stadiums Indoor entertainment venues - such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas - must stay closed People are advised not to travel to and from tier three areas Read more about the tier three rules Scientists are keeping a close watch on this variant as there are mutations to the ""spike protein"". This is the crucial part of the coronavirus that acts like the key to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. One mutation is on the crucial part of the spike that makes first contact with the outside of our cells. Another looks the same as one that emerged separately in mink, but seemed to make it harder for antibodies from Covid survivors to attack the virus. The three leading vaccines train the body to attack the spike, which is why people are asking if the variant will make the vaccines less effective. But vaccines teach the immune system to attack many parts of the spike so the view from health officials is these mutations are unlikely to affect the vaccine's effectiveness. And my golden rule for judging all ""new variant"" or ""new strain"" stories remains: Has the virus' behaviour actually changed? Viruses mutate all the time and they can become more common by just being in the right place at the right time. We still have no evidence the virus spreads more easily, is more dangerous or would affect the vaccine. Prof Whitty warned cases in some areas could rise ""very rapidly"" by Christmas - without action to combat the current doubling rate. But he stressed it was ""possible to turn this around with the tools we have"", highlighting how areas such as Liverpool have successfully brought infection rates down. Prof Fenton said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for London and parts of south-east England, which was why the government had had to take ""quick and decisive action"". Asked whether the government should rethink plans to ease some restrictions for Christmas, Mr Hancock said it was important ""everyone is cautious"" ahead of the festive period, especially when meeting vulnerable people. ""But we do understand why people do want to get together with their families,"" he said. At Christmas, people will be allowed to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends, butother tier rules will still apply. This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty: ""No evidence"" the new variant is ""more dangerous"" Earlier, Mr Hancock told MPs there was currently nothing to suggest that the new virus variant was more likely to cause serious disease. His advice was that it was ""highly unlikely"" the mutation would fail to respond to a vaccine. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warned the country was ""heading into the Christmas easing with diminishing headroom"". And while London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the announcement as ""incredibly disappointing"" for businesses, he said it was clear the virus was accelerating ""in the wrong direction"" and urged all Londoners to follow the new rules. Essex County Council leader David Finch said local leaders would lobby the government for support ""during this very challenging time"", and Hertfordshire County Council's leader, David Williams, called for residents to ""stay disciplined and stick to the guidance"". Where are schools closing early for Christmas? How close is light at end of Covid tunnel? There was anger from London's hospitality and entertainment sectors, who will be hit hard by the fresh restrictions. Andy Jones, who owns Jones & Sons restaurant in Dalston, east London, said it was ""unacceptable to give the hospitality industry 24 hours' notice"". ""This week we had about Â£42,000 worth of bookings in the system already,"" he said, adding that the restaurant would be closed for business - apart from delivering takeaway meals on Sundays. ""My biggest gripe is that busy restaurants plan a week ahead. We've got a week's worth of food pretty much, either prepped ready to go, bought in already, which you can't send back, or on order."" Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh - currently putting on the Les MisÃ©rables musical in the West End - described the rules as ""devastating"". He said it made theatres' efforts to ensure safe performances  ""seem worthless"". Kate Nicholls, of trade body UKHospitality, said the move placed an ""unfair, illogical and disproportionate burden on hospitality businesses without effectively tackling Covid"". And Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said the move into tier three was ""another nail in the coffin for London's pubs, as well as those affected in parts of Hertfordshire and Essex. There was also disappointment thatsporting events in Londonwould no longer be able to welcome fans from Wednesday. Despite coronavirus cases continuing to rise, No 10 said the government ""has no plans to review the Christmas guidelines"" which effectively suspend the tier system of restrictions and allow more households to mix. In Scotland, people have been toldto ""cut down"" the number of contacts in the week before Christmasif they plan to meet up with relatives. In Wales, a second health boardhas suspended non-urgent care amid a continued rise in cases. And a leading doctor in Northern Irelandsaid its health service is facing a ""nightmare"" scenarioin January.

Glastonbury 2021: 'We're doing everything we can',"Michael and Emily Eavis say that Glastonbury ""lost millions"" after cancelling in 2020 Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis says she hopes the festival can go ahead in 2021, despite the ""huge uncertainty"" surrounding live music in the pandemic. ""We're doing everything we can on our end to plan and prepare,"" she told the BBC, ""but I think we're still quite a long way from being able to say we're confident 2021 will go ahead."" Eavis said Glastonbury lost ""millions"" in 2020. Her father, Michael, has previously warned the festival ""would seriously go bankrupt,external"" if they had to cancel again next year. But that scenario is unlikely ""as long as we can make a firm call either way in advance"", Eavis clarified to the BBC. The live music industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid-19, with more than 90% of the gigs planned for 2020 cancelled. Despite the arrival of a vaccine and rapid-turnaround tests, there are still uncertainties about when concerts can resume. Organisers are also facing difficulties in obtaining cancellation insurance, putting huge sums of money at stake if an event is called off. Eavis and other festival organisers are calling on MPs to create a fund that would cover the cost of events cancelled due to Covid-19 next year, following the example of the German government. In an exclusive BBC interview, Eavis added that some sets could be live-streamed from Worthy Farm ""if we can't run the full show next year""; and that this year's headliners - Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar - would all be welcomed back in the future. You can read the full interview below. The festival normally welcomes 200,000 people to Worthy Farm in Somerset every year 2020 was due to be Glastonbury's 50th birthday party. How hard was the decision to cancel? Oh, it was really hard. We obviously had so many plans for the 50th birthday, and it was set to be a full blown celebration. To be honest, we stayed optimistic about being able to run right until the 11th hour. I remember we had a meeting in February where we talked about there being a 10% chance of us being forced to cancel because of Covid. But that chance kept creeping up day by day, and by the middle of March, it had become clear there was simply no way we could plan, build and run the show. So we had to pull it. And within a week of us cancelling, the Covid crisis had moved up several levels and the whole summer's events had basically shut down. Thousands of fans really want to be back at Worthy Farm next June. At this point, what would you say the odds are? I can't tell you how much we'd love to welcome everyone back to the farm! It's been way too quiet here this year and we want to get people back here as soon as we possibly can. Obviously the vaccine news in recent weeks has increased our chances, but I think we're still quite a long way from being able to say we're confident 2021 will go ahead. We're doing everything we can on our end to plan and prepare, but there are still just so many unknowns and factors which are completely out of our control. What we definitely can't afford to risk is getting too far into the process of next year, only for it to be snatched away from us again. We lost millions this year, and we can't risk that happening again. Glastonbury festival axed due to virus concerns Glastonbury Festival: 50 years of memories Glastonbury 2021 will be 'a double celebration' What changes would have to be made to ensure the festival can go ahead? That's sort of the issue, really: It's just too early to say. We're talking about a situation where the goalposts move weekly and sometimes daily. Clearly the vaccine is being rolled out, and that's great news, but there isn't yet any kind of clarity or consensus on what things will look like in May - when we'd usually have thousands of staff on site - or June, when we'd obviously have the festival. We're doing everything we can to plan for next year. The hard part is understanding exactly what we'll be planning for, and what impact that will have on what we're able to do. But, right now, I'm not sure there's anything we could do that would completely ensure we can welcome 200,000 people to spend six days in some fields in June 2021. This year's Pyramid stage headliners were due to be Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and Paul McCartney Your dad said Glastonbury would go bankrupt if you had to cancel again in 2021. Is that still the case? Well, it certainly wouldn't be good news if we got to the week of the Festival - having obviously spent a huge amount of time and money building the event - and then heard a few days before gates opening that we weren't allowed to go ahead. But, as long as we can make a firm call either way well in advance, then we'll be OK. The next few weeks are going to be crucial, really. They'll hopefully give us a much better idea of what is and isn't going to be possible. The House of Commons culture select committee haslaunched an inquiry,externalinto the future of the festival industry. What support would you like to see being offered? I think everyone - including government - wants there to be festivals next summer. But because of the huge uncertainty I just spoke about, and the fact that events take months to plan, there's a huge risk for organisers that they'll spend an awful lot of money and then see their events being cancelled for reasons completely outside of their control. And when those events go down, a huge number of jobs and livelihoods will disappear again too. So, for that reason, I would certainly love for the UK government to offer some kind of support for events in the case that they are forced to cancel. Germany announced aâ¬2.5bn (Â£2.3bn) event cancellation fund,externallast week, and the whole UK festival industry would certainly welcome something similar from our government. This summer, we should have seen Kendrick Lamar, Paul McCartney and Taylor Swift headlining the Pyramid Stage - what are the chances that they'll come back for 2021? Well, I certainly hope they'll be coming at some point! Again, it's much too soon for us to be able to confirm line-up for 2021, but we were so pleased with our line-up for 2020 and I really hope all three of those headliners will be here at the farm before too long. Now that Taylor has started recording indie albums in a woodland cabin, will she have to be re-booked for the acoustic stage? Good question! She'd be great there, wouldn't she? Her album has been a soundtrack to us on Worthy Farm this year, and rather than imagining what could have been, I've definitely been listening to it imagining what eventually will be! That moment is definitely coming. And when she does finally come and deliver a Pyramid headline set, she's welcome to play as many sets in other venues as she fancies! I certainly get the impression she'll be staying for the whole weekend and getting stuck in. Dua Lipa was due to headline Glastonbury's Other Stage, having previously played the John Peel tent in 2017 and 2018 What was the music that got you through the lockdown? Oh, so many things. It feels like we've had music on constantly. Taylor, Laura Marling, Nick Cave, Phoebe Bridgers, Michael Kiwanuka, Dua Lipa, Sault and Bob Dylan have all been on heavy rotation. Livestreams and virtual gigs really took off this year. Did you tune in? And were there any that particularly impressed you? They've been great, haven't they? We've watched quite a few. I absolutely loved Dua Lipa's one. It was designed by the team behind Block9, one of our late-night areas, and it really captured that proper club feel. It had us dancing around in the living room, by the fire. It really set the bar for live streams, I think, and I heard 5 million people tuned in, which is huge. There's a unique feeling that comes with sharing a music event online with millions of others, knowing everyone else is stuck at home too. It's a new sensation, the 2020 version of gigs, and I think we've needed those connections. We're actually looking into the possibility of streaming some things from here if we can't run the full show next year. We really want to get busy with planning some gigs - even if they're to be streamed! Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The BBC showed highlights from its Glastonbury archive over the summerâ¦ Did you wallow in the nostalgia like the rest of us? Absolutely! It was certainly a bittersweet weekend for us, but the BBC created what I was just talking about, a shared weekend of musical reflection and connection. And I don't normally get to watch Glastonbury on the telly! It was really lovely. And there's no doubt that watching crowds of people experiencing something together has a new level of emotion attached to it now. That's why I think live music is going to return bigger and brighter - and also more moving and joyous - than ever. I can't wait for the next time I'm at a big show. Outside of music, what's the main thing that's helped you survive 2020? I was thinking the other day, actually, it almost feels like we've been as busy this year as any year, trying to plan and manage the difficult situations we've found ourselves in. But at the same time, I am hugely aware that I'm really lucky to have experienced these crazy times in good health and with my family, surrounded by Somerset countryside. Those are things which have definitely made this whole thing much easier to survive than the experiences of so many other people. I really can't complain at all.

Christmas safety advice 'set to be strengthened',"Advice around celebrating Christmas safely across the UK is expected to be significantly strengthened in the coming days, the BBC has been told. People are likely to be urged to think carefully about travelling and to stay local where possible. However, it is unlikely the agreed rules - allowing up to three households to mix for five days - will change. Officials from all four nations held talks on Tuesday - and more are scheduled to take place on Wednesday. It comes amid concern that relaxing the restrictions will fuel a further surge in Covid-19 case numbers. Two leading medical journalsdescribed the current rules as ""rash"". A source said no final decisions had been taken but people are likely to be told that the relaxations are limits not targets and that they should be cautious when forming household bubbles. It is still hoped a common approach can be agreed across the four nations. Under the agreed Christmas rules, travel restrictions will be eased from 23 to 27 December to allow up to three households to form a bubble and stay overnight at each other's homes. How many people can get together at Christmas? New Covid strain: How worried should we be? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live A spokeswoman for Northern Ireland's government said scientific advisers would be consulted ahead of any decision, while a Welsh government spokesman said talks on Wednesday would ""confirm the position"". Ahead of the talks, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon argued there was a ""case"" for tightening the planned freedoms to combat a rise in infections and indicated she could break with the four-nations approach. Meanwhile, another 18,450 cases and 506 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Tuesday,government figures,externalshowed. The four nations have been taking very different approaches to restrictions in the last few months, so agreeing a common approach to Christmas was no small ask. But there are big questions now about what changes should be made given the rising number of Covid cases in many areas. I understand there are no plans to make changes to the restrictions in England; meaning it's unlikely the legal rules will change. However, we can expect firmer guidance in the next few days. One source on the call with the four nations told me there was an acceptance tougher messaging was needed. There has been discussion about travel. Some are particularly worried about people moving from areas where the virus is spreading fast, to areas where it's fairly rare, and taking the virus with them. The new guidance could cover that - as well as reminding people the rules are a maximum, not a target. It's not impossible that different parts of the UK will take different decisions. But there is still hope they can agree when talks reconvene on Wednesday morning. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the plans. Earlier, No 10 said the rules were ""under constant review"" but it still intended to allow families to meet up. The prime minister's spokesman said the government had been clear that people needed to ""remain cautious and vigilant"" duringthe five days of relaxed rules. According to a YouGov poll, a majority of people (57%) in Great Britain believe the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions over Christmas should be scrapped. Some 31% said the easing should go ahead as planned, while 12% said they were unsure. This video can not be played The government needs to ""review"" and ""toughen up"" the planned Christmas virus restrictions, says Sir Keir Starmer. In a joint editorial criticising the UK's Christmas rules,the editors of British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal wrote,externalthat the government was ""about to blunder into another major error that will cost many lives"". They stressed that demand on the NHS was increasing, and added that a new strain of coronavirus ""has introduced further potential jeopardy"". If the UK's Christmas plans are not changed, BMJ editor in chief Fiona Godlee said hospitals could become overwhelmed with a surge in Covid patients. She told BBC News: ""On the current trend, if nothing is done, by New Year's Day there will be as many people in hospital with Covid-19 as there were at the peak of the first phase in April. ""That's even without the Christmas relaxation - so if you add that on top, and then on top of that the winter pressures that we always see in the NHS at winter, you will see a worrying scenario of people not being able to get the care they need."" She also said England's tiered system was ""not succeeding in what it set out to do"", as case numbers have continued to increase in some areas in the top tiers. This video can not be played What can I do under tier 3 restrictions in England? A review of which areas of England are in which tier is scheduled to take place on Wednesday. It has already been announced that some 10.8 million people across London, Essex and Hertfordshire will join tier three from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday, bringing the total number of people living under the toughest restrictions to 34 million people - or 61% of England's population.

UK Christmas rules 'unlikely to change',"This video can not be played Minister Robert Jenrick says people ""should use their own judgement at Christmas"" A relaxation of coronavirus rules over Christmas will still go ahead despite calls for them to be toughened, the four UK nations have agreed. But sterner warnings will be issued to urge people to keep social contact low. UK leaders have come under pressure to review the five-day plan as Covid infections continue to rise in Wales and parts of south-east England. Only two households are advised to mix in Wales,under new stricter advice. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the House of Commons: ""We should exercise extreme caution in the way we celebrate Christmas."" He said discussions on Wednesday morning had resulted in ""unanimous agreement"" between the four UK nations ""that we should proceed in principle with the existing regulations because we don't want to criminalise people's long-made plans"". However, he added it was ""absolutely vital that people should, at this very, very tricky time, exercise a high degree of personal responsibility"". He urged people to be particularly careful when they come into contact with vulnerable people - and should avoid contact with elderly people ""wherever possible"". A statement is expected soon to confirm the details of Wednesday morning's talks. Between 23 and 27 December, you can form a""Christmas bubble"",externalcomprised of people from three households You can travel between tiers and between UK nations to meet your bubble You can only meet in homes, places of worship or public outdoor spaces - not pubs or restaurants You can meet people outside your bubble according to your local rules Earlier, cabinet minister Robert Jenrick urged the public to ""use their own judgement"" on who to see over the five days of relaxed rules, from 23 to 27 December. Mr Jenrick said the government ""can't legislate for every eventuality"" so the law which sets out the Christmas relaxations ""remains unchanged"". However, Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that further guidance would be published to show infection rates are rising in many parts of the country, and to reflect thatCovid cases surged in parts of the US following the Thanksgiving holiday. How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? An information campaign is expected to be launched in the days running up to Christmas, with people being urged to think carefully about bubbling with elderly or at-risk relatives. Mr Jenrick said based on the further guidance, the government would ask people to ""weigh up the risks to their own loved ones"" and ""exercise their own good judgement"" about their Christmas plans. ""You can come together as three families and bubble for up to five days - but I suspect many, many people across the country will choose to do less than that, to protect themselves, their loved ones, and broader society,"" he said. The government's Christmas travel adviser, Sir Peter Hendy, said ministers' message to the public would be ""stay local if you can"". He told MPs on the Transport Committee he was confident there would be no overcrowding on trains during the festive period, but urged passengers to book tickets early. Labour has called for the measures over Christmas to be reviewed. Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed told BBC Breakfast that the four UK nations should reconsider whether the proposed easing of restrictions was safe, ""given what we now know about the failure of [England's] tiered system to control the rate of infection"". It comes aftertwo leading journals said the ""rash"" decision to ease restrictions would ""cost many lives"". In a joint editorial, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal stressed that demand on the NHS was increasing, adding that a newstrain of coronavirus- identified in both England and Wales - ""has introduced further potential jeopardy"". Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the ""major driver"" for how much the disease spreads over the five-day Christmas period was the infection prevalence - and that the current prevalence had started to rise ""really quite rapidly in some places"". ""When the rules were made about Christmas, we didn't know what that prevalence was going to be,"" Prof Medley told the Today programme. As for the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed, he said: ""We don't have much headroom."" Patients face 12-hour wait as hospital struggles New Covid strain: How worried should we be? After the first round of talks on Tuesday, a UK government source said they were ""keen to maintain a UK-wide approach"". Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had earlier told the Scottish Parliament there was a ""case"" for tightening the planned freedoms to combat a rise in infections. In Wales, First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said ""the choice is a grim one"", but the current plans were a ""hard-won agreement"" he would not put aside ""lightly"". A spokeswoman for Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said they would be holding discussions with their medical and scientific advisers. Despite the significant pressure for a rethink, leaders from the UK are likely to stick to the deal they agreed last month. There are no plans for a change of regulations in England - and it's unlikely Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland will make changes either. But there are real concerns among decision makers about the impact the relaxations could have - in particular the number of people who will be travelling across the UK. So you can expect to hear much stronger advice that just because you can mix, that doesn't mean you should. Ministers are preparing to warn people they should limit their interactions before forming a Christmas bubble, that they should think carefully before mixing with elderly or at-risk relatives, and that where possible people should stay local and avoid travel. Leaders are still trying to strike a balance between allowing people to visit relatives who they may not have seen for months, without allowing the virus to run rampant. But many still believe that relaxing rules just as many areas are seeing a significant increase in cases is too risky, and will lead to a considerably more difficult period at the start of next year. The resumption of talks comes as nearly 10.8 million people in London, and parts of Essex and Hertfordshirejoined England's toughest tier of restrictionsat 00:01 GMT. It means some 34 million people in England are now living under the toughest rules - around 61% of England's population. RESTRICTIONS LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Under tier three - very high alert - rules, pubs and restaurants must close, except for takeaway and delivery, and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas must remain shut. Ministers are also due to review other English tiers today - with an announcement due on Thursday. On Tuesday, theScottish government announced that three council areas- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian - are to have tougher restrictions imposed from Friday in a bid to reverse rising numbers of cases. It was also announced that a further 506 people in the UK had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 64,908. Another 18,450 infections were confirmed.

Facebook to move all UK users onto US agreementsThe move could allow the social media giant to avoid strict EU privacy laws being introduced.Business,"Facebook will shift its UK users onto agreements with the companyâs corporate headquarters in California. The move could put UK users out of reach of Europe's privacy laws. But Facebook said there will be no change to the privacy controls or the services it offers UK customers. Currently, UK users are governed by agreements with Facebookâs Irish headquarters, but this legal relationship will change following the UK's exit from the European Union (EU). âFacebook has had to make changes to respond to Brexit and will be transferring legal responsibilities and obligations for UK users from Facebook Ireland to Facebook Inc,"" the social media giant told Reuters, which first reported the story. Tech Tent: Breaking up Facebook Facebook facing US legal action over competition Why don't Facebook and Apple like each other? The changes come into effect in 2021, and users will be notified by an update to Facebookâs terms of service in the first half of the year. A number of other tech companies also have their European headquarters in Dublin, including Google, Microsoft, AirBnB and Twitter. Facebookâs decision follows a similar move by Google in February. This video can not be played An advertising boycott wants Facebook to do more about hate speech and misinformation (video published in July) Facebookâs UK users will remain subject to UK privacy law, which will still largely mirror the EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is among the worldâs strictest privacy regimes. Privacy advocates have expressed concern that the UK might be tempted to water down its protections in the pursuit of free trade deals as it leaves the EU. In particular, they are worried about a possible deal with the US, which has weaker privacy laws. Already, the Cloud Act - a US law passed in 2018 - has made it easier for US and UK authorities to access data stored by digital service providers stored in each otherâs territory. However, Facebook has been under increasing pressure in the US. In a landmark lawsuit, US regulators have accused Facebook of buying up rivals in order to stifle competition. Regulators are seeking the sale of Facebook's picture sharing platform Instagram and its messaging service WhatsApp. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?
