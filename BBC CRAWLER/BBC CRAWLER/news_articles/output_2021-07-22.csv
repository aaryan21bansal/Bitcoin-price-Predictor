US supermodel sponsors Irish boys' basketball club,"Emily Ratajkowski has family ties to Bantry Two teen basketball teams in a small Irish coastal town will soon have a spring in their step after securing sponsorship from a US supermodel. Emily Ratajkowski answered a funding appeal for kit for the under-15 and under-16 boys of Bantry Basketball Club in County Cork ahead of the new season. Her support has set the teams' Snapchat group ""on fire"", said coach Pat Curran. He said the family of the model, actress and activist had long been ""ingrained"" in the Bantry community. The 30-year-old's parents have a home in the town and her father John played for the basketball club ""about 20 years ago"", Pat told BBC News NI. The closure of many Irish businesses during the country's Covid-19 lockdown had meant that the club was finding it difficult to get sponsorship this year. ""I was speaking John the other night so I just said to him if Emily would be interested in sponsoring one of the teams,"" said the coach. The Bantry boys - pictured at the start of 2020 with coach Pat Curran - will have the name of Ratajkowski's clothing company on their jerseys ""He texted her and she was back within five minutes, saying: 'Absolutely I'd love to do it'. ""They're very decent people."" Her financial support will help to buy new kits and cover training expenses for the teams over the next two years. But Pat said the deal was about much more than money. He said Ratajkowski's ""great sense of social justice"" made her an inspiration for the club's young players. ""Everyone knows Emily Ratajkowski, the model and the actress, but there's a lot more to her,"" he said. ""She's used a platform over and over again to be an advocate for marginalised groups such as immigrants. ""She's particularly vocal on women's rights, women's reproductive rights, Black Lives Matter, LGBT rights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""She's someone that they can really look up look up to with her advocacies and how she carries herself - she really encapsulates that ethos of inclusivity."" Pat said the ""feel-good story"" had caused a stir in Bantry, with the town revelling in it. ""My own son was delighted - he'd know Emily's parents really well,"" he said.

Invincibles open men's Hundred with entertaining win,"This video can not be played Nutmegs and diving catches - best of the first men's Hundred match The Hundred: Oval Invincibles v Manchester Originals, Kia Oval Oval Invincibles 145-8 (100 balls):Billings 49, T Curran 29; Klaassen 3-23 Manchester Originals 136-7 (100 balls):Brathwaite 37, Sowter 2-18 Invincibles win by nine runs Scorecard Oval Invincibles edged out Manchester Originals by nine runs as the men's Hundred kicked off in entertaining fashion at The Oval. After a thrillingopening women's game on Wednesday,the men's opener also went the distance as Manchester chased 146 to win. After a poor start, Originals' Carlos Brathwaite hit 37 from 29 balls but, with 19 needed from the last five balls, the West Indies international was caught. It was a fine Invincibles bowling performance which secured the win after captain Sam Billings had earlier hit 49 to lead a recovery from 32-3 to 145-8 from their 100 balls. Here are BBC Sport's takeaways from the Invincibles' win. This video can not be played 'It's a beauty!' - Lammonby makes brilliant diving catch to dismiss Roy This match didn't quite match the drama of the women's opener but it was still another entertaining night at The Oval - the match lit up by nutmegs, diving catches and a pair of brilliant brothers, two of 15 internationals across the two XIs. Manchester started badly in their chase, England's Phil Salt and Jos Buttler making just four and eight respectively. After 41 balls they were 50-4. But with Brathwaite at the crease almost anything is possible - as England fans know after hedowned Ben Stokes in stunning fashion in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final. Needing 47 runs from the last 20 balls he hit England's Tom Curran for six and the home crowd of 18,126 - another positive attendance at the start of cricket's newest competition - were nervous. Ultimately, though, it was the other Curran, Sam - Tom's younger brother - who had Brathwaite caught at long-on, leaving the West Indies star to slump from the field dejected, taking Manchester's hopes with him. This video can not be played 'Brother to brother!' - Currans combine to dismiss Harrison At the halfway stage, Manchester were probably favourites after restricting the Invincibles to a below-par score. Up stepped the Invincibles bowling attack - led by the Currans. Tom had already impressed the crowd with a nutmeg shot with the bat. With the ball - his now trademark headband on - he bowled the penultimate set of five balls and removed Calvin Harrison, who made 23 from 16 in support of Brathwaite. Twenty-three-year-old Sam, hair bleached blonde a la Phil Foden, bowled the first five balls and the last five, deceiving the Manchester batters with slower balls, which he later told BBC Sport he has honed with the help of West Indies' all-rounder Dwayne Bravo. It was was impressive from the two local England internationals, both of whom came through the Surrey academy. They were supported well by another England international Reece Topley, who had the dangerous Joe Clarke caught behind for 15, and a less well-known name, spinner Nathan Sowter, who chipped in with 2-18. This video can not be played 'Through the legs!' - Curran nutmegs himself Buttler, a key member of England's 2019 World Cup-winning team, is one of the most destructive batters in the world at his best. Here, as he did in England's Twenty20 win over Pakistan on Tuesday, he struggled for fluency. He only hit one four in his 10 balls - a reverse sweep one ball before he was dismissed. All of Manchester's star names, skipper Buttler and Salt with the bat, or Matt Parkinson with the ball, had quiet nights. Buttler will only have one more game in The Hundred before leaving for England duty but the others must find their feet for Manchester to go far. Manchester Originals were always behind the rate against Oval Invincibles, as this worm chart shows Sam Billings' knock was crucial. He largely targeted the leg side, hitting two big sixes. But impressive too was how he marshalled his team in the field. A change in the field helped see off Buttler and he even took a well-timed strategic time out with 10 balls needed and the game in the balance. ""He has just gone about it cleverly,"" said England Women's World Cup winner and BBC pundit Alex Hartley. ""Buttler hit a reverse sweep, he put that fielder back so Buttler had to go over extra cover and that is where he was caught. Billings has been absolutely outstanding."" Sam Billings scored a large majority of his runs through the leg side The game also saw new tactics, brought about byThe Hundred's new rules,begin to emerge. Both Sam Curran and Manchester left-arm spinner Tom Hartley took up the option of bowling 10 consecutive deliveries at the start of each innings. In Invincibles' batting innings and in an attempt to take advantage of the fielding restrictions, Sam Curran was promoted to open, an unfamiliar position the left-hander who usually bats in the middle order. He hit a six from his fourth ball but then became Hartley's first victim, bowled by a quicker delivery by the spinner. Hartley was probably the Originals' most impressive bowler, also dismissing England batter Jason Roy - he was caught brilliantly by Tom Lammonby diving forward in the deep for 20 - and taking 2-20 despite bowling 15 balls in the powerplay and five at the end.

Towie star 'took own life amid financial worries',"Mick Norcross, 57, was found dead at his home in Essex on 21 January Nightclub owner and The Only Way Is Essex star Mick Norcross took his own life, a coroner has ruled. The businessman and father of Kirk Norcross, who also appeared in the ITV show, was found dead at his home in Bulphan at 15:15 GMT on 21 January. The 57-year-old had financial concerns, Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard. He had taken out a Â£3.6m bank loan and a bridging loan secured against his main residence. Insp Neil Armstrong of Essex Police told the inquest that Mr Norcross had been involved in three property developments that were over schedule. He said Mr Norcross may have faced ""the loss of a lifetime's work and potentially the family home... and it appeared that was weighing heavily on him"". Mr Norcross owned the Sugar Hut, a Brentwood nightclub Mr Norcross first appeared on Towie in 2011 as the owner of the Sugar Hut nightclub in Brentwood. In a statement read by the coroner, his son Kirk said lockdown had changed him. He said his father had started sleeping in the mornings. ""It was almost like he had a black cloud over his head,"" he said. ""He would make passing comments, 'this money is not worth this agg (aggravation), I'm better offing myself'. ""I never took this seriously - I thought he was just joking."" Mick Norcross's partner Samantha Keahey said in a statement that he sold a Range Rover, an Aston Martin and a van and cashed in his private pension early. ""Mick has always supported his family as long as I've known him and the thought of not being able to support his family frightened him,"" she said. Essex's senior coroner Lincoln Brookes told the hearing: ""He had been under a great deal of pressure and I accept the evidence of his family that he was a very proud man who saw himself as a provider."" The inquest concluded that Mr Norcross died by suicide. The star posted atweet,externalto his 505,000 followers on the day he died, saying: ""At the end remind yourself that you did the best you could. And that's good enough.""

Critical workers to be exempt from self-isolation,"Critical staff working in the health, food and transport sectors can apply to be exempt from self-isolation, under a new Scottish government scheme. People who work in the emergency services, government and finance could also qualify for an exemption. But they must be double vaccinated, have a negative PCR test and agree to take daily lateral flow tests. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the changes would ""ensure staff shortages do not put key services at risk"". The exemptions would be limited and applied on a ""case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary"", she added. Previously anyone who came into contact with someone who had tested positive must isolate for 10 days. The new scheme will allow employers to apply to the Scottish government for permission to exempt those who work in critical roles and where staff shortages could jeopardise essential services. Supermarkets say shortages are not widespread The 'pingdemic' in Scotland The exemption will only be granted where workers have voluntarily agreed not to self-isolate. The changes come after businesses across the UK were affected by large numbers of workers self-isolating, leading to shortages of some products in supermarkets. Health and social care also remains under pressure from staff shortages. In Lanarkshire urgent social care is being prioritised only for the most vulnerable by reducing home care packages ""where it is safe to do so"" as a result of the ""exceptional"" pressures on the NHS. The Scottish government has said employers who meetthe definition of Critical National Infrastructure,externalcan apply for the exemption. There are 13 national infrastructure sectors: Chemicals Civil Nuclear Communications Defence Emergency Services Energy Finance Food Government Health Space Transport Water There were some empty shelves at this Co-op in Glasgow on Thursday Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is essential that lifeline services and critical national infrastructure are maintained and we are implementing these changes now ahead of possible changes to self-isolation rules for close contacts that may apply more generally in future. ""We have seen significant staff shortages in a small number of organisations in recent days and we have worked with them to protect services. ""Clinical evidence tells us we can safely and effectively release some critical staff from self-isolation, with appropriate safeguards. However, this is a very limited change at this stage, to be applied on a case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary."" The move was widely criticised by unions including Unite, Unison and GMB Scotland. Louise Gilmour, of GMB Scotland, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmethat the ""pretty shocking"" decision was ""driven by resource - not what is safe for our workers or their families"". ""We believe it's the cuts, the underfunding and the under-staffing of these services that means they don't have the capacity we need in times of crisis - that's within our NHS, our social care and our supermarkets,"" she added. Meanwhile Unison's Willie Duffy warned that the new rules were not an ""appropriate or well evidenced"" response and could lead to further spread of the virus. However it was described as a ""step forward in... a fast-moving situation"" by the Scottish Retail Consortium. ""Whilst it is vexing that store staff are not explicitly in scope, it will hopefully help the grocery supply chain as its grapples with a conflux of pressures at the current time including elevated levels of self-isolation amongst staff in logistics, distribution, and production,"" a spokesman added. He said the availability of products on shop shelves ""remains good"". The move was also welcomed as a ""cautious step in the right direction"" by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. ""However, many questions must be clarified by the SNP if these changes are to have the right effect,"" he added.  ""They must be clear on who exactly will qualify for an exemption and for how long an exemption will last for."" The haulage industry already faced a shortage of drivers but the situation has been made worse by the Covid pandemic Earlier Colin Smith, chief executive of the Scottish Wholesale Association, said his members were ""critical"" to keeping the shops supplied. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthere was on average a 13% shortfall of required drivers in Scotland but staff shortages were not as bad as in England. ""The problems is the supply chain is heavily interlinked with England, so higher cases down there means less staff to pick and deliver to our depots so we can get it out our end users,"" he added. He said fast moving goods such as soft drinks, pet food and alcohol are goods where ""we can't replenish quick enough"". In the transport sector, ScotRail said a ""very limited number of trains"" have been cancelled due to staff shortages, but it has not amended its timetables. On Thursday a Loganair flight was cancelled due to staff isolation. The airline is understood to be experiencing shortages of cabin crew and pilots. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Postmasters in IT scandal to get up to Â£100,000","Sub-postmasters wrongly convicted of offences in a Post Office IT scandal will get interim compensation of up to Â£100,000, the government has said. As of this week, a total of 59 former sub-postmasters have had their convictions quashed - with more due in court over the coming months. More people have been affected by the scandal than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. The government has agreed to fund the initial payments. Those affected can still seek extra compensation at a later date, via mediated settlements or through the civil courts. Some of those claims could add up to millions of pounds. 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' Post Office scandal: More postmasters cleared Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said: ""The suffering and distress these postmasters and their families have gone through cannot be overstated. While nothing will make up for the years of pain they faced after this appalling injustice, I hope this initial step provides a measure of comfort. ""The Post Office has started to turn a corner in terms of dealing with its past mistakes - and this government will support them in doing so wherever possible."" There were more than 700 prosecutions based on evidence from the Horizon software system. Hundreds of people who ran Post Office branches were subsequently convicted of various offences, including theft and false accounting, when the system was used. The Horizon system was designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch Following the convictions some of these former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities, and struggled to secure work. Some lost their homes and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Some have since died. However, the IT was found to have bugs and defects that left a black hole in accounts. Following a series of court cases, many have received some civil compensation and some have had their convictions overturned. The Post Office said the interim payments would be offered to those who were ""badly failed"" whilst final compensation arrangements were established. Its chief executive, Nick Read, said: ""Ensuring compensation is made as quickly as possible is a priority for Post Office. ""Whilst we cannot change the past, this is an important step towards meaningful compensation for victims and we will offer payments as soon as possible."" The Post Office is contacting postmasters and will aim to make an offer for an interim payment within 28 days of receiving an application from those whose overturned convictions relied on Horizon evidence. Anyone who has received a share of the civil payout can still receive the latest compensation, if their Horizon-related conviction is overturned. Chi Onwurah, Labour's shadow business minister, said: ""This news is bittersweet - for those sub-postmasters who lost their jobs, homes, and reputations, for those who have still not had their convictions overturned and so will not be in scope, and for those who lost their lives, for whom this news comes too late."" Neil Hudgell, of Hudgell Solicitors, which represents some of the postmasters, described the announcement of interim compensation as a ""cautiously positive step"" ""This cannot be a delaying gesture though. This is money to which these clients are entitled. With regards to how final settlements are agreed, we want them to come to the table and be meaningful in what they put forward,"" he said.

Pinged rules for staff 'unworkable',"Industry bodies have reacted with dismay at the government's plan for firms to apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules. The government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be ""considered on a case-by-case basis"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the airport operators association, said the scheme was ""simply unworkable"". The food supply industry called for clarity on how the scheme would work. The new policy comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that fully-vaccinated people in critical roles in England would be able to continue workingeven if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid.The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms. Individual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption. Those deemed eligible, which includes NHS and care staff, will be able to take daily tests instead. Downing Street said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors. The number of exceptions outside of the NHS is expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands. There are ongoing discussions with companies in critical industries. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""A number of those exemptions are in process of being granted or have been granted."" 'Pingdemic' Firms have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app.Iceland and Greene King saidon Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result. Business lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery. Rod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the plan felt like it had been ""thought up on the hoof without proper organisation or thought"". ""Truckers were classed as essential workers at the start of the pandemic; now they may be or may not be,"" he said. ""It's too confusing. The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain."" Ms Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government ""must reconsider and exempt categories of workers"", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate. ""As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,"" she said. ""Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable."" 'Pingdemic' shuts Iceland and Greene King sites Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: ""What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? ""If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it. He said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was ""growing exponentially across the food supply chain"". Andrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots. He said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had ""well over 100 people"" off at the moment. The firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate. Mr Selley said it was a ""little ridiculous"" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate. He added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the ""same way it did for key workers"" at the beginning of the pandemic. The government has saidit is ""crucial"" for people to quarantine after being ""pinged""by the NHS Covid-19 app. Its message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a ""ping"" from the app. The Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an ""advisory tool"" and that people were not under any ""legal duty"". The prime minister's official spokesman said ""business-critical areas"" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating. ""It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,"" he said. ""It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions."" Asked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: ""We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. ""What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.""

In Lanarkshire urgent social care is being prioritised only for the most vulnerable by reducing home care packages ""where it is safe to do so"" as a result of the ""exceptional"" pressures on the NHS. The Scottish government has said employers who meetthe definition of Critical National Infrastructure,externalcan apply for the exemption. There are 13 national infrastructure sectors: Chemicals Civil Nuclear Communications Defence Emergency Services Energy Finance Food Government Health Space Transport Water There were some empty shelves at this Co-op in Glasgow on Thursday Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is essential that lifeline services and critical national infrastructure are maintained and we are implementing these changes now ahead of possible changes to self-isolation rules for close contacts that may apply more generally in future. ""We have seen significant staff shortages in a small number of organisations in recent days and we have worked with them to protect services. ""Clinical evidence tells us we can safely and effectively release some critical staff from self-isolation, with appropriate safeguards. However, this is a very limited change at this stage, to be applied on a case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary."" The move was widely criticised by unions including Unite, Unison and GMB Scotland. Louise Gilmour, of GMB Scotland, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmethat the ""pretty shocking"" decision was ""driven by resource - not what is safe for our workers or their families"". ""We believe it's the cuts, the underfunding and the under-staffing of these services that means they don't have the capacity we need in times of crisis - that's within our NHS, our social care and our supermarkets,"" she added. Meanwhile Unison's Willie Duffy warned that the new rules were not an ""appropriate or well evidenced"" response and could lead to further spread of the virus. However it was described as a ""step forward in... a fast-moving situation"" by the Scottish Retail Consortium. ""Whilst it is vexing that store staff are not explicitly in scope, it will hopefully help the grocery supply chain as its grapples with a conflux of pressures at the current time including elevated levels of self-isolation amongst staff in logistics, distribution, and production,"" a spokesman added. He said the availability of products on shop shelves ""remains good"". The move was also welcomed as a ""cautious step in the right direction"" by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. ""However, many questions must be clarified by the SNP if these changes are to have the right effect,"" he added.  ""They must be clear on who exactly will qualify for an exemption and for how long an exemption will last for."" The haulage industry already faced a shortage of drivers but the situation has been made worse by the Covid pandemic Earlier Colin Smith, chief executive of the Scottish Wholesale Association, said his members were ""critical"" to keeping the shops supplied. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandthere was on average a 13% shortfall of required drivers in Scotland but staff shortages were not as bad as in England. ""The problems is the supply chain is heavily interlinked with England, so higher cases down there means less staff to pick and deliver to our depots so we can get it out our end users,"" he added. He said fast moving goods such as soft drinks, pet food and alcohol are goods where ""we can't replenish quick enough"". In the transport sector, ScotRail said a ""very limited number of trains"" have been cancelled due to staff shortages, but it has not amended its timetables. On Thursday a Loganair flight was cancelled due to staff isolation. The airline is understood to be experiencing shortages of cabin crew and pilots. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Supermarkets: Shortages not widespread,"Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. The Co-op said items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer were worst affected. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was ""concerned about instances of shortages"". ""I don't want people to get the impression that every shelf in every supermarket is bare - that is not the case but we are certainly concerned about instances of shortages, we are looking at the supply chains of critical industries and we are reviewing that situation,"" he added. A record 618,903 people in England and Wales were ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app in the week to 14 July. Who needs to self-isolate and who is exempt? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets and other sectors, including hospitality and transport, have said growing numbers of staff have been affected which means they have to self-isolate for 10 days. Some companies have reduced opening hours to cope with the staff shortages or shut parts of the business. Firms want people who have been doubly vaccinated or have daily tests to be able to return to work. Mr Kwarteng said that the government would publish guidance later on which sectors would be exempt, although he declined to comment on whether it would include the food industry. Many of Thursday's newspapers carried pictures of empty shelves in some supermarket branches - with some describing panic buying of certain items - but industry sources told the BBC that so far, food shortages were not a systemic problem. Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said photographs of empty shelves in supermarkets were ""isolated incidents"". It is understood that Tesco is experiencing low availability across a small number of products due to the rise in the number of workers self-isolating as well as the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, the Co-op said it was being hit ""by some patchy disruption to our deliveries and store operations"". ""We are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly,"" it added. It is understood that items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer are worst affected. Lidl said the rise in numbers of employees having to self-isolate was starting to hit operations, but it was working to minimise disruption. About 1,000 Iceland employees - almost 4% of its staff - are currently absent for Covid-related reasons, with the north of England most affected. Of these, 27% have tested positive for Covid, while 64% have been ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told to isolate. Iceland is recruiting 2,000 temporary staff to help with the shortages while the Co-op will take on 3,000 extra workers. Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""We're working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now. ""As always, our focus is on maintaining the best possible range of products and high levels of service for our customers."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the increasing number of workers being told to isolate was ""putting increasing pressure on retailers' ability to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked"". A fall in the number of available HGV drivers, exacerbated by the rising numbers being forced to isolate, was also ""resulting in minor disruption to some supply chains"", the BRC's Andrew Opie said. The Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of 100,000 HGV drivers in the UK due to workers returning to Europe following Brexit as well as delays in testing hauliers for Covid. Meanwhile, the British Meat Processors Association said some members were seeing between 5% and 10% of their workforce ""pinged"" by the app. Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. If someone is told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace they are legally obliged to do so. But if someone is ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app the requirement to self-isolate is only advisory. Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, which supplies produce to hospitals, care home and prisons as well as restaurants, said it was asking workers who have been ""pinged"" to come back to work after they have taken a negative PCR test. ""We have a process of doing lateral flow tests daily away from their workplace and if that is negative then they can proceed with their work,"" Mr Selley said. Backlash as pinged staff rules called unworkable 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets But Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: ""The rules are clear and I think they should be followed."" Earlier this week, the government announced a ""small number"" of fully vaccinated critical workers, including health and care staff, would be allowed to continue to do their job even if they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive for Covid. The prime minister has said he does not want to extend the exemption too widely in order to limit the spread of the virus. The government has argued it is necessary to keep isolation rules largely unchanged until 16 August. From that date, people who are fully vaccinated and under-18s will be able to avoid self-isolating by taking daily Covid tests. Dozens of councils across Englandhave also been forced to suspend bin collections due to staff self-isolating. On Wednesday, BP said lorry driver shortages and isolating staffhad caused fuel supply issues at some of its petrol stations. The oil firm said shortages of unleaded petrol and diesel had seen a ""handful"" of its UK sites close temporarily. Have you experienced shops struggling to keep their shelves stocked?

Which workers will be able to avoid self-isolation?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results.

"More than 600,000 told to isolate","More than 600,000 people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales were sent self-isolation alerts in the week between 8 and 15 July. Data shows 618,903 alerts were sent - a 17% rise from the previous week. There are complaints from businesses that the alerts are causing serious staff shortages and affecting services. However some fully-vaccinated key workers will be exempt from self-isolating if they are pinged by the app as a close contact of a positive case. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC a âvery narrowâ list of jobs would be released today. Self-isolation for all fully-vaccinated people pinged by the app as close contacts is due to be scrapped by 16 August, although there are calls for this deadline to be brought forward. The app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the Test and Trace team. Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? ""If you are pinged, you should self-isolate. I know it poses challenges, and we are seeing reports of shortages which we are monitoring, but the rules are clear and I think they should be followed,"" Mr Kwarteng told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4. Latest government figures show there are a further 44,104 daily coronavirus cases in the UK, with 73 coronavirus-related deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned cases could rise even more this week, as most legal restrictions have ended in England. His spokesman said that the app was doing ""what it's designed to do"". ""We're aware of the impact on some industries and services and working closely with them particularly food and supermarketsâ¦.we have a robust and resilient food supply chain."" Butsupermarkets have warnedthey may have product shortages due to staff self-isolating. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. However, Iceland urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. Meanwhile,dozens of councils have suspended bin collectionsdue to staff shortages from isolation and fuel provider BP has temporarily closed ""a handful of sites"" due to Covid staff absences. In England 607,486 alerts were sent to app users in the period between 8 and 15 July, with a further 11,417 sent in Wales. There were fewer app pings per case in England during this period, with 2.8 pings issued per every reported coronavirus case. An average of 3.2 pings were sent per case reported in the last month. Scotland's app has issued fewer than 60,000 notification ""pings""since it launched in September 2020. Another record then for the number of people pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app and sent into isolation. For businesses struggling to deal with the impact on their employees this will be more evidence that a different approach is needed. The fact that the number of pings did not rise even more sharply in a week when case numbers were accelerating, may be an indication that some people have deleted the app, although we have to be cautious about extrapolating too much from one week's figures. Its defenders point out that many of the complaints about the app concern wider health policy rather than the tech itself - the fact that people  who may have been in contact with the virus are being told to isolate even if they are fully vaccinated is a policy applying to traditional Test and Trace too, and won't change until August 16th. One man, who was heavily involved in the design of the app, told me people didn't realise that it worked on a number of levels - ""even if someone ignores the message to self-isolate, telling them they have been exposed to the virus is likely to make them behave more cautiously."" He also said that while the anonymous nature of the app meant only limited data could be extracted from it, there was useful and early information for epidemiologists about the spread of the virus and the R rate. The government still insists the app is doing the job for which it was designed - but there will be mounting pressure from industry for a more rapid change to allow people who are pinged to be tested rather than to isolate. When the new health secretary Sajid Javid replaced Matt Hancock, there were reports that he wanted the app's sensitivity tweaked so that it sent out fewer alerts. But that appears to be off the agenda for the moment, with the Department of Health insisting there are no immediate plans for any changes. Downloads of the app continued to rise to 26,826,748 from 26,523,853 the previous week. The BBC understands there is no way to know if the app has been deleted, but #DeleteTheApp has been trending on Twitter today. A recent poll by YouGov suggested that one in ten users have deleted the app, having previously installed it. Those aged between 18 and 24 were most likely to have deleted the app, after installing it, according to the data. People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days. In this same week to 14 July, 259,265 people in England tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 33% from the previous week. NHS Test and Trace said it was the highest weekly number of people testing positive since January. The service said it had identified 475,465 people as close contacts of somebody who had a positive coronavirus result, and had been able to contact 94% of them NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA officials giving update on wildfires as firefighters struggle to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Food workers to be exempt from Covid isolation,"New Covid daily contact testing sites for workers at supermarket depots and food manufacturers won't begin operating until next week. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers in England will be exempt from quarantine rules as the government tries to prevent food supply problems. The government had initially promised to begin testing at 15 ""crucial"" supermarket depots on Friday. But the BBC has learned that testing will be delayed until Monday 26 July. Up to 10,000 staff are expected to qualify for the scheme, but supermarket workers are not included. Earlier on Friday, the Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast: ""We've identified 15 depots covering around five supermarkets where they have the most acute problem with staff absences at the moment and we intend to roll that out today. They already have the infrastructure in place to do the testing at those sites."" However, on Friday afternoon a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman confirmed to the BBC that testing has not yet started. ""No sites are running yet, but we expect to be able to offer daily contact testing to some priority organisations by the end of the day on Monday 26 July and we will support them to mobilise as quickly as possible,"" he said. He added that so far, Defra had contacted 10 supermarkets and that Test & Trace would continue to contact all the organisations identified for this scheme over the weekend and early next week. Which workers don't have to self-isolate? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets say shortages not widespread Warning that 'pingdemic' threatens shop openings The move comes after thehigh number of retail staff self-isolatingaffected the availability of some products. Iceland welcomed the change, but said it wouldn't solve the issue of staff shortages in supermarkets themselves. ""The food supply chain only works if teams are in place to support at each stage - there's no point in fixing the manufacturing and logistics issues if there is no one to put products on the shelves, serve customers at the till and deliver to their homes,"" said Iceland boss Richard Walker. Initially, 15 supermarket depots will be involved, followed by 150 depots later on next week. Up to 500 sites will take part in total, but the new rules will not apply to supermarket store staff. It will mean workers who are alerted by the app or contacted by NHS Test and Trace will be able to continue working if they test negative, whether or not they are vaccinated. Krissy Fremont says she is driving delivery vans because many of Birchall Foodservice's drivers are self-isolating Krissy Fremont is the HR manager for Birchall Foodservice, a wholesaler based in Burnley, Lancashire, that delivers to schools, hospices, care homes, restaurants, hotels and cafes. She says there is still confusion as to whether her firm is on the exemptions list and when they can start on-site daily contact testing - instead of staff members having to self-isolate. ""We're struggling left, right and centre in all departments, but this last week has been the toughest with people having to self-isolate with pinging from the app or children having to self-isolate from school,"" she told the BBC. ""We've had 14 people off in the last week due to Covid and only one of them has been a positive case."" She says her customers cannot be left without food because many are in vulnerable situations, so by hook or by crook the food deliveries must go out. ""So we've had directors going out delivering, we've had to buy extra vans so people like myself can go out delivering.... the management team is all hands on deck,"" she said. ""We can't fail our customers, they've stood by us and we have to get our orders out."" The scheme will run until 16 August when the plan is for the rules to change so that double jabbed people and under-18s will no longer have to self isolate if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. M&S said it was working with the government to identify the key sites it wanted to take part in the daily contact testing scheme. But it said more needed to be done to ""mitigate the impact on wider store operations for all food retailers and we would like the bring forward of the 16 August date so that those who are fully vaccinated or who have a negative test are not forced to quarantine when they are contacted by track and trace"". Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast shop staff had been excluded from the scheme because their inclusion would have been a ""really significant undertaking"". ""You're talking then thousands of different shops and many more people and we still want to maintain the test, trace and isolate system."" However, he added that the government would keep the policy ""under review, but we think this is a sensible first step"". ""We're never going to take risks with our food supply chain,"" he added. The government's move comes as supermarkets said the supply of some products was being affected by the ""pingdemic"" keeping staff away from work. Arecord 618,903 people were told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid appbetween 8 and 15 July in England and Wales. While some retailers said they may have to close stores, they played down fears of food shortages, saying the problems were not widespread. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said ""disruption is limited at the moment"", but it was vital that the government rolled out the scheme as fast as possible and was prepared to take further action if necessary. Separately, the government outlined plans to allow other key industries in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers. In this case, the scheme will only apply to workers who are fully vaccinated. This scheme covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. The policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. Are you a food worker? Get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while the announcement would be a relief to some businesses, ""it will leave many more still facing critical staff shortages and lost revenue as the number of people being asked to isolate remains high"". CBI director general Tony Danker agreed, warning: ""The current approach to self-isolation is closing down the economy, rather than opening it up."" Businesses have already exhausted contingency plans to get in extra staff and are ""at risk of grinding to a halt in the next few weeks"", he added. Phil Langslow, trading director at Cheshire-based County Milk Products, which provides dairy products to the likes of Nestle and Kellogg's, said the government move was ""a step in the right direction"". ""People having to isolate meant that a number of our suppliers, the service providers that are doing the transport for us, have just said they cannot cope. Roughly half of the deliveries that we would expect to be done are not being done routinely and we're having to scramble to actually get product to its destination on time. ""If you think of the food chain as just that - as a chain, and like any chain, you're only as good as the weakest link - if you cannot get your goods to the market, then you've got a problem,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Scotland has also launcheda system of exemptions from self-isolation, covering workers in sectors such as health and social care. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said daily testing of food industry staff would ""minimise the disruption caused by rising cases in the coming weeks, while ensuring workers are not put at risk"".

Who needs to self-isolate?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results.

What is the NHS Covid app?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external.

"Postmasters in IT scandal to get up to Â£100,000Subpostmasters wrongly convicted of offences during an IT scandal are to receive interim compensation.Business","Sub-postmasters wrongly convicted of offences in a Post Office IT scandal will get interim compensation of up to Â£100,000, the government has said. As of this week, a total of 59 former sub-postmasters have had their convictions quashed - with more due in court over the coming months. More people have been affected by the scandal than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. The government has agreed to fund the initial payments. Those affected can still seek extra compensation at a later date, via mediated settlements or through the civil courts. Some of those claims could add up to millions of pounds. 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' Post Office scandal: More postmasters cleared Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said: ""The suffering and distress these postmasters and their families have gone through cannot be overstated. While nothing will make up for the years of pain they faced after this appalling injustice, I hope this initial step provides a measure of comfort. ""The Post Office has started to turn a corner in terms of dealing with its past mistakes - and this government will support them in doing so wherever possible."" There were more than 700 prosecutions based on evidence from the Horizon software system. Hundreds of people who ran Post Office branches were subsequently convicted of various offences, including theft and false accounting, when the system was used. The Horizon system was designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch Following the convictions some of these former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities, and struggled to secure work. Some lost their homes and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Some have since died. However, the IT was found to have bugs and defects that left a black hole in accounts. Following a series of court cases, many have received some civil compensation and some have had their convictions overturned. The Post Office said the interim payments would be offered to those who were ""badly failed"" whilst final compensation arrangements were established. Its chief executive, Nick Read, said: ""Ensuring compensation is made as quickly as possible is a priority for Post Office. ""Whilst we cannot change the past, this is an important step towards meaningful compensation for victims and we will offer payments as soon as possible."" The Post Office is contacting postmasters and will aim to make an offer for an interim payment within 28 days of receiving an application from those whose overturned convictions relied on Horizon evidence. Anyone who has received a share of the civil payout can still receive the latest compensation, if their Horizon-related conviction is overturned. Chi Onwurah, Labour's shadow business minister, said: ""This news is bittersweet - for those sub-postmasters who lost their jobs, homes, and reputations, for those who have still not had their convictions overturned and so will not be in scope, and for those who lost their lives, for whom this news comes too late."" Neil Hudgell, of Hudgell Solicitors, which represents some of the postmasters, described the announcement of interim compensation as a ""cautiously positive step"" ""This cannot be a delaying gesture though. This is money to which these clients are entitled. With regards to how final settlements are agreed, we want them to come to the table and be meaningful in what they put forward,"" he said.

Nurses 'not ruling out strike' after 3% pay rise,"This video can not be played ""Claps don't pay the bills,"" nurse Matthew Tovey says Unions representing nurses in Wales say strike action is being considered in response to a 3% pay rise offer. The GMB union said it was balloting with a clear recommendation to reject the offer and take industrial action. RCN Wales, which has argued for a 12.5% increase, said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the pay award from the Welsh government, which matches England's offer to NHS staff. Eluned Morgan said she would be ""very disappointed"" if strikes took place. ""I think that now is not the right time for industrial action I'm afraid,"" she said. ""We are under immense pressure. We know that there are a lot of people waiting for to be seen on waiting lists, and we need to consider them as well when we're making these decisions."" It follows asimilar announcement in England of a 3% pay rise for nurses and other NHS workers, while Scotland offered 4% in March. Nurse Jackie Davies said colleagues were discussing striking for the first time in her career. 'Profound and surreal' - inside Covid-19 wards Longest A&E waits in nine years as admissions rise Isolation rules loosened for critical workers Parents' relief as Welsh hospital visit rules change ""For the first time in my 36 years, I've had nurses talking about striking and saying things like when are we going to walk out, not if,"" she said. ""I joined the RCN in particular because the RCN had a no-strike policy - and we're a profession, and we're never going to walk out on our patients. ""There was that trust and respect that we would be regarded fairly, and treated fairly. But I can look at my salary, and my salary has hardly moved in the last nine years, because we've had no pay raises for seven years."" Ms Davies, who works in Swansea and is the RCN's trade union committee member for Wales, said the union will consult with members and ask what action they would like to take. ""And I'll be putting a tick next to that box to say yes [to strike], and I, honest to God, since I started this in 1985 I never thought that I would be putting a tick next to a box like that,"" she said. People gathered at a protest on NHS pay ahead of the Welsh and UK governments' announcements Matthew Tovey, who qualified as a nurse during the pandemic, said every healthcare worker had dealt with the strain of the pandemic. ""We've all had to deal with Covid within our own wards, I think every healthcare worker has had to deal with Covid whether the cleaner, porter, support workers to staff nurses,"" he said. ""It was already under-resourced, understaffed and underfunded but Covid just accelerated the staff shortages, the staff morale, burnout, they've just exacerbated it. ""We're working at a 20% pay deficit from 2010... I'm hoping the government is just going to restore our pay... that's the least they can do, nurses are leaving in droves, we just want to be paid fairly."" Mr Tovey, from Merthyr Tydfil, said the public and politicians had clapped for NHS workers every week at the beginning of the pandemic, but had not fairly rewarded them. Merthyr nurse Matthew Tovey, pictured right, was part of a group that handed a petition to Downing Street on NHS pay ""It's pathetic, pitiful and poor, after all we've been through - we saved Boris's life yet we've had nothing. Claps don't pay the bills,"" he said. ""There's real concerns and people are leaving the profession, the pressure is just too much. We're qualified people with responsibility, we're working the jobs of two or three people, we need to be paid fairly. ""We would only go to industrial action because we are adamant we need to make the change for patient safety. ""We need qualified and experienced people when people are admitted to A&E. When they go to wards, there are a lot of junior people at the moment but we need people to teach them, we need those experienced nurses."" The RCN's Ms Whyley said 12.5% was ""absolutely what we deserve"". ""We've got a really angry workforce who do not think this this award is sufficient,"" she said. ""I'm going to see what they want to do and when we've had that opportunity, we'll come back with our plan. ""We've done our homework, we've looked at the economic data, we've looked at the data from other professions and benchmarking and we can see that over the last 10 years, our members have significantly fallen behind other groups and their pay."" Paul Gage, GMB health lead for Wales said: ""Let's face it, this is a slap in the face for Welsh NHS and social care staff. ""Everybody says that our NHS staff deserve better after what they did for us over the last 18 months. ""Well, it's time to do something about it. ""We'll be balloting our members with a clear recommendation for rejection and for industrial action."" And TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said: ""It simply doesn't recognise their dedication, commitment and contribution."" The increase will be backdated to April 2021, and follows a recommendation by NHS pay bodies. The Welsh Conservatives welcomed the announcement, but Plaid Cymru said there is a risk workers will feel ""let down"" -especially as workers in Scotland are receiving 4%. Asked why Wales couldn't meet the Scottish government's offer of 4%, Ms Morgan said ministers were ""restricted by the amount of funding that we get from the UK Conservative government"" but she said it was ""important"" for the pay recommendations to be respected.

Labour MP thrown out of Commons for PM lie claim,"This video can not be played Dawn Butler refuses to withdraw her claims that Boris Johnson lies to Parliament and is ordered out of the Commons. Labour MP Dawn Butler has been ordered to leave the Commons chamber after she refused to withdraw accusations that Boris Johnson is a liar. Ms Butler said the prime minister had ""lied to the House and the country over and over again"". Under parliamentary rules, MPs are not allowed to accuse each other of lying in the House of Commons.

Parties demand Commons debate on PM's 'inaccuracies' MP thrown out for lie accusation Has Bercow 'lies' ruling overturned tradition? The incident took place during the final debate in the House of Commons before MPs leave Westminster for the summer. Ms Butler used her speech to attack the prime minister for ""misleading this House"" during the pandemic. The Brent Central MP cited past statements on economic growth, nurses' bursaries and investment in the NHS as proof of the prime minister's dishonesty. The rules governing behaviour in the Commons state that MPs are not allowed to use abusive language or accuse another MP of either being drunk or a liar. Acting Deputy Speaker Judith Cummins interrupted Ms Butler and asked her to ""reflect on her words and perhaps correct the record"". Ms Butler replied: ""At the end of the day, the prime minister has lied to this House time and time again and it's funny that we get in trouble in this place for calling out the lie, rather than the person lying.""

Longest A&E waits in nine years as admissions rise,"Wales' health minister has unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment Average waiting times at emergency departments are the longest they have been in nine years, the latest figures show. The Welsh Ambulance Trust also received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. More than 600,000 patients are waiting for treatment in Wales after record backlogs during the pandemic. It comes as Wales' health minister pledged to ""transform"" the delivery of urgent care. Eluned Morgan unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment. It includes annual funding of Â£25m to ""support people to access the right care in the right place"". The strategy comes after unions criticised the Welsh government's planned3% pay rise for NHS staff. Coroner concerned over emergency staffing levels Ambulance service pushed to limit in heatwave The figures, published on Thursday, show the Welsh Ambulance Trust received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. There were 41,454 calls to the service last month, an average of 1,382 per day. A record percentage of the calls received - 7.9% - were so-called ""red calls"" where incidents are classed as immediately life-threatening. Meanwhile the average number of people admitted to emergency departments in Wales every day in June was 3,136 - the second-highest figure since comparable records began in April 2012. Targets state 95% of all patients visiting A&E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours and no patient should wait longer than 12 hours. In June, 70.6% of patients spent less than four hours in A&E, a small drop on the previous month and 7.4% lower than June 2019, before the pandemic. There was also an increase of 6.4% in the number of people waiting more than 12 hours compared with the previous month, and an increase of 43% compared to June 2019. Average A&E waiting times increased to the longest since comparable records began in April 2012. The figures showed that in May, 608,062 people were waiting to start treatment - more than 19% of the Welsh population and the highest figure since comparable data was first gathered in 2011. It represents an increase of more than 5,000 since April. In May, 227,753 patients had been waiting more than 36 weeks (nine months) - an increase of more than 5,000 compared with April, and nearly nine times more than pre-pandemic total from February 2020 (25,634). Responding to the data, Ms Morgan said: ""The latest data shows the pressure on emergency care services is growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and putting a huge strain on NHS staff. Philip Banfield, chairman of the Welsh consultant committee at the British Medical Association Cymru, stressed that staff needed ""the tools to do the job"". ""There was a brief time at the start of the pandemic when people said: 'What do you need to do the job?' And we need to go back to that stage,"" he said. Ms Morgan said demand on Wales' GPs and emergency departments had continued to grow beyond levels seen before the pandemic, adding: ""Staff are under real pressure."" The government, she said, wanted to make sure everyone could access the ""high quality care they need in the right place, the first time"". ""Often people feel they have no option but to go to their GP, call 999 or go to their nearest emergency department for advice or treatment,"" Ms Morgan said. ""But under our new plans, people with urgent care needs could be treated elsewhere by the many different health professionals working in NHS Wales."" Health boards have had funding to set up new ""urgent primary care centres"", she said, where people can be seen without the need for a GP appointment or to go to A&E. She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersambulance services saw a 45% rise in calls on Monday compared with the previous week. She urged people to think ""very carefully"" about whether their accident was ""genuinely"" an emergency to help reduce waiting times. Last month, Ms Morgan welcomed therollout of a 111 service system,externalfor people in north Wales to get ""non-urgent medical advice"". Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief A&E phone triage scheme 'the way forward' ""What we're trying to do is make sure the public understands that there are alternatives to accident, emergency and GP services,"" she said. The service has now been rolled out to all health board areas across Wales, except for the Cardiff and Vale area, which is expected to come later this financial year. Additional money will also be made available for schemes to help people return home from hospital, reducing unnecessarily long stays and freeing up essential bed capacity. The summer holidays and hot weather, along with the easing of lockdown restrictions and an increase in Covid cases, has heaped more pressure on the NHS. The Welsh Conservatives called on the health minister to urgently come out with a plan, calling the numbers ""extremely concerning"". ""Without treatment, people simply cannot go about their daily lives,"" Russell George said. Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcements of extra funding and better signposting, but said problems were ""even deeper than before. ""I'll be looking for evidence of changes that make a difference in the long term, building more sustainable services at the heart of our communities,"" Rhun ap Iorwerth said. Olwen Williams says one of the challenges is staffing Olwen Williams, vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, described the proposals as ""a wonderful opportunity"". ""Care in the community is definitely the way forward,"" she said. ""And we need our primary care teams, our ambulance services, our community services, social services and our medical services all to work together to ensure that individuals get the right care in the right place at the right time."" Dr Williams added there were ""two big challenges"" involved. She said the first was whether people would accept the change of ""care closer to home"". The second, she explained, was to do with staffing, and how health boards would deliver the changes. Wales Ambulance Service chief executive Jason Killens said a combination of factors in recent days had put the service under ""extreme pressure"". ""It's not just here in Wales that we're seeing this unprecedented level of demand on the emergency ambulance service, and indeed on the NHS as a whole,"" Mr Killens said. ""Our staff have been doing fantastic work for 18 months through the pandemic, and with this warmer weather, they are working in extremely difficult conditions and I pay tribute to them because they've all been fantastic.""

"UK has no idea of EU fishing catch, says Labour","Labour has accused the government of having no idea how many fish are being caught in UK waters by EU boats. The party has accused ministers of losing control of UK waters and ""letting down"" fishing fleets. Data on certain species such as scallops and crab is not yet being regularly shared by the two sides since the Brexit transition ended in January. The government said it expected information sharing for these stocks ""to take place shortly"". What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? UK and Norway fail to reach fishing deal Who really owns UK fishing rights? Under the Brexit trade deal, 100 species, including cod and herring, have catch quotas applied to them for UK and EU waters. Data on these species is being shared to prevent stocks becoming depleted. But the EU and UK also agreed to allow each other's boats to catch species not covered by quotas in quantities based on historic averages, until June 2026. Statistics on these ""non-quota"" fish - which used to be collected and shared by the EU under the Common Fisheries Policy - are not being shared in full, despite an agreement to do so. The two sides are hoping to hammer out an agreement to resume full data sharing at a new committee. Fishing quotas were a contentious part of negotiations over a Brexit trade deal Labour said the government was having to ""start from scratch"" in gathering the data, while the fishing industry has expressed concern that EU boats were catching large amounts of non-quota species, particularly in the English Channel. Labour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said a UK-EU data-sharing arrangement should have been in place when the post-Brexit trade agreement came into force in January. He told MPs: ""The fishing industry knows that the government has failed to negotiate real-terms quota data with the European Union."" Mr Pollard added that the government had ""lost control of our waters"" and was ""badly letting down"" the British fishing industry. Stocks not covered by quotas, including red mullet, squid and most commercial shellfish, are particularly important to smaller UK vessels fishing close to the shoreline. Environment Secretary George Eustice told MPs: ""The government has required all foreign vessels, including EU vessels, to have a licence to fish in our waters. ""That sets certain conditions. We have access to vessel-monitoring data so that we can track the precise location of all of those vessels."" He added: ""We are also working on methodologies now, so they have to declare their catch when they leave our waters and enter our waters, and that will give us the data that [Mr Pollard] suggests we need."" Mr Eustice also said the government had secured total fishing ""opportunities"" for UK fleets of 628,000 tonnes for 2021 - up around 55,000 tonnes on last year.

""I don't want people to get the impression that every shelf in every supermarket is bare - that is not the case but we are certainly concerned about instances of shortages, we are looking at the supply chains of critical industries and we are reviewing that situation,"" he added. A record 618,903 people in England and Wales were ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app in the week to 14 July. Who needs to self-isolate and who is exempt? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets and other sectors, including hospitality and transport, have said growing numbers of staff have been affected which means they have to self-isolate for 10 days. Some companies have reduced opening hours to cope with the staff shortages or shut parts of the business. Firms want people who have been doubly vaccinated or have daily tests to be able to return to work. Mr Kwarteng said that the government would publish guidance later on which sectors would be exempt, although he declined to comment on whether it would include the food industry. Many of Thursday's newspapers carried pictures of empty shelves in some supermarket branches - with some describing panic buying of certain items - but industry sources told the BBC that so far, food shortages were not a systemic problem. Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said photographs of empty shelves in supermarkets were ""isolated incidents"". It is understood that Tesco is experiencing low availability across a small number of products due to the rise in the number of workers self-isolating as well as the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, the Co-op said it was being hit ""by some patchy disruption to our deliveries and store operations"". ""We are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly,"" it added. It is understood that items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer are worst affected. Lidl said the rise in numbers of employees having to self-isolate was starting to hit operations, but it was working to minimise disruption. About 1,000 Iceland employees - almost 4% of its staff - are currently absent for Covid-related reasons, with the north of England most affected. Of these, 27% have tested positive for Covid, while 64% have been ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told to isolate. Iceland is recruiting 2,000 temporary staff to help with the shortages while the Co-op will take on 3,000 extra workers. Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""We're working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now. ""As always, our focus is on maintaining the best possible range of products and high levels of service for our customers."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the increasing number of workers being told to isolate was ""putting increasing pressure on retailers' ability to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked"". A fall in the number of available HGV drivers, exacerbated by the rising numbers being forced to isolate, was also ""resulting in minor disruption to some supply chains"", the BRC's Andrew Opie said. The Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of 100,000 HGV drivers in the UK due to workers returning to Europe following Brexit as well as delays in testing hauliers for Covid. Meanwhile, the British Meat Processors Association said some members were seeing between 5% and 10% of their workforce ""pinged"" by the app. Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. If someone is told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace they are legally obliged to do so. But if someone is ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app the requirement to self-isolate is only advisory. Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, which supplies produce to hospitals, care home and prisons as well as restaurants, said it was asking workers who have been ""pinged"" to come back to work after they have taken a negative PCR test. ""We have a process of doing lateral flow tests daily away from their workplace and if that is negative then they can proceed with their work,"" Mr Selley said. Backlash as pinged staff rules called unworkable 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets But Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: ""The rules are clear and I think they should be followed."" Earlier this week, the government announced a ""small number"" of fully vaccinated critical workers, including health and care staff, would be allowed to continue to do their job even if they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive for Covid. The prime minister has said he does not want to extend the exemption too widely in order to limit the spread of the virus. The government has argued it is necessary to keep isolation rules largely unchanged until 16 August. From that date, people who are fully vaccinated and under-18s will be able to avoid self-isolating by taking daily Covid tests. Dozens of councils across Englandhave also been forced to suspend bin collections due to staff self-isolating. On Wednesday, BP said lorry driver shortages and isolating staffhad caused fuel supply issues at some of its petrol stations. The oil firm said shortages of unleaded petrol and diesel had seen a ""handful"" of its UK sites close temporarily. Have you experienced shops struggling to keep their shelves stocked?

Which workers will be able to avoid isolation?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results.

"LiveLiveMore than 600,000 told to isolate by Covid app3 minutes ago","A record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in week to 14 July Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi defended the figure, saying self-isolation was the second most important tool, after vaccines, for fighting Covid The food industry says rising numbers of self-isolating staff mean shops are facing serious challenges as they try to keep shelves stocked A list of workers able to skip self-isolation if fully vaccinated will be revealed later, Kwarteng says The Royal College of Nursing tells the BBC staff are ""angry"" and deserve a bigger increase Women quarantining in UK hotels will now have female guards, when possible, after allegations of sexual harassment The UK reports 39,906 new coronavirus cases and 84 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Lauren Turner We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day - thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of the latest Covid developments:  We will be back with more tomorrow. Our coverage today has been brought to you by Vanessa Barford, Francesca Gillett, Hamish Mackay, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and George Wright.  Many young adults are still to get their first vaccine - despite the fact all over-18s are now eligible - prompting calls for more to do so. Almost 90% of all UK adults have had a first dose and about 70% are fully vaccinated. But about 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - haven't been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. Under-30s only became eligible for the Covid vaccine in June. Half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to those in their 20s. The vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Read more here. Labour has said the government must produce a ""clear, unambiguous list"" of those workers who could avoid self-isolating. Shadow Business Minister Seema Malhotra said it made sense to exempt ""certain fully vaccinated professionals"" - like those in the emergency services -  from self-isolation rules through a targeted test scheme. However, she said the government had made a mess of its own policy and ""is undermining the effectiveness of the rule change"". ""If ministers don't know or can't decide what the plan is, how can employers possibly be expected to understand what's required of them?"" she added.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 The government is planning to lift the rule to self-isolate for people who are fully vaccinated on 16 August. Not everyone will be double-jabbed by then - especially younger people - so it means many people will still be required to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone with Covid. But Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, says ministers should bring forward this date. Two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had both jabs, he points out - and the Office for National Statistics antibody study found ""40-50%"" of un-vaccinated people were showing signs of having had the virus and so had a ""degree of immunity"". Prof Hunter told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: ""Given the damage this policy is doing, I can't see any public health reason why we shouldn't actually stop requiring quarantining of casual contacts. ""The emphasis is on casual. Clearly if your husband, partner or children you live with have Covid, then that's a totally different issue and I think we need to continue."" He added: ""If you haven't been vaccinated and you haven't had a double vaccine, then the risks are higher and I can see some value in continuing with (self-isolating)."" A family member visits his relative's grave at a cemetery for Covid victims in Jakarta The World Health Organization has urged Indonesia to retain existing Covid restrictions and even to expand them across the country, pointing to a steep rise in deaths and infections. The agency issued the warning two days after President Joko Widodo pledged to gradually ease the measures because of falling case numbers in some regions. But epidemiologists have questioned the Indonesian leader's plan, saying there's a lack of testing outside the capital, Jakarta. This week, daily deaths hit
record highs of more than 1,300 - among the highest tolls in the world. Indonesia's daily positivity rate, the proportion of people
tested who are infected, has averaged 30% over the past week
even as cases numbers have dropped. A level above 20% meant ""very
high"" transmissibility, the WHO said. ""Indonesia is currently facing a very high transmission
level, and it is indicative of the utmost importance of
implementing stringent public health and social measures,
especially movement restrictions, throughout the country,"" it
said. Earlier in the week, Indonesia's medical association said the healthcare system was at risk of collapse due to rising hospital admissions coupled with the deaths of medical staff due to Covid. This video can not be played Dawn Butler suspended from Commons for calling PM a liar Labour MP Dawn Butler has been ordered to leave the House of Commons for the rest of the day after she refused to withdraw accusations that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has lied during the pandemic. She said it was dangerous to lie during a pandemic and that Boris Johnson had ""lied to the House and the country over and over again"". Acting Deputy Speaker Judith Cummins asked the MP to ""reflect on her words and perhaps correct the record"". Ms Butler replied: ""At the end of the day, the prime minister has lied to this House time and time again and it's funny that we get in trouble in this place for calling out the lie, rather than the person lying"". The acting deputy speaker again asked the MP to withdraw her remarks but she replied: ""I have reflected on my words and somebody needs to tell the truth in this House that the prime minister has lied"". It is considered not within the boundaries of parliamentary etiquette to call another member a liar. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Just shy of
40,000 new infections have been confirmed in the UK governmentâs daily Covid
update. That is significant â it is the first time since the rise in infection
rates took off that we have seen a dip in cases compared to the same day a week
ago. Last Thursday 48,500 cases were reported. We should be
careful about reading too much into this. It is just one day and the impact of
the lifting of most restrictions in England and Scotland on 19 July has yet to
take effect. But
nonetheless it offers further evidence that cases will peak somewhere around
the expected levels as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by natural
infection and vaccination. The hope of
government scientists was always that by this stage we would be seeing the
first signs of a plateau. In recent weeks infection rates have not been growing
as quickly as they were at the end of June. And now we
have the first sign that growth may have stopped. We should expect that to be
temporary. The modelling suggests we will soon get a further rise from the 19
July relaxing and further mixing that ensues. But it is at
least a tiny sign that this summer wave could be tamed, before there is a threat
of the NHS being overwhelmed to the extent that restrictions may have to be
reintroduced. A fresh wave of Covid could pose a risk to the euro zone's economic recovery, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said. Her warning comes after the bank hinted at an even longer period of monetary support. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is becoming dominant in Europe, leading to a surge in cases in many countries. ""The reopening of large parts of the economy is supporting a
vigorous bounce-back in the services sector,"" said Lagarde. ""But the Delta
variant of the coronavirus could dampen this recovery in
services, especially in tourism and hospitality."" She added that ECB forecasts from June had included an assumption that some measures
to contain the pandemic would continue through the third and
fourth quarters of this year. A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk. From Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. Ministers will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen. If given the go-ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately. The executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to 10 people, from no more than three households. A decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting. Read more here. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson has said there is no need for the public to be stockpiling due to fears that firms could grind to a halt because of the high numbers of staff isolating. ""I don't think there's any need for members of the public to be stockpiling what they buy. There's plenty of food in the country,"" Dickinson said. ""What we're seeing is pockets of issues in specific places where case numbers are particularly high and the most important thing is that the government acts now before the situation does get more serious, so that we don't see more empty shelves in more places."" Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. Read more here:Supermarkets say shortages are not widespread We have a bit more from thegovernment coronavirus figures,external. They show a total of 325,223 people tested positive for coronavirus in the last seven days, up 63,391 - or 24.2% - on the week before. Meanwhile, 387 people have died within 28 days of a positive test in the last week, up by 130 - or 50.6% - on the previous seven days. The UK has reported 39,906 new positive Covid cases in the last 24 hours. And there have been 84 further deaths, within 28 days of a positive test. Katharine Da CostaBBC health correspondent Covid infections among people aged 20-29 are at the highest level on record across any age group since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Public Health England. In the week to 18 July, the seven-day case rate among this age group was 1154.7 per 100,000 population. The lowest case rates were in people aged 80 and above, with a seven-day rate of 60.6 per 100,000 population. Cases have increased across all regions in England with the highest seven-day average in the North East at 951.7 per 100,000 people compared to the lowest at 423.1 in the South East. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, urged everyone in their 20s to come forward for two doses of the vaccine. âIt is vital we all remain cautious,"" she said. ""Remember that meeting outside is safer than inside, get two doses of the vaccine as soon as you can, isolate if you are told to by NHS Test and Trace and if you show symptoms stay home and get a PCR test. ""We all still have a part to play, Covid-19 has not gone away. âThanks to the vaccine, hospital admissions and deaths are not growing as quickly as previous waves. However, they are on the rise and we continue to closely monitor the data.â Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government risks ""losing social consent"" for isolation if it does not immediately bring forward the relaxation of quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated. It comes after a record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 14 July. Hunt, a Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee, said ministers must bring forward the scheduled end of isolation for all fully vaccinated contacts who test negative from 16 August. Without ending that requirement and replacing it with testing ""we risk losing social consent for this very, very important weapon against the virus"", he said. Self-isolation is still one of the main tools being used to try and stop Covid spreading. At the moment, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you have symptoms, test positive for Covid, live with someone who tests positive or has symptoms, or are told to isolate by contact-tracers. You must also isolate if you arrive in the UK from a red list country, or from an amber list country and are not fully vaccinated. If you are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app saying you have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus, you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work,even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. However, the UK government has not yet confirmed which workers are included in this exemption. A list is expected to be published later today. BBC Radio 5 Live The owner of a chain of cocktail bars says he had to close one of them because staff left their phones together - and they were all pinged by the NHS Covid app. Martin Greenhow runs Mojo, which has branches in Leeds, Harrogate, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester. He tells Radio 5 Live how the Liverpool bar had to shut for a week after every member of staff was alerted by the NHS app and asked to self-isolate. The closure has cost him tens of thousands of pounds. âWe test all our staff on a daily basis,"" he says. ""I donât instruct them to ignore the ping, I give them the option. Itâs at their discretion. ""We will be as altruistic as we can, but fundamentally if a business runs out of money it runs out of all opportunity to do that. âWe ask them to behave in a grown-up, adult manner, which I think the government should expect the entire country to do and stop trying to nanny them.â He adds his business is also being affected by staff shortages in the supply chain, which he says are ""bringing the country to a grinding halt"". Athletes have already arrived in Tokyo for the Olympics With the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics due to start on
Friday, more than 80 people associated with the Games have tested positive. The head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has not
ruled out cancelling the games in the light of rising infections. The BBC Reality Check team has been looking into whether Japan has
Covid under control. You can read what they found here. First Covid vaccination doses are now being offered
without an appointment on the Isle of Man. The first of three walk-in clinics is open between 09:00 and
12:00 BST at the Douglas vaccination hub. A government spokesman said doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca
jab would be offered to anyone aged 18 and over on a ""first-come, first-served basis"". About 89% of adults on the island have already received
their first jab, while about 78% have now been given both. Read more

Ethirajan AnbarasanAnbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia editor, BBC World Service Tax officials in India have raided the offices of a prominent newspaper group, Dainik Bhaskar, which has often challenged the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities say they are investigating alleged tax evasion. The Press Club of India says it deplores such intimidation and calls the raid an attempt to deter the independent media. Dainik Bhaskar publishes newspapers in Hindi and several other Indian languages across a dozen states. The editor of the group says staff members' mobile phones were seized when the tax authorities raided several locations. In the past few months, it carried a series of reports on the devastation caused by the pandemic.  The publication repeatedly questioned the government's Covid death statistics, and reported that the corpses of suspected coronavirus victims were floating in the river Ganges. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long been accused of attempting to stifle critical reporting, an accusation it denies. More than a third of a police force's control room staff are off work because they either have Covid-19 or have been told to self-isolate. Dorset Police said it came at a time when 999 calls had increased 21% since last week and 101 calls were up by 11%. A spokesperson said many of those affected were able to work from home and respond to non-urgent calls. But they said callers to 101 ""may have to wait some time"" to speak to someone as 999 calls were being prioritised. About 35% of control room staff are not working due to the issues. The BBC has asked the force how many workers that equates to. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Supermarkets say shortages are not widespreadThe Co-op says that supplies of soft drinks, beer and deodorant have been affected.","Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. The Co-op said items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer were worst affected. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was ""concerned about instances of shortages"". ""I don't want people to get the impression that every shelf in every supermarket is bare - that is not the case but we are certainly concerned about instances of shortages, we are looking at the supply chains of critical industries and we are reviewing that situation,"" he added. A record 618,903 people in England and Wales were ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app in the week to 14 July. Who needs to self-isolate and who is exempt? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets and other sectors, including hospitality and transport, have said growing numbers of staff have been affected which means they have to self-isolate for 10 days. Some companies have reduced opening hours to cope with the staff shortages or shut parts of the business. Firms want people who have been doubly vaccinated or have daily tests to be able to return to work. Mr Kwarteng said that the government would publish guidance later on which sectors would be exempt, although he declined to comment on whether it would include the food industry. Many of Thursday's newspapers carried pictures of empty shelves in some supermarket branches - with some describing panic buying of certain items - but industry sources told the BBC that so far, food shortages were not a systemic problem. Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said photographs of empty shelves in supermarkets were ""isolated incidents"". It is understood that Tesco is experiencing low availability across a small number of products due to the rise in the number of workers self-isolating as well as the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, the Co-op said it was being hit ""by some patchy disruption to our deliveries and store operations"". ""We are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly,"" it added. It is understood that items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer are worst affected. Lidl said the rise in numbers of employees having to self-isolate was starting to hit operations, but it was working to minimise disruption. About 1,000 Iceland employees - almost 4% of its staff - are currently absent for Covid-related reasons, with the north of England most affected. Of these, 27% have tested positive for Covid, while 64% have been ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told to isolate. Iceland is recruiting 2,000 temporary staff to help with the shortages while the Co-op will take on 3,000 extra workers. Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""We're working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now. ""As always, our focus is on maintaining the best possible range of products and high levels of service for our customers."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the increasing number of workers being told to isolate was ""putting increasing pressure on retailers' ability to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked"". A fall in the number of available HGV drivers, exacerbated by the rising numbers being forced to isolate, was also ""resulting in minor disruption to some supply chains"", the BRC's Andrew Opie said. The Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of 100,000 HGV drivers in the UK due to workers returning to Europe following Brexit as well as delays in testing hauliers for Covid. Meanwhile, the British Meat Processors Association said some members were seeing between 5% and 10% of their workforce ""pinged"" by the app. Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. If someone is told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace they are legally obliged to do so. But if someone is ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app the requirement to self-isolate is only advisory. Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, which supplies produce to hospitals, care home and prisons as well as restaurants, said it was asking workers who have been ""pinged"" to come back to work after they have taken a negative PCR test. ""We have a process of doing lateral flow tests daily away from their workplace and if that is negative then they can proceed with their work,"" Mr Selley said. Backlash as pinged staff rules called unworkable 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets But Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: ""The rules are clear and I think they should be followed."" Earlier this week, the government announced a ""small number"" of fully vaccinated critical workers, including health and care staff, would be allowed to continue to do their job even if they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive for Covid. The prime minister has said he does not want to extend the exemption too widely in order to limit the spread of the virus. The government has argued it is necessary to keep isolation rules largely unchanged until 16 August. From that date, people who are fully vaccinated and under-18s will be able to avoid self-isolating by taking daily Covid tests. Dozens of councils across Englandhave also been forced to suspend bin collections due to staff self-isolating. On Wednesday, BP said lorry driver shortages and isolating staffhad caused fuel supply issues at some of its petrol stations. The oil firm said shortages of unleaded petrol and diesel had seen a ""handful"" of its UK sites close temporarily. Have you experienced shops struggling to keep their shelves stocked?

Theatre and concert hall opening decision delayed,"A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk. From Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. Ministers will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen. If given the go ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Northern Ireland Executive said ""modest relaxations"" had been agreed after careful consideration. It followed an update from health and scientific advisers on how the virus is progressing, including the increasing numbers of cases and hospital admissions, the statement added. It comes asanother 1,430 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday. This includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the last 24 hours. No further deaths were recorded. The frustration here is not totally surprising. A pause has been put on things which some people hoped would be given the green light and the most disappointed people will be those who run our theatres and concert halls. Today's decision doesn't mean reopening of those venues won't happen, but it's not going to happen as quickly as the people who own them want. However, when you consider some of the figures that ministers were considering today, that is not a surprise. This all happens before the executive meets on 12 August to consider the mandatory wearing of facemasks and the end of social distancing. It doesn't look like 'freedom day' - or anything like it - will be announced in Northern Ireland anytime soon. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the decision to make modest changes to restrictions was made ""in the context of a rapid increase in the number of cases"". She said there had also been a doubling of the number of people in hospital in the last eight days, the majority of whom were unvaccinated. Ms O'Neill reiterated a call for young people to take up the opportunity to get vaccinated at pop-up centres across Northern Ireland. ""A cautious approach is what is required here and a steady approach,"" she said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says some progress had been made regarding the easing of restrictions Ms O'Neill said health officials had advised there would be more data available next week, which would help them understand the correlation between Covid-19 cases and admissions to hospital. She said this information would help inform decisions around restrictions that may be further eased. Dr Alan Stout, chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee, described the Northern Ireland Executive's decision as ""sensible and measured"". He said the executive had not bowed to pressure to ease restrictions but has instead based its decision on data and the risks faced. ""The temptation is that we move too soon, we need that little bit more time,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. However, Dr Stout added that Northern Ireland was ""not losing the race"" between infections and vaccines. ""We are doing well and we are protecting people. We would shudder to think what position we would be in right now if we had not vaccinated as many people,"" he said. However, Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was ""regrettable"" more progress could not have been made in the wider reopening of the economy. He added that the executive also needed to take action about the number of people being required to self-isolate. ""We have received numerous calls from members this week indicating that they could well have to close because of staff having to self-isolate,"" he said. ""At the very least, we need the executive to bring Northern Ireland into line with the English date of 16 August, which allows 'pinged' double-vaccinated workers to take a PCR test, rather than self-isolation for 10 days."" Meanwhile, Ireland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the number of Covid-19 cases related to overseas travel had increased ""very sharply"". He said 676 cases were reported in the last fortnight in people returning from Spain, Great Britain and Portugal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a series of posts on Twitter, Dr Glynn said it was ""strongly advised"" that people should only travel on the basis of their vaccination status or immunity after recovering from Covid-19. By Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter We know younger people are currently affected more by Covid-19 because a large part of that cohort simply have not had a vaccination yet. The uptake is slow in that age group. Of all the positive tests in the previous seven days, more than 90% were in those aged under 60. Anecdotally, we are hearing from some people that they are getting vaccinated but some are still catching the virus. A lot of people have said to us that they really would not like to see what they would have had to go through if they had not been vaccinated. It is a complicated, hard-hitting and unpleasant virus. Our hospital figures are remaining reasonably low but today we have 162 people in hospital. There is a lag, however. In another two to three weeks, we are going to see those rising case numbers reflected in hospital admissions. The Northern Ireland Executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to ten people, from no more than three households. A decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting. Other decisions, including removing the restrictions on sound levels from indoor venues, the holding of conferences and exhibitions and reducing social distancing to one metre will be considered next Thursday. Many Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland have been lifted in recent months, after a lockdown that lasted about four months. Hospitality Ulster has previously urged the executive to lift further restrictions on hospitality However,theatres and live music venues have been closed in Northern Ireland for the best part of 16 months, with all other parts of the UK already allowing them to reopen. The arts and music sector had been urging the executive to stick to the latest indicative date and allow the industry to resume trading, with mitigations. They had been looking at allowing a range of relaxations including: 10 people from three households to meet indoors at home - children aged 12 and under are exempt from the limit 15 people from an unlimited number of households to meet in a private garden Theatres and concert halls to reopen, with social distancing of 1m (3ft) required Removing the restrictions on sound levels of music at indoor venues Conferences and exhibitions to resume Hair and beauty salons to operate without requirements for appointments and overlapping appointments to be permitted Social distancing legal requirement to be reduced to 1m indoors, and removed for all outdoor activities MoT centres to resume normal services, allowing customers to be present in testing halls The executive previously said that it intended to remove the so-called ""bubble"" caring provision if it approved the relaxations for increasing numbers of people allowed to meet at home. Although mandatory use of face coverings in England ended on 19 July, that does not apply in Northern Ireland Although mandatory use of face coverings in England ended on 19 July, that does not apply in Northern Ireland. Ministers have discussed the issue in recent days but they are moving more cautiously with lifting that rule. They did put in place an indicative date of 26 July, which would see face coverings no longer compulsory in places of worship or for students in school classrooms in the new term - but that has yet to be signed off by ministers. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered 'We've lost count of the performances postponed' Ministers are due to review the wearing face coverings in places of worship at next Thursday's executive meeting. Looking at ending the mandatory use of face coverings more widely is unlikely to be discussed by ministers until a meeting on 12 August. Masks have been legally required in Northern Ireland on public transport, in shops and in a range of other settings since last summer, with a limited number of exemptions. That is not entirely clear. Decisions on easing or imposing restrictions must be agreed by the five parties in the executive. They have to consider advice from health officials about the spread of the variant, as well as social and economic effects of restrictions on the public. The first and deputy first ministers have indicated that they will meet again on 12 August to look at lifting requirements for face coverings in other settings, the requirement for self-isolation and travel.

Stormont directed to set up abortion services in NI,"Abortion was decriminalised in 2019 in Northern Ireland, but full services have been stalled Westminster has directed Stormont's Department of Health to set up full abortion services in Northern Ireland by no later than next March. The government has intervened with a formal direction requiring Stormont to act. Changes to abortion laws took effect last year after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution. But the commissioning of services has been stalled due to disagreement within the five-party executive. In March, Mr Lewis tookunprecedented powersallowing him to direct Stormont to act, but he had not used them until now. Reaction to Westminster's abortion intervention Abortion law delays 'deeply troubling', court told The government had previously said it was required to uphold legal and human rights duties on Northern Ireland abortion services and would intervene if the delay at Stormont continued. Ina written statement to Parliament,external, Mr Lewis said he was issuing the direction to the Department of Health, Health Minister Robin Swann and to the Health and Social Care Board. He added that while he recognised the strain Covid-19 had placed on healthcare, he remained ""extremely disappointed"" that full commissioning proposals have not progressed. ""This ongoing stalemate leaves me no choice but to issue a direction,"" he said. ""I have a legal and moral obligation to ensure the women and girls in Northern Ireland are afforded their rights and can access the healthcare."" He also said he ""acknowledges and respects the deeply held views that individuals hold"" on abortion laws. ""However, it is the clear will of Parliament that the rights of women and girls in Northern Ireland are properly upheld."" Brandon Lewis said he had ""no choice"" but to intervene The secretary of state said he was also directing Stormont's first and deputy first ministers that ""once proposals are brought forward by the Department of Health, they must be included on the agenda"" at the next executive meeting. It is understood Mr Lewis has told the Stormont parties that he believes costs of the commissioned abortion services should be met by the executive through its block grant. The Department of Health and Executive Office have been asked for comment. This significant move is likely to face criticism from some of the parties in Northern Ireland, who accused Mr Lewis of breaching devolution when he initially intervened earlier this year. The details are set out in a written statement to Parliament but the Stormont parties have already been informed of the development. Abortion is a devolved matter, but services have not been fully set up as the parties in the executive remain deadlocked. The government has also directed that there should be ""immediate support"" for interim early medical abortion services in Northern Ireland. It's the second significant intervention by Brandon Lewis on Northern Ireland in just over a week. But unlike when the Stormont parties united against the proposals on legacy, there will be no unity this time. While some pro-choice parties say the government had no choice but to act due to delay and disagreement within the executive, others opposed to abortion say it amounts to a total override of devolution. The government has made clear it did not want to step in but given legal duties it also must uphold, its patience with Stormont had run out. This does not take the issues out of the parties' hands entirely though. Proposals for abortion services will still need to go to the five-party executive, where any substantive discussion is likely to lead to even more division. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the barrier to human rights had been ""overcome"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, DUP MP Carla Lockhart said abortion laws should be decided by Stormont. ""What we have in this statement from the secretary of state is a further example of a government acting with no respect to the local electorate and locally elected politicians. ""The DUP stand ready to find a locally agreed way forward. We urge all parties who sit with us in the Northern Ireland Executive to share this intent."" UUP leader Doug Beattie says abortion service provision has to happen Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said he believed the delivery of services ""absolutely will happen"". ""Abortion is legal in Northern Ireland and therefore we need to have the services to make sure that they can be delivered. ""The Ulster Unionist Party has a position of conscience on abortion but myself as an MLA (member of the NI Assembly), I think that we need to have safe abortion services for women here in Northern Ireland, and it needs to be delivered as soon as possible."" Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry said the intervention was ""upholding the law and human rights"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey said she looked forward ""to seeing the creation of a fully funded, stigma-free and safe abortion service"". Abortion laws changed in Northern Ireland in March 2020, allowing terminations to take place in some circumstances. According to the latest figures from Northern Ireland's Department of Health, 1,556 terminations have taken place in Northern Ireland since March 2020. But health trusts have been only carrying out limited services, meaning some women seeking an abortion beyond 10 weeks in their pregnancy have had to travel to Great Britain to access services. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland New abortion laws come into force in NI The Department of Health has maintained that the matter is ""controversial"" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive. In May, proposals from Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Health Minister Robin Swann on commissioning of abortion services were blocked from executive discussion by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The party is opposed to abortion and has previously criticised Mr Lewis for taking powers to act, saying it would have ""serious consequences for devolution"". Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance have said they would support the commissioning of services being imposed by Westminster, if it remains stalled by the executive.

What happens if I'm 'pinged'?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

LiveLiveRetailers warn of disruption amid record app alerts2 minutes ago,"A record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in week to 14 July Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi defended the figure, saying self-isolation was the second most important tool, after vaccines, for fighting Covid The food industry says rising numbers of self-isolating staff mean shops are facing serious challenges as they try to keep shelves stocked A list of workers able to skip self-isolation if fully vaccinated will be revealed later, Kwarteng says The Royal College of Nursing tells the BBC staff are ""angry"" and deserve a bigger increase Women quarantining in UK hotels will now have female guards, when possible, after allegations of sexual harassment The UK reports 39,906 new coronavirus cases and 84 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Lauren Turner We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day - thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of the latest Covid developments:  We will be back with more tomorrow. Our coverage today has been brought to you by Vanessa Barford, Francesca Gillett, Hamish Mackay, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and George Wright.  Many young adults are still to get their first vaccine - despite the fact all over-18s are now eligible - prompting calls for more to do so. Almost 90% of all UK adults have had a first dose and about 70% are fully vaccinated. But about 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - haven't been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. Under-30s only became eligible for the Covid vaccine in June. Half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to those in their 20s. The vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Read more here. Labour has said the government must produce a ""clear, unambiguous list"" of those workers who could avoid self-isolating. Shadow Business Minister Seema Malhotra said it made sense to exempt ""certain fully vaccinated professionals"" - like those in the emergency services -  from self-isolation rules through a targeted test scheme. However, she said the government had made a mess of its own policy and ""is undermining the effectiveness of the rule change"". ""If ministers don't know or can't decide what the plan is, how can employers possibly be expected to understand what's required of them?"" she added.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 The government is planning to lift the rule to self-isolate for people who are fully vaccinated on 16 August. Not everyone will be double-jabbed by then - especially younger people - so it means many people will still be required to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone with Covid. But Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, says ministers should bring forward this date. Two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had both jabs, he points out - and the Office for National Statistics antibody study found ""40-50%"" of un-vaccinated people were showing signs of having had the virus and so had a ""degree of immunity"". Prof Hunter told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: ""Given the damage this policy is doing, I can't see any public health reason why we shouldn't actually stop requiring quarantining of casual contacts. ""The emphasis is on casual. Clearly if your husband, partner or children you live with have Covid, then that's a totally different issue and I think we need to continue."" He added: ""If you haven't been vaccinated and you haven't had a double vaccine, then the risks are higher and I can see some value in continuing with (self-isolating)."" A family member visits his relative's grave at a cemetery for Covid victims in Jakarta The World Health Organization has urged Indonesia to retain existing Covid restrictions and even to expand them across the country, pointing to a steep rise in deaths and infections. The agency issued the warning two days after President Joko Widodo pledged to gradually ease the measures because of falling case numbers in some regions. But epidemiologists have questioned the Indonesian leader's plan, saying there's a lack of testing outside the capital, Jakarta. This week, daily deaths hit
record highs of more than 1,300 - among the highest tolls in the world. Indonesia's daily positivity rate, the proportion of people
tested who are infected, has averaged 30% over the past week
even as cases numbers have dropped. A level above 20% meant ""very
high"" transmissibility, the WHO said. ""Indonesia is currently facing a very high transmission
level, and it is indicative of the utmost importance of
implementing stringent public health and social measures,
especially movement restrictions, throughout the country,"" it
said. Earlier in the week, Indonesia's medical association said the healthcare system was at risk of collapse due to rising hospital admissions coupled with the deaths of medical staff due to Covid. This video can not be played Dawn Butler suspended from Commons for calling PM a liar Labour MP Dawn Butler has been ordered to leave the House of Commons for the rest of the day after she refused to withdraw accusations that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has lied during the pandemic. She said it was dangerous to lie during a pandemic and that Boris Johnson had ""lied to the House and the country over and over again"". Acting Deputy Speaker Judith Cummins asked the MP to ""reflect on her words and perhaps correct the record"". Ms Butler replied: ""At the end of the day, the prime minister has lied to this House time and time again and it's funny that we get in trouble in this place for calling out the lie, rather than the person lying"". The acting deputy speaker again asked the MP to withdraw her remarks but she replied: ""I have reflected on my words and somebody needs to tell the truth in this House that the prime minister has lied"". It is considered not within the boundaries of parliamentary etiquette to call another member a liar. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Just shy of
40,000 new infections have been confirmed in the UK governmentâs daily Covid
update. That is significant â it is the first time since the rise in infection
rates took off that we have seen a dip in cases compared to the same day a week
ago. Last Thursday 48,500 cases were reported. We should be
careful about reading too much into this. It is just one day and the impact of
the lifting of most restrictions in England and Scotland on 19 July has yet to
take effect. But
nonetheless it offers further evidence that cases will peak somewhere around
the expected levels as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by natural
infection and vaccination. The hope of
government scientists was always that by this stage we would be seeing the
first signs of a plateau. In recent weeks infection rates have not been growing
as quickly as they were at the end of June. And now we
have the first sign that growth may have stopped. We should expect that to be
temporary. The modelling suggests we will soon get a further rise from the 19
July relaxing and further mixing that ensues. But it is at
least a tiny sign that this summer wave could be tamed, before there is a threat
of the NHS being overwhelmed to the extent that restrictions may have to be
reintroduced. A fresh wave of Covid could pose a risk to the euro zone's economic recovery, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said. Her warning comes after the bank hinted at an even longer period of monetary support. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is becoming dominant in Europe, leading to a surge in cases in many countries. ""The reopening of large parts of the economy is supporting a
vigorous bounce-back in the services sector,"" said Lagarde. ""But the Delta
variant of the coronavirus could dampen this recovery in
services, especially in tourism and hospitality."" She added that ECB forecasts from June had included an assumption that some measures
to contain the pandemic would continue through the third and
fourth quarters of this year. A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk. From Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. Ministers will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen. If given the go-ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately. The executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to 10 people, from no more than three households. A decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting. Read more here. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson has said there is no need for the public to be stockpiling due to fears that firms could grind to a halt because of the high numbers of staff isolating. ""I don't think there's any need for members of the public to be stockpiling what they buy. There's plenty of food in the country,"" Dickinson said. ""What we're seeing is pockets of issues in specific places where case numbers are particularly high and the most important thing is that the government acts now before the situation does get more serious, so that we don't see more empty shelves in more places."" Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. Read more here:Supermarkets say shortages are not widespread We have a bit more from thegovernment coronavirus figures,external. They show a total of 325,223 people tested positive for coronavirus in the last seven days, up 63,391 - or 24.2% - on the week before. Meanwhile, 387 people have died within 28 days of a positive test in the last week, up by 130 - or 50.6% - on the previous seven days. The UK has reported 39,906 new positive Covid cases in the last 24 hours. And there have been 84 further deaths, within 28 days of a positive test. Katharine Da CostaBBC health correspondent Covid infections among people aged 20-29 are at the highest level on record across any age group since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Public Health England. In the week to 18 July, the seven-day case rate among this age group was 1154.7 per 100,000 population. The lowest case rates were in people aged 80 and above, with a seven-day rate of 60.6 per 100,000 population. Cases have increased across all regions in England with the highest seven-day average in the North East at 951.7 per 100,000 people compared to the lowest at 423.1 in the South East. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, urged everyone in their 20s to come forward for two doses of the vaccine. âIt is vital we all remain cautious,"" she said. ""Remember that meeting outside is safer than inside, get two doses of the vaccine as soon as you can, isolate if you are told to by NHS Test and Trace and if you show symptoms stay home and get a PCR test. ""We all still have a part to play, Covid-19 has not gone away. âThanks to the vaccine, hospital admissions and deaths are not growing as quickly as previous waves. However, they are on the rise and we continue to closely monitor the data.â Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government risks ""losing social consent"" for isolation if it does not immediately bring forward the relaxation of quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated. It comes after a record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 14 July. Hunt, a Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee, said ministers must bring forward the scheduled end of isolation for all fully vaccinated contacts who test negative from 16 August. Without ending that requirement and replacing it with testing ""we risk losing social consent for this very, very important weapon against the virus"", he said. Self-isolation is still one of the main tools being used to try and stop Covid spreading. At the moment, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you have symptoms, test positive for Covid, live with someone who tests positive or has symptoms, or are told to isolate by contact-tracers. You must also isolate if you arrive in the UK from a red list country, or from an amber list country and are not fully vaccinated. If you are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app saying you have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus, you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work,even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. However, the UK government has not yet confirmed which workers are included in this exemption. A list is expected to be published later today. BBC Radio 5 Live The owner of a chain of cocktail bars says he had to close one of them because staff left their phones together - and they were all pinged by the NHS Covid app. Martin Greenhow runs Mojo, which has branches in Leeds, Harrogate, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester. He tells Radio 5 Live how the Liverpool bar had to shut for a week after every member of staff was alerted by the NHS app and asked to self-isolate. The closure has cost him tens of thousands of pounds. âWe test all our staff on a daily basis,"" he says. ""I donât instruct them to ignore the ping, I give them the option. Itâs at their discretion. ""We will be as altruistic as we can, but fundamentally if a business runs out of money it runs out of all opportunity to do that. âWe ask them to behave in a grown-up, adult manner, which I think the government should expect the entire country to do and stop trying to nanny them.â He adds his business is also being affected by staff shortages in the supply chain, which he says are ""bringing the country to a grinding halt"". Athletes have already arrived in Tokyo for the Olympics With the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics due to start on
Friday, more than 80 people associated with the Games have tested positive. The head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has not
ruled out cancelling the games in the light of rising infections. The BBC Reality Check team has been looking into whether Japan has
Covid under control. You can read what they found here. First Covid vaccination doses are now being offered
without an appointment on the Isle of Man. The first of three walk-in clinics is open between 09:00 and
12:00 BST at the Douglas vaccination hub. A government spokesman said doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca
jab would be offered to anyone aged 18 and over on a ""first-come, first-served basis"". About 89% of adults on the island have already received
their first jab, while about 78% have now been given both. Read more

Ethirajan AnbarasanAnbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia editor, BBC World Service Tax officials in India have raided the offices of a prominent newspaper group, Dainik Bhaskar, which has often challenged the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities say they are investigating alleged tax evasion. The Press Club of India says it deplores such intimidation and calls the raid an attempt to deter the independent media. Dainik Bhaskar publishes newspapers in Hindi and several other Indian languages across a dozen states. The editor of the group says staff members' mobile phones were seized when the tax authorities raided several locations. In the past few months, it carried a series of reports on the devastation caused by the pandemic.  The publication repeatedly questioned the government's Covid death statistics, and reported that the corpses of suspected coronavirus victims were floating in the river Ganges. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long been accused of attempting to stifle critical reporting, an accusation it denies. More than a third of a police force's control room staff are off work because they either have Covid-19 or have been told to self-isolate. Dorset Police said it came at a time when 999 calls had increased 21% since last week and 101 calls were up by 11%. A spokesperson said many of those affected were able to work from home and respond to non-urgent calls. But they said callers to 101 ""may have to wait some time"" to speak to someone as 999 calls were being prioritised. About 35% of control room staff are not working due to the issues. The BBC has asked the force how many workers that equates to. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"More than 600,000 people told to isolate by app last week","More than 600,000 people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales were sent self-isolation alerts in the week between 8 and 15 July. Data shows 618,903 alerts were sent - a 17% rise from the previous week. There are complaints from businesses that the alerts are causing serious staff shortages and affecting services. However some fully-vaccinated key workers will be exempt from self-isolating if they are pinged by the app as a close contact of a positive case. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC a âvery narrowâ list of jobs would be released today. Self-isolation for all fully-vaccinated people pinged by the app as close contacts is due to be scrapped by 16 August, although there are calls for this deadline to be brought forward. The app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the Test and Trace team. Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? ""If you are pinged, you should self-isolate. I know it poses challenges, and we are seeing reports of shortages which we are monitoring, but the rules are clear and I think they should be followed,"" Mr Kwarteng told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4. Latest government figures show there are a further 44,104 daily coronavirus cases in the UK, with 73 coronavirus-related deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned cases could rise even more this week, as most legal restrictions have ended in England. His spokesman said that the app was doing ""what it's designed to do"". ""We're aware of the impact on some industries and services and working closely with them particularly food and supermarketsâ¦.we have a robust and resilient food supply chain."" Butsupermarkets have warnedthey may have product shortages due to staff self-isolating. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. However, Iceland urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. Meanwhile,dozens of councils have suspended bin collectionsdue to staff shortages from isolation and fuel provider BP has temporarily closed ""a handful of sites"" due to Covid staff absences. In England 607,486 alerts were sent to app users in the period between 8 and 15 July, with a further 11,417 sent in Wales. There were fewer app pings per case in England during this period, with 2.8 pings issued per every reported coronavirus case. An average of 3.2 pings were sent per case reported in the last month. Scotland's app has issued fewer than 60,000 notification ""pings""since it launched in September 2020. Another record then for the number of people pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app and sent into isolation. For businesses struggling to deal with the impact on their employees this will be more evidence that a different approach is needed. The fact that the number of pings did not rise even more sharply in a week when case numbers were accelerating, may be an indication that some people have deleted the app, although we have to be cautious about extrapolating too much from one week's figures. Its defenders point out that many of the complaints about the app concern wider health policy rather than the tech itself - the fact that people  who may have been in contact with the virus are being told to isolate even if they are fully vaccinated is a policy applying to traditional Test and Trace too, and won't change until August 16th. One man, who was heavily involved in the design of the app, told me people didn't realise that it worked on a number of levels - ""even if someone ignores the message to self-isolate, telling them they have been exposed to the virus is likely to make them behave more cautiously."" He also said that while the anonymous nature of the app meant only limited data could be extracted from it, there was useful and early information for epidemiologists about the spread of the virus and the R rate. The government still insists the app is doing the job for which it was designed - but there will be mounting pressure from industry for a more rapid change to allow people who are pinged to be tested rather than to isolate. When the new health secretary Sajid Javid replaced Matt Hancock, there were reports that he wanted the app's sensitivity tweaked so that it sent out fewer alerts. But that appears to be off the agenda for the moment, with the Department of Health insisting there are no immediate plans for any changes. Downloads of the app continued to rise to 26,826,748 from 26,523,853 the previous week. The BBC understands there is no way to know if the app has been deleted, but #DeleteTheApp has been trending on Twitter today. A recent poll by YouGov suggested that one in ten users have deleted the app, having previously installed it. Those aged between 18 and 24 were most likely to have deleted the app, after installing it, according to the data. People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days. In this same week to 14 July, 259,265 people in England tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 33% from the previous week. NHS Test and Trace said it was the highest weekly number of people testing positive since January. The service said it had identified 475,465 people as close contacts of somebody who had a positive coronavirus result, and had been able to contact 94% of them NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA officials giving update on wildfires as firefighters struggle to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"'We sold up, moved to the sea and are living the Zoom dream'","It was three in the morning when Sam Lancaster found her family's new Yorkshire home by the sea. ""I don't even know what brought Scarborough into my head. I just googled it,"" she says. It was house-love at first sight. But there was another key piece of information. Her husband Craig had been told by his employer, a major telecoms firm, that he could work - indefinitely - from home. Sam and Craig and their two daughters really could live anywhere - including the seaside. The Lancasters say they had ""outgrown"" their home in Thatcham, Berkshire, not far from Craig's office in Newbury. And no longer constrained by the geography of a daily commute, they started looking for better value houses in other parts of the country. Now they're unpacking boxes in a big, rambling home on the North Yorkshire coast, with the sea a blue horizon out the back window. In this week's picture-postcard sunshine, they've been swimming in the sea most days. ""It's a no-brainer. It feels so right,"" says 41-year-old Sam, convinced her family's migration 230 miles north, as the gull flies, is going to be part of a bigger trend. ""If you can work from home, why wouldn't you move?"" she says, swatting away any doubts. Craig, whose IT job supports network operations, says a trip to Screwfix turned into a nature trek. ""We saw seals swimming in the sea and puffins. You wouldn't see that in Thatcham."" ""Just look out the window. There are lovely walks, people have been welcoming, the girls can go down to the beach,"" says Sam. She's in a mover's honeymoon where everything still feels like a holiday, even though she says some of the locals are more likely to ""slag off the town"". Some of their old friends also thought they were crazy for uprooting. Sam says they quietly asked her whether she thought it was a rash decision. But there was another piece of rocket fuel for this life change. The awfulness of the pandemic made her think there was no point in hesitating. She had ""gone off"" their old area. Here was a chance to reinvent their lives. ""I would never have done this without the pandemic,"" she says. She worked as a teaching assistant before and might return to that later. But nothing was going to hold her back. It will mean new schools for Sophie aged 15, and Olivia, eight, and making new friends for parents and children. But they seem unfazed and confident about a fresh start. ""Life is so short,"" says Sam. The Lancasters could be part of a changing tide. The big beaches and widescreen skies have always made seaside towns seductive, but they can be slow to reach. Coastal transport can have more dodgy links than a crazy golf course. Will remote working make the coast a practical option? Will people start moving to Zoomtown-on-Sea? And could this revitalise fading seaside towns? Figures up to June 2021 from the Rightmove property network showed a 115% increase in enquiries about moving from cities to a seaside town, compared with before the pandemic. These are people viewing properties and getting information, not completing sales. But Tim Bannister, director of property data, says: ""It's a really strong indicator, a window into what's happening."" There has also been a shift from most city dwellers looking to move. Before the pandemic they were looking for properties in the same city. Now, most are looking elsewhere. It's an out-of-city trend that applies to London, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester. The rise of hybrid working is a big factor, according to estate agents. ""People are reassessing their lives,"" says Phil Fletcher, of CPH estate agents in Scarborough. He also wants the town to reassess its relationship with seagulls, which have just caused a leak in his ceiling. He says people who have had tough experiences in the pandemic are now making big choices about their relationships, their jobs and where they live. ""People are sitting up and thinking: 'Live for the day.'"" Coastal towns, like sea views, are always changing. Where his estate agency now stands was the site of the Theatre Royal, when Scarborough was an entertainment capital. The idea of remote workers moving to cheaper, characterful Victorian houses in Scarborough is not future-gazing for him: ""I can see it already happening."" But seaside towns can have a Jekyll and Hyde character. On a sunny day Scarborough looks irresistible. Families are outside ice-cream coloured chalets, one with a placard saying: ""Be Nice or Go Home."" Boats are running trips to see dolphins off the coast. Holidaymakers are shielding their chips from dive-bombing seagulls. It's not just the memorial plaques on seafront benches that prove how much people love to sit and look at the sea. Environmental psychologist Michelle Tester-Jones, at the University of Exeter, is part of a research project which has found ""consistent evidence that spending time near 'blue spaces' seems to be good for well-being"", including helping with ""anxiety and low mood"". But take a short walk from Scarborough's seafront and there are boarded up shops on the High Street, like teeth missing in a smile. The Christmas bargain store is still promising presents in July. A food bank collection point stands in the locked-up entrance to Debenhams. The town has immense natural beauty and handsome old buildings, but deprivation - in income, health and education - runs through Scarborough like a stick of rock. It's a low-income economy with many jobs relying on summer tourism. Male life expectancy has been going into reverse. ""It's a town of two cities - of bizarre contrasts,"" says Andrew Clay, director of Scarborough Museums Trust. ""We have wealth and successful businesses,"" with a legacy of great architecture and spectacular views, he says. ""But some of the areas here are some of the UK's most depressed - in terms of social deprivation, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, hard-to-reach communities. There's an issue with aspiration in the town,"" he says. This mix of light and shade has always been there, perhaps. Mr Clay is speaking in a wood-panelled room in what was once the home of the aristocratic Sitwell family. Edward VII stayed a couple of doors down, when Scarborough was a royal playground. Until he caught typhoid. The wheel will turn again, and Scarborough will find new ways to appeal to a wider and wealthier range of people, says Mr Clay. That's if it upgrades its facilities, like getting a multiplex cinema and making better use of its cultural heritage. ""It's a town that has always reinvented itself,"" he says. Seaside towns can be like those distorting mirrors in funfairs. Posters of Scarborough from the 1920s and 1930s show glamorous couples in sleek cars and speed boats, with the bays and sandy beaches looking like the south of France. What you see depends on your perspective. Liz Colling, Scarborough's councillor in charge of inclusive growth, wants the town's next reinvention to be about revitalising the local economy, including encouraging more digital jobs. It's a ""very realistic ambition"" which is already beginning to happen, she says. ""I have a nephew who has just started a job remotely. He would never have applied before because it's based in London,"" says Cllr Colling, adding that her son is also working remotely. ""Historically our younger people have left town to pursue education and jobs, but this is a sign that you can still stay here and have a really good career,"" she says. Local digital marketing firm, Digital Zest, has had a boom time during the lockdown, with so much going online. Managing director Paul Taylor expects more people to come and work remotely, because of the quality of life and being able to go straight from desk to beach. But even the digital world needs to travel - and he wants improvements to road and transport connections. How Scarborough appealed to upmarket tourists in 1930 Scarborough, one of the ""left-behind towns"", is getting more than Â£20m ""levelling-up"" funding. But it raises the question of what such labels mean, because the town has little of the graffiti, grime or street-begging in a ""richer"" place such as London. The real difference is in the jobs market - and it's why the arrival of Zoom workers is significant. It's a town with very few professional jobs. It has half the average for the Yorkshire and Humber region, and below a third of a resort such as Brighton. For civil service jobs, Scarborough has only a fifth of the national average. It also struggles to attract people to stay in such professional jobs - for instance the town has been blighted with problems in recruiting NHS dentists. Parents have had totake their children to other towns to find a dentist. Timo Hannay, a data analyst who hasresearched the struggles of coastal communities,externaland who advises policymakers, says Scarborough has many of the problems typical of seaside towns - but to a slightly greater degree. We'll keep being fascinated by these towns, he says, because the seaside carries such a strong sense of Britain's changing identity - both in its ""self-assurance and self-doubt"". What can get overlooked about Zoom-working is the long-term change for remote workers themselves. Craig Lancaster is 52. He could spend the rest of his working life alone at home with his multiple computer screens. ""I do miss the interaction, that's the one thing work-wise. I don't think it's as personable as being in the office face-to-face,"" he says. No-one else at home will want to obsess about office politics, there are no workmates to meet over coffee. But for Craig, the positives of a better work-life balance outweigh any drawbacks. ""Work is changing. Productivity has gone up with people working from home. Businesses have realised that trusting their employees means they're saving money, they're not having to pay for buildings."" Seaside towns have often been defined by what they used to be. In Scarborough you can almost hear the ghosts of old comedians and imagine the big summer crowds filling huge Victorian hotels, which have become cliff faces for nesting seagulls. Could it be that the unexpected opportunities afforded by the pandemic will see flocks of a different sort descend on the town? In a series of special reports BBC News has been looking at the challenges and opportunities in seaside towns such as Scarborough.

Here is a round-up of the latest Covid developments:  We will be back with more tomorrow. Our coverage today has been brought to you by Vanessa Barford, Francesca Gillett, Hamish Mackay, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and George Wright.  Many young adults are still to get their first vaccine - despite the fact all over-18s are now eligible - prompting calls for more to do so. Almost 90% of all UK adults have had a first dose and about 70% are fully vaccinated. But about 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - haven't been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. Under-30s only became eligible for the Covid vaccine in June. Half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to those in their 20s. The vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Read more here. Labour has said the government must produce a ""clear, unambiguous list"" of those workers who could avoid self-isolating. Shadow Business Minister Seema Malhotra said it made sense to exempt ""certain fully vaccinated professionals"" - like those in the emergency services -  from self-isolation rules through a targeted test scheme. However, she said the government had made a mess of its own policy and ""is undermining the effectiveness of the rule change"". ""If ministers don't know or can't decide what the plan is, how can employers possibly be expected to understand what's required of them?"" she added.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 The government is planning to lift the rule to self-isolate for people who are fully vaccinated on 16 August. Not everyone will be double-jabbed by then - especially younger people - so it means many people will still be required to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone with Covid. But Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, says ministers should bring forward this date. Two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had both jabs, he points out - and the Office for National Statistics antibody study found ""40-50%"" of un-vaccinated people were showing signs of having had the virus and so had a ""degree of immunity"". Prof Hunter told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: ""Given the damage this policy is doing, I can't see any public health reason why we shouldn't actually stop requiring quarantining of casual contacts. ""The emphasis is on casual. Clearly if your husband, partner or children you live with have Covid, then that's a totally different issue and I think we need to continue."" He added: ""If you haven't been vaccinated and you haven't had a double vaccine, then the risks are higher and I can see some value in continuing with (self-isolating)."" A family member visits his relative's grave at a cemetery for Covid victims in Jakarta The World Health Organization has urged Indonesia to retain existing Covid restrictions and even to expand them across the country, pointing to a steep rise in deaths and infections. The agency issued the warning two days after President Joko Widodo pledged to gradually ease the measures because of falling case numbers in some regions. But epidemiologists have questioned the Indonesian leader's plan, saying there's a lack of testing outside the capital, Jakarta. This week, daily deaths hit
record highs of more than 1,300 - among the highest tolls in the world. Indonesia's daily positivity rate, the proportion of people
tested who are infected, has averaged 30% over the past week
even as cases numbers have dropped. A level above 20% meant ""very
high"" transmissibility, the WHO said. ""Indonesia is currently facing a very high transmission
level, and it is indicative of the utmost importance of
implementing stringent public health and social measures,
especially movement restrictions, throughout the country,"" it
said. Earlier in the week, Indonesia's medical association said the healthcare system was at risk of collapse due to rising hospital admissions coupled with the deaths of medical staff due to Covid. This video can not be played Dawn Butler suspended from Commons for calling PM a liar Labour MP Dawn Butler has been ordered to leave the House of Commons for the rest of the day after she refused to withdraw accusations that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has lied during the pandemic. She said it was dangerous to lie during a pandemic and that Boris Johnson had ""lied to the House and the country over and over again"". Acting Deputy Speaker Judith Cummins asked the MP to ""reflect on her words and perhaps correct the record"". Ms Butler replied: ""At the end of the day, the prime minister has lied to this House time and time again and it's funny that we get in trouble in this place for calling out the lie, rather than the person lying"". The acting deputy speaker again asked the MP to withdraw her remarks but she replied: ""I have reflected on my words and somebody needs to tell the truth in this House that the prime minister has lied"". It is considered not within the boundaries of parliamentary etiquette to call another member a liar. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Just shy of
40,000 new infections have been confirmed in the UK governmentâs daily Covid
update. That is significant â it is the first time since the rise in infection
rates took off that we have seen a dip in cases compared to the same day a week
ago. Last Thursday 48,500 cases were reported. We should be
careful about reading too much into this. It is just one day and the impact of
the lifting of most restrictions in England and Scotland on 19 July has yet to
take effect. But
nonetheless it offers further evidence that cases will peak somewhere around
the expected levels as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by natural
infection and vaccination. The hope of
government scientists was always that by this stage we would be seeing the
first signs of a plateau. In recent weeks infection rates have not been growing
as quickly as they were at the end of June. And now we
have the first sign that growth may have stopped. We should expect that to be
temporary. The modelling suggests we will soon get a further rise from the 19
July relaxing and further mixing that ensues. But it is at
least a tiny sign that this summer wave could be tamed, before there is a threat
of the NHS being overwhelmed to the extent that restrictions may have to be
reintroduced. A fresh wave of Covid could pose a risk to the euro zone's economic recovery, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said. Her warning comes after the bank hinted at an even longer period of monetary support. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is becoming dominant in Europe, leading to a surge in cases in many countries. ""The reopening of large parts of the economy is supporting a
vigorous bounce-back in the services sector,"" said Lagarde. ""But the Delta
variant of the coronavirus could dampen this recovery in
services, especially in tourism and hospitality."" She added that ECB forecasts from June had included an assumption that some measures
to contain the pandemic would continue through the third and
fourth quarters of this year. A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk. From Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. Ministers will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen. If given the go-ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately. The executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to 10 people, from no more than three households. A decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting. Read more here. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson has said there is no need for the public to be stockpiling due to fears that firms could grind to a halt because of the high numbers of staff isolating. ""I don't think there's any need for members of the public to be stockpiling what they buy. There's plenty of food in the country,"" Dickinson said. ""What we're seeing is pockets of issues in specific places where case numbers are particularly high and the most important thing is that the government acts now before the situation does get more serious, so that we don't see more empty shelves in more places."" Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. Read more here:Supermarkets say shortages are not widespread We have a bit more from thegovernment coronavirus figures,external. They show a total of 325,223 people tested positive for coronavirus in the last seven days, up 63,391 - or 24.2% - on the week before. Meanwhile, 387 people have died within 28 days of a positive test in the last week, up by 130 - or 50.6% - on the previous seven days. The UK has reported 39,906 new positive Covid cases in the last 24 hours. And there have been 84 further deaths, within 28 days of a positive test. Katharine Da CostaBBC health correspondent Covid infections among people aged 20-29 are at the highest level on record across any age group since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Public Health England. In the week to 18 July, the seven-day case rate among this age group was 1154.7 per 100,000 population. The lowest case rates were in people aged 80 and above, with a seven-day rate of 60.6 per 100,000 population. Cases have increased across all regions in England with the highest seven-day average in the North East at 951.7 per 100,000 people compared to the lowest at 423.1 in the South East. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, urged everyone in their 20s to come forward for two doses of the vaccine. âIt is vital we all remain cautious,"" she said. ""Remember that meeting outside is safer than inside, get two doses of the vaccine as soon as you can, isolate if you are told to by NHS Test and Trace and if you show symptoms stay home and get a PCR test. ""We all still have a part to play, Covid-19 has not gone away. âThanks to the vaccine, hospital admissions and deaths are not growing as quickly as previous waves. However, they are on the rise and we continue to closely monitor the data.â Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government risks ""losing social consent"" for isolation if it does not immediately bring forward the relaxation of quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated. It comes after a record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 14 July. Hunt, a Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee, said ministers must bring forward the scheduled end of isolation for all fully vaccinated contacts who test negative from 16 August. Without ending that requirement and replacing it with testing ""we risk losing social consent for this very, very important weapon against the virus"", he said. Self-isolation is still one of the main tools being used to try and stop Covid spreading. At the moment, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you have symptoms, test positive for Covid, live with someone who tests positive or has symptoms, or are told to isolate by contact-tracers. You must also isolate if you arrive in the UK from a red list country, or from an amber list country and are not fully vaccinated. If you are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app saying you have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus, you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work,even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. However, the UK government has not yet confirmed which workers are included in this exemption. A list is expected to be published later today. BBC Radio 5 Live The owner of a chain of cocktail bars says he had to close one of them because staff left their phones together - and they were all pinged by the NHS Covid app. Martin Greenhow runs Mojo, which has branches in Leeds, Harrogate, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester. He tells Radio 5 Live how the Liverpool bar had to shut for a week after every member of staff was alerted by the NHS app and asked to self-isolate. The closure has cost him tens of thousands of pounds. âWe test all our staff on a daily basis,"" he says. ""I donât instruct them to ignore the ping, I give them the option. Itâs at their discretion. ""We will be as altruistic as we can, but fundamentally if a business runs out of money it runs out of all opportunity to do that. âWe ask them to behave in a grown-up, adult manner, which I think the government should expect the entire country to do and stop trying to nanny them.â He adds his business is also being affected by staff shortages in the supply chain, which he says are ""bringing the country to a grinding halt"". Athletes have already arrived in Tokyo for the Olympics With the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics due to start on
Friday, more than 80 people associated with the Games have tested positive. The head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has not
ruled out cancelling the games in the light of rising infections. The BBC Reality Check team has been looking into whether Japan has
Covid under control. You can read what they found here. First Covid vaccination doses are now being offered
without an appointment on the Isle of Man. The first of three walk-in clinics is open between 09:00 and
12:00 BST at the Douglas vaccination hub. A government spokesman said doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca
jab would be offered to anyone aged 18 and over on a ""first-come, first-served basis"". About 89% of adults on the island have already received
their first jab, while about 78% have now been given both. Read more

Ethirajan AnbarasanAnbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia editor, BBC World Service Tax officials in India have raided the offices of a prominent newspaper group, Dainik Bhaskar, which has often challenged the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities say they are investigating alleged tax evasion. The Press Club of India says it deplores such intimidation and calls the raid an attempt to deter the independent media. Dainik Bhaskar publishes newspapers in Hindi and several other Indian languages across a dozen states. The editor of the group says staff members' mobile phones were seized when the tax authorities raided several locations. In the past few months, it carried a series of reports on the devastation caused by the pandemic.  The publication repeatedly questioned the government's Covid death statistics, and reported that the corpses of suspected coronavirus victims were floating in the river Ganges. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long been accused of attempting to stifle critical reporting, an accusation it denies. More than a third of a police force's control room staff are off work because they either have Covid-19 or have been told to self-isolate. Dorset Police said it came at a time when 999 calls had increased 21% since last week and 101 calls were up by 11%. A spokesperson said many of those affected were able to work from home and respond to non-urgent calls. But they said callers to 101 ""may have to wait some time"" to speak to someone as 999 calls were being prioritised. About 35% of control room staff are not working due to the issues. The BBC has asked the force how many workers that equates to. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"More than 600,000 people told to isolate by app last week618,903 people in England and Wales received self-isolation alerts in the week up to 14 July","More than 600,000 people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales were sent self-isolation alerts in the week between 8 and 15 July. Data shows 618,903 alerts were sent - a 17% rise from the previous week. There are complaints from businesses that the alerts are causing serious staff shortages and affecting services. However some fully-vaccinated key workers will be exempt from self-isolating if they are pinged by the app as a close contact of a positive case. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC a âvery narrowâ list of jobs would be released today. Self-isolation for all fully-vaccinated people pinged by the app as close contacts is due to be scrapped by 16 August, although there are calls for this deadline to be brought forward. The app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the Test and Trace team. Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? ""If you are pinged, you should self-isolate. I know it poses challenges, and we are seeing reports of shortages which we are monitoring, but the rules are clear and I think they should be followed,"" Mr Kwarteng told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4. Latest government figures show there are a further 44,104 daily coronavirus cases in the UK, with 73 coronavirus-related deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned cases could rise even more this week, as most legal restrictions have ended in England. His spokesman said that the app was doing ""what it's designed to do"". ""We're aware of the impact on some industries and services and working closely with them particularly food and supermarketsâ¦.we have a robust and resilient food supply chain."" Butsupermarkets have warnedthey may have product shortages due to staff self-isolating. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. However, Iceland urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. Meanwhile,dozens of councils have suspended bin collectionsdue to staff shortages from isolation and fuel provider BP has temporarily closed ""a handful of sites"" due to Covid staff absences. In England 607,486 alerts were sent to app users in the period between 8 and 15 July, with a further 11,417 sent in Wales. There were fewer app pings per case in England during this period, with 2.8 pings issued per every reported coronavirus case. An average of 3.2 pings were sent per case reported in the last month. Scotland's app has issued fewer than 60,000 notification ""pings""since it launched in September 2020. Another record then for the number of people pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app and sent into isolation. For businesses struggling to deal with the impact on their employees this will be more evidence that a different approach is needed. The fact that the number of pings did not rise even more sharply in a week when case numbers were accelerating, may be an indication that some people have deleted the app, although we have to be cautious about extrapolating too much from one week's figures. Its defenders point out that many of the complaints about the app concern wider health policy rather than the tech itself - the fact that people  who may have been in contact with the virus are being told to isolate even if they are fully vaccinated is a policy applying to traditional Test and Trace too, and won't change until August 16th. One man, who was heavily involved in the design of the app, told me people didn't realise that it worked on a number of levels - ""even if someone ignores the message to self-isolate, telling them they have been exposed to the virus is likely to make them behave more cautiously."" He also said that while the anonymous nature of the app meant only limited data could be extracted from it, there was useful and early information for epidemiologists about the spread of the virus and the R rate. The government still insists the app is doing the job for which it was designed - but there will be mounting pressure from industry for a more rapid change to allow people who are pinged to be tested rather than to isolate. When the new health secretary Sajid Javid replaced Matt Hancock, there were reports that he wanted the app's sensitivity tweaked so that it sent out fewer alerts. But that appears to be off the agenda for the moment, with the Department of Health insisting there are no immediate plans for any changes. Downloads of the app continued to rise to 26,826,748 from 26,523,853 the previous week. The BBC understands there is no way to know if the app has been deleted, but #DeleteTheApp has been trending on Twitter today. A recent poll by YouGov suggested that one in ten users have deleted the app, having previously installed it. Those aged between 18 and 24 were most likely to have deleted the app, after installing it, according to the data. People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days. In this same week to 14 July, 259,265 people in England tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 33% from the previous week. NHS Test and Trace said it was the highest weekly number of people testing positive since January. The service said it had identified 475,465 people as close contacts of somebody who had a positive coronavirus result, and had been able to contact 94% of them NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA officials giving update on wildfires as firefighters struggle to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Many young adults are still to get their first vaccine - despite the fact all over-18s are now eligible - prompting calls for more to do so. Almost 90% of all UK adults have had a first dose and about 70% are fully vaccinated. But about 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - haven't been vaccinated at all.

The UK has reported 39,906 new positive Covid cases in the last 24 hours. And there have been 84 further deaths, within 28 days of a positive test. Katharine Da CostaBBC health correspondent Covid infections among people aged 20-29 are at the highest level on record across any age group since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Public Health England. In the week to 18 July, the seven-day case rate among this age group was 1154.7 per 100,000 population. The lowest case rates were in people aged 80 and above, with a seven-day rate of 60.6 per 100,000 population. Cases have increased across all regions in England with the highest seven-day average in the North East at 951.7 per 100,000 people compared to the lowest at 423.1 in the South East. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, urged everyone in their 20s to come forward for two doses of the vaccine. âIt is vital we all remain cautious,"" she said. ""Remember that meeting outside is safer than inside, get two doses of the vaccine as soon as you can, isolate if you are told to by NHS Test and Trace and if you show symptoms stay home and get a PCR test. ""We all still have a part to play, Covid-19 has not gone away. âThanks to the vaccine, hospital admissions and deaths are not growing as quickly as previous waves. However, they are on the rise and we continue to closely monitor the data.â Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government risks ""losing social consent"" for isolation if it does not immediately bring forward the relaxation of quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated. It comes after a record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 14 July. Hunt, a Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee, said ministers must bring forward the scheduled end of isolation for all fully vaccinated contacts who test negative from 16 August. Without ending that requirement and replacing it with testing ""we risk losing social consent for this very, very important weapon against the virus"", he said. Self-isolation is still one of the main tools being used to try and stop Covid spreading. At the moment, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you have symptoms, test positive for Covid, live with someone who tests positive or has symptoms, or are told to isolate by contact-tracers. You must also isolate if you arrive in the UK from a red list country, or from an amber list country and are not fully vaccinated. If you are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app saying you have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus, you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work,even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. However, the UK government has not yet confirmed which workers are included in this exemption. A list is expected to be published later today. BBC Radio 5 Live The owner of a chain of cocktail bars says he had to close one of them because staff left their phones together - and they were all pinged by the NHS Covid app. Martin Greenhow runs Mojo, which has branches in Leeds, Harrogate, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester. He tells Radio 5 Live how the Liverpool bar had to shut for a week after every member of staff was alerted by the NHS app and asked to self-isolate. The closure has cost him tens of thousands of pounds. âWe test all our staff on a daily basis,"" he says. ""I donât instruct them to ignore the ping, I give them the option. Itâs at their discretion. ""We will be as altruistic as we can, but fundamentally if a business runs out of money it runs out of all opportunity to do that. âWe ask them to behave in a grown-up, adult manner, which I think the government should expect the entire country to do and stop trying to nanny them.â He adds his business is also being affected by staff shortages in the supply chain, which he says are ""bringing the country to a grinding halt"".

Ethirajan AnbarasanAnbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia editor, BBC World Service Tax officials in India have raided the offices of a prominent newspaper group, Dainik Bhaskar, which has often challenged the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities say they are investigating alleged tax evasion. The Press Club of India says it deplores such intimidation and calls the raid an attempt to deter the independent media. Dainik Bhaskar publishes newspapers in Hindi and several other Indian languages across a dozen states. The editor of the group says staff members' mobile phones were seized when the tax authorities raided several locations. In the past few months, it carried a series of reports on the devastation caused by the pandemic.  The publication repeatedly questioned the government's Covid death statistics, and reported that the corpses of suspected coronavirus victims were floating in the river Ganges. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long been accused of attempting to stifle critical reporting, an accusation it denies. More than a third of a police force's control room staff are off work because they either have Covid-19 or have been told to self-isolate. Dorset Police said it came at a time when 999 calls had increased 21% since last week and 101 calls were up by 11%. A spokesperson said many of those affected were able to work from home and respond to non-urgent calls. But they said callers to 101 ""may have to wait some time"" to speak to someone as 999 calls were being prioritised. About 35% of control room staff are not working due to the issues.

NHS waiting lists reach record high in Wales,"Wales' health minister has unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment Average waiting times at emergency departments are the longest they have been in nine years, the latest figures show. The Welsh Ambulance Trust also received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. More than 600,000 patients are waiting for treatment in Wales after record backlogs during the pandemic. It comes as Wales' health minister pledged to ""transform"" the delivery of urgent care. Eluned Morgan unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment. It includes annual funding of Â£25m to ""support people to access the right care in the right place"". The strategy comes after unions criticised the Welsh government's planned3% pay rise for NHS staff. Coroner concerned over emergency staffing levels Ambulance service pushed to limit in heatwave The figures, published on Thursday, show the Welsh Ambulance Trust received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. There were 41,454 calls to the service last month, an average of 1,382 per day. A record percentage of the calls received - 7.9% - were so-called ""red calls"" where incidents are classed as immediately life-threatening. Meanwhile the average number of people admitted to emergency departments in Wales every day in June was 3,136 - the second-highest figure since comparable records began in April 2012. Targets state 95% of all patients visiting A&E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours and no patient should wait longer than 12 hours. In June, 70.6% of patients spent less than four hours in A&E, a small drop on the previous month and 7.4% lower than June 2019, before the pandemic. There was also an increase of 6.4% in the number of people waiting more than 12 hours compared with the previous month, and an increase of 43% compared to June 2019. Average A&E waiting times increased to the longest since comparable records began in April 2012. The figures showed that in May, 608,062 people were waiting to start treatment - more than 19% of the Welsh population and the highest figure since comparable data was first gathered in 2011. It represents an increase of more than 5,000 since April. In May, 227,753 patients had been waiting more than 36 weeks (nine months) - an increase of more than 5,000 compared with April, and nearly nine times more than pre-pandemic total from February 2020 (25,634). Responding to the data, Ms Morgan said: ""The latest data shows the pressure on emergency care services is growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and putting a huge strain on NHS staff. Philip Banfield, chairman of the Welsh consultant committee at the British Medical Association Cymru, stressed that staff needed ""the tools to do the job"". ""There was a brief time at the start of the pandemic when people said: 'What do you need to do the job?' And we need to go back to that stage,"" he said. Ms Morgan said demand on Wales' GPs and emergency departments had continued to grow beyond levels seen before the pandemic, adding: ""Staff are under real pressure."" The government, she said, wanted to make sure everyone could access the ""high quality care they need in the right place, the first time"". ""Often people feel they have no option but to go to their GP, call 999 or go to their nearest emergency department for advice or treatment,"" Ms Morgan said. ""But under our new plans, people with urgent care needs could be treated elsewhere by the many different health professionals working in NHS Wales."" Health boards have had funding to set up new ""urgent primary care centres"", she said, where people can be seen without the need for a GP appointment or to go to A&E. She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersambulance services saw a 45% rise in calls on Monday compared with the previous week. She urged people to think ""very carefully"" about whether their accident was ""genuinely"" an emergency to help reduce waiting times. Last month, Ms Morgan welcomed therollout of a 111 service system,externalfor people in north Wales to get ""non-urgent medical advice"". Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief A&E phone triage scheme 'the way forward' ""What we're trying to do is make sure the public understands that there are alternatives to accident, emergency and GP services,"" she said. The service has now been rolled out to all health board areas across Wales, except for the Cardiff and Vale area, which is expected to come later this financial year. Additional money will also be made available for schemes to help people return home from hospital, reducing unnecessarily long stays and freeing up essential bed capacity. The summer holidays and hot weather, along with the easing of lockdown restrictions and an increase in Covid cases, has heaped more pressure on the NHS. The Welsh Conservatives called on the health minister to urgently come out with a plan, calling the numbers ""extremely concerning"". ""Without treatment, people simply cannot go about their daily lives,"" Russell George said. Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcements of extra funding and better signposting, but said problems were ""even deeper than before. ""I'll be looking for evidence of changes that make a difference in the long term, building more sustainable services at the heart of our communities,"" Rhun ap Iorwerth said. Olwen Williams says one of the challenges is staffing Olwen Williams, vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, described the proposals as ""a wonderful opportunity"". ""Care in the community is definitely the way forward,"" she said. ""And we need our primary care teams, our ambulance services, our community services, social services and our medical services all to work together to ensure that individuals get the right care in the right place at the right time."" Dr Williams added there were ""two big challenges"" involved. She said the first was whether people would accept the change of ""care closer to home"". The second, she explained, was to do with staffing, and how health boards would deliver the changes. Wales Ambulance Service chief executive Jason Killens said a combination of factors in recent days had put the service under ""extreme pressure"". ""It's not just here in Wales that we're seeing this unprecedented level of demand on the emergency ambulance service, and indeed on the NHS as a whole,"" Mr Killens said. ""Our staff have been doing fantastic work for 18 months through the pandemic, and with this warmer weather, they are working in extremely difficult conditions and I pay tribute to them because they've all been fantastic.""

Cases have increased across all regions in England with the highest seven-day average in the North East at 951.7 per 100,000 people compared to the lowest at 423.1 in the South East. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, urged everyone in their 20s to come forward for two doses of the vaccine. âIt is vital we all remain cautious,"" she said. ""Remember that meeting outside is safer than inside, get two doses of the vaccine as soon as you can, isolate if you are told to by NHS Test and Trace and if you show symptoms stay home and get a PCR test. ""We all still have a part to play, Covid-19 has not gone away. âThanks to the vaccine, hospital admissions and deaths are not growing as quickly as previous waves. However, they are on the rise and we continue to closely monitor the data.â Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government risks ""losing social consent"" for isolation if it does not immediately bring forward the relaxation of quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated. It comes after a record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 14 July. Hunt, a Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee, said ministers must bring forward the scheduled end of isolation for all fully vaccinated contacts who test negative from 16 August. Without ending that requirement and replacing it with testing ""we risk losing social consent for this very, very important weapon against the virus"", he said. Self-isolation is still one of the main tools being used to try and stop Covid spreading. At the moment, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you have symptoms, test positive for Covid, live with someone who tests positive or has symptoms, or are told to isolate by contact-tracers. You must also isolate if you arrive in the UK from a red list country, or from an amber list country and are not fully vaccinated. If you are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app saying you have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus, you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work,even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. However, the UK government has not yet confirmed which workers are included in this exemption. A list is expected to be published later today. BBC Radio 5 Live The owner of a chain of cocktail bars says he had to close one of them because staff left their phones together - and they were all pinged by the NHS Covid app. Martin Greenhow runs Mojo, which has branches in Leeds, Harrogate, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester. He tells Radio 5 Live how the Liverpool bar had to shut for a week after every member of staff was alerted by the NHS app and asked to self-isolate. The closure has cost him tens of thousands of pounds. âWe test all our staff on a daily basis,"" he says. ""I donât instruct them to ignore the ping, I give them the option. Itâs at their discretion. ""We will be as altruistic as we can, but fundamentally if a business runs out of money it runs out of all opportunity to do that. âWe ask them to behave in a grown-up, adult manner, which I think the government should expect the entire country to do and stop trying to nanny them.â He adds his business is also being affected by staff shortages in the supply chain, which he says are ""bringing the country to a grinding halt"".

Ethirajan AnbarasanAnbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia editor, BBC World Service Tax officials in India have raided the offices of a prominent newspaper group, Dainik Bhaskar, which has often challenged the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities say they are investigating alleged tax evasion. The Press Club of India says it deplores such intimidation and calls the raid an attempt to deter the independent media. Dainik Bhaskar publishes newspapers in Hindi and several other Indian languages across a dozen states. The editor of the group says staff members' mobile phones were seized when the tax authorities raided several locations. In the past few months, it carried a series of reports on the devastation caused by the pandemic.  The publication repeatedly questioned the government's Covid death statistics, and reported that the corpses of suspected coronavirus victims were floating in the river Ganges. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long been accused of attempting to stifle critical reporting, an accusation it denies. More than a third of a police force's control room staff are off work because they either have Covid-19 or have been told to self-isolate. Dorset Police said it came at a time when 999 calls had increased 21% since last week and 101 calls were up by 11%. A spokesperson said many of those affected were able to work from home and respond to non-urgent calls. But they said callers to 101 ""may have to wait some time"" to speak to someone as 999 calls were being prioritised. About 35% of control room staff are not working due to the issues. The BBC has asked the force how many workers that equates to. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Shoppers told there is no need to panic buy,"Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. The Co-op said items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer were worst affected. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was ""concerned about instances of shortages"". ""I don't want people to get the impression that every shelf in every supermarket is bare - that is not the case but we are certainly concerned about instances of shortages, we are looking at the supply chains of critical industries and we are reviewing that situation,"" he added. A record 618,903 people in England and Wales were ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app in the week to 14 July. Who needs to self-isolate and who is exempt? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets and other sectors, including hospitality and transport, have said growing numbers of staff have been affected which means they have to self-isolate for 10 days. Some companies have reduced opening hours to cope with the staff shortages or shut parts of the business. Firms want people who have been doubly vaccinated or have daily tests to be able to return to work. Mr Kwarteng said that the government would publish guidance later on which sectors would be exempt, although he declined to comment on whether it would include the food industry. Many of Thursday's newspapers carried pictures of empty shelves in some supermarket branches - with some describing panic buying of certain items - but industry sources told the BBC that so far, food shortages were not a systemic problem. Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said photographs of empty shelves in supermarkets were ""isolated incidents"". It is understood that Tesco is experiencing low availability across a small number of products due to the rise in the number of workers self-isolating as well as the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, the Co-op said it was being hit ""by some patchy disruption to our deliveries and store operations"". ""We are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly,"" it added. It is understood that items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer are worst affected. Lidl said the rise in numbers of employees having to self-isolate was starting to hit operations, but it was working to minimise disruption. About 1,000 Iceland employees - almost 4% of its staff - are currently absent for Covid-related reasons, with the north of England most affected. Of these, 27% have tested positive for Covid, while 64% have been ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told to isolate. Iceland is recruiting 2,000 temporary staff to help with the shortages while the Co-op will take on 3,000 extra workers. Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""We're working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now. ""As always, our focus is on maintaining the best possible range of products and high levels of service for our customers."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the increasing number of workers being told to isolate was ""putting increasing pressure on retailers' ability to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked"". A fall in the number of available HGV drivers, exacerbated by the rising numbers being forced to isolate, was also ""resulting in minor disruption to some supply chains"", the BRC's Andrew Opie said. The Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of 100,000 HGV drivers in the UK due to workers returning to Europe following Brexit as well as delays in testing hauliers for Covid. Meanwhile, the British Meat Processors Association said some members were seeing between 5% and 10% of their workforce ""pinged"" by the app. Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. If someone is told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace they are legally obliged to do so. But if someone is ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app the requirement to self-isolate is only advisory. Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, which supplies produce to hospitals, care home and prisons as well as restaurants, said it was asking workers who have been ""pinged"" to come back to work after they have taken a negative PCR test. ""We have a process of doing lateral flow tests daily away from their workplace and if that is negative then they can proceed with their work,"" Mr Selley said. Backlash as pinged staff rules called unworkable 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets But Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: ""The rules are clear and I think they should be followed."" Earlier this week, the government announced a ""small number"" of fully vaccinated critical workers, including health and care staff, would be allowed to continue to do their job even if they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive for Covid. The prime minister has said he does not want to extend the exemption too widely in order to limit the spread of the virus. The government has argued it is necessary to keep isolation rules largely unchanged until 16 August. From that date, people who are fully vaccinated and under-18s will be able to avoid self-isolating by taking daily Covid tests. Dozens of councils across Englandhave also been forced to suspend bin collections due to staff self-isolating. On Wednesday, BP said lorry driver shortages and isolating staffhad caused fuel supply issues at some of its petrol stations. The oil firm said shortages of unleaded petrol and diesel had seen a ""handful"" of its UK sites close temporarily. Have you experienced shops struggling to keep their shelves stocked?

What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

NHS waiting lists reach record high,"Wales' health minister has unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment Average waiting times at emergency departments are the longest they have been in nine years, the latest figures show. The Welsh Ambulance Trust also received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. More than 600,000 patients are waiting for treatment in Wales after record backlogs during the pandemic. It comes as Wales' health minister pledged to ""transform"" the delivery of urgent care. Eluned Morgan unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment. It includes annual funding of Â£25m to ""support people to access the right care in the right place"". The strategy comes after unions criticised the Welsh government's planned3% pay rise for NHS staff. Coroner concerned over emergency staffing levels Ambulance service pushed to limit in heatwave The figures, published on Thursday, show the Welsh Ambulance Trust received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. There were 41,454 calls to the service last month, an average of 1,382 per day. A record percentage of the calls received - 7.9% - were so-called ""red calls"" where incidents are classed as immediately life-threatening. Meanwhile the average number of people admitted to emergency departments in Wales every day in June was 3,136 - the second-highest figure since comparable records began in April 2012. Targets state 95% of all patients visiting A&E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours and no patient should wait longer than 12 hours. In June, 70.6% of patients spent less than four hours in A&E, a small drop on the previous month and 7.4% lower than June 2019, before the pandemic. There was also an increase of 6.4% in the number of people waiting more than 12 hours compared with the previous month, and an increase of 43% compared to June 2019. Average A&E waiting times increased to the longest since comparable records began in April 2012. The figures showed that in May, 608,062 people were waiting to start treatment - more than 19% of the Welsh population and the highest figure since comparable data was first gathered in 2011. It represents an increase of more than 5,000 since April. In May, 227,753 patients had been waiting more than 36 weeks (nine months) - an increase of more than 5,000 compared with April, and nearly nine times more than pre-pandemic total from February 2020 (25,634). Responding to the data, Ms Morgan said: ""The latest data shows the pressure on emergency care services is growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and putting a huge strain on NHS staff. Philip Banfield, chairman of the Welsh consultant committee at the British Medical Association Cymru, stressed that staff needed ""the tools to do the job"". ""There was a brief time at the start of the pandemic when people said: 'What do you need to do the job?' And we need to go back to that stage,"" he said. Ms Morgan said demand on Wales' GPs and emergency departments had continued to grow beyond levels seen before the pandemic, adding: ""Staff are under real pressure."" The government, she said, wanted to make sure everyone could access the ""high quality care they need in the right place, the first time"". ""Often people feel they have no option but to go to their GP, call 999 or go to their nearest emergency department for advice or treatment,"" Ms Morgan said. ""But under our new plans, people with urgent care needs could be treated elsewhere by the many different health professionals working in NHS Wales."" Health boards have had funding to set up new ""urgent primary care centres"", she said, where people can be seen without the need for a GP appointment or to go to A&E. She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersambulance services saw a 45% rise in calls on Monday compared with the previous week. She urged people to think ""very carefully"" about whether their accident was ""genuinely"" an emergency to help reduce waiting times. Last month, Ms Morgan welcomed therollout of a 111 service system,externalfor people in north Wales to get ""non-urgent medical advice"". Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief A&E phone triage scheme 'the way forward' ""What we're trying to do is make sure the public understands that there are alternatives to accident, emergency and GP services,"" she said. The service has now been rolled out to all health board areas across Wales, except for the Cardiff and Vale area, which is expected to come later this financial year. Additional money will also be made available for schemes to help people return home from hospital, reducing unnecessarily long stays and freeing up essential bed capacity. The summer holidays and hot weather, along with the easing of lockdown restrictions and an increase in Covid cases, has heaped more pressure on the NHS. The Welsh Conservatives called on the health minister to urgently come out with a plan, calling the numbers ""extremely concerning"". ""Without treatment, people simply cannot go about their daily lives,"" Russell George said. Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcements of extra funding and better signposting, but said problems were ""even deeper than before. ""I'll be looking for evidence of changes that make a difference in the long term, building more sustainable services at the heart of our communities,"" Rhun ap Iorwerth said. Olwen Williams says one of the challenges is staffing Olwen Williams, vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, described the proposals as ""a wonderful opportunity"". ""Care in the community is definitely the way forward,"" she said. ""And we need our primary care teams, our ambulance services, our community services, social services and our medical services all to work together to ensure that individuals get the right care in the right place at the right time."" Dr Williams added there were ""two big challenges"" involved. She said the first was whether people would accept the change of ""care closer to home"". The second, she explained, was to do with staffing, and how health boards would deliver the changes. Wales Ambulance Service chief executive Jason Killens said a combination of factors in recent days had put the service under ""extreme pressure"". ""It's not just here in Wales that we're seeing this unprecedented level of demand on the emergency ambulance service, and indeed on the NHS as a whole,"" Mr Killens said. ""Our staff have been doing fantastic work for 18 months through the pandemic, and with this warmer weather, they are working in extremely difficult conditions and I pay tribute to them because they've all been fantastic.""

"Promise to transform Welsh NHS to cope with demandDelivery of urgent care to be transformed during a ""challenging period"", says the health minister.Wales","Wales' health minister has unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment Average waiting times at emergency departments are the longest they have been in nine years, the latest figures show. The Welsh Ambulance Trust also received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. More than 600,000 patients are waiting for treatment in Wales after record backlogs during the pandemic. It comes as Wales' health minister pledged to ""transform"" the delivery of urgent care. Eluned Morgan unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment. It includes annual funding of Â£25m to ""support people to access the right care in the right place"". The strategy comes after unions criticised the Welsh government's planned3% pay rise for NHS staff. Coroner concerned over emergency staffing levels Ambulance service pushed to limit in heatwave The figures, published on Thursday, show the Welsh Ambulance Trust received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. There were 41,454 calls to the service last month, an average of 1,382 per day. A record percentage of the calls received - 7.9% - were so-called ""red calls"" where incidents are classed as immediately life-threatening. Meanwhile the average number of people admitted to emergency departments in Wales every day in June was 3,136 - the second-highest figure since comparable records began in April 2012. Targets state 95% of all patients visiting A&E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours and no patient should wait longer than 12 hours. In June, 70.6% of patients spent less than four hours in A&E, a small drop on the previous month and 7.4% lower than June 2019, before the pandemic. There was also an increase of 6.4% in the number of people waiting more than 12 hours compared with the previous month, and an increase of 43% compared to June 2019. Average A&E waiting times increased to the longest since comparable records began in April 2012. The figures showed that in May, 608,062 people were waiting to start treatment - more than 19% of the Welsh population and the highest figure since comparable data was first gathered in 2011. It represents an increase of more than 5,000 since April. In May, 227,753 patients had been waiting more than 36 weeks (nine months) - an increase of more than 5,000 compared with April, and nearly nine times more than pre-pandemic total from February 2020 (25,634). Responding to the data, Ms Morgan said: ""The latest data shows the pressure on emergency care services is growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and putting a huge strain on NHS staff. Philip Banfield, chairman of the Welsh consultant committee at the British Medical Association Cymru, stressed that staff needed ""the tools to do the job"". ""There was a brief time at the start of the pandemic when people said: 'What do you need to do the job?' And we need to go back to that stage,"" he said. Ms Morgan said demand on Wales' GPs and emergency departments had continued to grow beyond levels seen before the pandemic, adding: ""Staff are under real pressure."" The government, she said, wanted to make sure everyone could access the ""high quality care they need in the right place, the first time"". ""Often people feel they have no option but to go to their GP, call 999 or go to their nearest emergency department for advice or treatment,"" Ms Morgan said. ""But under our new plans, people with urgent care needs could be treated elsewhere by the many different health professionals working in NHS Wales."" Health boards have had funding to set up new ""urgent primary care centres"", she said, where people can be seen without the need for a GP appointment or to go to A&E. She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersambulance services saw a 45% rise in calls on Monday compared with the previous week. She urged people to think ""very carefully"" about whether their accident was ""genuinely"" an emergency to help reduce waiting times. Last month, Ms Morgan welcomed therollout of a 111 service system,externalfor people in north Wales to get ""non-urgent medical advice"". Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief A&E phone triage scheme 'the way forward' ""What we're trying to do is make sure the public understands that there are alternatives to accident, emergency and GP services,"" she said. The service has now been rolled out to all health board areas across Wales, except for the Cardiff and Vale area, which is expected to come later this financial year. Additional money will also be made available for schemes to help people return home from hospital, reducing unnecessarily long stays and freeing up essential bed capacity. The summer holidays and hot weather, along with the easing of lockdown restrictions and an increase in Covid cases, has heaped more pressure on the NHS. The Welsh Conservatives called on the health minister to urgently come out with a plan, calling the numbers ""extremely concerning"". ""Without treatment, people simply cannot go about their daily lives,"" Russell George said. Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcements of extra funding and better signposting, but said problems were ""even deeper than before. ""I'll be looking for evidence of changes that make a difference in the long term, building more sustainable services at the heart of our communities,"" Rhun ap Iorwerth said. Olwen Williams says one of the challenges is staffing Olwen Williams, vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, described the proposals as ""a wonderful opportunity"". ""Care in the community is definitely the way forward,"" she said. ""And we need our primary care teams, our ambulance services, our community services, social services and our medical services all to work together to ensure that individuals get the right care in the right place at the right time."" Dr Williams added there were ""two big challenges"" involved. She said the first was whether people would accept the change of ""care closer to home"". The second, she explained, was to do with staffing, and how health boards would deliver the changes. Wales Ambulance Service chief executive Jason Killens said a combination of factors in recent days had put the service under ""extreme pressure"". ""It's not just here in Wales that we're seeing this unprecedented level of demand on the emergency ambulance service, and indeed on the NHS as a whole,"" Mr Killens said. ""Our staff have been doing fantastic work for 18 months through the pandemic, and with this warmer weather, they are working in extremely difficult conditions and I pay tribute to them because they've all been fantastic.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsMore than 600,000 people pinged by NHS Covid-19 app618,903 people in England and Wales received self-isolation alerts in the week up to 14 JulyTechnology","More than 600,000 people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales were sent self-isolation alerts in the week between 8 and 15 July. Data shows 618,903 alerts were sent - a 17% rise from the previous week. There are complaints from businesses that the alerts are causing serious staff shortages and affecting services. However some fully-vaccinated key workers will be exempt from self-isolating if they are pinged by the app as a close contact of a positive case. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC a âvery narrowâ list of jobs would be released today. Self-isolation for all fully-vaccinated people pinged by the app as close contacts is due to be scrapped by 16 August, although there are calls for this deadline to be brought forward. The app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the Test and Trace team. Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? ""If you are pinged, you should self-isolate. I know it poses challenges, and we are seeing reports of shortages which we are monitoring, but the rules are clear and I think they should be followed,"" Mr Kwarteng told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4. Latest government figures show there are a further 44,104 daily coronavirus cases in the UK, with 73 coronavirus-related deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned cases could rise even more this week, as most legal restrictions have ended in England. His spokesman said that the app was doing ""what it's designed to do"". ""We're aware of the impact on some industries and services and working closely with them particularly food and supermarketsâ¦.we have a robust and resilient food supply chain."" Butsupermarkets have warnedthey may have product shortages due to staff self-isolating. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. However, Iceland urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. Meanwhile,dozens of councils have suspended bin collectionsdue to staff shortages from isolation and fuel provider BP has temporarily closed ""a handful of sites"" due to Covid staff absences. In England 607,486 alerts were sent to app users in the period between 8 and 15 July, with a further 11,417 sent in Wales. There were fewer app pings per case in England during this period, with 2.8 pings issued per every reported coronavirus case. An average of 3.2 pings were sent per case reported in the last month. Scotland's app has issued fewer than 60,000 notification ""pings""since it launched in September 2020. Another record then for the number of people pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app and sent into isolation. For businesses struggling to deal with the impact on their employees this will be more evidence that a different approach is needed. The fact that the number of pings did not rise even more sharply in a week when case numbers were accelerating, may be an indication that some people have deleted the app, although we have to be cautious about extrapolating too much from one week's figures. Its defenders point out that many of the complaints about the app concern wider health policy rather than the tech itself - the fact that people  who may have been in contact with the virus are being told to isolate even if they are fully vaccinated is a policy applying to traditional Test and Trace too, and won't change until August 16th. One man, who was heavily involved in the design of the app, told me people didn't realise that it worked on a number of levels - ""even if someone ignores the message to self-isolate, telling them they have been exposed to the virus is likely to make them behave more cautiously."" He also said that while the anonymous nature of the app meant only limited data could be extracted from it, there was useful and early information for epidemiologists about the spread of the virus and the R rate. The government still insists the app is doing the job for which it was designed - but there will be mounting pressure from industry for a more rapid change to allow people who are pinged to be tested rather than to isolate. When the new health secretary Sajid Javid replaced Matt Hancock, there were reports that he wanted the app's sensitivity tweaked so that it sent out fewer alerts. But that appears to be off the agenda for the moment, with the Department of Health insisting there are no immediate plans for any changes. Downloads of the app continued to rise to 26,826,748 from 26,523,853 the previous week. The BBC understands there is no way to know if the app has been deleted, but #DeleteTheApp has been trending on Twitter today. A recent poll by YouGov suggested that one in ten users have deleted the app, having previously installed it. Those aged between 18 and 24 were most likely to have deleted the app, after installing it, according to the data. People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days. In this same week to 14 July, 259,265 people in England tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 33% from the previous week. NHS Test and Trace said it was the highest weekly number of people testing positive since January. The service said it had identified 475,465 people as close contacts of somebody who had a positive coronavirus result, and had been able to contact 94% of them NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA officials giving update on wildfires as firefighters struggle to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Shoppers told there is no need to panic buyBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwateng says the government is ""concerned about instances of shortages"",Business","Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. The Co-op said items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer were worst affected. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was ""concerned about instances of shortages"". ""I don't want people to get the impression that every shelf in every supermarket is bare - that is not the case but we are certainly concerned about instances of shortages, we are looking at the supply chains of critical industries and we are reviewing that situation,"" he added. A record 618,903 people in England and Wales were ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app in the week to 14 July. Who needs to self-isolate and who is exempt? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets and other sectors, including hospitality and transport, have said growing numbers of staff have been affected which means they have to self-isolate for 10 days. Some companies have reduced opening hours to cope with the staff shortages or shut parts of the business. Firms want people who have been doubly vaccinated or have daily tests to be able to return to work. Mr Kwarteng said that the government would publish guidance later on which sectors would be exempt, although he declined to comment on whether it would include the food industry. Many of Thursday's newspapers carried pictures of empty shelves in some supermarket branches - with some describing panic buying of certain items - but industry sources told the BBC that so far, food shortages were not a systemic problem. Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said photographs of empty shelves in supermarkets were ""isolated incidents"". It is understood that Tesco is experiencing low availability across a small number of products due to the rise in the number of workers self-isolating as well as the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, the Co-op said it was being hit ""by some patchy disruption to our deliveries and store operations"". ""We are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly,"" it added. It is understood that items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer are worst affected. Lidl said the rise in numbers of employees having to self-isolate was starting to hit operations, but it was working to minimise disruption. About 1,000 Iceland employees - almost 4% of its staff - are currently absent for Covid-related reasons, with the north of England most affected. Of these, 27% have tested positive for Covid, while 64% have been ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told to isolate. Iceland is recruiting 2,000 temporary staff to help with the shortages while the Co-op will take on 3,000 extra workers. Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""We're working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now. ""As always, our focus is on maintaining the best possible range of products and high levels of service for our customers."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the increasing number of workers being told to isolate was ""putting increasing pressure on retailers' ability to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked"". A fall in the number of available HGV drivers, exacerbated by the rising numbers being forced to isolate, was also ""resulting in minor disruption to some supply chains"", the BRC's Andrew Opie said. The Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of 100,000 HGV drivers in the UK due to workers returning to Europe following Brexit as well as delays in testing hauliers for Covid. Meanwhile, the British Meat Processors Association said some members were seeing between 5% and 10% of their workforce ""pinged"" by the app. Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. If someone is told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace they are legally obliged to do so. But if someone is ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app the requirement to self-isolate is only advisory. Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, which supplies produce to hospitals, care home and prisons as well as restaurants, said it was asking workers who have been ""pinged"" to come back to work after they have taken a negative PCR test. ""We have a process of doing lateral flow tests daily away from their workplace and if that is negative then they can proceed with their work,"" Mr Selley said. Backlash as pinged staff rules called unworkable 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets But Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: ""The rules are clear and I think they should be followed."" Earlier this week, the government announced a ""small number"" of fully vaccinated critical workers, including health and care staff, would be allowed to continue to do their job even if they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive for Covid.

He also said that while the anonymous nature of the app meant only limited data could be extracted from it, there was useful and early information for epidemiologists about the spread of the virus and the R rate. The government still insists the app is doing the job for which it was designed - but there will be mounting pressure from industry for a more rapid change to allow people who are pinged to be tested rather than to isolate. When the new health secretary Sajid Javid replaced Matt Hancock, there were reports that he wanted the app's sensitivity tweaked so that it sent out fewer alerts. But that appears to be off the agenda for the moment, with the Department of Health insisting there are no immediate plans for any changes. Downloads of the app continued to rise to 26,826,748 from 26,523,853 the previous week. The BBC understands there is no way to know if the app has been deleted, but #DeleteTheApp has been trending on Twitter today. A recent poll by YouGov suggested that one in ten users have deleted the app, having previously installed it. Those aged between 18 and 24 were most likely to have deleted the app, after installing it, according to the data. People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days. In this same week to 14 July, 259,265 people in England tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 33% from the previous week. NHS Test and Trace said it was the highest weekly number of people testing positive since January. The service said it had identified 475,465 people as close contacts of somebody who had a positive coronavirus result, and had been able to contact 94% of them NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA officials giving update on wildfires as firefighters struggle to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"'We sold up, moved to the sea and are living the Zoom dream''We sold up, moved to the sea and are living the Zoom dream'","It was three in the morning when Sam Lancaster found her family's new Yorkshire home by the sea. ""I don't even know what brought Scarborough into my head. I just googled it,"" she says. It was house-love at first sight. But there was another key piece of information. Her husband Craig had been told by his employer, a major telecoms firm, that he could work - indefinitely - from home. Sam and Craig and their two daughters really could live anywhere - including the seaside. The Lancasters say they had ""outgrown"" their home in Thatcham, Berkshire, not far from Craig's office in Newbury. And no longer constrained by the geography of a daily commute, they started looking for better value houses in other parts of the country. Now they're unpacking boxes in a big, rambling home on the North Yorkshire coast, with the sea a blue horizon out the back window. In this week's picture-postcard sunshine, they've been swimming in the sea most days. ""It's a no-brainer. It feels so right,"" says 41-year-old Sam, convinced her family's migration 230 miles north, as the gull flies, is going to be part of a bigger trend. ""If you can work from home, why wouldn't you move?"" she says, swatting away any doubts. Craig, whose IT job supports network operations, says a trip to Screwfix turned into a nature trek. ""We saw seals swimming in the sea and puffins. You wouldn't see that in Thatcham."" ""Just look out the window. There are lovely walks, people have been welcoming, the girls can go down to the beach,"" says Sam. She's in a mover's honeymoon where everything still feels like a holiday, even though she says some of the locals are more likely to ""slag off the town"". Some of their old friends also thought they were crazy for uprooting. Sam says they quietly asked her whether she thought it was a rash decision. But there was another piece of rocket fuel for this life change. The awfulness of the pandemic made her think there was no point in hesitating. She had ""gone off"" their old area. Here was a chance to reinvent their lives. ""I would never have done this without the pandemic,"" she says. She worked as a teaching assistant before and might return to that later. But nothing was going to hold her back. It will mean new schools for Sophie aged 15, and Olivia, eight, and making new friends for parents and children. But they seem unfazed and confident about a fresh start. ""Life is so short,"" says Sam. The Lancasters could be part of a changing tide. The big beaches and widescreen skies have always made seaside towns seductive, but they can be slow to reach. Coastal transport can have more dodgy links than a crazy golf course. Will remote working make the coast a practical option? Will people start moving to Zoomtown-on-Sea? And could this revitalise fading seaside towns? Figures up to June 2021 from the Rightmove property network showed a 115% increase in enquiries about moving from cities to a seaside town, compared with before the pandemic. These are people viewing properties and getting information, not completing sales. But Tim Bannister, director of property data, says: ""It's a really strong indicator, a window into what's happening."" There has also been a shift from most city dwellers looking to move. Before the pandemic they were looking for properties in the same city. Now, most are looking elsewhere. It's an out-of-city trend that applies to London, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester. The rise of hybrid working is a big factor, according to estate agents. ""People are reassessing their lives,"" says Phil Fletcher, of CPH estate agents in Scarborough. He also wants the town to reassess its relationship with seagulls, which have just caused a leak in his ceiling. He says people who have had tough experiences in the pandemic are now making big choices about their relationships, their jobs and where they live. ""People are sitting up and thinking: 'Live for the day.'"" Coastal towns, like sea views, are always changing. Where his estate agency now stands was the site of the Theatre Royal, when Scarborough was an entertainment capital. The idea of remote workers moving to cheaper, characterful Victorian houses in Scarborough is not future-gazing for him: ""I can see it already happening."" But seaside towns can have a Jekyll and Hyde character. On a sunny day Scarborough looks irresistible. Families are outside ice-cream coloured chalets, one with a placard saying: ""Be Nice or Go Home."" Boats are running trips to see dolphins off the coast. Holidaymakers are shielding their chips from dive-bombing seagulls. It's not just the memorial plaques on seafront benches that prove how much people love to sit and look at the sea. Environmental psychologist Michelle Tester-Jones, at the University of Exeter, is part of a research project which has found ""consistent evidence that spending time near 'blue spaces' seems to be good for well-being"", including helping with ""anxiety and low mood"". But take a short walk from Scarborough's seafront and there are boarded up shops on the High Street, like teeth missing in a smile. The Christmas bargain store is still promising presents in July. A food bank collection point stands in the locked-up entrance to Debenhams. The town has immense natural beauty and handsome old buildings, but deprivation - in income, health and education - runs through Scarborough like a stick of rock. It's a low-income economy with many jobs relying on summer tourism. Male life expectancy has been going into reverse. ""It's a town of two cities - of bizarre contrasts,"" says Andrew Clay, director of Scarborough Museums Trust. ""We have wealth and successful businesses,"" with a legacy of great architecture and spectacular views, he says. ""But some of the areas here are some of the UK's most depressed - in terms of social deprivation, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, hard-to-reach communities. There's an issue with aspiration in the town,"" he says. This mix of light and shade has always been there, perhaps. Mr Clay is speaking in a wood-panelled room in what was once the home of the aristocratic Sitwell family. Edward VII stayed a couple of doors down, when Scarborough was a royal playground. Until he caught typhoid. The wheel will turn again, and Scarborough will find new ways to appeal to a wider and wealthier range of people, says Mr Clay. That's if it upgrades its facilities, like getting a multiplex cinema and making better use of its cultural heritage. ""It's a town that has always reinvented itself,"" he says. Seaside towns can be like those distorting mirrors in funfairs. Posters of Scarborough from the 1920s and 1930s show glamorous couples in sleek cars and speed boats, with the bays and sandy beaches looking like the south of France. What you see depends on your perspective. Liz Colling, Scarborough's councillor in charge of inclusive growth, wants the town's next reinvention to be about revitalising the local economy, including encouraging more digital jobs. It's a ""very realistic ambition"" which is already beginning to happen, she says. ""I have a nephew who has just started a job remotely. He would never have applied before because it's based in London,"" says Cllr Colling, adding that her son is also working remotely. ""Historically our younger people have left town to pursue education and jobs, but this is a sign that you can still stay here and have a really good career,"" she says. Local digital marketing firm, Digital Zest, has had a boom time during the lockdown, with so much going online. Managing director Paul Taylor expects more people to come and work remotely, because of the quality of life and being able to go straight from desk to beach. But even the digital world needs to travel - and he wants improvements to road and transport connections. How Scarborough appealed to upmarket tourists in 1930 Scarborough, one of the ""left-behind towns"", is getting more than Â£20m ""levelling-up"" funding. But it raises the question of what such labels mean, because the town has little of the graffiti, grime or street-begging in a ""richer"" place such as London. The real difference is in the jobs market - and it's why the arrival of Zoom workers is significant. It's a town with very few professional jobs. It has half the average for the Yorkshire and Humber region, and below a third of a resort such as Brighton. For civil service jobs, Scarborough has only a fifth of the national average. It also struggles to attract people to stay in such professional jobs - for instance the town has been blighted with problems in recruiting NHS dentists. Parents have had totake their children to other towns to find a dentist. Timo Hannay, a data analyst who hasresearched the struggles of coastal communities,externaland who advises policymakers, says Scarborough has many of the problems typical of seaside towns - but to a slightly greater degree. We'll keep being fascinated by these towns, he says, because the seaside carries such a strong sense of Britain's changing identity - both in its ""self-assurance and self-doubt"". What can get overlooked about Zoom-working is the long-term change for remote workers themselves. Craig Lancaster is 52. He could spend the rest of his working life alone at home with his multiple computer screens. ""I do miss the interaction, that's the one thing work-wise. I don't think it's as personable as being in the office face-to-face,"" he says. No-one else at home will want to obsess about office politics, there are no workmates to meet over coffee. But for Craig, the positives of a better work-life balance outweigh any drawbacks. ""Work is changing. Productivity has gone up with people working from home. Businesses have realised that trusting their employees means they're saving money, they're not having to pay for buildings."" Seaside towns have often been defined by what they used to be. In Scarborough you can almost hear the ghosts of old comedians and imagine the big summer crowds filling huge Victorian hotels, which have become cliff faces for nesting seagulls. Could it be that the unexpected opportunities afforded by the pandemic will see flocks of a different sort descend on the town? In a series of special reports BBC News has been looking at the challenges and opportunities in seaside towns such as Scarborough.

Young farmers' club membership halves in pandemic,"This video can not be played Katie Davies says more members are starting to return as Covid rules are eased Welsh young farmers' clubs (YFCs) have seen their membership halve during a ""tough"" year, with the pandemic challenging the way they usually run. Wales YFC has just over 4,000 members in a typical year - but that fell to just over 2,000 in 2020-2021. Chair Katie Davies said it was a worry but she believed clubs had a positive future with more members starting to return as Covid rules were eased. The organisation hopes to hold more face-to-face events this summer. Young farmers and mental health: 'We feel so isolated' Out-of-work young 'face being scarred by Covid' Where are Britain's loneliest places in lockdown? In a normal year the Royal Welsh showground in Llanelwedd, Powys, would be full of farmers of all ages. For young farmers in particular it would be the pinnacle of the competition calendar. The Royal Welsh Show was cancelled this July and took place virtually in 2020 But this year, like last, there areno competitions on the showgroundas the coronavirus pandemic has put a stop to the YFC's face-to-face competitions. ""It's been a very difficult year for us,"" Ms Davies told BBC Radio Cymru'sDros Frecwastprogramme. ""Doing everything over Zoom and not face-to-face, that's tough for our members, not to be able to see anyone. ""It's a shock, and it does make us worry for the future of the organisation. ""But, at the same time, it isn't a big shock because it's been such a different year, and not everyone wants to do something over Zoom."" Bodycams for farmers as they fight rural crime 'Growing Welsh tea isn't easy with our weather' Young farmer Sioned Fflur Evans competed online while she was living away from Ceredigion One of those who did not rejoin during the past year was 22-year-old Chloe Jones. She is usually a member of Pontsian YFC in Ceredigion, but works in Cardiff, and would travel back to compete. But Covid made her rethink last year. ""I originally joined when I was in Year 8, and I've competed in many competitions and love being a part of the club,"" she said. ""This year I had considered joining because I want to support the club and want to be part of the competitions. ""But Covid came, and I wasn't going to get the same experiences as usual. ""For me, being part of the competitions and meeting weekly, that's what YFC is, I enjoy the socialising. ""I would consider rejoining this year coming. Deaths on Welsh farms more than double in a year Covid postpones Europe's biggest agricultural show ""I want to be a part of the YFC until I'm too old to do so because I really enjoy everything about it. ""Even if I do live in Cardiff, I still want to join and support the club."" Like many organisations, the YFCs turned to the virtual world to hold many of their events and competitions. That was not practical for every event - and not to everyone's taste, especially those who would prefer to meet face-to-face. But it has offered opportunities to people like 24-year-old Sioned Fflur Evans, a member of Llanwenog YFC, Ceredigion, but has been living in Birmingham and Bristol for the past two years. ""This year, when the competition was online or on Zoom, it made it much easier for me to compete as I could log on from Birmingham,"" she said. Katie Davies: ""If the restrictions are relaxed again in August we'll see more members returning in September"" The challenge for the clubs in Wales is encouraging those who have left to rejoin - for social reasons, but also for the sake of the organisation's finances. Last year BBC Radio Cymru found the organisation was facing potential losses of Â£140,000. But Ms Davies believes most members will rejoin after a year's break. ""We are positive about the future of the YFC because counties are meeting and clubs are meeting face-to-face,"" she said. ""With that we're seeing more members coming back. ""Looking forward, if the restrictions are relaxed again in August we'll see more members returning in September when the new YFC year starts.""

"Coronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning.UK'We sold up, moved to the sea and are living the Zoom dream'","Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. There's no need to panic buy, says the managing director of a supermarket,who warns there's a risk shops will shut due to the numbers of workers being forced to self-isolate for 10 days. The comments from Iceland boss Richard Walker came after a warning from the British Retail Consortium that pressure is mounting on shops to keep their shelves stocked as more and more staff are being pinged by the NHS Covid app. He says photographs of empty shelves were isolated incidents but he is calling for retail staff to be exempt from staying at home when contacted. The government says it is crucial people isolate when contacted to stop the spread of the virus. A 3% pay rise offered to nurses and other NHS workers by the government has left staff ""really angry and upset"" and feeling they are not ""valued for what they do,"" a union has told the BBC - andafter a consultation it could lead to a strike.The Royal College of Nursing had called for a 12.5% pay increase, which it says would help fill vacancies and retain staff. It claims the 3% - or an additional Â£1,000 a year for the average nurse - is effectively a pay cut once inflation is factored in. The pay rise, recommended by an independent NHS pay review body then accepted by the government, was a recognition of the ""extraordinary efforts"" of the health service's workers, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said. Women quarantining in UK hotels will now have female guards, when possible.The change made by the Department of Health and Social Care comes after the BBC reported allegations of sexual harassment. Sixteen women contacted the BBC and some said complaints were ignored or disbelieved. One male guard had mimed having sex in a lift, and another had asked for a hug, they said. If it's not possible for women to have female guards they should be escorted by two male guards, the new guidance says. Covid vaccine supply isn't generally a problem in the US. It was one of the world's leaders in the uptake of vaccinations until the middle of April, but its rate has slowed down. The US is still ahead of some other major economies, such as Japan, but the rate is dropping off as it climbs elsewhere.We've had a look into why. You've been told you can work from home indefinitely by your boss, so do you find different places to work from time-to-time, stay put or move more than 200 miles away?

LiveLiveWorkers exempt from isolation to be revealed later6 minutes ago,"A record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in week to 14 July Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi defended the figure, saying self-isolation was the second most important tool, after vaccines, for fighting Covid The food industry says rising numbers of self-isolating staff mean shops are facing serious challenges as they try to keep shelves stocked A list of workers able to skip self-isolation if fully vaccinated will be revealed later, Kwarteng says The Royal College of Nursing tells the BBC staff are ""angry"" and deserve a bigger increase Women quarantining in UK hotels will now have female guards, when possible, after allegations of sexual harassment The UK reports 39,906 new coronavirus cases and 84 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Lauren Turner We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day - thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of the latest Covid developments:  We will be back with more tomorrow. Our coverage today has been brought to you by Vanessa Barford, Francesca Gillett, Hamish Mackay, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and George Wright.  Many young adults are still to get their first vaccine - despite the fact all over-18s are now eligible - prompting calls for more to do so. Almost 90% of all UK adults have had a first dose and about 70% are fully vaccinated. But about 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - haven't been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. Under-30s only became eligible for the Covid vaccine in June. Half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to those in their 20s. The vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Read more here. Labour has said the government must produce a ""clear, unambiguous list"" of those workers who could avoid self-isolating. Shadow Business Minister Seema Malhotra said it made sense to exempt ""certain fully vaccinated professionals"" - like those in the emergency services -  from self-isolation rules through a targeted test scheme. However, she said the government had made a mess of its own policy and ""is undermining the effectiveness of the rule change"". ""If ministers don't know or can't decide what the plan is, how can employers possibly be expected to understand what's required of them?"" she added.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 The government is planning to lift the rule to self-isolate for people who are fully vaccinated on 16 August. Not everyone will be double-jabbed by then - especially younger people - so it means many people will still be required to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone with Covid. But Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, says ministers should bring forward this date. Two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had both jabs, he points out - and the Office for National Statistics antibody study found ""40-50%"" of un-vaccinated people were showing signs of having had the virus and so had a ""degree of immunity"". Prof Hunter told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: ""Given the damage this policy is doing, I can't see any public health reason why we shouldn't actually stop requiring quarantining of casual contacts. ""The emphasis is on casual. Clearly if your husband, partner or children you live with have Covid, then that's a totally different issue and I think we need to continue."" He added: ""If you haven't been vaccinated and you haven't had a double vaccine, then the risks are higher and I can see some value in continuing with (self-isolating)."" A family member visits his relative's grave at a cemetery for Covid victims in Jakarta The World Health Organization has urged Indonesia to retain existing Covid restrictions and even to expand them across the country, pointing to a steep rise in deaths and infections. The agency issued the warning two days after President Joko Widodo pledged to gradually ease the measures because of falling case numbers in some regions. But epidemiologists have questioned the Indonesian leader's plan, saying there's a lack of testing outside the capital, Jakarta. This week, daily deaths hit
record highs of more than 1,300 - among the highest tolls in the world. Indonesia's daily positivity rate, the proportion of people
tested who are infected, has averaged 30% over the past week
even as cases numbers have dropped. A level above 20% meant ""very
high"" transmissibility, the WHO said. ""Indonesia is currently facing a very high transmission
level, and it is indicative of the utmost importance of
implementing stringent public health and social measures,
especially movement restrictions, throughout the country,"" it
said. Earlier in the week, Indonesia's medical association said the healthcare system was at risk of collapse due to rising hospital admissions coupled with the deaths of medical staff due to Covid. This video can not be played Dawn Butler suspended from Commons for calling PM a liar Labour MP Dawn Butler has been ordered to leave the House of Commons for the rest of the day after she refused to withdraw accusations that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has lied during the pandemic. She said it was dangerous to lie during a pandemic and that Boris Johnson had ""lied to the House and the country over and over again"". Acting Deputy Speaker Judith Cummins asked the MP to ""reflect on her words and perhaps correct the record"". Ms Butler replied: ""At the end of the day, the prime minister has lied to this House time and time again and it's funny that we get in trouble in this place for calling out the lie, rather than the person lying"". The acting deputy speaker again asked the MP to withdraw her remarks but she replied: ""I have reflected on my words and somebody needs to tell the truth in this House that the prime minister has lied"". It is considered not within the boundaries of parliamentary etiquette to call another member a liar. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Just shy of
40,000 new infections have been confirmed in the UK governmentâs daily Covid
update. That is significant â it is the first time since the rise in infection
rates took off that we have seen a dip in cases compared to the same day a week
ago. Last Thursday 48,500 cases were reported. We should be
careful about reading too much into this. It is just one day and the impact of
the lifting of most restrictions in England and Scotland on 19 July has yet to
take effect. But
nonetheless it offers further evidence that cases will peak somewhere around
the expected levels as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by natural
infection and vaccination. The hope of
government scientists was always that by this stage we would be seeing the
first signs of a plateau. In recent weeks infection rates have not been growing
as quickly as they were at the end of June. And now we
have the first sign that growth may have stopped. We should expect that to be
temporary. The modelling suggests we will soon get a further rise from the 19
July relaxing and further mixing that ensues. But it is at
least a tiny sign that this summer wave could be tamed, before there is a threat
of the NHS being overwhelmed to the extent that restrictions may have to be
reintroduced. A fresh wave of Covid could pose a risk to the euro zone's economic recovery, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said. Her warning comes after the bank hinted at an even longer period of monetary support. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is becoming dominant in Europe, leading to a surge in cases in many countries. ""The reopening of large parts of the economy is supporting a
vigorous bounce-back in the services sector,"" said Lagarde. ""But the Delta
variant of the coronavirus could dampen this recovery in
services, especially in tourism and hospitality."" She added that ECB forecasts from June had included an assumption that some measures
to contain the pandemic would continue through the third and
fourth quarters of this year. A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk. From Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. Ministers will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen. If given the go-ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately.

British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson has said there is no need for the public to be stockpiling due to fears that firms could grind to a halt because of the high numbers of staff isolating. ""I don't think there's any need for members of the public to be stockpiling what they buy. There's plenty of food in the country,"" Dickinson said. ""What we're seeing is pockets of issues in specific places where case numbers are particularly high and the most important thing is that the government acts now before the situation does get more serious, so that we don't see more empty shelves in more places."" Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary.

They show a total of 325,223 people tested positive for coronavirus in the last seven days, up 63,391 - or 24.2% - on the week before. Meanwhile, 387 people have died within 28 days of a positive test in the last week, up by 130 - or 50.6% - on the previous seven days. The UK has reported 39,906 new positive Covid cases in the last 24 hours. And there have been 84 further deaths, within 28 days of a positive test. Katharine Da CostaBBC health correspondent Covid infections among people aged 20-29 are at the highest level on record across any age group since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Public Health England. In the week to 18 July, the seven-day case rate among this age group was 1154.7 per 100,000 population. The lowest case rates were in people aged 80 and above, with a seven-day rate of 60.6 per 100,000 population. Cases have increased across all regions in England with the highest seven-day average in the North East at 951.7 per 100,000 people compared to the lowest at 423.1 in the South East. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, urged everyone in their 20s to come forward for two doses of the vaccine. âIt is vital we all remain cautious,"" she said. ""Remember that meeting outside is safer than inside, get two doses of the vaccine as soon as you can, isolate if you are told to by NHS Test and Trace and if you show symptoms stay home and get a PCR test. ""We all still have a part to play, Covid-19 has not gone away. âThanks to the vaccine, hospital admissions and deaths are not growing as quickly as previous waves. However, they are on the rise and we continue to closely monitor the data.â Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government risks ""losing social consent"" for isolation if it does not immediately bring forward the relaxation of quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated. It comes after a record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 14 July. Hunt, a Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee, said ministers must bring forward the scheduled end of isolation for all fully vaccinated contacts who test negative from 16 August. Without ending that requirement and replacing it with testing ""we risk losing social consent for this very, very important weapon against the virus"", he said. Self-isolation is still one of the main tools being used to try and stop Covid spreading. At the moment, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you have symptoms, test positive for Covid, live with someone who tests positive or has symptoms, or are told to isolate by contact-tracers. You must also isolate if you arrive in the UK from a red list country, or from an amber list country and are not fully vaccinated. If you are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app saying you have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus, you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work,even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. However, the UK government has not yet confirmed which workers are included in this exemption. A list is expected to be published later today.

Ethirajan AnbarasanAnbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia editor, BBC World Service Tax officials in India have raided the offices of a prominent newspaper group, Dainik Bhaskar, which has often challenged the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities say they are investigating alleged tax evasion. The Press Club of India says it deplores such intimidation and calls the raid an attempt to deter the independent media. Dainik Bhaskar publishes newspapers in Hindi and several other Indian languages across a dozen states. The editor of the group says staff members' mobile phones were seized when the tax authorities raided several locations. In the past few months, it carried a series of reports on the devastation caused by the pandemic.  The publication repeatedly questioned the government's Covid death statistics, and reported that the corpses of suspected coronavirus victims were floating in the river Ganges.

A spokesperson said many of those affected were able to work from home and respond to non-urgent calls. But they said callers to 101 ""may have to wait some time"" to speak to someone as 999 calls were being prioritised. About 35% of control room staff are not working due to the issues.

"NI Executive to discuss coronavirus restrictionsProposals to further ease restrictions, including reopening of theatres, may be approved later.","A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk. From Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. Ministers will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen. If given the go ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Northern Ireland Executive said ""modest relaxations"" had been agreed after careful consideration. It followed an update from health and scientific advisers on how the virus is progressing, including the increasing numbers of cases and hospital admissions, the statement added. It comes asanother 1,430 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday. This includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the last 24 hours. No further deaths were recorded. The frustration here is not totally surprising. A pause has been put on things which some people hoped would be given the green light and the most disappointed people will be those who run our theatres and concert halls. Today's decision doesn't mean reopening of those venues won't happen, but it's not going to happen as quickly as the people who own them want. However, when you consider some of the figures that ministers were considering today, that is not a surprise. This all happens before the executive meets on 12 August to consider the mandatory wearing of facemasks and the end of social distancing. It doesn't look like 'freedom day' - or anything like it - will be announced in Northern Ireland anytime soon. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the decision to make modest changes to restrictions was made ""in the context of a rapid increase in the number of cases"". She said there had also been a doubling of the number of people in hospital in the last eight days, the majority of whom were unvaccinated. Ms O'Neill reiterated a call for young people to take up the opportunity to get vaccinated at pop-up centres across Northern Ireland. ""A cautious approach is what is required here and a steady approach,"" she said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says some progress had been made regarding the easing of restrictions Ms O'Neill said health officials had advised there would be more data available next week, which would help them understand the correlation between Covid-19 cases and admissions to hospital. She said this information would help inform decisions around restrictions that may be further eased. Dr Alan Stout, chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee, described the Northern Ireland Executive's decision as ""sensible and measured"". He said the executive had not bowed to pressure to ease restrictions but has instead based its decision on data and the risks faced. ""The temptation is that we move too soon, we need that little bit more time,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. However, Dr Stout added that Northern Ireland was ""not losing the race"" between infections and vaccines. ""We are doing well and we are protecting people. We would shudder to think what position we would be in right now if we had not vaccinated as many people,"" he said. However, Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was ""regrettable"" more progress could not have been made in the wider reopening of the economy. He added that the executive also needed to take action about the number of people being required to self-isolate. ""We have received numerous calls from members this week indicating that they could well have to close because of staff having to self-isolate,"" he said. ""At the very least, we need the executive to bring Northern Ireland into line with the English date of 16 August, which allows 'pinged' double-vaccinated workers to take a PCR test, rather than self-isolation for 10 days."" Meanwhile, Ireland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the number of Covid-19 cases related to overseas travel had increased ""very sharply"". He said 676 cases were reported in the last fortnight in people returning from Spain, Great Britain and Portugal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a series of posts on Twitter, Dr Glynn said it was ""strongly advised"" that people should only travel on the basis of their vaccination status or immunity after recovering from Covid-19. By Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter We know younger people are currently affected more by Covid-19 because a large part of that cohort simply have not had a vaccination yet. The uptake is slow in that age group. Of all the positive tests in the previous seven days, more than 90% were in those aged under 60. Anecdotally, we are hearing from some people that they are getting vaccinated but some are still catching the virus. A lot of people have said to us that they really would not like to see what they would have had to go through if they had not been vaccinated. It is a complicated, hard-hitting and unpleasant virus. Our hospital figures are remaining reasonably low but today we have 162 people in hospital. There is a lag, however. In another two to three weeks, we are going to see those rising case numbers reflected in hospital admissions. The Northern Ireland Executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to ten people, from no more than three households. A decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting. Other decisions, including removing the restrictions on sound levels from indoor venues, the holding of conferences and exhibitions and reducing social distancing to one metre will be considered next Thursday. Many Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland have been lifted in recent months, after a lockdown that lasted about four months. Hospitality Ulster has previously urged the executive to lift further restrictions on hospitality However,theatres and live music venues have been closed in Northern Ireland for the best part of 16 months, with all other parts of the UK already allowing them to reopen. The arts and music sector had been urging the executive to stick to the latest indicative date and allow the industry to resume trading, with mitigations. They had been looking at allowing a range of relaxations including: 10 people from three households to meet indoors at home - children aged 12 and under are exempt from the limit 15 people from an unlimited number of households to meet in a private garden Theatres and concert halls to reopen, with social distancing of 1m (3ft) required Removing the restrictions on sound levels of music at indoor venues Conferences and exhibitions to resume Hair and beauty salons to operate without requirements for appointments and overlapping appointments to be permitted Social distancing legal requirement to be reduced to 1m indoors, and removed for all outdoor activities MoT centres to resume normal services, allowing customers to be present in testing halls The executive previously said that it intended to remove the so-called ""bubble"" caring provision if it approved the relaxations for increasing numbers of people allowed to meet at home. Although mandatory use of face coverings in England ended on 19 July, that does not apply in Northern Ireland Although mandatory use of face coverings in England ended on 19 July, that does not apply in Northern Ireland. Ministers have discussed the issue in recent days but they are moving more cautiously with lifting that rule. They did put in place an indicative date of 26 July, which would see face coverings no longer compulsory in places of worship or for students in school classrooms in the new term - but that has yet to be signed off by ministers. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered 'We've lost count of the performances postponed' Ministers are due to review the wearing face coverings in places of worship at next Thursday's executive meeting. Looking at ending the mandatory use of face coverings more widely is unlikely to be discussed by ministers until a meeting on 12 August. Masks have been legally required in Northern Ireland on public transport, in shops and in a range of other settings since last summer, with a limited number of exemptions. That is not entirely clear. Decisions on easing or imposing restrictions must be agreed by the five parties in the executive. They have to consider advice from health officials about the spread of the variant, as well as social and economic effects of restrictions on the public. The first and deputy first ministers have indicated that they will meet again on 12 August to look at lifting requirements for face coverings in other settings, the requirement for self-isolation and travel.

Here is a round-up of the latest Covid developments:  We will be back with more tomorrow. Our coverage today has been brought to you by Vanessa Barford, Francesca Gillett, Hamish Mackay, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and George Wright.  Many young adults are still to get their first vaccine - despite the fact all over-18s are now eligible - prompting calls for more to do so. Almost 90% of all UK adults have had a first dose and about 70% are fully vaccinated. But about 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - haven't been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. Under-30s only became eligible for the Covid vaccine in June. Half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to those in their 20s. The vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Read more here. Labour has said the government must produce a ""clear, unambiguous list"" of those workers who could avoid self-isolating. Shadow Business Minister Seema Malhotra said it made sense to exempt ""certain fully vaccinated professionals"" - like those in the emergency services -  from self-isolation rules through a targeted test scheme. However, she said the government had made a mess of its own policy and ""is undermining the effectiveness of the rule change"". ""If ministers don't know or can't decide what the plan is, how can employers possibly be expected to understand what's required of them?"" she added.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 The government is planning to lift the rule to self-isolate for people who are fully vaccinated on 16 August. Not everyone will be double-jabbed by then - especially younger people - so it means many people will still be required to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone with Covid. But Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, says ministers should bring forward this date. Two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had both jabs, he points out - and the Office for National Statistics antibody study found ""40-50%"" of un-vaccinated people were showing signs of having had the virus and so had a ""degree of immunity"". Prof Hunter told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: ""Given the damage this policy is doing, I can't see any public health reason why we shouldn't actually stop requiring quarantining of casual contacts. ""The emphasis is on casual. Clearly if your husband, partner or children you live with have Covid, then that's a totally different issue and I think we need to continue."" He added: ""If you haven't been vaccinated and you haven't had a double vaccine, then the risks are higher and I can see some value in continuing with (self-isolating)."" A family member visits his relative's grave at a cemetery for Covid victims in Jakarta The World Health Organization has urged Indonesia to retain existing Covid restrictions and even to expand them across the country, pointing to a steep rise in deaths and infections. The agency issued the warning two days after President Joko Widodo pledged to gradually ease the measures because of falling case numbers in some regions. But epidemiologists have questioned the Indonesian leader's plan, saying there's a lack of testing outside the capital, Jakarta. This week, daily deaths hit
record highs of more than 1,300 - among the highest tolls in the world. Indonesia's daily positivity rate, the proportion of people
tested who are infected, has averaged 30% over the past week
even as cases numbers have dropped. A level above 20% meant ""very
high"" transmissibility, the WHO said. ""Indonesia is currently facing a very high transmission
level, and it is indicative of the utmost importance of
implementing stringent public health and social measures,
especially movement restrictions, throughout the country,"" it
said. Earlier in the week, Indonesia's medical association said the healthcare system was at risk of collapse due to rising hospital admissions coupled with the deaths of medical staff due to Covid. This video can not be played Dawn Butler suspended from Commons for calling PM a liar Labour MP Dawn Butler has been ordered to leave the House of Commons for the rest of the day after she refused to withdraw accusations that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has lied during the pandemic. She said it was dangerous to lie during a pandemic and that Boris Johnson had ""lied to the House and the country over and over again"". Acting Deputy Speaker Judith Cummins asked the MP to ""reflect on her words and perhaps correct the record"". Ms Butler replied: ""At the end of the day, the prime minister has lied to this House time and time again and it's funny that we get in trouble in this place for calling out the lie, rather than the person lying"". The acting deputy speaker again asked the MP to withdraw her remarks but she replied: ""I have reflected on my words and somebody needs to tell the truth in this House that the prime minister has lied"". It is considered not within the boundaries of parliamentary etiquette to call another member a liar. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Just shy of
40,000 new infections have been confirmed in the UK governmentâs daily Covid
update. That is significant â it is the first time since the rise in infection
rates took off that we have seen a dip in cases compared to the same day a week
ago. Last Thursday 48,500 cases were reported. We should be
careful about reading too much into this. It is just one day and the impact of
the lifting of most restrictions in England and Scotland on 19 July has yet to
take effect. But
nonetheless it offers further evidence that cases will peak somewhere around
the expected levels as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by natural
infection and vaccination. The hope of
government scientists was always that by this stage we would be seeing the
first signs of a plateau. In recent weeks infection rates have not been growing
as quickly as they were at the end of June. And now we
have the first sign that growth may have stopped. We should expect that to be
temporary. The modelling suggests we will soon get a further rise from the 19
July relaxing and further mixing that ensues. But it is at
least a tiny sign that this summer wave could be tamed, before there is a threat
of the NHS being overwhelmed to the extent that restrictions may have to be
reintroduced. A fresh wave of Covid could pose a risk to the euro zone's economic recovery, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said. Her warning comes after the bank hinted at an even longer period of monetary support. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is becoming dominant in Europe, leading to a surge in cases in many countries. ""The reopening of large parts of the economy is supporting a
vigorous bounce-back in the services sector,"" said Lagarde. ""But the Delta
variant of the coronavirus could dampen this recovery in
services, especially in tourism and hospitality."" She added that ECB forecasts from June had included an assumption that some measures
to contain the pandemic would continue through the third and
fourth quarters of this year. A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk.

"LiveLiveWorkers exempt from isolation to be revealed laterThe list of exemptions will be ""very narrow"", Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tells the BBC.UK","A record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in week to 14 July Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi defended the figure, saying self-isolation was the second most important tool, after vaccines, for fighting Covid The food industry says rising numbers of self-isolating staff mean shops are facing serious challenges as they try to keep shelves stocked A list of workers able to skip self-isolation if fully vaccinated will be revealed later, Kwarteng says The Royal College of Nursing tells the BBC staff are ""angry"" and deserve a bigger increase Women quarantining in UK hotels will now have female guards, when possible, after allegations of sexual harassment The UK reports 39,906 new coronavirus cases and 84 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Lauren Turner We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day - thanks for joining us. Here is a round-up of the latest Covid developments:  We will be back with more tomorrow. Our coverage today has been brought to you by Vanessa Barford, Francesca Gillett, Hamish Mackay, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and George Wright.  Many young adults are still to get their first vaccine - despite the fact all over-18s are now eligible - prompting calls for more to do so. Almost 90% of all UK adults have had a first dose and about 70% are fully vaccinated. But about 34% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England - about three million people - haven't been vaccinated at all. In Scotland, about 30% are not yet vaccinated. Under-30s only became eligible for the Covid vaccine in June. Half of all under-30s in England - more than four million people - received a first dose in the three weeks after the vaccination programme was opened to those in their 20s. The vaccination rate is still climbing for this group in England and Scotland. Read more here. Labour has said the government must produce a ""clear, unambiguous list"" of those workers who could avoid self-isolating. Shadow Business Minister Seema Malhotra said it made sense to exempt ""certain fully vaccinated professionals"" - like those in the emergency services -  from self-isolation rules through a targeted test scheme. However, she said the government had made a mess of its own policy and ""is undermining the effectiveness of the rule change"". ""If ministers don't know or can't decide what the plan is, how can employers possibly be expected to understand what's required of them?"" she added.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 The government is planning to lift the rule to self-isolate for people who are fully vaccinated on 16 August. Not everyone will be double-jabbed by then - especially younger people - so it means many people will still be required to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone with Covid. But Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, says ministers should bring forward this date. Two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had both jabs, he points out - and the Office for National Statistics antibody study found ""40-50%"" of un-vaccinated people were showing signs of having had the virus and so had a ""degree of immunity"". Prof Hunter told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: ""Given the damage this policy is doing, I can't see any public health reason why we shouldn't actually stop requiring quarantining of casual contacts. ""The emphasis is on casual. Clearly if your husband, partner or children you live with have Covid, then that's a totally different issue and I think we need to continue."" He added: ""If you haven't been vaccinated and you haven't had a double vaccine, then the risks are higher and I can see some value in continuing with (self-isolating)."" A family member visits his relative's grave at a cemetery for Covid victims in Jakarta The World Health Organization has urged Indonesia to retain existing Covid restrictions and even to expand them across the country, pointing to a steep rise in deaths and infections. The agency issued the warning two days after President Joko Widodo pledged to gradually ease the measures because of falling case numbers in some regions. But epidemiologists have questioned the Indonesian leader's plan, saying there's a lack of testing outside the capital, Jakarta. This week, daily deaths hit
record highs of more than 1,300 - among the highest tolls in the world. Indonesia's daily positivity rate, the proportion of people
tested who are infected, has averaged 30% over the past week
even as cases numbers have dropped. A level above 20% meant ""very
high"" transmissibility, the WHO said. ""Indonesia is currently facing a very high transmission
level, and it is indicative of the utmost importance of
implementing stringent public health and social measures,
especially movement restrictions, throughout the country,"" it
said. Earlier in the week, Indonesia's medical association said the healthcare system was at risk of collapse due to rising hospital admissions coupled with the deaths of medical staff due to Covid. This video can not be played Dawn Butler suspended from Commons for calling PM a liar Labour MP Dawn Butler has been ordered to leave the House of Commons for the rest of the day after she refused to withdraw accusations that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has lied during the pandemic. She said it was dangerous to lie during a pandemic and that Boris Johnson had ""lied to the House and the country over and over again"". Acting Deputy Speaker Judith Cummins asked the MP to ""reflect on her words and perhaps correct the record"". Ms Butler replied: ""At the end of the day, the prime minister has lied to this House time and time again and it's funny that we get in trouble in this place for calling out the lie, rather than the person lying"". The acting deputy speaker again asked the MP to withdraw her remarks but she replied: ""I have reflected on my words and somebody needs to tell the truth in this House that the prime minister has lied"". It is considered not within the boundaries of parliamentary etiquette to call another member a liar. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Just shy of
40,000 new infections have been confirmed in the UK governmentâs daily Covid
update. That is significant â it is the first time since the rise in infection
rates took off that we have seen a dip in cases compared to the same day a week
ago. Last Thursday 48,500 cases were reported. We should be
careful about reading too much into this. It is just one day and the impact of
the lifting of most restrictions in England and Scotland on 19 July has yet to
take effect. But
nonetheless it offers further evidence that cases will peak somewhere around
the expected levels as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by natural
infection and vaccination. The hope of
government scientists was always that by this stage we would be seeing the
first signs of a plateau. In recent weeks infection rates have not been growing
as quickly as they were at the end of June. And now we
have the first sign that growth may have stopped. We should expect that to be
temporary. The modelling suggests we will soon get a further rise from the 19
July relaxing and further mixing that ensues. But it is at
least a tiny sign that this summer wave could be tamed, before there is a threat
of the NHS being overwhelmed to the extent that restrictions may have to be
reintroduced. A fresh wave of Covid could pose a risk to the euro zone's economic recovery, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said. Her warning comes after the bank hinted at an even longer period of monetary support. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is becoming dominant in Europe, leading to a surge in cases in many countries. ""The reopening of large parts of the economy is supporting a
vigorous bounce-back in the services sector,"" said Lagarde. ""But the Delta
variant of the coronavirus could dampen this recovery in
services, especially in tourism and hospitality."" She added that ECB forecasts from June had included an assumption that some measures
to contain the pandemic would continue through the third and
fourth quarters of this year. A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week. Venues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications. Ministers however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk. From Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. Ministers will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen. If given the go-ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately. The executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to 10 people, from no more than three households. A decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting. Read more here. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson has said there is no need for the public to be stockpiling due to fears that firms could grind to a halt because of the high numbers of staff isolating. ""I don't think there's any need for members of the public to be stockpiling what they buy. There's plenty of food in the country,"" Dickinson said. ""What we're seeing is pockets of issues in specific places where case numbers are particularly high and the most important thing is that the government acts now before the situation does get more serious, so that we don't see more empty shelves in more places."" Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. Read more here:Supermarkets say shortages are not widespread We have a bit more from thegovernment coronavirus figures,external. They show a total of 325,223 people tested positive for coronavirus in the last seven days, up 63,391 - or 24.2% - on the week before. Meanwhile, 387 people have died within 28 days of a positive test in the last week, up by 130 - or 50.6% - on the previous seven days. The UK has reported 39,906 new positive Covid cases in the last 24 hours. And there have been 84 further deaths, within 28 days of a positive test. Katharine Da CostaBBC health correspondent Covid infections among people aged 20-29 are at the highest level on record across any age group since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Public Health England. In the week to 18 July, the seven-day case rate among this age group was 1154.7 per 100,000 population. The lowest case rates were in people aged 80 and above, with a seven-day rate of 60.6 per 100,000 population. Cases have increased across all regions in England with the highest seven-day average in the North East at 951.7 per 100,000 people compared to the lowest at 423.1 in the South East. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England, urged everyone in their 20s to come forward for two doses of the vaccine. âIt is vital we all remain cautious,"" she said. ""Remember that meeting outside is safer than inside, get two doses of the vaccine as soon as you can, isolate if you are told to by NHS Test and Trace and if you show symptoms stay home and get a PCR test. ""We all still have a part to play, Covid-19 has not gone away. âThanks to the vaccine, hospital admissions and deaths are not growing as quickly as previous waves. However, they are on the rise and we continue to closely monitor the data.â Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government risks ""losing social consent"" for isolation if it does not immediately bring forward the relaxation of quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated. It comes after a record 618,903 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 14 July. Hunt, a Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee, said ministers must bring forward the scheduled end of isolation for all fully vaccinated contacts who test negative from 16 August. Without ending that requirement and replacing it with testing ""we risk losing social consent for this very, very important weapon against the virus"", he said. Self-isolation is still one of the main tools being used to try and stop Covid spreading. At the moment, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you have symptoms, test positive for Covid, live with someone who tests positive or has symptoms, or are told to isolate by contact-tracers. You must also isolate if you arrive in the UK from a red list country, or from an amber list country and are not fully vaccinated. If you are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app saying you have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus, you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work,even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. However, the UK government has not yet confirmed which workers are included in this exemption. A list is expected to be published later today. BBC Radio 5 Live The owner of a chain of cocktail bars says he had to close one of them because staff left their phones together - and they were all pinged by the NHS Covid app. Martin Greenhow runs Mojo, which has branches in Leeds, Harrogate, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester. He tells Radio 5 Live how the Liverpool bar had to shut for a week after every member of staff was alerted by the NHS app and asked to self-isolate. The closure has cost him tens of thousands of pounds. âWe test all our staff on a daily basis,"" he says. ""I donât instruct them to ignore the ping, I give them the option. Itâs at their discretion. ""We will be as altruistic as we can, but fundamentally if a business runs out of money it runs out of all opportunity to do that. âWe ask them to behave in a grown-up, adult manner, which I think the government should expect the entire country to do and stop trying to nanny them.â He adds his business is also being affected by staff shortages in the supply chain, which he says are ""bringing the country to a grinding halt"". Athletes have already arrived in Tokyo for the Olympics With the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics due to start on
Friday, more than 80 people associated with the Games have tested positive. The head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has not
ruled out cancelling the games in the light of rising infections. The BBC Reality Check team has been looking into whether Japan has
Covid under control. You can read what they found here. First Covid vaccination doses are now being offered
without an appointment on the Isle of Man. The first of three walk-in clinics is open between 09:00 and
12:00 BST at the Douglas vaccination hub. A government spokesman said doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca
jab would be offered to anyone aged 18 and over on a ""first-come, first-served basis"". About 89% of adults on the island have already received
their first jab, while about 78% have now been given both. Read more

"Sports not accountable on head injuries, say MPs","Elite rugby players may be more at risk from brain changes than other people, a study suggests Sport has been allowed to ""mark its own homework"" on reducing the risks of brain injury, an MPs' inquiry says. Its report calls for a standard definition of concussion that all sports must use, and a paid medical officer at every major sporting event. It comes asthe first study to scan elite rugby players' brains,externalsuggests one in four could be at risk of small abnormalities. But the long-term effects on brain health are not clear, researchers say. And they stress that there are many health benefits to taking part in sport, which must also be taken into account. The inquiry, carried out by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee of MPs,,externalheard evidence from former athletes, scientists, doctors, players' unions and the governing bodies for various sports. It found ""unaccountable"" governing bodies had failed to address the issue of brain injury in their sports, and said the government had ""failed to take action on player welfare"". As a result, its report said, the safety of athletes could be easily lost when funding for individual sports depended on how good their protocols looked on paper, but not in practice. ""We've been shocked by evidence from athletes who suffered head trauma, putting their future health on the line in the interests of achieving sporting success for the UK,"" committee chairman Julian Knight said. Heading a football regularly over many years has been linked to brain damage ""The Health and Safety Executive is responsible by law. However, risk management appears to have been delegated to the national governing bodies, such as the FA (Football Association). ""That is a dereliction of duty which must change,"" said Mr Knight. He added that at grassroots level, the committee had found ""negligible effort to track brain injuries"" and the long-term impacts of them. There is mounting evidence thatheading a football repeatedly over many years may cause brain damage. And previous research has found thatformer professional footballers are three-and-a-half times more likely to die of dementiathan people of the same age in the general population. But there is still no definitive proof that one causes the other. The issue hit the headlines after former England player Jeff Astle died aged 59 of dementia nearly 20 years ago, and a coroner ruled that he had the brain of a boxer which had been damaged by years of heading heavy leather footballs. During the inquiry, his daughter Dawn Astle told MPs that she felt let down by the lack of research that had taken place since. ""I want to make sure that the game is safe, safe for players now, players in the future, and children coming into the game. Sport just has not done enough and they should hang their heads in shame, in my opinion,"" she said. In rugby, the potential for players to have mild brain injuries from heavy contact is much greater - particularly in rucks and tackles. In a study of 44 elite rugby players from seven clubs, funded by the Drake Foundation, brain scans showed rugby players were more likely to have suffered changes to their brains than other athletes in non-contact sports, and non-athletes. In fact, 10 of the players had signs of damage on scans, including small tears in blood vessels - and these were seen in players with and without a recent head injury. In half of the players, scans showed unexpected changes in the brain's shape (or white matter volume). Female rugby players were also included in the study, and head injuries will now be assessed differently in their elite league There was no evidence that any of these players had poorer cognitive function or memory than other people in the study. Prof David Sharp, senior study author from Imperial College London, said: ""What is not clear at this stage is the long-term clinical impact of these changes. ""Further research is needed to understand the long-term implications of repeated head injuries experienced during a rugby career and to provide more accurate ways to assess risk for an individual."" Dr Richard Sylvester, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery and Homerton University Hospital, said: ""You can find an abnormality if you look hard enough - but what is the relevance of it?"" The Rugby Football Union (RFU) has announced a series of measures to reduce head impacts by players in training and matches. It says it will agree a new framework for contact training, and introduce off-field assessments of head impacts in the women's game - this already exists in men's rugby.

"Consumer charity, dating and pet spending surges","The British Heart Foundation took Â£1m on the day many non-essential shops reopened in April Britons spent more money on charity, dating and their pets as Covid restrictions continued to ease, according to data from Nationwide. Spending on holidays, eating and drinking, leisure, gardening, and clothing also surged from April to June, the building society said. Contactless and mobile payments also continued to pick up pace, Nationwide added. However, spending fell in general retailers across the board. The building society looked at hundreds of millions of transactions by its customers from April to June, and compared them with the previous quarter. By far the biggest surge in spending was on holidays, including a massive increase in spending on UK campsites and caravan parks, as quarantine restrictions remained for many foreign destinations. Spending on eating and drinking also surged to more than Â£1bn as restrictions on restaurants were lifted. However, general retailers and department stores continued to be hit by the pandemic, with a massive 91% drop in spending by Nationwide customers. However, there was a 16% increase in spending on charity - dwarfing the spending in department stores. This included charity shops and charitable donations, said Nationwide's head of payments Mark Nalder. The building society expects that trend to continue. Charity shops saw a huge spike in spending when they were allowed to reopen on 12 April, with the British Heart Foundation alone taking Â£1m in a single day on that Monday, said Charity Retail Association's chief executive Robin Osterley. ""There was a lot of pent up demand that continued on,"" he said. Sales at charity shops have continued to boom, ranging between 5% and 10% higher than two years ago. During lockdown people had a chance to reflect on what they really needed, and so were donating after clear-outs, but they also had a think about how they wanted to spend their money, Mr Osterley added. ""It's all part of people thinking: 'There has to be a better way. We can't go back to how we were [before the pandemic]',"" he said. People who were in a financial position to make a choice were attracted by the sustainability aspect of buying from charity shops. They also liked the fact that their money was going to a good cause, he said. There were also people who were struggling financially, and had to buy from charity shops to make ends meet. There was also a surge in people looking for romance, as spending on online dating grew. Between April and June people spent Â£3.8m, a rise of 5% from the previous quarter. Britons also showed how much they loved their pets, splurging Â£124.5m on gifts and keeping them fed and healthy. Millions of householdsbought new pets during the pandemic, prompting lawyers to say that couples should consider a legal agreement overwho should get custody of the pet, in the event of a break-up. But the biggest growth in essential spending was on public transport and taxis as restrictions eased in the second quarter, followed by motoring and fuel and car charging. The ways that people paid for goods and services also continued to evolve. Contactless payments, including via mobile phone, were already booming during the pandemic, and that growth continued in the second quarter. Mobile payments were up 76%, while contactless card payments grew 46%. Payments were still dominated by debit cards despite slower growth, however. Mr Nalder said that although the growth in contactless payments meant more convenience for many, he warned thata decline in cash useseen during the pandemic could become entrenched to thedisadvantage of people who rely on it.

Promise to transform Welsh NHS to cope with demand,"Wales' health minister has unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment Average waiting times at emergency departments are the longest they have been in nine years, the latest figures show. The Welsh Ambulance Trust also received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. More than 600,000 patients are waiting for treatment in Wales after record backlogs during the pandemic. It comes as Wales' health minister pledged to ""transform"" the delivery of urgent care. Eluned Morgan unveiled a strategy to reduce the number of people seeking hospital treatment. It includes annual funding of Â£25m to ""support people to access the right care in the right place"". The strategy comes after unions criticised the Welsh government's planned3% pay rise for NHS staff. Coroner concerned over emergency staffing levels Ambulance service pushed to limit in heatwave The figures, published on Thursday, show the Welsh Ambulance Trust received more calls in June than in any month since the pandemic began. There were 41,454 calls to the service last month, an average of 1,382 per day. A record percentage of the calls received - 7.9% - were so-called ""red calls"" where incidents are classed as immediately life-threatening. Meanwhile the average number of people admitted to emergency departments in Wales every day in June was 3,136 - the second-highest figure since comparable records began in April 2012. Targets state 95% of all patients visiting A&E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours and no patient should wait longer than 12 hours. In June, 70.6% of patients spent less than four hours in A&E, a small drop on the previous month and 7.4% lower than June 2019, before the pandemic. There was also an increase of 6.4% in the number of people waiting more than 12 hours compared with the previous month, and an increase of 43% compared to June 2019. Average A&E waiting times increased to the longest since comparable records began in April 2012. The figures showed that in May, 608,062 people were waiting to start treatment - more than 19% of the Welsh population and the highest figure since comparable data was first gathered in 2011. It represents an increase of more than 5,000 since April. In May, 227,753 patients had been waiting more than 36 weeks (nine months) - an increase of more than 5,000 compared with April, and nearly nine times more than pre-pandemic total from February 2020 (25,634). Responding to the data, Ms Morgan said: ""The latest data shows the pressure on emergency care services is growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and putting a huge strain on NHS staff. Philip Banfield, chairman of the Welsh consultant committee at the British Medical Association Cymru, stressed that staff needed ""the tools to do the job"". ""There was a brief time at the start of the pandemic when people said: 'What do you need to do the job?' And we need to go back to that stage,"" he said. Ms Morgan said demand on Wales' GPs and emergency departments had continued to grow beyond levels seen before the pandemic, adding: ""Staff are under real pressure."" The government, she said, wanted to make sure everyone could access the ""high quality care they need in the right place, the first time"". ""Often people feel they have no option but to go to their GP, call 999 or go to their nearest emergency department for advice or treatment,"" Ms Morgan said. ""But under our new plans, people with urgent care needs could be treated elsewhere by the many different health professionals working in NHS Wales."" Health boards have had funding to set up new ""urgent primary care centres"", she said, where people can be seen without the need for a GP appointment or to go to A&E. She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersambulance services saw a 45% rise in calls on Monday compared with the previous week. She urged people to think ""very carefully"" about whether their accident was ""genuinely"" an emergency to help reduce waiting times. Last month, Ms Morgan welcomed therollout of a 111 service system,externalfor people in north Wales to get ""non-urgent medical advice"". Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief A&E phone triage scheme 'the way forward' ""What we're trying to do is make sure the public understands that there are alternatives to accident, emergency and GP services,"" she said. The service has now been rolled out to all health board areas across Wales, except for the Cardiff and Vale area, which is expected to come later this financial year. Additional money will also be made available for schemes to help people return home from hospital, reducing unnecessarily long stays and freeing up essential bed capacity. The summer holidays and hot weather, along with the easing of lockdown restrictions and an increase in Covid cases, has heaped more pressure on the NHS. The Welsh Conservatives called on the health minister to urgently come out with a plan, calling the numbers ""extremely concerning"". ""Without treatment, people simply cannot go about their daily lives,"" Russell George said. Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcements of extra funding and better signposting, but said problems were ""even deeper than before. ""I'll be looking for evidence of changes that make a difference in the long term, building more sustainable services at the heart of our communities,"" Rhun ap Iorwerth said. Olwen Williams says one of the challenges is staffing Olwen Williams, vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, described the proposals as ""a wonderful opportunity"". ""Care in the community is definitely the way forward,"" she said. ""And we need our primary care teams, our ambulance services, our community services, social services and our medical services all to work together to ensure that individuals get the right care in the right place at the right time."" Dr Williams added there were ""two big challenges"" involved. She said the first was whether people would accept the change of ""care closer to home"". The second, she explained, was to do with staffing, and how health boards would deliver the changes. Wales Ambulance Service chief executive Jason Killens said a combination of factors in recent days had put the service under ""extreme pressure"". ""It's not just here in Wales that we're seeing this unprecedented level of demand on the emergency ambulance service, and indeed on the NHS as a whole,"" Mr Killens said. ""Our staff have been doing fantastic work for 18 months through the pandemic, and with this warmer weather, they are working in extremely difficult conditions and I pay tribute to them because they've all been fantastic.""

Shops try to keep shelves stocked as staff isolate,"Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products. The Co-op said it was ""running low on some products"", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it ""might not always"" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary. The Co-op said items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer were worst affected. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was ""concerned about instances of shortages"". ""I don't want people to get the impression that every shelf in every supermarket is bare - that is not the case but we are certainly concerned about instances of shortages, we are looking at the supply chains of critical industries and we are reviewing that situation,"" he added. A record 618,903 people in England and Wales were ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app in the week to 14 July. Who needs to self-isolate and who is exempt? What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Supermarkets and other sectors, including hospitality and transport, have said growing numbers of staff have been affected which means they have to self-isolate for 10 days. Some companies have reduced opening hours to cope with the staff shortages or shut parts of the business. Firms want people who have been doubly vaccinated or have daily tests to be able to return to work. Mr Kwarteng said that the government would publish guidance later on which sectors would be exempt, although he declined to comment on whether it would include the food industry. Many of Thursday's newspapers carried pictures of empty shelves in some supermarket branches - with some describing panic buying of certain items - but industry sources told the BBC that so far, food shortages were not a systemic problem. Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said photographs of empty shelves in supermarkets were ""isolated incidents"". It is understood that Tesco is experiencing low availability across a small number of products due to the rise in the number of workers self-isolating as well as the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, the Co-op said it was being hit ""by some patchy disruption to our deliveries and store operations"". ""We are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly,"" it added. It is understood that items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer are worst affected. Lidl said the rise in numbers of employees having to self-isolate was starting to hit operations, but it was working to minimise disruption. About 1,000 Iceland employees - almost 4% of its staff - are currently absent for Covid-related reasons, with the north of England most affected. Of these, 27% have tested positive for Covid, while 64% have been ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told to isolate. Iceland is recruiting 2,000 temporary staff to help with the shortages while the Co-op will take on 3,000 extra workers. Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""We're working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now. ""As always, our focus is on maintaining the best possible range of products and high levels of service for our customers."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the increasing number of workers being told to isolate was ""putting increasing pressure on retailers' ability to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked"". A fall in the number of available HGV drivers, exacerbated by the rising numbers being forced to isolate, was also ""resulting in minor disruption to some supply chains"", the BRC's Andrew Opie said. The Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of 100,000 HGV drivers in the UK due to workers returning to Europe following Brexit as well as delays in testing hauliers for Covid. Meanwhile, the British Meat Processors Association said some members were seeing between 5% and 10% of their workforce ""pinged"" by the app. Under current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine. If someone is told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace they are legally obliged to do so. But if someone is ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app the requirement to self-isolate is only advisory. Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, which supplies produce to hospitals, care home and prisons as well as restaurants, said it was asking workers who have been ""pinged"" to come back to work after they have taken a negative PCR test. ""We have a process of doing lateral flow tests daily away from their workplace and if that is negative then they can proceed with their work,"" Mr Selley said. Backlash as pinged staff rules called unworkable 'Pingdemic' threatens shop hours, say supermarkets But Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: ""The rules are clear and I think they should be followed."" Earlier this week, the government announced a ""small number"" of fully vaccinated critical workers, including health and care staff, would be allowed to continue to do their job even if they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive for Covid. The prime minister has said he does not want to extend the exemption too widely in order to limit the spread of the virus. The government has argued it is necessary to keep isolation rules largely unchanged until 16 August. From that date, people who are fully vaccinated and under-18s will be able to avoid self-isolating by taking daily Covid tests. Dozens of councils across Englandhave also been forced to suspend bin collections due to staff self-isolating. On Wednesday, BP said lorry driver shortages and isolating staffhad caused fuel supply issues at some of its petrol stations. The oil firm said shortages of unleaded petrol and diesel had seen a ""handful"" of its UK sites close temporarily. Have you experienced shops struggling to keep their shelves stocked?

Self-isolation hits bin collections across countryCampaigners are worried fly-tipping will increase as people struggle to get rid of waste.England,"Somerset is short of drivers for its recycling lorries Dozens of councils across England have been forced to suspend bin collections due to staff self-isolating. Most have temporarily stopped garden waste pick-ups, but some recycling collections have also been hit. Some councils have said they are unsure when services will return to normal. The Local Government Association (LGA) said if Covid rates increased further, many would have to prioritise services that protect the most vulnerable. Collections are also beingaffected by a shortage of HGV driversunrelated to self-isolation. Campaigners are worried the lack of collections will lead to more fly-tipping as people struggle to get rid of their waste. A spokesman for the Anti Fly-Tipping Association said: ""This news is obviously going to have huge knock-on effects, resulting in many more fly-tipping incidents which is ulimately going to cost councils just as much, if not more, in the long-run to clear up."" In Somersetat least 24 staff had been ""pinged"" by the NHS Test and Trace app, forcing a delay to collections. Bin collections across England have been disrupted due to staff self-isolation In Barnsley, Doncaster, and Redcar and Cleveland garden waste collections have been suspended, with no end date given. Barnsley Council said staff absences were the highest since the start of the pandemic and that they were trying to move staff from non-essential services to focus on emptying general waste and recycling bins. Redcar and Cleveland Council said: ""The current regulations have meant 21 staff have started a self-isolation period this week alone, to add to employees who were already self-isolating. ""These include a high number of trained drivers who cannot safely be replaced by other staff."" Bin collection issues have been reported in at least 25 council areas including:Coventry, Liverpool, Manchester, Stockport,Stockton, Solihull, Derbyshire Dales, South Oxfordshire, Stoke on Trent, South Devon, Tower Hamlets and Milton Keynes. LGA chairman James Jamieson said: ""It is clear that the current high prevalence of Covid-19 has resulted in large numbers of close contacts being required to self-isolate, which is placing pressure on some council services due to staff shortages. ""Most councils have been able to keep services running but there is a concern that, if rates increase further, many will be forced to prioritise services that protect the most vulnerable in their communities.""

Chinese unite online to aid flood victims,"Zhengzhou city was devastated by floods after it saw a year's worth of rainfall in three days Chinese people are using social media to help speed up rescue efforts after deadly floods engulfed Henan province. At least 33 people have diedthere after a year's worth of rain fell in three days in Zhengzhou city. Users of the Weibo social media platform connected people who were stuck or in danger with professional rescue teams and other helpers. However some posts which mention people being trapped or asking for help have been removed from Weibo. The Chinese government employs millions of people to monitor and censor internet activity. Past disasters such as the sinking of a ship on the Yangtze River in 2015 saw some social media posts removed in order to maintain stability and prevent anti-government sentiment. With the floods in Zhengzhou, many people sharedtales of horror and pleaded for help online. In response, thousands of people on social media directed their Weibo posts to emergency rescue teams so that they knew where to go. When news emerged that some trains were being stranded after rail lines had become submerged, people put together lists of each train number and the resources its passengers needed. Some put together text-only versions of critical contact lists, after discovering that people in some areas could not download images because heavy rains had affected internet speeds. People also helped to organise streams of information so that it was up-to-date and clear. According to local media reports, residents living near the Tielu Railway Station also delivered food and bottled water to passengers stuck in a train after a related hashtag was viewed more than 800 million times. This video can not be played Video showed floodwater rising on a busy commuter train While some focused on giving emergency rescue advice, others shared information on mental health support and personal hygiene tips. A hashtag related to menstruation amid the floods,externalhad more than 200 million views, as doctors and social workers reminded women to change their sanitary pads frequently to avoid the risk of infection. Others posted addresses to locations where women could collect free sanitary products. But there have also been cases where posts about the floods have been censored. These are mainly from individuals requesting help, rather than people criticising the government. Free Weibo, a site that determines whether posts have been censored, said these posts included reports of people trapped at a school, elderly people in need of oxygen and thousands of people trapped on a campus. One post asked whether authorities should be held accountable.

"Consumer charity, dating and pet spending surgesPeople have been spending more on non-essentials as Covid restrictions ease, Nationwide says.Business","The British Heart Foundation took Â£1m on the day many non-essential shops reopened in April Britons spent more money on charity, dating and their pets as Covid restrictions continued to ease, according to data from Nationwide. Spending on holidays, eating and drinking, leisure, gardening, and clothing also surged from April to June, the building society said. Contactless and mobile payments also continued to pick up pace, Nationwide added. However, spending fell in general retailers across the board. The building society looked at hundreds of millions of transactions by its customers from April to June, and compared them with the previous quarter. By far the biggest surge in spending was on holidays, including a massive increase in spending on UK campsites and caravan parks, as quarantine restrictions remained for many foreign destinations. Spending on eating and drinking also surged to more than Â£1bn as restrictions on restaurants were lifted. However, general retailers and department stores continued to be hit by the pandemic, with a massive 91% drop in spending by Nationwide customers. However, there was a 16% increase in spending on charity - dwarfing the spending in department stores. This included charity shops and charitable donations, said Nationwide's head of payments Mark Nalder. The building society expects that trend to continue. Charity shops saw a huge spike in spending when they were allowed to reopen on 12 April, with the British Heart Foundation alone taking Â£1m in a single day on that Monday, said Charity Retail Association's chief executive Robin Osterley. ""There was a lot of pent up demand that continued on,"" he said. Sales at charity shops have continued to boom, ranging between 5% and 10% higher than two years ago. During lockdown people had a chance to reflect on what they really needed, and so were donating after clear-outs, but they also had a think about how they wanted to spend their money, Mr Osterley added. ""It's all part of people thinking: 'There has to be a better way. We can't go back to how we were [before the pandemic]',"" he said. People who were in a financial position to make a choice were attracted by the sustainability aspect of buying from charity shops. They also liked the fact that their money was going to a good cause, he said. There were also people who were struggling financially, and had to buy from charity shops to make ends meet. There was also a surge in people looking for romance, as spending on online dating grew. Between April and June people spent Â£3.8m, a rise of 5% from the previous quarter. Britons also showed how much they loved their pets, splurging Â£124.5m on gifts and keeping them fed and healthy. Millions of householdsbought new pets during the pandemic, prompting lawyers to say that couples should consider a legal agreement overwho should get custody of the pet, in the event of a break-up. But the biggest growth in essential spending was on public transport and taxis as restrictions eased in the second quarter, followed by motoring and fuel and car charging. The ways that people paid for goods and services also continued to evolve. Contactless payments, including via mobile phone, were already booming during the pandemic, and that growth continued in the second quarter. Mobile payments were up 76%, while contactless card payments grew 46%. Payments were still dominated by debit cards despite slower growth, however. Mr Nalder said that although the growth in contactless payments meant more convenience for many, he warned thata decline in cash useseen during the pandemic could become entrenched to thedisadvantage of people who rely on it.

"Fewer flat buyers to face mortgage cladding checksLenders agree to change applications for loans involving buildings below 18m high, the government says.UK Politics","People buying flats in buildings lower than 18m (59ft) in England will no longer have to provide safety details on external walls to get a mortgage, the government has said. Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds welcomed the change, and said it should pave the way for updated industry guidance. It follows concerns over large bills to remove cladding facing many flat owners since the Grenfell Tower fire. But Labour called the height-based stipulation ""arbitrary"". Homeowners to get 15 years to sue shoddy builders What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell survivors condemn new fire safety laws What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? After the 2017 fire in Grenfell Tower, west London, in which 72 people died, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar dangerous cladding. Work to remove the material, as well as fix other safety issues, meant many residents were charged thousands of pounds, often leaving them in negative equity and unable to sell their property. Mortgage lenders began asking for assurances on the safety of external wall systems as a condition of approving mortgage applications. Mortgage applicants were asked to get safety assessors to sign off a form - known as EWS1 - to prove their property is safe. Lenders have been asking for the forms for many different types of buildings, including those without cladding. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. After the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers. But on Wednesday, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said this guidance would now be changed to exempt leaseholders in low-to-medium-rise blocks from this requirement. He said the change followed new advice from fire safety experts commissioned by the government earlier this year. Home fires were at an all-time low, he said, while 91% occurred in houses, bungalows or converted flats. By BBC business presenter Sarah Corker This is an attempt to unlock parts of the property market that have been paralysed by the cladding crisis. It's estimated that up to 3 million flats have been left unsellable because lenders are demanding an EWS1 form. It's left people in low and mid-rise buildings, where the safety risks are deemed as low, unable to move with properties valued at zero. Even blocks with no cladding have been affected. The problem has been compounded by a shortage of fire engineers to carry out the checks and flat-owners have faced long delays obtaining the paperwork. There is an acceptance too that ""extreme risk aversion"" from lenders, insurers, and the wider property industry has resulted in flat-owners across the UK receiving massive bills for work that is not necessary. Lenders have now committed to review their practices on this, but the response from leaseholders has so far been muted. They are waiting for banks to actually change their policies - only then will this policy make a real difference to those caught up in the cladding scandal. Mr Jenrick also said: ""In the small number of cases [in purpose-built tower blocks below 18m] where there are known to be concerns these should be addressed primarily through risk management and mitigation."" He added: ""Fire-risk assessors and lenders should not presume that there is significant risk to life unless there is evidence to support this. ""This would ensure that they respond only to the evidence and adopt a far more proportionate and balanced approach."" Mr Jenrick said he was pleased major lenders had agreed to change their rules, adding: ""I hope and expect other lenders to follow suit swiftly."" The change, which will apply only in England, would influence mortgage lenders' attitudes across the UK, he added. For Labour, shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said there was a ""cosy relationship between developers and the private inspectors they handsomely pay"". She added: ""The government should think again about its arbitrary definition of high-risk buildings.""
