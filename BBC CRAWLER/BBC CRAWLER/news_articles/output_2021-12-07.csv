Gales and snow as Storm Barra sweeps UK,"Sleet and snow fall outside a pharmacy in Biggar, South Lanarkshire Strong winds, heavy rain and snow have hit parts of the UK, as Storm Barra sweeps across the country. Most of the UK was covered by severe yellow weather warnings on Tuesday - with only the far north of Scotland escaping the worst weather. Gales and blizzards have been reported, with wind gusts reaching 86mph at Aberdaron in Gwynedd. About 3,200 homes in north-east Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have lost power. But Storm Barra is not expected to be as bad as its predecessor, Arwen, which hit the UK 11 days ago and left thousands of homes without electricity. About 360 homes are still without power in the North East of England, an area in the path of the new storm. Flood warnings have been issued in28 places across the UK for Wednesday, including in Sunderland, Bournemouth, Aberystwyth and Orkney.

A yellow warning of heavy snow for inland areas of Scotland also until midnight that also lasted until midnight. A yellow warning for wind for parts of south and south-west England, as well as the east coast and south of Wales is still in place - lasting until 18:00 GMT on Wednesday. As Storm Barra swept in from the Atlantic earlier on Tuesday, strong winds with gusts of up to 80mph were recorded in the Republic of Ireland. Schools closed across 12 counties in Ireland and 49,000 homes and businesses were without power.

A further 270 homesare still without power across Wales,and ferries and trains have been cancelled. The storm left 1,700 homes without powerin parts of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshireand also caused school closures and delays across the transport network. A Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks spokesman said: ""We are re-routing the network to restore customer supplies quickly where possible, and all faults will be worked on this evening and into the night."" Snow has already fallen in northern England and southern Scotland. High winds damaged the roof of a school in Stranraer, while a fallen tree blocked the A702 road in South Lanarkshire. Four schools also shut in Dumfries and Galloway. The storm is set to continue eastwards, with travel disruption, power outages and large waves in coastal areas possible, the Met Office said.

Asked whether it was acceptable for people to be without power for as long as they had been, he replied: ""No I don't think it is. Too many people have spent too long without power.""""I think that we need to learn the lessons for the future and make sure that we have better resilience against storms of this kind. It's likely to happen again, we've got to make sure we protect people against it,"" he said. Are you in an area affected by Storm Barra?

US vows robust response amid Ukraine invasion fear,"Putin joined the meeting by video link from Sochi The US says it is preparing ""strong economic and other measures"" over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin spoke. In a video call, President Biden voiced worries over Russian troop build-ups near the border with Ukraine and called for a de-escalation of tensions. Russia says it will not attack. President Putin accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to Russia. More than 90,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. The movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. ANALYSIS:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? After Tuesday's call, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration was preparing specific robust responses in the weeks ahead if they were required. The measures included economic sanctions and other actions such as additional troop deployments to Nato allies in the region and defence equipment for Ukraine. Mr Sullivan refused to be drawn on what the economic measures might be. But he said Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which is not yet in operation, provided ""leverage"" for the US and its allies. ""If Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,"" he told journalists. Earlier reports said US officials had reached agreement with Germany to shut down the pipeline in the event of an invasion. Mr Biden was accompanied by top officials for the call Other possible measures include restrictions on Russia's banks converting roubles into foreign currencies, or even disconnecting Russia from the Swift global financial payment system, reports say. ""Things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now,"" Mr Sullivan added, referring to Western responses to Russia's annexation of Crimea. He also said there was ""a lot of give and take"" in the call and ""no finger-wagging"" but that President Biden was ""crystal clear where the United States stands on all of these issues"". Video footage of the opening moments showed friendly greetings between the US and Russian leaders, before the talks continued behind closed doors. The call was held on a secure video link set up under previous administrations but never used before. President Putin spoke from his residence in the southern resort of Sochi and President Biden from the White House. By Jonathan Marcus of the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter Russia's military option could take a variety of forms from a large incursion, to a significant invasion of the eastern part of Ukraine. One aim would be to bring the main fighting elements of the Ukrainian army to battle and to inflict such a defeat upon them that the Kyiv government has to rethink its position. Invading territory amidst a hostile population has significant risks. Ukraine's armed forces have had some Western weaponry and training and are much improved since 2015. However, Russian forces have also improved over recent years. The firepower Russia is building up is impressive. For all the talk about Ukrainian sovereignty Nato cannot and will not come to Ukraine's aid. And additional weapons supplies might simply contribute to Russia's justification for war. Moscow's calculation of the costs of conflict may also be influenced by previous military deployments. While the West currently sees military engagements through the prism of the strategic defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia may take a very different view. Its operations in Georgia, its seizure of Crimea, its combat in eastern Ukraine - not to mention its involvement in Syria - may all be seen by President Putin as relative victories. Of all the military contingencies, Michael Kofman, of the US Centre for Naval Analyses, still thinks that if it happens it will be big. ""I think Russia is in the best position since 2014 economically, politically, and militarily to execute such an operation, which is not to say it will happen, but simply to suggest that there are the fewest constraints relative to other periods when it has conducted offensive operations."" Read the full analysis Meanwhile, a Kremlin statement said President Putin had stressed that Russia should not be held responsible for tensions because Nato was making ""dangerous attempts to take over Ukrainian territory and increasing its military potential"" on Russia's borders. ""Therefore Russia is seriously interested in getting reliable guarantees fixed in law to rule out the eastward expansion of Nato and the location in countries neighbouring Russia of offensive weapons systems,""the statement added (in Russian).,external The White House said President Biden did not make any guarantees to limit Nato expansion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that, while the talks brought ""no sensations"", he was grateful for President Biden's ""unwavering support"". Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the Reuters news agency that talks between Mr Biden and Mr Putin had enabled ""deterrence and de-escalation"". But he said the focus is to put together a deterrence package to ward off any further escalation from Russia. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether President Putin has made a decision. Presidents Biden and Putin last met in person in Switzerland in June, but made little progress other than to agree to send their ambassadors back and begin a dialogue on nuclear arms control. In a conference call on Monday night, the White House said the leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy had formed a joint strategy ""to impose significant and severe harm on the Russian economy"" should Russia launch an invasion. President Biden spoke to the four European leaders again after his talks with President Putin. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line A large part of the recent Russian military build-up is in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine and then annexed in 2014. Troops are also gathering near Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which are under the control of Russian-backed separatists. More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in seven years of conflict since Russian-backed forces seized large areas of Ukraine's east.

Never-before-seen photos show Epstein-Maxwell bond,"Jurors saw never-before-seen photos of Ms Maxwell with Jeffrey Epstein Prosecutors in Ghislaine Maxwell's trial have presented previously unseen photos linking the socialite to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The evidence to show their closeness came as a third accuser testified that Ms Maxwell, 59, set up paid ""massages"" for Epstein that turned sexual. Ms Maxwell is accused of grooming underage girls for abuse between 1994 and 2004. She has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and seven other charges. Ms Maxwell - who has British, American and French citizenship - has been in a US jail since her arrest last year. She faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Maxwell 'gave schoolgirl outfit to Epstein victim' Prosecutors have called Ms Maxwell and Epstein, her former boyfriend and business associate, ""partners in crime"", presenting documents on Monday showing that he had wired her more than $30m (Â£23m) over an eight-year period. Prosecutors are trying to link Ms Maxwell to Jeffrey Epstein by showing the jury intimate photos like this one Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Jurors on Tuesday were shown the contents of never-before-seen digital evidence seized by the FBI during a 2019 raid on Epstein's Manhattan home. Among them are photographs of two of Ms Maxwell's accusers in various states of undress, and of parts of Epstein's now-infamous Florida mansion, but the trove also contains several pictures of the duo together, sometimes embracing or being intimate with each other. Of particular note are a framed photo sitting on a table that shows the couple kissing and a sketch of Ms Maxwell mounted on a bathroom wall. A ""help wanted"" flyer for massage therapists in the area is included in the trove of evidence. The court also heard the readout of a document registered under Ms Maxwell's name - and found on a hard drive in Epstein's home - that describes the two as ""rarely apart"". ""Jeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun together,"" its unidentified author wrote. ""On top of being partners they are also best of friends."" This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' Also on Tuesday, a woman named Carolyn - now in her 30s - alleged she had multiple sexual encounters with Epstein from age 14 to 18. Named in the Maxwell indictment as ""Minor Victim 4"", she was introduced to the wealthy duo by Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), one of Epstein's most vocal accusers. The witness testified that she had dropped out of school after the seventh grade and was in need of money. Upon their first visit to Epstein's Florida home, both girls participated in a massage that ended with Ms Roberts having sex with their host while Carolyn allegedly watched. A photo of Ghislaine Maxwell hangs in the bathroom of Jeffrey Epstein's Florida home She claimed Ms Maxwell paid her $300 and took her number, later saying she had ""a great body for Mr Epstein and his friends"". Carolyn told the court she went back to the home more than a hundred times, sometimes three times a week, until she turned 18. ""Something sexual happened every single time,"" she said. She testified that Ms Maxwell would often welcome her or provide an update on Epstein's whereabouts, adding that - as she could not pronounce her hostess's first name - she simply called her ""Maxwell"". Ms Maxwell would pay her each time, she added, and paid extra on occasions she brought friends with her. The witness said both adults had known she was very young. She recounted an invitation to visit Epstein's private island when she was 14 years old; she said she refused because she had no passport and her mother would not let her go. Carolyn said she had a child by the time she hit 18 and went back to visit Epstein again. ""He asked me if I had any younger friends, and I said no. And that's when I realized I was too old,"" she said. Defence lawyers for Ms Maxwell have said she is being scapegoated for Epstein's crimes. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend?

Australia joins diplomatic boycott of Beijing games,"Protesters have called for a boycott of the event Australia has said it will join the US in a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in China. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision was in response to ""human rights abuses"" in China's Xinjiang province and ""many other issues that Australia has consistently raised"". Athletes would still attend, he added. China has condemned the US announcement and threatened to retaliate, without giving further details. On Monday, the US said it would not send diplomats to the Games in Beijing over concerns about China's human rights record. US will pay price for Olympics boycott, China says Mr Morrison said it was ""no surprise"" that Australia had joined the boycott, given relations with China had deteriorated in recent years. ""I'm doing it because it's in Australia's national interest,"" he said on Wednesday. ""It's the right thing to do."" He accused China of rejecting opportunities to improve relations, insisting Australia remained open to bilateral talks. The Chinese embassy in Australia responded by saying: ""Mountains cannot stop the river from flowing into the sea. Australia's success at the Beijing Winter Olympics depends on the performance of Australian athletes, not on the attendance of Australian officials, and the political posturingâby some Australian politicians."" It added that the blame for the current state of China-Australia relations ""lies squarely on the Australian side"". Meanwhile at a media briefing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the US of violating ""political neutrality in sport"" and said the proposed boycott was ""based on lies and rumours"". Tensions are high between the two countries. The US has accused China of genocide in its repression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in the western region of Xinjiang - an allegation China has strongly denied. Relations are also strained over China's suppression of political freedoms in Hong Kong, and because of concerns for the Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, who was not seen for weeks after she accused a top government official of assault. Canberra has increasingly come to view China as a security threat amid allegations that Beijing has interfered in Australian politics and society. It has also raised concerns over two Australian citizens who remain imprisoned in China. Pro-democracy writerYang Hengjun has denied chargesof espionage and allegedly faced torture since his arrest in January 2019.Journalist Cheng Lei has been heldwithout charge since August last year. Other countries - including Canada and Japan - are also said to be considering diplomatic boycotts of the Games. New Zealand has confirmed it will not send officials due to Covid concerns. The Australian Olympic Committee said it supported its government's move but was keen to ensure safety for its approximately 40 athletes.

Sturgeon warns of 'rapid' rise in Omicron cases,"Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis due to a rapid increase in cases of the Omicron variant, Nicola Sturgeon has said. A total of 99 cases of Omicron have now been detected in Scotland - a tenfold increase in the space of a week. The first minister said she expected the number to continue to increase, and for the new variant to ""account for a rising share of overall cases"". She said the emergence of Omicron was a ""significant challenge for all of us"". Travel rules have already been tightened, and Ms Sturgeon said she would consider on a daily basis whether other measures - such as the extended use of Covid passports - were needed. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid-19 The overall number of Covid cases in Scotland has increased in the past week to around 2,800 new cases per day, having fallen in the previous fortnight. The bulk of the new cases have been among people aged under 60, which Ms Sturgeon said was ""encouraging"" and proof of the success of booster vaccines. The number of people in hospitals and intensive care wards with Covid has also fallen over the past week. But Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the emergence of the Omicron variant was an ""additional and very significant cause for concern"". Cases have been reported in nine of Scotland's 14 health board areas, with fears of widespread community transmission. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I would expect to see a continued and potentially rapid rise in cases in the days ahead, and for Omicron to account for a rising share of overall cases."" Covid regulations - including the use of vaccine passports - will be reviewed daily The first minister also said early data suggested that Omicron was more transmissible than the currently dominant Delta variant - ""perhaps significantly so"" - and could be more capable of re-infecting people who have previously had Covid. She said this had the potential to put very intense additional pressure on the health service over the winter. The government is to review restrictions on a daily basis, with Ms Sturgeon urging people to get vaccinated and to up their compliance with existing measures. She also said employers should ensure that all staff who can work from home are able to, saying this should continue until at least the middle of January. She said: ""Let's all pull together, do what is necessary, and get each other and the country through this winter and into what we all hope will be a better and brighter spring."" This is a holding statement, more notable for a change in tone rather than any pre-Christmas change in regulations. While the first minister still hopes new restrictions can be avoided she offers no guarantees this will be the case. Nicola Sturgeon has urged tighter compliance with existing rules and made clear the need for additional protections will be kept under daily review. She also signalled that extending the use of Covid passports remains an option for the Scottish government. It is clear that ministers are becoming increasingly concerned about the spread of the Omicron variant, with case numbers apparently doubling every two to three days. Because it is spreading faster than previous versions of Covid and may have some vaccine resistance, they worry that it could quickly put the NHS under severe strain. Opposition leaders said the government could be doing more to tackle the ""huge challenges"" facing the NHS. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ministers had ""failed to do enough to prevent this crisis escalating when hundreds of patients are left waiting more than half a day to be seen in our hospitals"". And Labour's Anas Sarwar said there were thousands of vacancies within the NHS, with people still waiting for postponed operations and specialist treatment. Ms Sturgeon said said NHS staffing was at record levels, and that her government would continue to work to support services to recover from the pandemic. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

Wales expects 'formidable wave' of Omicron cases,"This video can not be played The Welsh government says it is expecting a significant wave of the Omicron variant of coronavirus this winter Wales stands on the brink of ""another potentially perilous moment"" ahead of an expected ""formidable wave"" of Omicron cases, First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned. Five cases have been found in Wales but this is expected to rise substantially, with a peak by the end of January. Plans for all adults to be offered abooster jabby the end of that month were announced. Mr Drakeford appealed to the public to take up the offer. Health Minister Eluned Morgan expressed concern the variant ""spreads very rapidly"". On Tuesday officials confirmed the fifth Omicron case in Wales, among 101 cases reported in the UK on the same day. It brings the total to 437. The variant is believed to be spreadingin the community in England. The prime minister's official spokesman has said Omicronappears more transmissible than Delta- the variant of coronavirus currently dominant in the UK. Live: Welsh government press conference All adults offered booster jab by end of January Could Wales go into another lockdown? Scotland's first minister says her government will be reviewing Covid restrictions on a daily basis due to arapid increasein cases of the variant there. In the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday Mark Drakeford said Wales stands at the brink of ""another potentially perilous moment"" in the pandemic. He said Wales has to ""brace ourselves for the potential for a formidable wave of new infections in the new year, potentially just six weeks from now, if we cannot slow the spread of this new variant"". Appealing for people to be vaccinated, he added: ""It is the best Christmas present you can give yourself and your family this year, and it's not too dramatic to say that it's an investment in making sure that you are here for a healthy and happy Christmas next year as well."" He spoke following a Welsh government press conference where his colleague Eluned Morgan refused to rule out tightening Covid rules. No new restrictions have yet been introduced in Wales in response to the new variant, but she said: ""We can't give you any assurances on that because we are still learning about the situation."" Ministers have instead stressed the need to take care over the festive period, and Ms Morgan recommended people take lateral flow tests before meeting friends over Christmas. ""It's clear people should act with caution,"" the minister said. Mark Drakeford is due to announce his latest review of coronavirus restrictions on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

The health minister said it was not yet known how sick the Omicron variant could make people. Hospital admissions in South Africa had gone go up from about 143 to 788 in two weeks, she said, but added that ""we don't know if that's a pattern we would see reflected in our population"". ""We don't know the extent to which vaccines will give us protection but we do think they will give us a lot more than having no vaccine at all. So that's why our plea today is please help us in this situation."" Is Omicron more harmful than other Covid variants? Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? Ms Morgan said: ""We are expecting a significant wave of Omicron to hit Wales. ""The modelling suggests that it will reach its peak by around the end of January, which is why there is an urgency in terms of getting people vaccinated and boosters done as soon as possible."" No new restrictions have been announced for the Christmas period in Wales Speaking with BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Cheryl Walter, a lecturer in microbiology at Hull University, said that South African clinicians have said for a while that they are only seeing mild disease in patients diagnosed with Omicron. ""In terms of potency, it might be transmitted more easily, and again that is unsurprising when you look at the rate of cases of Omicron and how quickly they have crept up. ""But anecdotal studies and clinicians are saying that the Omicron variant of the disease is relatively mind, which is really good news,"" she added. All cases of Omicron in Wales have so far been detected in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area. Dr Meng Khaw of Public Health Wales said the fifth individual, announced on Tuesday, had recently travelled. ""As we have said previously, an increase in cases of Omicron variant in Wales is to be expected,"" she said. The overall seven-day rolling case rate per 100,000 people has risen slightly to 493.3. There were two more deaths reported by Public Health Wales on Tuesday, bringing the total to 6,441. On Tuesday the Welsh government announced it would offer all adults a booster vaccine by the end of January, in line with targets announced last week in England and Scotland. It follows advice to bring forward the gap between second and third doses from six months to three - significantly increasing the number of adults eligible for a third dose. Plans include: More vaccination centres, with drive-through options and longer opening hours. Walk-in centres for over-65s without an appointment Asking for additional help from the military to allow some parts of Wales to double the number of vaccinations provided Students, fire services and council staff to provide help at clinics, alongside GPs and community pharmacies This will allow the NHS to ramp up the number of vaccinations from 19,000 a day to the goal of more than 200,000 a week. At Tuesday's press conference, Ms Morgan there may be a need ""to reduce some planned care"" in the NHS to run the booster programme ""but we're obviously hoping that we can keep our GP surgeries going as usual"". Some family doctors had ""stepped up and offered support, but we're not expecting that provision within our community to be reduced at this time"", Ms Morgan added. Tuesday marks one year since the first Covid-19 vaccination was administered in Wales Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Gill Richardson encouraged pregnant women to get vaccinated before the variant takes hold. She said intensive care admissions for unvaccinated pregnant women ""are really much higher than they should be"". According to recent figures, one in six patients receiving the ECMO treatment,Â the most intense form of intensive care,Â were pregnant. Dr Richardson accepted that the decision was "" very difficult"" and ""women are worried and concerned"". But she asked them to talk to their midwives and partners about the vaccine, ""because we have seen some real tragedies amongst pregnant ladies who have sadly left their families behind and succumbed to the Delta variant"". Welsh Conservative and shadow health minister Russell George said: ""I am pleased that the minister has finally heeded our calls to rapidly roll out booster jabs and redeploy our volunteer army, even implementing our proposal for walk-in centres which she called free-for-alls only a few days ago. ""However, the reported possibility of extending vaccine passports to hospitality business is a slap in the face for one of the worst-affected sectors of the pandemic."" Plaid Cymru said ministers should base any decisions on new restrictions or lockdowns on emerging evidence of the seriousness of the Omicron variant. Delyth Jewell said: ""In the interim, being in a vacuum is not a good place to be, so businesses need to have clarity on whether there are going to be further restrictions.""

Government apologises to Grenfell victims,"Some 72 people died in the west London tower block fire The government has admitted a series of failings in the years leading up to the Grenfell Tower disaster and apologised to victims of the fire. Its barrister told the Grenfell Tower public inquiry it was ""deeply sorry for its past failures"" in overseeing building safety. Jason Beer QC said local inspectors were responsible for the safety of individual buildings but the government ""deeply regrets past failures"". Some 72 people died in the 2017 fire. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities barrister said: ""It apologises to the bereaved, residents and survivors of the fire for such failures."" ""This can of course neither change what happened nor compensate them for the immeasurable loss and grief suffered. ""The department believes that it must examine its own conduct and candidly accept mistakes, errors and omissions when the inquiry identifies them,"" he added. Cladding failed fire tests 13 years before Grenfell Why is cladding unsafe and what is it costing residents? Escape plans needed to avoid next Grenfell - union On Monday, a lawyer representing victims of the June 2017 disaster,described it asone of the ""major scandals of our time"". The government has proposed a Building Safety Bill with measures to introduce a new building safety regulator. It was created to examine the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the fire at Grenfell Tower on the night of 14 June 2017. The investigation has been separated into two phases:Phase 1 focused on the factual narrative of the events, and concluded on 12 December 2018.,external Phase 2 is examining the causes of these events, including how Grenfell Tower came to be in a condition which allowed the fire to spread in the way identified by Phase 1. This effectively reverses past conservative policy to deregulate the construction of buildings. A key role of the regulator is to ensure the safety of buildings taller than 18m (59ft). It will also regulate construction products and carry out ""surveillance"" on the market to ensure standards are met. The government banned the use of combustible materials after the tower block fire in west London. A Â£5bn building safety fund has been set up in an attempt to ensure residents aren't left financially destitute due to the costs of removing flammable cladding and other dangerous materials.

Biden and Putin talk as Ukraine tensions rise,"Putin joined the meeting by video link from Sochi The US says it is preparing ""strong economic and other measures"" over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin spoke. In a video call, President Biden voiced worries over Russian troop build-ups near the border with Ukraine and called for a de-escalation of tensions. Russia says it will not attack. President Putin accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to Russia. More than 90,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. The movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. ANALYSIS:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? After Tuesday's call, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration was preparing specific robust responses in the weeks ahead if they were required. The measures included economic sanctions and other actions such as additional troop deployments to Nato allies in the region and defence equipment for Ukraine. Mr Sullivan refused to be drawn on what the economic measures might be. But he said Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which is not yet in operation, provided ""leverage"" for the US and its allies. ""If Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,"" he told journalists. Earlier reports said US officials had reached agreement with Germany to shut down the pipeline in the event of an invasion. Mr Biden was accompanied by top officials for the call Other possible measures include restrictions on Russia's banks converting roubles into foreign currencies, or even disconnecting Russia from the Swift global financial payment system, reports say. ""Things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now,"" Mr Sullivan added, referring to Western responses to Russia's annexation of Crimea. He also said there was ""a lot of give and take"" in the call and ""no finger-wagging"" but that President Biden was ""crystal clear where the United States stands on all of these issues"". Video footage of the opening moments showed friendly greetings between the US and Russian leaders, before the talks continued behind closed doors. The call was held on a secure video link set up under previous administrations but never used before. President Putin spoke from his residence in the southern resort of Sochi and President Biden from the White House. By Jonathan Marcus of the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter Russia's military option could take a variety of forms from a large incursion, to a significant invasion of the eastern part of Ukraine. One aim would be to bring the main fighting elements of the Ukrainian army to battle and to inflict such a defeat upon them that the Kyiv government has to rethink its position. Invading territory amidst a hostile population has significant risks. Ukraine's armed forces have had some Western weaponry and training and are much improved since 2015. However, Russian forces have also improved over recent years. The firepower Russia is building up is impressive. For all the talk about Ukrainian sovereignty Nato cannot and will not come to Ukraine's aid. And additional weapons supplies might simply contribute to Russia's justification for war. Moscow's calculation of the costs of conflict may also be influenced by previous military deployments. While the West currently sees military engagements through the prism of the strategic defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia may take a very different view. Its operations in Georgia, its seizure of Crimea, its combat in eastern Ukraine - not to mention its involvement in Syria - may all be seen by President Putin as relative victories. Of all the military contingencies, Michael Kofman, of the US Centre for Naval Analyses, still thinks that if it happens it will be big. ""I think Russia is in the best position since 2014 economically, politically, and militarily to execute such an operation, which is not to say it will happen, but simply to suggest that there are the fewest constraints relative to other periods when it has conducted offensive operations."" Read the full analysis Meanwhile, a Kremlin statement said President Putin had stressed that Russia should not be held responsible for tensions because Nato was making ""dangerous attempts to take over Ukrainian territory and increasing its military potential"" on Russia's borders. ""Therefore Russia is seriously interested in getting reliable guarantees fixed in law to rule out the eastward expansion of Nato and the location in countries neighbouring Russia of offensive weapons systems,""the statement added (in Russian).,external The White House said President Biden did not make any guarantees to limit Nato expansion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that, while the talks brought ""no sensations"", he was grateful for President Biden's ""unwavering support"". Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the Reuters news agency that talks between Mr Biden and Mr Putin had enabled ""deterrence and de-escalation"". But he said the focus is to put together a deterrence package to ward off any further escalation from Russia. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether President Putin has made a decision. Presidents Biden and Putin last met in person in Switzerland in June, but made little progress other than to agree to send their ambassadors back and begin a dialogue on nuclear arms control. In a conference call on Monday night, the White House said the leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy had formed a joint strategy ""to impose significant and severe harm on the Russian economy"" should Russia launch an invasion. President Biden spoke to the four European leaders again after his talks with President Putin. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line A large part of the recent Russian military build-up is in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine and then annexed in 2014. Troops are also gathering near Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which are under the control of Russian-backed separatists. More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in seven years of conflict since Russian-backed forces seized large areas of Ukraine's east.

BBC 100 women: Who is on the list?,"The BBC has revealed its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2021. This year 100 Women is highlighting those who are hitting ""reset"" - women playing their part to reinvent our society, our culture and our world. Among them are Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Samoa's first female prime minister FiamÄ Naomi Mata'afa, Professor Heidi J Larson, who heads The Vaccine Confidence Project, and acclaimed author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Women from Afghanistan make up half of this year's list, some of whom appear under pseudonyms and without photos for their own safety. The resurgence of the Taliban in August 2021 has changed the lives of millions of Afghans - with girls banned from receiving secondary education, the ministry for women's affairs being disbanded, and women in many cases told not to return to work. This year's list recognises the scope of their bravery and their achievements as they are forced to reset their lives. Award-winning poet and writer, whose poetry and articles challenge patriarchal norms in Afghan culture. Lima Aafshid has worked as an independent reporter and social commentator for more than five years. She is also a member of Sher-e-daneshgah, the Kabul Poetry Association, which held virtual poetry sessions during the pandemic to help its more than 200 members maintain a sense of community despite the health crisis. *The fall of Afghanistan is like sinking back into the same mud we struggled with for 20 years. I am hopeful, however, that we can rise like a branch, reaching towards the light in the gloom of the forest. The first hijab-wearing supermodel, Halima Aden is a Somali by descent but was born in a refugee camp in Kenya. In 2017, she signed to one of the worldâs biggest modelling agencies, IMG Models, adding a clause to her contract that she would not be asked to take off her hijab when modelling. She was the first model to wear a hijab on the cover of British Vogue, Allure and Sports Illustratedâs swimsuit edition. Aden campaigns to improve awareness and visibility for Muslim women and was a Unicef ambassador for childrenâs rights. In 2020, she stepped away from modelling as she found it incompatible with her Muslim faith, but she continues to make an impact within the fashion industry and beyond. *Weâve seen our frontline workers go through extreme measures to keep us safe during the pandemic and I pray that we appreciate their sacrifices. We can reset the world by moving forward with gratitude. Criminal lawyer and founder of the all-women law firm Headfort Foundation, which offers pro-bono legal services. Based in Lagos, the four-person legal team visits prisons to help poor and wrongly incarcerated inmates who are unable to get bail, as well as citizens enduring long pre-trial detentions (in Nigeria, those awaiting trial make up about 70% of the prison population). Oluyemi Adetiba-Orija and her team focus on under-age offenders, offering them another chance at life outside prison. Since it started operating in 2018, the foundation has provided free legal assistance to more than 125 people charged with minor offences. *For the world to be reset, we all have a role to play!

In 2018, she received an N-Peace award, given by the United Nations Development Programme to outstanding women in peace-building and conflict resolution. *I never experienced such sudden change â as if no government existed before. Now our only hope is for the young generation to fill the gaps and reform the system, but that will only be possible with international support. Misogyny and the oppression of women are at the heart of this Afghan visual artistâs work. Rada Akbar has always used art as a medium to enable her to speak up and give women greater visibility in society. Since 2019, she has been organising annual ""Superwomen"" (Abarzanan) exhibitions to mark International Womenâs Day and to celebrate the central role that women have played in her countryâs history. Until recently, she had been trying to set up a museum of womenâs history in Kabul or elsewhere. She believes her art helps denounce the social laws that condemn women in the name of political, economic and religious beliefs. *Afghanistan and its citizens have been abused and violated by extremists and world leaders for decades. But we have never stopped working for a progressive country and we will live in a free and prosperous Afghanistan again.

Alam fled Afghanistan in the 1980s and now lives in the US but has continued to tell stories of her home country. In 2009 she was appointed a peace ambassador for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. *It took us decades to rebuild with so much blood and sacrifice.

Altunoluk helped the Turkish womenâs team win Paralympic gold in Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. Born in Tokat, Anatolia, she completed a degree in physical education in Ankara. *Disability should not be seen as an obstacle, but as an opportunity for self-expression. A librarian and book lover, Wahida Amiri is a law graduate and frequent protester. When the Taliban took power in Afghanistan and she could no longer work at her library, she took to the streets of Kabul. She was joined by countless other women in a collective march to ask the international community to support Afghan womenâs rights to work and to an education. Since the Taliban outlawed protests, Amiri has gathered with other women to promote reading and discussion. Her library had been operating since 2017 and Amiri says that without her books, she has lost her identity. *The world did not respect us as humans. But as Afghanistan goes through destruction, we revive hope through protests, demanding justice and encouraging book reading. As a climate expert working to accelerate the shift toward emissions-free transportation, MÃ³nica Araya has guided sustainability campaigns in the Americas and Europe - including the citizen initiative, Costa Rica Limpia, which helped her home country consolidate its position as a world leader in renewable energy.

Afghanistan's first waste-paper recycling factory, Gul-e-Mursal, was founded by businesswoman Zuhal Atmar. With a background in economics and business, she set up a women-led factory in Kabul in 2016. It has created 100 jobs, 30% of which have gone to women, from the factory floor to marketing. The factory collects waste and non-confidential papers from non-governmental organisations and processes almost 35 tonnes of paper a week, recycling them into toilet paper, which is then sold across the country. Atmar has been vocal about how difficult it is for women to get the financial support they need to set up and run a business in Afghanistan. *What does the future look like? The dreams, goals and hopes of the youth and women have been destroyed. A former domestic worker herself, Marcelina Bautista is director of Mexicoâs support and training centre for domestic workers (CACEH), which she founded 21 years ago. She campaigns to secure rights, such as fair wages and sick leave, enjoyed by other workers, and to improve their social status. Her initiative combines education for workers, employers and community members. Bautista was actively involved in negotiations that led the Mexican government formally to join an international labour agreement that protects domestic workers from exploitation, violence and unsafe working conditions. She was awarded an international human-rights prize from the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in Germany in 2010. *Changing the world means changing the conditions of millions of domestic workers, mostly women, who work at home while others develop professionally. This social inequality will only end when domestic work gets the recognition it deserves. Social activist and human-rights advocate Crystal Bayat figured prominently in protests against the Taliban takeover in 2021, helping organise one in Kabul on 19 August - independence day in Afghanistan. Bayat had begun a PhD in political management before her studies were interrupted when the Taliban took control of the country. She is currently based in the US, from where she continues the fight to preserve Afghan human-rights achievements. She also hopes to finish her PhD and write a book. *Ultimately, I want to be part of any future democratic changes in Afghanistan. My dream is to speak at the UN because I believe the world needs to hear what real Afghans, especially women, have to say. After working for the government at the presidential palace for a number of years, in various capacities, Razia Barakzai found herself without a job once the Taliban took power in Afghanistan. Since then, she has been actively involved in marches in Kabul, where countless women have demanded the right to work and receive an education. She was also one of the women behind the slogan #AfghanWomenExist, which highlights the fact that fear is driving Afghan women away from social media. Barakzai has a degree in law and political science, and an MBA. In a letter she wrote for the BBC about her experience campaigning, she said: âDying for freedom is preferable to living in slavery.â *The educated and young of the country - especially the brave, warrior women of Afghanistan - one day will be the flag-bearers of freedom. I see this every day through the demonstrations in the streets. The captain of the national wheelchair basketball team and a prominent advocate for women with disabilities, Nilofar Bayat fled Afghanistan to escape the Taliban. She and her husband, Ramish - also a wheelchair player - both worked for the International Red Cross. When she was two years old, a rocket hit her family home, killing her brother and damaging her spinal cord. Bayat played her first game of basketball in an open court in the middle of Kabul, a turning point for sportswomen in Afghanistan. She has become a voice for refugees fleeing her homeland, and she set up an association for Afghan women. Bayat hopes to play basketball again. *I hope it is game over in Afghanistan and we donât pay the price of war for another second. I hope to see a real smile on the faces of my people.

In a career spanning 40 years, she has raised awareness of how our everyday social and material practices can be used to support people with disabilities. *We need to centre the diverse experiences of disabled and other marginalised people over the last year, recognising this as a creative generator to reset our built surroundings as spaces of collective care and interdependence. The amateur historian investigated the deaths of 796 children at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Galway, conducting years of painstaking research that helped uncover a mass grave at the site of the former Irish institution for unmarried mothers, where hundreds of infants had disappeared, with no evidence of their burial, between the 1920s and the 1950s. This year, a long-awaited report on these institutions, run mostly by Catholic nuns, found an ""appalling level of infant mortality"" from various diseases, leading to an apology from the Irish government. Corless has received the Bar of Ireland Human Rights Award in recognition of her âexceptional humanitarian serviceâ. *If I could reset the world, I would obliterate the word ""shame"".

Ensandost, who has a degree in religious studies, has been active in promoting womenâs roles in political and civil affairs and appeared on Afghan media to speak about womenâs rights to work and learn. She recently took part in a public demonstration in Kabul, where she wore a shroud-like white fabric to protest against the oppression of women in her country. As well as being a teacher, she has been an active member of various womenâs associations in Afghanistan. *I want to see women be included in political, social, and economic affairs, a woman's right to an education to be upheld, and violence and inequalities against women and minorities to be eradicated.

She also works with women in rural areas who have experienced domestic violence, making sure they have shelter and helping them seek justice. *I thought we had lost everything and felt hopeless, but when I remembered everything we had done, I regained the courage to continue.

She says she had hoped to show a new side of Afghanistan to the world through her music, but instead it has been the âdarkest yearâ for Afghan women.

Music was banned when the Taliban ruled the country from 1996 to 2001 and Razma fears history is repeating itself for Afghanistanâs musicians. *Thinking about a society without music and songs makes me more depressed than ever.

Dr Ruksana is a surgeon and assistant professor. She is founder of an organisation that provides basic healthcare to patients who have been displaced from other Afghan provinces due to the conflict. She has worked in hostile environments during various periods of fighting, delivering medical assistance to the most vulnerable. She is a volunteer with the National Cancer Control Programme and is currently running a breast-cancer awareness drive. She is passionate about the work she is doing in surgery and hopes to be a source of inspiration for Afghan medical students. *Every major change is the result of the commitment and dedication of a leader. I may not be a leader, but I will stay in Afghanistan to bring change to the paralysed and corrupt healthcare system here. A lawmaker and former member of the Afghan Parliament from the northern Jowzjan province, Halima Sadaf Karimi is an experienced politician. She was one of nearly 70 female MPs in her country, and the only woman from the Uzbek minority in parliament, where she fought to advance the rights of her community. She has a degree in political science and economics. A prominent campaigner for womenâs rights, Sadaf Karimi received repeated threats from the Taliban and had to move house several times. In 2020, her younger brother, a university student, was killed by Taliban forces. *Selfish regimes have always faced early failures.

As a conductor of Zohra, Afghanistan's first all-female orchestra, Shogufa Safi leads a group of 13-to-20-year-old musicians, some of whom come from poor homes or are orphans. The Zohra ensemble is named after a Persian goddess of music and plays a mixture of traditional Afghan and Western classical music, and has been performing on national and international stages since 2014. The Afghanistan National Institute of Music, where Safi once practised, has closed down since the Taliban took power. After managing to escape to Doha, she and some of her colleagues - who had to leave their instruments behind in Afghanistan - long to be able to play together again. *Hope never fails. Even in the total darkness, I believe my baton will be a beacon of hope and light for Afghanistan. One of the many young women who want to play football in Afghanistan but are no longer able to under Taliban rule. For the last few years, Sahar played for a local football team and met many friends through playing sport. When the Taliban took over the country this year, she went into hiding with her family before being flown to a new country. She still fears for her fellow female players left in the country but hopes she can now realise her dreams of going back to a football pitch. *I want to continue my education and try hard to reach my goals to make my family - and myself - proud of my achievements. I want success so that nobody can say that girls cannot play football. Viral Instagram account and website Everyoneâs Invited, a platform for survivors of sexual abuse, was founded by Soma Sara in June 2020. It provides scope for victims to share testimonies of sexual assault anonymously, to condemn sexism and help eradicate ""rape culture"" in UK schools and universities. The project has collected more than 50,000 stories since it began, gaining prominence after the murder of Sarah Everard, who was kidnapped from a London street in March 2021.

She has dedicated her life to empowering victims of domestic violence, fighting for childrenâs health and education, and fighting corruption. When the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, she stayed with her people and still courageously voices the concerns of Afghan women in local and international media. Time magazine named her one of its ""100 Most Influential People"" of 2021. *Peace is my number one wish for my country.

Award-winning Turkish-British author and advocate for womenâs and LGBTQ+ rights. Elif Shafak has published 19 books, including 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and The Forty Rules of Love, chosen as one of the BBCâs 100 Novels that Shaped Our World. Her work has been translated into more than 50 languages. Shafak has a PhD in political science and has taught in universities in Turkey, the US and the UK. In 2021, she was awarded the HalldÃ³r Laxness International Literary Prize for her contribution to ""the renewal of the art of storytelling"". *East and West everywhere, we stand at a major crossroads.

One of Afghanistanâs most high-profile reporters, for more than a decade Anisa Shaheed covered stories about human-rights abuses, politics and corruption. She worked for Tolo News, one of the most influential television news channels in the country, and covered breaking news from the field. Shaheed received threats as both a journalist and a woman and had to flee after the Taliban takeover on 15 August. Reporters Without Borders, which attempts to defend media freedom, recognised her ""courageous"" reporting during the coronavirus outbreak. In 2021, she was named journalist of the year and ""the face of freedom of speech"" by Afghanistan's Free Speech Hub network. *At the peak of displacement and despair, I hope to see Afghanistan in peace.

She became the first female Church of England archdeacon from a black or ethnic-minority background in 2013. Now a retired Anglican priest and schoolteacher, Mina Smallman has been campaigning to make UK streets safer and to reform the police. Two of her daughters were murdered in 2020: Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry were stabbed to death by a 19-year-old man in a London park. Smallman criticised the policeâs handling of the initial missing-persons call and said her two girls might have been victims of ""racial profiling"" and ""classism"". She says she has forgiven her daughtersâ killer: ""When we hold hatred for someone, itâs not only them who are held captive, itâs you, because your thoughts become consumed by revenge. I refuse to give him that power."" *As a teacher and a priest, I have dedicated my life to raising boys and girls that people looked down on. Iâm asking each of you to speak up when you hear discrimination. We CAN change. Hyper-realistic ""reborn"" dolls help some women process a miscarriage or the loss of a child, and for some they assist in dealing with anxiety, depression, and fertility issues. Polish artist Barbara SmoliÅska is a doll designer and maker, creating life-like baby dolls that may be used as therapeutic aids. A former musician, she has professional training in cosmetology and is the founder of her company, Reborn Sugar Babies.

After being arrested by Myanmarâs military junta, Ein Soe May (not her real name) remained behind bars for six months until she was released under a recent amnesty. She was held in one of the many military interrogation centres and the notorious Insein prison, and she describes her time in detention as extremely difficult and alleges she was physically and mentally tortured. Since her student days, the young activist has been involved in many campaigning and grassroots activities. After the military coup on 1 February, Soe May became part of a movement actively opposing the countryâs military, including the ""pots and pans"" protest in February and the ""silence strike"" in late March. Since her release, she has resumed her political activities. *If only the world could be resetâ¦ We want to successfully overcome the epidemic and build a peaceful society.

At The Safe Alliance in Austin, Texas, chief public strategies officer Piper Stege Nelson works with the community to stop child abuse, sexual assault, domestic violence and sex trafficking. The organisation counsels young victims of rape who can no longer access abortion services, as a new state law bans terminations as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Stege Nelson has dedicated her life to advancing the rights of women and girls. She has worked with Michelle Obamaâs Let Girls Learn initiative and for Annieâs List, a political action committee dedicated to increasing the number and success of women in politics. *Covid-19 has already created a social-change reset - people feel empowered to speak out about what is important. The challenge now is to educate every man, woman and child about the importance of bodily autonomy and consent. After she started mountain climbing as a hobby in 2019, Fatima Sultani made it her mission to encourage an interest among Afghan girls in mountaineering. When just 18, she became the youngest woman to climb to the summit of Noshakh - the highest peak in Afghanistan, at 7,492m (24,580ft). She was part of a team of nine young Afghan mountaineers, three of them women. A keen sportswoman, Sultani has been a member of the national team for boxing, taekwondo and jiu jitsu for the past seven years. *Afghan women have fought for their freedom and rights for 20 years.

The Catholic nun became a symbol of Myanmarâs protests following the military takeover when she knelt in front of police to save protesters taking shelter in her church. The photo of her with her arms spread wide facing heavily armed police officers went viral on social media in March 2021, and won her widespread praise. Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng has openly spoken of protecting civilians, especially children. She has trained as a midwife and has led a life of service for the past 20 years, recently looking after Covid patients in Myanmarâs Kachin state. *I have witnessed with a broken heart what happened in Myanmar.

Theofelus holds a law degree from the University of Namibia and a diploma in African feminism and gender studies from the University of South Africa. *The world can reset through acceleration: we need to accelerate the implementation of all the plans that have been in the pipeline for years. Thereâs no time for delays. In fact, we have run out of time. She is founder of Afghan technology start-up Ehtesab, whose first product is an app to deliver real-time security, power and traffic alerts to Kabul residents. The app has proved critical in providing Afghans with information on the nature and extent of danger around them, by sharing reliable information on improvised-explosive-device (IED) attacks, public beatings and house raids. In 2022, Sara Wahedi hopes to launch an SMS alert function, allowing people in rural areas to access the service. The tech entrepreneur is one of Time Magazineâs 2021 ""Next Generation Leaders"" and is currently studying human rights and data science at Columbia University. *It is inevitable that Afghans will rise in unison, demanding free and fair elections and agency to rebuild our country.

Originally from a remote village in China, award-winning film-maker Nanfu Wang currently lives and works in the US. Her 2016 debut film, Hooligan Sparrow, was shortlisted for a ""best documentary feature"" Academy Award. She also directed One Child Nation (2019) and In the Same Breath (2021), which looks at how the Chinese and American governments reacted to the Covid-19 outbreak.

She was awarded the MacArthur genius grant in 2020 for ""creating intimate character studies that examine the impact of authoritarian governance, corruption, and lack of accountability"". *The whole world seems eager to return to a feeling of normal, but the circumstances that we considered normal were what created the crisis weâre living through now. A former member of parliament and a qualified gynaecologist, Dr Roshanak Wardak has provided medical services for women for more than 25 years, even working during the Talibanâs first spell in power as the only female doctor in her home province of Maidan Wardak. She became a member of parliament after their fall in 2001. Her district has been under Taliban control for almost 15 years and, like many rural areas, endured heavy fighting involving Nato forces. She told the BBC the Taliban takeover and the end of war had felt like a dream. ""I was waiting for this day to remove these corrupt people from power,"" she said. But recently sheâs focused on trying to get schools reopened, and broken Taliban promises have made her an outspoken advocate for girlsâ education. *My only hope is for Afghanistan to make the leaders of the government over the last 40 years accountable for their actions against the nation.

Following the Taliban invasion, she was forced to leave the country but remains a vocal advocate for the rights of disabled people, who she fears will face discrimination from the Taliban. Accessibility and discrimination remain serious issues in Afghanistan, which has one of the worldâs largest populations, per capita, of people with disabilities, partly because of its decades of conflict. *If there is any hope, it will be for me to see my country again with much more freedom, and more inclusion for all of us Afghans to work for its development. The youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani girlsâ education activist and UN messenger of peace. She has spoken up for the right of young women to an education since she was 11. Her activism began with blogs for the BBC about living under Taliban rule in Pakistan and the ban on girls attending school. In October 2012, a gunman boarded her bus, looking for her, and shot her in the head. Following her recovery, she has continued her work as co-founder of the non-profit Malala Fund, aiming to build a world where every girl can learn and lead without fear. *Hundreds of millions of girls are out of school today.

A psychotherapist and LGBTQ+ activist, Yuma is currently living in Spain. Yuma (who has asked to keep her surname private) became an activist after Russia passed a ""gay propaganda"" law in 2013, banning ""the promotion of non-traditional sexual relations to minors"". She provides psychological assistance to LGBT people from Chechnya who say they were tortured by Russian police in 2017-2018. She also supports LGBT festivals and events within Russia. *Forced isolation has shown how important close relationships are.

The first female deputy chief in the policeâs criminal investigation department in Afghanistanâs Khost province, a region that became increasingly destabilised by the activity of insurgent groups. Second Lieutenant Zala Zazai was one of about 4,000 female police officers in the country and received professional training from Turkeyâs police academy. During her service she faced intimidation from her male colleagues, as well as death threats from insurgents.

She has since voiced concern for the safety of other female police officers forced into hiding in Afghanistan. *My dream in the future is to wear my uniform again, challenging a traditional and patriarchal society. I want to work for Afghan women again in a remote place where women do not have the right to work. Click here, if you can't see the list of 100 women,external. Malala's message to an Afghan schoolgirl Rebel Wilson: I know what it's like to be invisible I am an Afghan lawyer but can't work anymore The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - women who are hitting ""reset"", playing their part to reinvent our world after the global pandemic has forced so many of us to reassess the way we live. It was also measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final names were chosen. This year BBC 100 Women made the unprecedented decision to devote half of the list to women from one country - Afghanistan.  Recent events in the country have made headlines and left millions of Afghans questioning their future, as rights groups have spoken up in fear that women's freedoms could be eroded for the foreseeable future under the Taliban. By dedicating half of the list to women who are from or work in the country, we wanted to highlight how many of them have been forced to disappear from areas of public life, as well as to share the voices of those who are being increasingly silenced or who are part of a new Afghan diaspora. On 3 December, the Taliban did issue a decree in the name of their supreme leader instructing ministries ""to take serious action"" on women's rights. The decree sets out the rules governing marriage and property for women, stating that women should not be forced into marriage and should not be seen as ""property"". But this declaration has been criticised by human rights organisations and observers as it fails to mention girls' secondary education and women's curtailed rights to employment. Some of the Afghan women on the list are anonymous to protect them and their families, with their consent and following all BBC Editorial Policy and safety guidelines.

LiveLiveUK officials accused by Labour MP of Afghan flight cover-up9 minutes ago,"The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee was quizzing top civil servants about the UK's handling of the evacuation of Kabul in August The UK airlifted 15,000 people out as the Taliban took over but a whistleblower has described it as a chaotic and dysfunctional operation Raphael Marshall said thousands of emails with pleas for help went unread and animals were helped over people at risk Top Foreign Office civil servant Sir Philip Barton admits he should not have stayed on holiday as the Taliban advanced on the Afghan capital Boris Johnson meanwhile denies claims that he and his wife Carrie intervened to organise the rescue of animals But Labour's Chris Bryant produces a letter from the PM's aide to animal charity boss Pen Farthing about evacuations which he says is evidence of a ""cover-up"" Edited by Brian Wheeler There was plenty to digest as the Foreign Affairs Committee examined what a whistleblower called the chaotic and dysfunctional withdrawal from Kabul this summer. As we close the live page, here is a re-cap of the main things we heard: We've had some reaction from the committee's chair Tom Tugendhat, who says many Afghan allies and partners were ""abandoned"". He said: ""This crisis demanded, and deserved, the full attention of the
Foreign Office. It seems that junior staff members and soldiers bore most of
the burden, having been placed under huge pressure to make life-or-death
decisions with insufficient guidance, support or oversight. âThe evidence weâve heard today points to a lack of
leadership, urgency and adequate resourcing. âIt is deeply painful how badly we have let Afghanistan down. âI would like to reiterate my thanks to Raphael Marshall.
His powerful and compelling evidence has helped bring fundamental failures to
light.â Tom Tugendhat finishes the session by asking the witnesses to pass on ""enormous thanks"" to many of their teams who he says have been ""frankly extraordinarily courageous throughout a difficult period"". Sir Philip says he ""appreciates the sentiment"". Chris Bryant says he hasjust been sent a letter to Pen Farthing,externalfrom Trudy Harrison MP - the parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister -  in which she says: ""Animals under the care of Nowzad can be evacuated on a separate charter flight - the Ministry of Defence will ensure a flight is available."" ""This doesn't equate with what you've told us this afternoon,"" says Bryant. ""I'm not aware of the letter,"" replies Sir Philip adding: ""We've not set out this afternoon to mislead you."" ""It feels like a cover-up,"" the Labour MP says adding ""the prime minster's fingerprints are all over this."" Sir Philip repeats his assertion that he ""wasn't aware of the letter"". There follows a long and slightly awkward silence. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace gave the order Conservative Bob Seely returns to the subject of the animal evacuations. He asks if there was a ministerial instruction to help Pen Farthing's organisation, Nowzad. Nigel Casey, the PM's special representative for Afghanistan,  replies: ""There was clearly a ministerial decision to help in the narrow sense by agreement the UK military would facilitate the landing of the charter which Pen Farthing's organisation had chartered. ""Flight clearance was done at direction of the defence secretary,"" he adds. On August 27,Mr Wallace told BBC Newssupporters of Mr Farthing's animal charity rescue mission had ""taken up too much time of my senior commanders dealing with this issue when they should be focused on dealing with the humanitarian crisis"".  Sir Philip Barton says he does not believe Chris Bryant's characterisation of events is accurate. He says the evacuation was not ideal but it was right to try to get people out. The UK government honoured its commitment to those who were called forward and the Foreign Office is working with the Home Office on the Afghan resettlement scheme, he adds. Labour MP Chris Bryant has just challenged the diplomats' version of events, delivering a withering assessment of the situation as it unfolded over those days after Kabul fell. Here is what the MP said in full: ""What I think really happened is that ministers were desperate to please, they weren't courageous enough to say 'I'm sorry there's a limit to what I can do'. ""There wasn't enough preparation done from last year let alone from April this year to be able to do a proper evacuation of the numbers that we really knew we were likely to have to evacuate. We offered the prospect, the hope, the expectation, indeed, for lots and lots of people, that they might be able to come to the United Kingdom, cruelly in all honesty. ""And then when ministers had hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of emails from lots of MPs, and effectively the Foreign Office collaborated in making sure that ministers could say that 'we've ticked every single box' even though in truth not a single one of these names was ever really properly considered. ""That's what happened really, isn't it? And that's shameful."" ...effectively the Foreign Office collaborated in making sure that ministers could say that 'we've ticked every single box' Chris Bryant, Labour MP Labour's Chris Bryant asks how the government dealt with letters from MPs raising cases of people still in Afghanistan. Sir Philip says the Foreign Office replied to all MPs who had written by 6 September and adds that he is grateful to MPs for raising cases they may have missed. Bryant says he sent a letter on 20 August listing people who might need help - he received a reply on 16 September saying the cases had been passed to the Home Office. He asks if any of the cases were actually considered. Sir Philip says the Home Office is responsible for processing the cases of people who are not British nationals. Philip Barton tells the committee that decisions on who to help under the ""special cases"" scheme were decided based on a criteria drawn up by the then foreign secretary. The criteria included contribution to UK objectives, vulnerability and in very rare cases whether they held sensitive information. Tom Tugendhat asks if the lists of people to help were prepared by junior staff. Nigel Casey replies that individuals were ""sifted according to priority"" then put to panels of more senior officials - all of which included someone with Afghan experience on who should be prioritised. Labour's Chris Bryant asks how many journalists they estimated could be included in the special cases category Sir Philip says they thought there were about 1,200, 500 of whom ended up on flights. Nigel Casey says there were approaches from media groups including the BBC and Sky who wrote to the prime minister seeking help for particular individuals. He says ministers decided the priority had to be British nationals, then those on the resettlement scheme, and then those considered to be special cases. The MPs are back, and Labour's Chris Bryant resumes his questioning on ""special cases"" for evacuation. Reality Check Former Foreign
secretary, Dominic Raab has defended the UK's handling of the evacuation from
Afghanistan after a whistleblower â who worked in the Foreign Office at the
time - said the response had been chaotic. Mr Raab said the
UK evacuated more people than any other nation except the US. From 15 August to
the end of that month, 15,000 people were evacuated by the UK, including 8,000
Afghans and 5,000 British nationals, according to the government. The
whistleblower, Raphael Marshall said he estimated that
between 75,000 and 150,000 people applied for evacuation. The
US evacuated the largest number of people from Afghanistan in August. From 14
August to 28 August, it got 113,500 people out of the country. Other countries
evacuated much smaller numbers over that period, according to official
statements and press releases.  You can read more here. The proceedings have been paused so that the MPs can take part in a Commons vote. Chris Bryant asked if the system had been a mistake Labour's Chris Bryant wonders whether the three separate systems for processing eligible Afghans for evacuation was a ""terrible mistake"" and asks about the ""special cases concept"". Sir Philip says that special cases played a part in filling spare capacity on UK flights and that the then-foreign secretary, the defence secretary and home secretary were involved in choosing who counted as a special case. These ministers decided in the week of 16 August that spare capacity would be used to ensure special cases were evacuated. Nigel Casey - the PM's special representative for Afghanistan - says that an early meeting of the Cobra emergency committee decided that there should be a third way for people to apply to leave Afghanistan for those ineligible under the two other schemes. Intelligence officers, journalists and judges were among those who were considered under the ""special cases"" scheme, Bryant says. Individuals would then be prioritised according to factors decided by the ministers, Casey adds. Tom Tugendhat picks up the questions about who was on holiday and when. He notes that the people who were away in August included: the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the foreign secretary, the national security adviser and the senior civil servants at the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence. He asks Laurie Bristow if he had thought about taking a holiday. Bristow replies that he was in London from 7 -11 August as part of ""a planned rotation"" of staff. This video can not be played Chris Bryant queries Foreign Office staffing as the Taliban took over Afghanistan Foreign Office chief Sir Philip Barton again says he regrets taking a 17-day holiday at the height of the Afghan crisis. He says it was not clear Kabul would fall so soon when he went on leave. He says he went on holiday on 9 August and returned on the 26th - between which time Kabul fell to the Taliban and Britain launched an evacuation effort for UK nationals and eligible Afghans. Labour MP Chris Bryant says Sir Philip's statement on the holiday sounds ""less credible each every time you repeat it... it just feels a bit scripted now"". Sir Philip declines to speak about then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's holiday which occurred around the same time. Sir Philip says it is normal for secretaries of state and permanent secretaries to be away at the same time in holiday periods. Bryant asks when Sir Philip booked the holiday and says that if the booking was made after it became clear there was a crisis in Afghanistan it would amount to a ""dereliction of duty"". Sir Philip says there was ""no inevitability"" that Kabul would fall on 9 August but Bryant says evidence suggests that other organisations had predicted events would move quickly. He repeatedly declines to say where he was on holiday. Labour's Graham Stringer asks the ex-Afghanistan ambassador how many times he spoke to then-Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab ahead of the Taliban taking over. Sir Laurie Bristow replies that he spoke to Raab twice in the first fortnight of August, before the fall of Kabul. Stringer now asks how records of Afghans who'd helped the British forces were left behind in the embassy. ""We regret this very much,"" Philip Barton says. He adds that a team was designated to destroy sensitive information but acknowledges a mistake was made ""under immense pressure"". Bristow says he is ""absolutely mortified"" that it happened. Asked if any of those whose details were in the documents are still at risk, Barton replies: ""As far as I know - no."" Tory MP Alicia Kearns continues to question the diplomats on the impact of the evacuation of rescue animals on the withdrawal of Britons and eligible Afghans. Sir Laurie Bristow describes efforts to drawdown the UK's efforts closer to the airfield after the bomb attack at the airport's Abbey Gate - and says there were considerable time constraints. ""Couldn't UK troops have been processing people not animals?"", Kearns asks. Sir Laurie says the issue was not planes - or capacity on planes - and that the trade-off was not as simple as being between people and animals. The committee has been asking questions about how animals from the Nowzad charity were evacuated from Afghanistan. The organisation - run by Pen Farthing - was an animal shelter in Kabul which cared for dogs, cats and donkeys, some of them belonging to UK servicemen and women. When the Taliban took control of the capital, its supporters launched a vociferous campaign for evacuation, saying staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations and the animals were at risk ""because the Taliban considers companion animals, particularly dogs, unclean"". Mr Farthing and 150 animals were able to leave the country. His staff were left behind, but later made it safely to Pakistan. Tom Tugendhat asks how much staff time the Nowzad evacuation took up. ""I don't know,"" replies Philip Barton. Nigel Casey says ""permission for the charter had to be sought and supported by the Ministry of Defence but it didn't detract from our operation"". Tugendhat asks if a flight could be arranged for Nowzad, why couldn't it be arranged for the five-year-old son of an Afghan interpreter - who Tugendhat had been trying to help. ""We operated on the basis of advice coming from the military... we followed their instructions and took people out on the timetable they gave us,"" replies Casey. ""I don't think it would have been possible to evacuate anyone else,"" he says adding that negotiations with the Taliban to extend the deadline for evacuations had been unsuccessful."" Laurie Bristow says: ""We all left Kabul thinking about the people who we couldn't get out."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Instagram announces 'take-a-break' feature for teens,"Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is due in front of US politicians this week Instagram has announced new features it says will help teenagers and parents manage time spent on the app. Parents will be able to see how much time their children spend on Instagram and set time limits, while teens will get reminders to take a break. It comes a day before Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is due to appear before US Senators investigating online safety. Instagram has been under increasing pressure over teens' use of the platform in recent months. Its internal researchsuggesting that teens blamed Instagram for increased anxietywas the first in a series of revelations in France Haugen's leaked documents from inside Facebook. The US Senate Committee is expected to quiz Mr Mosseri on Instagram's internal information on child safety and its plans - as well as what the committee calls ""potential legislative solutions"". The timing of the announcement by Instagram was ""interesting"", said social media consultant Matt Navarra. ""Instagram's boss will want to have something new and meaningful to show US senators when they grill him... the new features will give worried parents more tools to help keep their children safe when using Instagram, but many will wonder why it has taken them so long to act."" In his blog post,external, Mr Mosseri announced the launch of the ""take-a-break"" feature, which he hadtweeted about in November. It will be launched on Tuesday in the UK, Ireland, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, he said. ""If someone has been scrolling for a certain amount of time, we'll ask them to take a break from Instagram and suggest that they set reminders to take more breaks in the future,"" Mr Mosseri wrote. The feature would also show them tips from experts to ""help them reflect and reset"", he said. Teenage users will get notifications to turn on break reminders, he said. Instagram also said it will launch a new tool for parents in March 2022, which will let them see how much time children are spending on Instagram, and set time limits for the app. Another companion feature will allow teens to opt-in to a system that will notify parents if the teenager files a report against an Instagram user. Time limits already exist on Instagram - users can voluntarily set a time limit per day and receive a notification when that limit is hit. Mr Mosseri also unveiled a new system to bulk-manage Instagram accounts. Starting in January, a new system will let any user see all their posts, or all their likes and comments, in a chronological list - and select several at once to delete in bulk. Instagram defaults under-16s' accounts to private Instagram for kids paused after backlash Instagram: A blessing or a curse? ""While available to everyone, I think this tool is particularly important for teens to more fully understand what information they've shared on Instagram, what is visible to others, and to have an easier way to manage their digital footprint,"" Mr Mosseri wrote. Among the other measures announced on Tuesday were an expansion of the app's limits on messaging teens - so that now, people will no longer be able to tag or mention teens who do not follow them. And another feature suggests that Instagram will ""nudge"" users towards other types of content ""if people are dwelling on one topic for a while"". Mr Mosseri did not elaborate on what types of content that ""nudge"" might apply to, how it will work, or when it will be implemented. The only example given, in an image on the blog post, was suggesting a user who had looked at beauty posts might want to explore travel, interior design or dogs. Ahead of his grilling by US politicians on Wednesday, Mr Mosseri finished his blog post announcing these new measures by saying: ""I continue to welcome productive collaboration with lawmakers and policymakers on our shared goal of creating an online world that both benefits and protects many generations to come."" The range of new measures was broadly welcomed by the Molly Rose Foundation, set up in memory of teenager Molly Russell who took her own life in 2017 and who viewed distressing material on Instagram. ""As ever, when such announcements are made, it is the detail of the proposals that will reveal how effective the new measures are likely to be,"" it warned. ""Shifting responsibility to parents without Instagram also taking additional steps towards greater online safety would not be adequate."" The sentiment was echoed by Sarah Goodall, chief executive of social media consultancy Tribal Impact. ""A lot of children, they're very isolated with their experience on social media,"" she told the BBC, referring to problems such as cyber-bullying. In particular, she praised the newly announced facility whereby parents will be able to receive an alert if their child reports another user of the app. However, Ms Goodall - who is a parent herself - argued that social media companies could, in general, do more to enable parental oversight of their children's activity online. ""A lot of parents that I'm teaching how to be active on social, they don't understand how to work with their children, the conversations to have, the sites to spot - and I do believe that the social platforms could do more to help,"" she added.

Ubisoft launches in-game NFTs,"Ubisoft's NFT system will launch in Ghost Recon: Breakpoint first Game titan Ubisoft has announced its new system to bring NFTs to its in-game items, starting this week. Non-fungible tokens have exploded in popularity, and are widely used for digital art collectibles. Ubisoft's system - called ""Digits"" - will be offered as in-game digital items with one-of-a-kind serial numbers, which can be bought and sold. Critics argue NFTs are bad for the environment, while offering little benefit over traditional systems. Ubisoft - famous for games such as the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six series - is the most significant game developer and publisher to launch an NFT project yet. The company claims it has addressed the environmental problems associated with blockchain technology. What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? NFT-based fantasy football cards raise $680m Its in-game NFTs will be stored on the Tezos blockchain, which it claims is far more energy-efficient than other options. But the use of NFTs in gaming remains controversial, with many players and designers believing they are only considered as a way to make money, rather than providing players with any benefit. Ubisoft's first batch of Digits will launch with ""limited editions"" - of a fixed number of in-game digital items - for the company's game Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint, on Thursday. They can be paid for with crypto-currency, but only in the launch countries of USA, Canada, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Australia and Brazil. Many games - especially free-to-play ones such as the popular Fortnite or Warzone titles - make a large chunk of their money through selling in-game cosmetic items or ""skins"" that change the look of characters or items. Ubisoft is applying the NFT technology to this game mechanic, and calling its overall ecosystem ""Quartz"". NFTs are always unique in some way, but in-game cosmetics are identical for every player who gets a copy. Ubisoft's solution is to put a unique serial number on these digital items. Ubisoft's system will ask over-18s to connect a crypto-wallet to use the NFT system In one example shown by the company, a digital helmet worn by a character appears to have a serial number ""stamped in"" to the metal in its appearance - a number Ubisoft says will be different for every owner. That serial number will be visible in-game to other players, and each player can only own one of each ""Digit"" NFT, Ubisoft said. These Digits can then be bought and sold with crypto-currency like any other token on the blockchain - even for those who do not own or play Ubisoft's games. The items will also list previous owners in-game, it said. ""With Digits, items are no longer bound to a player's game inventory since they can be put on sale for other eligible players to acquire on third-party platforms outside of the Ubisoft ecosystem,"" it said. But it is unlikely the items would ever be able to be used in non-Ubisoft games. Some NFTs give the original creator a ""cut"" of the sale every time it changes hands. Ubisoft has not said if it has set up the system in that way. The company is characterising the entire release as a ""large-scale experiment"" and says it has been exploring blockchain technology for four years. Ubisoft says it is using the Tezos blockchain  because it requires ""exceedingly less energy"" than other systems used to mine Bitcoin or Ethereum crypto-currencies. Traditional crypto-systems use what's called ""proof of work"" which involves powerful computers doing extremely intense calculations to verify transactions. Tezos uses a different system, called ""proof of stake"". But the whole idea of including NFTs in games is controversial in itself, despiteinterest from another large gaming firm, EA. Steam, the largest PC gaming platform, hasbanned NFT and blockchain games from being listed on its store,external- which resulted in the removal of some early NFT-based games. One popularTwitter thread from a game designer on the topic,external, arguing that NFTs ""are harmful to games"" and that things are not ""made any easier or better by building them with NFTs and blockchain tech"", has been retweeted thousands of times. What are the fan tokens given to Messi by PSG? Twelve-year-old boy makes Â£290,000 from whale NFTs OpenSea admits insider trading of NFTs The trading of cosmetic items for real money has also been proven to work without blockchain technology - by Steam,which released a system for buying and selling in-game skins in 2012,external. But Ubisoft said its NFT system is a first step towards ""developing a true metaverse"". The metaverse concept sometimes includes the idea of digitally-owned items transferring between different digital worlds. Some enthusiasts believe NFTs offer a clear mechanic for doing so. ""Our long-term efforts led us to understand how blockchain's decentralised approach could genuinely make players stakeholders of our games, in a way that is also sustainable for our industry, placing back into their hands the value they generate through the time they spend, the items they buy or the content they create online,"" argued Nicolas Pouard from Ubisoft's innovation team.

Omicron appears more transmissible - No 10,"Early indications suggest the Omicron variant of coronavirus is ""more transmissible"" than Delta, Downing Street says But much remains unknown and the government is not looking at introducing its Plan B level of restrictions, a spokesman tells reporters Scientists are yet to draw firm conclusions but are continuing to analyse samples of the virus and real-world data People travelling to the UK must now take a Covid test before their journey as well as a PCR test upon their return There are 437 confirmed cases of the highly-mutated Omicron variant in the UK Experts believe it could overtake Delta to become the dominant variant That's about it from our live page coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a reminder of the major headlines from today:  Today's coverage has been written by Doug Faulkner, James Harness, Yaroslav Lukov and Rebecca Morton and edited by Emma Harrison and Holly Wallis. Thanks for joining us. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Officially there have been just over 400 Omicron infections. But
thatâs just the tip of the iceberg. It is based on positive tests sent to labs to check for
variants, which only happens in a minority of cases. Because of a quirk in the way Omicron shows on PCR tests it is
possible to identify suspected cases too. Using this data, researchers at the University of East Anglia
believe there could have been five to six times as many Omicron cases as the
official total shows. This data is what is behind suggestions the number of cases is
doubling every three days or so and the conclusion that it is more
transmissible than Delta. What is not clear is why. To what extent is it down to Omicronâs
ability to get past immunity, greater infectiousness or because it has a
shorter incubation period? The answer to that could have a big bearing on how quickly and
how far infection levels will climb. Another unknown is what that will mean for serious illness. You
would expect reinfections or infections post-vaccination to be milder. If that is the case, the proportion of cases ending up in
hospital will drop. But even if it halves, if infection rates more than double,
pressure on the NHS will still increase. The threat of hospitals being overwhelmed is now back on the
table. The number of new Covid cases reported across the UK this week is the highest weekly figure since January. A total of 336,893 new cases have been
reported in the past seven days, including 45,691 on Tuesday. This is the highest number for a
seven-day period since the week to 16 January, when 339,956 were reported. Weekly cases during the second wave of the virus peaked at
417,620, for the seven days to 9 January. This video can not be played Gatwick passengers on new covid restrictions We asked passengers travelling through Gatwick Airport for their views on changes to Covid restrictions. Most are concerned about the cost and stress it adds to travelling, although some think there are benefits to the extra virus screening. Lauren Rochat-Greene, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is among those quarantining in a hotel at Gatwick, after flying back to the UK from Cape Town, via Geneva. She says she has already paid nearly Â£4,000 in Covid tests, flights and hotel quarantine costs to get back from South Africa, but also has a Â£10,000 fine hanging over her head. Having flown out to visit family when South Africa was on the green list, she says she had to stay an extra week in Cape Town before flying to Geneva in order to get home. ""As I got into Geneva they pulled me aside and said they're not accepting anyone from red list countries. They said the rules had changed in the last 24-48 hours. They wanted to send me back on a flight to South Africa but I'm a British citizen,"" she says. As her PCR test was expiring she says she was told to get on a flight or go back to South Africa, and was taken to get another test before being escorted to the plane, without being able to book a space in a quarantine hotel. She says when she arrived in Luton she was told she should not have come and was given a notice of intent to serve a fixed penalty notice. After a five-hour wait at Luton she says a quarantine hotel room was found for her at Gatwick. ""I had to pay immediately more than Â£2,000. All in all it's cost me almost Â£4,000 extra. And I have the possibility of a fixed penalty notice of Â£10,000 hanging over my head."" Holidaymakers returning from South Africa are considering court actionafter long-awaited trips ended in quarantine. Couples have told the BBC they have spent thousands of pounds in hotel fees despite following all the Covid rules before travelling. More than 40,000 peoplehave signed a petition against the overnight move,externalto add countries, including South Africa, to the red list in response to the discovery of the Omicron variant. A judicial review on making people pay for mandatory hotel quarantining is being sought at the High Court on Thursday. Kate and Alex Freed from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had already been forced to postpone their wedding four times by lockdowns before finally tying the knot and jetting off to Cape Town at the start of November. They describe the increase of hotel prices as ""disgusting"" and are angry the UK brought in its travel ban overnight without the previous grace periods. A spokesman for the Department for Health and Social Care says: ""The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme."" Earlier we heard from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who extended Scotland's work-from-home guidance until mid-January - but Downing Street says that is ""not our position"". The prime minister's official spokesman says ""we are obviously looking at incoming data on the Omicron variant"" but ""our position remains as set out, with the limited number of restrictions we have introduced so far"". See you in Paris soon? Many countries are re-introducing restrictions in response to thenew Omicron variant. There are regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These are often changing quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. We've analysed - country-by-country - key things a traveller from the UK needs to know about going to each of seven popular destinations, including Ireland, Spain, France, Italy and the US.

authorities say workers, including some in the medical profession, are using or
supplying fake Covid vaccination certificates to get round new regulations. A senior health
official said there was a market for forged documentation and that some health
workers were involved. People are known to
be buying bogus certificates from medical workers for as little as $12. It comes after
authorities banned members of the public from entering government offices
without proof of at least one vaccine from 1 December. Since mid-November
authorities have required proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test for
government employees to enter their offices. Employees who have not been
immunised are required to pay for the PCR test twice a week at a cost of at
least $40 each time. Egypt has set a target of vaccinating 40% of the
population of 102 million by the end of this year but millions are still
reluctant or unwilling to get the jab. Two people were killed and four injured, including a 10-year-old child, when a gunman opened fire inside a public services office in Moscow on Tuesday, Russian officials say. The suspect - who was later detained - reportedly started shooting after being told to put a face mask on. A source told Russia's Interfax news agency that the man opened fire when a guard tried to escort him out of the building in the south-east of the capital. A criminal investigation into the shooting has been launched. If convicted, the 45-year-old suspect could be jailed for life. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media have reported new cases of Covid-19 in multiple cities in the eastern province of Zhejiang. There are confirmed cases
of the virus in the cities of Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo. It is reporting two cases of the virus in Hangzhou, and a new case recorded in Shaoxing. On Monday it was reported that the city of Ningbo had confirmed three cases of the virus. Officials said a further five people have tested positive in the city, sparking fears of a wider outbreak. It is routine for large-scale testing drives to be ordered whenever fresh cases are identified. Ningboâs Zhenhai District has issued a level 1 emergency response and gone into lockdown. All schools have been closed, and flights have been cancelled from Ningbo into the capital city, Beijing. China has maintained a low number of cases due to its zero-Covid strategy - communities are locked down the moment fresh cases of the virus are identified. On Monday, Nigeria became the eleventh African country to be added to the UK's travel red list. It means only UK and Irish citizens, and UK residents, can arrive from there - and they must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Oche Ameh, a British citizen, is an engineer in Lagos, Nigeria, and had booked to travel back to the UK to spend Christmas with his family in Nottingham. However, the new restrictions mean he would have to quarantine over Christmas and New Year and also spend Â£2,285 on a hotel. ""It costs too much. I'm incredibly upset,"" he says. ""My kids are expecting to see their dad for Christmas. It's heart-breaking. As soon as the [travel] ban is lifted, I'll come home."" Julie, pictured with her partner Simon, had hoped to visit her family for Christmas We've been hearing from more people affected by the change to the UK's travel rules. Julie, 39, who lives in Sheffield, had been hoping to visit her family in France this Christmas for the first time in more than two years. However, she says the cost of tests, as well as worries about giving Covid to her vulnerable parents or grandparents, mean ""unfortunately, it looks like it's not going to happen"". When she looked at test prices online she found the actual prices on company websites were much higher than those advertised on the government site. ""The situation changed very quickly, and new rules arrived with such a short notice. The ferry also contacted us twice to change the times of the journey, making us feel like they keep cancelling more trips,"" she tells the BBC. ""It all feels very unstable and last thing we want is be stuck in France and not be able to come back home."" ""I feel sad to have to postpone my holidays and worried this is going to break my family's heart,"" she adds. A further 45,691 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, according to the latest figures. That's up from 39,716 cases on Tuesday last week. There were also a further 180 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. On Monday 329,165 booster jabs or third doses were given, taking the total to more than 20.9 million. A family have described how they were forced to book separate quarantine hotel rooms 100 miles apart because there were no bigger rooms available. Jennie Bianco, 42, from Sheffield, was in South Africa for work before she was joined by her husband and six-year-old son for a five-day holiday. But the day after they arrived the country was put on the travel red list, meaning they would have to quarantine for 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK. Jennie had already spent Â£200 to change their flights and Â£600 to book extra accommodation after she was told there wouldn't be family rooms available for another four days. However, despite several calls to the customer service line they were unable to secure a family room due to a lack of availability. It meant she had to pay Â£2,285 for the single room plus Â£2,610 for the room for her husband and son, rather than getting a discounted family room - and Jennie had to get help from her dad to afford the cost. There was also no option to request rooms in the same hotel. Her husband and son were placed in Milton Keynes, while she was in Gatwick. Jennie is also worried about the impact of being separated from her son, who is adopted. ""Especially after being together for so long
during Covid and the separation anxiety that comes with that. But for him, itâs
a particularly difficult situation,"" she tells the BBC. A government spokesperson said: ""The majority of passengers who have used the managed quarantine service have been satisfied with the service and we aim to keep families together.â As Omicron spreads across the globe, many people face an anxious wait to see if they will be able to travel for Christmas. Lucy, from London, lives in Kenya and is hoping to travel back to the UK to see her family on Monday. Kenya is not on the red list but she's worried that could change. She's also concerned about getting her test result in the required time. She tells the BBC some testing centres in Kenya are facing a ""substantial increase"" in the number of tests they are dealing with, so ""they're worried about being able to meet those needs"". ""I haven't seen my sister in two years. I saw my parents last year but couldn't get back last Christmas because of restrictions, especially in London, with the costs and everything it wasn't worth it,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends are also coming back who have lived abroad, a lot of them got married and had babies and I feel like I've really missed out over the past two years."" Instead of being congratulated for being one of the first countries in the world to identify the Omicron variant, Botswana has been penalised for it, the countryâs President Mokgweetsi Masisi has said.Masisi told BBC World Newsâs Lucy Hockings that the travel ban had left the southern African nation's economy throttled. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the booster jab campaign needs to go faster. ""A number of weeks ago we said we should move to at least 500,000 a day. As I understand it the figures this week are lower than last week,"" he says. The opposition leader says we ""are in a race now between this booster regime and the new variant"" and the government should have acted weeks ago, adding that the programme needs to be ramped up immediately. On Sunday 290,165 booster jabs were given, taking the total number of people who have received a booster or third dose to 20,580,644. That's 35.8% of the population over 12 in the UK. Here's how to get a booster jab. There is already ""immense pressure"" on hospitals even before the impact of the new Omicron variant is fully felt, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine says. Dr Nick Scriven tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme his hospital in Yorkshire is ""as busy as I can remember it"". ""Itâs not just Covid, the Covid wards area is actually beginning
to empty a little bit at the moment,"" he says. However, he adds that Covid patients tend to be in hospital a lot longer than people with other illnesses. If hospital admissions start to increase as the Omicron variant spreads, he says wards will be more crowded and nurses ""will be run off their feet"". Care may not be so ""dignified"" and there may be delays to less urgent treatment, he adds. People are being asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households Sturgeon says it is vital to ""strengthen compliance"" with existing measures to slow the spread of Omicron. People are already advised to work from home where practical, but she says employers are now being asked to ensure this is happening. If staff were working from home at the start of the pandemic, they should be asked to do so again, she adds. This advice will be in place until the middle of January, when it will be reviewed. People are also asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households. However, the first minister says she ""cannot guarantee"" further measures will not be needed. It is important to remain open to any proportionate measures, such as the extension of Covid certification, she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

Wales expects significant wave of Omicron,"This video can not be played The Welsh government says it is expecting a significant wave of the Omicron variant of coronavirus this winter Wales stands on the brink of ""another potentially perilous moment"" ahead of an expected ""formidable wave"" of Omicron cases, First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned. Five cases have been found in Wales but this is expected to rise substantially, with a peak by the end of January. Plans for all adults to be offered abooster jabby the end of that month were announced. Mr Drakeford appealed to the public to take up the offer. Health Minister Eluned Morgan expressed concern the variant ""spreads very rapidly"". On Tuesday officials confirmed the fifth Omicron case in Wales, among 101 cases reported in the UK on the same day. It brings the total to 437. The variant is believed to be spreadingin the community in England. The prime minister's official spokesman has said Omicronappears more transmissible than Delta- the variant of coronavirus currently dominant in the UK. Live: Welsh government press conference All adults offered booster jab by end of January Could Wales go into another lockdown? Scotland's first minister says her government will be reviewing Covid restrictions on a daily basis due to arapid increasein cases of the variant there. In the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday Mark Drakeford said Wales stands at the brink of ""another potentially perilous moment"" in the pandemic. He said Wales has to ""brace ourselves for the potential for a formidable wave of new infections in the new year, potentially just six weeks from now, if we cannot slow the spread of this new variant"". Appealing for people to be vaccinated, he added: ""It is the best Christmas present you can give yourself and your family this year, and it's not too dramatic to say that it's an investment in making sure that you are here for a healthy and happy Christmas next year as well."" He spoke following a Welsh government press conference where his colleague Eluned Morgan refused to rule out tightening Covid rules. No new restrictions have yet been introduced in Wales in response to the new variant, but she said: ""We can't give you any assurances on that because we are still learning about the situation."" Ministers have instead stressed the need to take care over the festive period, and Ms Morgan recommended people take lateral flow tests before meeting friends over Christmas. ""It's clear people should act with caution,"" the minister said. Mark Drakeford is due to announce his latest review of coronavirus restrictions on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

The health minister said it was not yet known how sick the Omicron variant could make people. Hospital admissions in South Africa had gone go up from about 143 to 788 in two weeks, she said, but added that ""we don't know if that's a pattern we would see reflected in our population"". ""We don't know the extent to which vaccines will give us protection but we do think they will give us a lot more than having no vaccine at all. So that's why our plea today is please help us in this situation."" Is Omicron more harmful than other Covid variants? Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? Ms Morgan said: ""We are expecting a significant wave of Omicron to hit Wales. ""The modelling suggests that it will reach its peak by around the end of January, which is why there is an urgency in terms of getting people vaccinated and boosters done as soon as possible."" No new restrictions have been announced for the Christmas period in Wales Speaking with BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Cheryl Walter, a lecturer in microbiology at Hull University, said that South African clinicians have said for a while that they are only seeing mild disease in patients diagnosed with Omicron. ""In terms of potency, it might be transmitted more easily, and again that is unsurprising when you look at the rate of cases of Omicron and how quickly they have crept up. ""But anecdotal studies and clinicians are saying that the Omicron variant of the disease is relatively mind, which is really good news,"" she added. All cases of Omicron in Wales have so far been detected in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area. Dr Meng Khaw of Public Health Wales said the fifth individual, announced on Tuesday, had recently travelled. ""As we have said previously, an increase in cases of Omicron variant in Wales is to be expected,"" she said. The overall seven-day rolling case rate per 100,000 people has risen slightly to 493.3. There were two more deaths reported by Public Health Wales on Tuesday, bringing the total to 6,441. On Tuesday the Welsh government announced it would offer all adults a booster vaccine by the end of January, in line with targets announced last week in England and Scotland. It follows advice to bring forward the gap between second and third doses from six months to three - significantly increasing the number of adults eligible for a third dose. Plans include: More vaccination centres, with drive-through options and longer opening hours. Walk-in centres for over-65s without an appointment Asking for additional help from the military to allow some parts of Wales to double the number of vaccinations provided Students, fire services and council staff to provide help at clinics, alongside GPs and community pharmacies This will allow the NHS to ramp up the number of vaccinations from 19,000 a day to the goal of more than 200,000 a week. At Tuesday's press conference, Ms Morgan there may be a need ""to reduce some planned care"" in the NHS to run the booster programme ""but we're obviously hoping that we can keep our GP surgeries going as usual"". Some family doctors had ""stepped up and offered support, but we're not expecting that provision within our community to be reduced at this time"", Ms Morgan added. Tuesday marks one year since the first Covid-19 vaccination was administered in Wales Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Gill Richardson encouraged pregnant women to get vaccinated before the variant takes hold. She said intensive care admissions for unvaccinated pregnant women ""are really much higher than they should be"". According to recent figures, one in six patients receiving the ECMO treatment,Â the most intense form of intensive care,Â were pregnant. Dr Richardson accepted that the decision was "" very difficult"" and ""women are worried and concerned"". But she asked them to talk to their midwives and partners about the vaccine, ""because we have seen some real tragedies amongst pregnant ladies who have sadly left their families behind and succumbed to the Delta variant"". Welsh Conservative and shadow health minister Russell George said: ""I am pleased that the minister has finally heeded our calls to rapidly roll out booster jabs and redeploy our volunteer army, even implementing our proposal for walk-in centres which she called free-for-alls only a few days ago. ""However, the reported possibility of extending vaccine passports to hospitality business is a slap in the face for one of the worst-affected sectors of the pandemic."" Plaid Cymru said ministers should base any decisions on new restrictions or lockdowns on emerging evidence of the seriousness of the Omicron variant. Delyth Jewell said: ""In the interim, being in a vacuum is not a good place to be, so businesses need to have clarity on whether there are going to be further restrictions.""

"Sturgeon warns of 'rapid' rise in Omicron casesScotland's Covid restrictions to be reviewed daily as first minister warns that Omicron is a ""significant challenge"".Scotland politics","Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis due to a rapid increase in cases of the Omicron variant, Nicola Sturgeon has said. A total of 99 cases of Omicron have now been detected in Scotland - a tenfold increase in the space of a week. The first minister said she expected the number to continue to increase, and for the new variant to ""account for a rising share of overall cases"". She said the emergence of Omicron was a ""significant challenge for all of us"". Travel rules have already been tightened, and Ms Sturgeon said she would consider on a daily basis whether other measures - such as the extended use of Covid passports - were needed. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid-19 The overall number of Covid cases in Scotland has increased in the past week to around 2,800 new cases per day, having fallen in the previous fortnight. The bulk of the new cases have been among people aged under 60, which Ms Sturgeon said was ""encouraging"" and proof of the success of booster vaccines. The number of people in hospitals and intensive care wards with Covid has also fallen over the past week. But Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the emergence of the Omicron variant was an ""additional and very significant cause for concern"". Cases have been reported in nine of Scotland's 14 health board areas, with fears of widespread community transmission. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I would expect to see a continued and potentially rapid rise in cases in the days ahead, and for Omicron to account for a rising share of overall cases."" Covid regulations - including the use of vaccine passports - will be reviewed daily The first minister also said early data suggested that Omicron was more transmissible than the currently dominant Delta variant - ""perhaps significantly so"" - and could be more capable of re-infecting people who have previously had Covid. She said this had the potential to put very intense additional pressure on the health service over the winter. The government is to review restrictions on a daily basis, with Ms Sturgeon urging people to get vaccinated and to up their compliance with existing measures. She also said employers should ensure that all staff who can work from home are able to, saying this should continue until at least the middle of January. She said: ""Let's all pull together, do what is necessary, and get each other and the country through this winter and into what we all hope will be a better and brighter spring."" This is a holding statement, more notable for a change in tone rather than any pre-Christmas change in regulations. While the first minister still hopes new restrictions can be avoided she offers no guarantees this will be the case. Nicola Sturgeon has urged tighter compliance with existing rules and made clear the need for additional protections will be kept under daily review. She also signalled that extending the use of Covid passports remains an option for the Scottish government. It is clear that ministers are becoming increasingly concerned about the spread of the Omicron variant, with case numbers apparently doubling every two to three days. Because it is spreading faster than previous versions of Covid and may have some vaccine resistance, they worry that it could quickly put the NHS under severe strain. Opposition leaders said the government could be doing more to tackle the ""huge challenges"" facing the NHS. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ministers had ""failed to do enough to prevent this crisis escalating when hundreds of patients are left waiting more than half a day to be seen in our hospitals"". And Labour's Anas Sarwar said there were thousands of vacancies within the NHS, with people still waiting for postponed operations and specialist treatment. Ms Sturgeon said said NHS staffing was at record levels, and that her government would continue to work to support services to recover from the pandemic. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

BBC 100 women: Who is on the list?The BBC has reveals its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2021,"The BBC has revealed its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2021. This year 100 Women is highlighting those who are hitting ""reset"" - women playing their part to reinvent our society, our culture and our world. Among them are Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Samoa's first female prime minister FiamÄ Naomi Mata'afa, Professor Heidi J Larson, who heads The Vaccine Confidence Project, and acclaimed author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Women from Afghanistan make up half of this year's list, some of whom appear under pseudonyms and without photos for their own safety. The resurgence of the Taliban in August 2021 has changed the lives of millions of Afghans - with girls banned from receiving secondary education, the ministry for women's affairs being disbanded, and women in many cases told not to return to work. This year's list recognises the scope of their bravery and their achievements as they are forced to reset their lives. Award-winning poet and writer, whose poetry and articles challenge patriarchal norms in Afghan culture. Lima Aafshid has worked as an independent reporter and social commentator for more than five years. She is also a member of Sher-e-daneshgah, the Kabul Poetry Association, which held virtual poetry sessions during the pandemic to help its more than 200 members maintain a sense of community despite the health crisis. *The fall of Afghanistan is like sinking back into the same mud we struggled with for 20 years. I am hopeful, however, that we can rise like a branch, reaching towards the light in the gloom of the forest. The first hijab-wearing supermodel, Halima Aden is a Somali by descent but was born in a refugee camp in Kenya. In 2017, she signed to one of the worldâs biggest modelling agencies, IMG Models, adding a clause to her contract that she would not be asked to take off her hijab when modelling. She was the first model to wear a hijab on the cover of British Vogue, Allure and Sports Illustratedâs swimsuit edition. Aden campaigns to improve awareness and visibility for Muslim women and was a Unicef ambassador for childrenâs rights. In 2020, she stepped away from modelling as she found it incompatible with her Muslim faith, but she continues to make an impact within the fashion industry and beyond. *Weâve seen our frontline workers go through extreme measures to keep us safe during the pandemic and I pray that we appreciate their sacrifices. We can reset the world by moving forward with gratitude. Criminal lawyer and founder of the all-women law firm Headfort Foundation, which offers pro-bono legal services. Based in Lagos, the four-person legal team visits prisons to help poor and wrongly incarcerated inmates who are unable to get bail, as well as citizens enduring long pre-trial detentions (in Nigeria, those awaiting trial make up about 70% of the prison population). Oluyemi Adetiba-Orija and her team focus on under-age offenders, offering them another chance at life outside prison. Since it started operating in 2018, the foundation has provided free legal assistance to more than 125 people charged with minor offences. *For the world to be reset, we all have a role to play! Speak, advocate and support good causes, ensuring freedom and safety for the world.

She is a former member of Afghanistanâs Youth Parliament, where she worked for the rights of women and children. In 2018, she received an N-Peace award, given by the United Nations Development Programme to outstanding women in peace-building and conflict resolution. *I never experienced such sudden change â as if no government existed before. Now our only hope is for the young generation to fill the gaps and reform the system, but that will only be possible with international support. Misogyny and the oppression of women are at the heart of this Afghan visual artistâs work. Rada Akbar has always used art as a medium to enable her to speak up and give women greater visibility in society. Since 2019, she has been organising annual ""Superwomen"" (Abarzanan) exhibitions to mark International Womenâs Day and to celebrate the central role that women have played in her countryâs history. Until recently, she had been trying to set up a museum of womenâs history in Kabul or elsewhere. She believes her art helps denounce the social laws that condemn women in the name of political, economic and religious beliefs. *Afghanistan and its citizens have been abused and violated by extremists and world leaders for decades. But we have never stopped working for a progressive country and we will live in a free and prosperous Afghanistan again.

Award-wining TV, film and theatre actress and human-rights activist Leena Alam is renowned for her appearances in feminist television shows in Afghanistan, including Shereen and Killing of Farkhunda, which told the story of an Afghan woman who was falsely accused of burning the Quran and was publicly lynched by a mob of angry men. Alam fled Afghanistan in the 1980s and now lives in the US but has continued to tell stories of her home country. In 2009 she was appointed a peace ambassador for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. *It took us decades to rebuild with so much blood and sacrifice. Watching it all fall to the ground in the blink of an eye is heart-breaking, but the fight must continue, this time with stronger foundations.

Often considered the worldâs best goalball player, she has been top scorer at two Paralympic Games, two world championships and four European championships. Altunoluk helped the Turkish womenâs team win Paralympic gold in Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. Born in Tokat, Anatolia, she completed a degree in physical education in Ankara. *Disability should not be seen as an obstacle, but as an opportunity for self-expression. A librarian and book lover, Wahida Amiri is a law graduate and frequent protester. When the Taliban took power in Afghanistan and she could no longer work at her library, she took to the streets of Kabul. She was joined by countless other women in a collective march to ask the international community to support Afghan womenâs rights to work and to an education. Since the Taliban outlawed protests, Amiri has gathered with other women to promote reading and discussion. Her library had been operating since 2017 and Amiri says that without her books, she has lost her identity. *The world did not respect us as humans. But as Afghanistan goes through destruction, we revive hope through protests, demanding justice and encouraging book reading. As a climate expert working to accelerate the shift toward emissions-free transportation, MÃ³nica Araya has guided sustainability campaigns in the Americas and Europe - including the citizen initiative, Costa Rica Limpia, which helped her home country consolidate its position as a world leader in renewable energy.

Afghanistan's first waste-paper recycling factory, Gul-e-Mursal, was founded by businesswoman Zuhal Atmar. With a background in economics and business, she set up a women-led factory in Kabul in 2016. It has created 100 jobs, 30% of which have gone to women, from the factory floor to marketing. The factory collects waste and non-confidential papers from non-governmental organisations and processes almost 35 tonnes of paper a week, recycling them into toilet paper, which is then sold across the country. Atmar has been vocal about how difficult it is for women to get the financial support they need to set up and run a business in Afghanistan. *What does the future look like? The dreams, goals and hopes of the youth and women have been destroyed. A former domestic worker herself, Marcelina Bautista is director of Mexicoâs support and training centre for domestic workers (CACEH), which she founded 21 years ago. She campaigns to secure rights, such as fair wages and sick leave, enjoyed by other workers, and to improve their social status. Her initiative combines education for workers, employers and community members. Bautista was actively involved in negotiations that led the Mexican government formally to join an international labour agreement that protects domestic workers from exploitation, violence and unsafe working conditions. She was awarded an international human-rights prize from the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in Germany in 2010. *Changing the world means changing the conditions of millions of domestic workers, mostly women, who work at home while others develop professionally. This social inequality will only end when domestic work gets the recognition it deserves. Social activist and human-rights advocate Crystal Bayat figured prominently in protests against the Taliban takeover in 2021, helping organise one in Kabul on 19 August - independence day in Afghanistan. Bayat had begun a PhD in political management before her studies were interrupted when the Taliban took control of the country. She is currently based in the US, from where she continues the fight to preserve Afghan human-rights achievements. She also hopes to finish her PhD and write a book. *Ultimately, I want to be part of any future democratic changes in Afghanistan. My dream is to speak at the UN because I believe the world needs to hear what real Afghans, especially women, have to say. After working for the government at the presidential palace for a number of years, in various capacities, Razia Barakzai found herself without a job once the Taliban took power in Afghanistan. Since then, she has been actively involved in marches in Kabul, where countless women have demanded the right to work and receive an education. She was also one of the women behind the slogan #AfghanWomenExist, which highlights the fact that fear is driving Afghan women away from social media. Barakzai has a degree in law and political science, and an MBA. In a letter she wrote for the BBC about her experience campaigning, she said: âDying for freedom is preferable to living in slavery.â *The educated and young of the country - especially the brave, warrior women of Afghanistan - one day will be the flag-bearers of freedom. I see this every day through the demonstrations in the streets. The captain of the national wheelchair basketball team and a prominent advocate for women with disabilities, Nilofar Bayat fled Afghanistan to escape the Taliban. She and her husband, Ramish - also a wheelchair player - both worked for the International Red Cross. When she was two years old, a rocket hit her family home, killing her brother and damaging her spinal cord. Bayat played her first game of basketball in an open court in the middle of Kabul, a turning point for sportswomen in Afghanistan. She has become a voice for refugees fleeing her homeland, and she set up an association for Afghan women. Bayat hopes to play basketball again. *I hope it is game over in Afghanistan and we donât pay the price of war for another second. I hope to see a real smile on the faces of my people.

The amateur historian investigated the deaths of 796 children at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Galway, conducting years of painstaking research that helped uncover a mass grave at the site of the former Irish institution for unmarried mothers, where hundreds of infants had disappeared, with no evidence of their burial, between the 1920s and the 1950s. This year, a long-awaited report on these institutions, run mostly by Catholic nuns, found an ""appalling level of infant mortality"" from various diseases, leading to an apology from the Irish government. Corless has received the Bar of Ireland Human Rights Award in recognition of her âexceptional humanitarian serviceâ. *If I could reset the world, I would obliterate the word ""shame"".

Ensandost, who has a degree in religious studies, has been active in promoting womenâs roles in political and civil affairs and appeared on Afghan media to speak about womenâs rights to work and learn. She recently took part in a public demonstration in Kabul, where she wore a shroud-like white fabric to protest against the oppression of women in her country. As well as being a teacher, she has been an active member of various womenâs associations in Afghanistan. *I want to see women be included in political, social, and economic affairs, a woman's right to an education to be upheld, and violence and inequalities against women and minorities to be eradicated.

She also works with women in rural areas who have experienced domestic violence, making sure they have shelter and helping them seek justice. *I thought we had lost everything and felt hopeless, but when I remembered everything we had done, I regained the courage to continue.

Smallman criticised the policeâs handling of the initial missing-persons call and said her two girls might have been victims of ""racial profiling"" and ""classism"". She says she has forgiven her daughtersâ killer: ""When we hold hatred for someone, itâs not only them who are held captive, itâs you, because your thoughts become consumed by revenge. I refuse to give him that power."" *As a teacher and a priest, I have dedicated my life to raising boys and girls that people looked down on.

Malala's message to an Afghan schoolgirl Rebel Wilson: I know what it's like to be invisible I am an Afghan lawyer but can't work anymore The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - women who are hitting ""reset"", playing their part to reinvent our world after the global pandemic has forced so many of us to reassess the way we live. It was also measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final names were chosen. This year BBC 100 Women made the unprecedented decision to devote half of the list to women from one country - Afghanistan.  Recent events in the country have made headlines and left millions of Afghans questioning their future, as rights groups have spoken up in fear that women's freedoms could be eroded for the foreseeable future under the Taliban. By dedicating half of the list to women who are from or work in the country, we wanted to highlight how many of them have been forced to disappear from areas of public life, as well as to share the voices of those who are being increasingly silenced or who are part of a new Afghan diaspora. On 3 December, the Taliban did issue a decree in the name of their supreme leader instructing ministries ""to take serious action"" on women's rights. The decree sets out the rules governing marriage and property for women, stating that women should not be forced into marriage and should not be seen as ""property"". But this declaration has been criticised by human rights organisations and observers as it fails to mention girls' secondary education and women's curtailed rights to employment. Some of the Afghan women on the list are anonymous to protect them and their families, with their consent and following all BBC Editorial Policy and safety guidelines.

Biden and Putin talks as Ukraine tensions rise,"Putin joined the meeting by video link from Sochi The US says it is preparing ""strong economic and other measures"" over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin spoke. In a video call, President Biden voiced worries over Russian troop build-ups near the border with Ukraine and called for a de-escalation of tensions. Russia says it will not attack. President Putin accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to Russia. More than 90,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. The movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. ANALYSIS:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? After Tuesday's call, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration was preparing specific robust responses in the weeks ahead if they were required. The measures included economic sanctions and other actions such as additional troop deployments to Nato allies in the region and defence equipment for Ukraine. Mr Sullivan refused to be drawn on what the economic measures might be. But he said Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which is not yet in operation, provided ""leverage"" for the US and its allies. ""If Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,"" he told journalists. Earlier reports said US officials had reached agreement with Germany to shut down the pipeline in the event of an invasion. Mr Biden was accompanied by top officials for the call Other possible measures include restrictions on Russia's banks converting roubles into foreign currencies, or even disconnecting Russia from the Swift global financial payment system, reports say. ""Things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now,"" Mr Sullivan added, referring to Western responses to Russia's annexation of Crimea. He also said there was ""a lot of give and take"" in the call and ""no finger-wagging"" but that President Biden was ""crystal clear where the United States stands on all of these issues"". Video footage of the opening moments showed friendly greetings between the US and Russian leaders, before the talks continued behind closed doors. The call was held on a secure video link set up under previous administrations but never used before. President Putin spoke from his residence in the southern resort of Sochi and President Biden from the White House. By Jonathan Marcus of the Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter Russia's military option could take a variety of forms from a large incursion, to a significant invasion of the eastern part of Ukraine. One aim would be to bring the main fighting elements of the Ukrainian army to battle and to inflict such a defeat upon them that the Kyiv government has to rethink its position. Invading territory amidst a hostile population has significant risks. Ukraine's armed forces have had some Western weaponry and training and are much improved since 2015. However, Russian forces have also improved over recent years. The firepower Russia is building up is impressive. For all the talk about Ukrainian sovereignty Nato cannot and will not come to Ukraine's aid. And additional weapons supplies might simply contribute to Russia's justification for war. Moscow's calculation of the costs of conflict may also be influenced by previous military deployments. While the West currently sees military engagements through the prism of the strategic defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia may take a very different view. Its operations in Georgia, its seizure of Crimea, its combat in eastern Ukraine - not to mention its involvement in Syria - may all be seen by President Putin as relative victories. Of all the military contingencies, Michael Kofman, of the US Centre for Naval Analyses, still thinks that if it happens it will be big. ""I think Russia is in the best position since 2014 economically, politically, and militarily to execute such an operation, which is not to say it will happen, but simply to suggest that there are the fewest constraints relative to other periods when it has conducted offensive operations."" Read the full analysis Meanwhile, a Kremlin statement said President Putin had stressed that Russia should not be held responsible for tensions because Nato was making ""dangerous attempts to take over Ukrainian territory and increasing its military potential"" on Russia's borders. ""Therefore Russia is seriously interested in getting reliable guarantees fixed in law to rule out the eastward expansion of Nato and the location in countries neighbouring Russia of offensive weapons systems,""the statement added (in Russian).,external The White House said President Biden did not make any guarantees to limit Nato expansion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that, while the talks brought ""no sensations"", he was grateful for President Biden's ""unwavering support"". Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the Reuters news agency that talks between Mr Biden and Mr Putin had enabled ""deterrence and de-escalation"". But he said the focus is to put together a deterrence package to ward off any further escalation from Russia. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether President Putin has made a decision. Presidents Biden and Putin last met in person in Switzerland in June, but made little progress other than to agree to send their ambassadors back and begin a dialogue on nuclear arms control. In a conference call on Monday night, the White House said the leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy had formed a joint strategy ""to impose significant and severe harm on the Russian economy"" should Russia launch an invasion. President Biden spoke to the four European leaders again after his talks with President Putin. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line A large part of the recent Russian military build-up is in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine and then annexed in 2014. Troops are also gathering near Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which are under the control of Russian-backed separatists. More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in seven years of conflict since Russian-backed forces seized large areas of Ukraine's east.

Western powers back Ukraine amid invasion fears,"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Western powers have called on Russia to lower tensions with Ukraine, ahead of a video call between US President Joe Biden and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Responding to fears of a Russian invasion, Mr Biden agreed with leaders of the UK, France, Germany and Italy to use ""all the tools at their disposal"". Moscow denies it has plans to attack. But Russia has moved thousands of troops near Ukraine's eastern borders, and Ukraine says tanks have been moved to the front line inside its territory. Hours before the video talks scheduled for 15:00 GMT, it appeared Washington was not planning a US military response, but focusing instead on tough economic sanctions. In a conference call on Monday night, the White House said the five Western leaders had formed a joint strategy ""to impose significant and severe harm on the Russian economy"" should Russia launch an invasion. They ""reaffirmed their staunch support for Ukraine's territorial integrity"", Downing Street said. BACKGROUND: Why Russia is stoking border tensions with Ukraine Possible measures include restrictions on Russia's banks converting roubles into foreign currencies, or even disconnecting Russia from the Swift global financial payment system, reports say. A Ukrainian government serviceman on the front line in Donetsk Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has condemned talk of a Russian incursion as ""shallow and unfounded"". Russia wants guarantees that Ukraine will not try to seize areas captured by Russian-backed separatists in 2014 and has warned the West not to cross ""red lines"" by adding Ukraine to Nato's military alliance. More than 90,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. A large part of the recent Russian military build-up is in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine and then annexed in 2014. Troops are also gathering near Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the name for parts of Luhansk and Donetsk regions under the control of Russian-backed separatists. Ukrainian officials have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January. The defence ministry said on Tuesday that heavy armour was being reinforced in rebel-held areas, including with tanks, artillery and snipers. More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in seven years of conflict since Russian-backed forces seized large areas of Ukraine's east. The two presidents last met in person in Geneva in June, but made little progress other than to agree to send their ambassadors back and begin a dialogue on nuclear arms control. Mr Peskov said the Russian president would ""listen with great attention"" to Mr Biden's proposals on Ukraine.

"Wales expects significant wave of OmicronThe variant spreads rapidly and could peak by the end of January, Wales' health minister says.WalesComments","This video can not be played The Welsh government says it is expecting a significant wave of the Omicron variant of coronavirus this winter Wales stands on the brink of ""another potentially perilous moment"" ahead of an expected ""formidable wave"" of Omicron cases, First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned. Five cases have been found in Wales but this is expected to rise substantially, with a peak by the end of January. Plans for all adults to be offered abooster jabby the end of that month were announced. Mr Drakeford appealed to the public to take up the offer. Health Minister Eluned Morgan expressed concern the variant ""spreads very rapidly"". On Tuesday officials confirmed the fifth Omicron case in Wales, among 101 cases reported in the UK on the same day. It brings the total to 437. The variant is believed to be spreadingin the community in England. The prime minister's official spokesman has said Omicronappears more transmissible than Delta- the variant of coronavirus currently dominant in the UK. Live: Welsh government press conference All adults offered booster jab by end of January Could Wales go into another lockdown? Scotland's first minister says her government will be reviewing Covid restrictions on a daily basis due to arapid increasein cases of the variant there. In the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday Mark Drakeford said Wales stands at the brink of ""another potentially perilous moment"" in the pandemic. He said Wales has to ""brace ourselves for the potential for a formidable wave of new infections in the new year, potentially just six weeks from now, if we cannot slow the spread of this new variant"". Appealing for people to be vaccinated, he added: ""It is the best Christmas present you can give yourself and your family this year, and it's not too dramatic to say that it's an investment in making sure that you are here for a healthy and happy Christmas next year as well."" He spoke following a Welsh government press conference where his colleague Eluned Morgan refused to rule out tightening Covid rules. No new restrictions have yet been introduced in Wales in response to the new variant, but she said: ""We can't give you any assurances on that because we are still learning about the situation."" Ministers have instead stressed the need to take care over the festive period, and Ms Morgan recommended people take lateral flow tests before meeting friends over Christmas. ""It's clear people should act with caution,"" the minister said. Mark Drakeford is due to announce his latest review of coronavirus restrictions on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

The health minister said it was not yet known how sick the Omicron variant could make people. Hospital admissions in South Africa had gone go up from about 143 to 788 in two weeks, she said, but added that ""we don't know if that's a pattern we would see reflected in our population"". ""We don't know the extent to which vaccines will give us protection but we do think they will give us a lot more than having no vaccine at all. So that's why our plea today is please help us in this situation."" Is Omicron more harmful than other Covid variants? Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? Ms Morgan said: ""We are expecting a significant wave of Omicron to hit Wales. ""The modelling suggests that it will reach its peak by around the end of January, which is why there is an urgency in terms of getting people vaccinated and boosters done as soon as possible."" No new restrictions have been announced for the Christmas period in Wales Speaking with BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Cheryl Walter, a lecturer in microbiology at Hull University, said that South African clinicians have said for a while that they are only seeing mild disease in patients diagnosed with Omicron. ""In terms of potency, it might be transmitted more easily, and again that is unsurprising when you look at the rate of cases of Omicron and how quickly they have crept up. ""But anecdotal studies and clinicians are saying that the Omicron variant of the disease is relatively mind, which is really good news,"" she added. All cases of Omicron in Wales have so far been detected in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area. Dr Meng Khaw of Public Health Wales said the fifth individual, announced on Tuesday, had recently travelled. ""As we have said previously, an increase in cases of Omicron variant in Wales is to be expected,"" she said. The overall seven-day rolling case rate per 100,000 people has risen slightly to 493.3. There were two more deaths reported by Public Health Wales on Tuesday, bringing the total to 6,441. On Tuesday the Welsh government announced it would offer all adults a booster vaccine by the end of January, in line with targets announced last week in England and Scotland. It follows advice to bring forward the gap between second and third doses from six months to three - significantly increasing the number of adults eligible for a third dose. Plans include: More vaccination centres, with drive-through options and longer opening hours. Walk-in centres for over-65s without an appointment Asking for additional help from the military to allow some parts of Wales to double the number of vaccinations provided Students, fire services and council staff to provide help at clinics, alongside GPs and community pharmacies This will allow the NHS to ramp up the number of vaccinations from 19,000 a day to the goal of more than 200,000 a week. At Tuesday's press conference, Ms Morgan there may be a need ""to reduce some planned care"" in the NHS to run the booster programme ""but we're obviously hoping that we can keep our GP surgeries going as usual"". Some family doctors had ""stepped up and offered support, but we're not expecting that provision within our community to be reduced at this time"", Ms Morgan added. Tuesday marks one year since the first Covid-19 vaccination was administered in Wales Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Gill Richardson encouraged pregnant women to get vaccinated before the variant takes hold. She said intensive care admissions for unvaccinated pregnant women ""are really much higher than they should be"". According to recent figures, one in six patients receiving the ECMO treatment,Â the most intense form of intensive care,Â were pregnant. Dr Richardson accepted that the decision was "" very difficult"" and ""women are worried and concerned"". But she asked them to talk to their midwives and partners about the vaccine, ""because we have seen some real tragedies amongst pregnant ladies who have sadly left their families behind and succumbed to the Delta variant"". Welsh Conservative and shadow health minister Russell George said: ""I am pleased that the minister has finally heeded our calls to rapidly roll out booster jabs and redeploy our volunteer army, even implementing our proposal for walk-in centres which she called free-for-alls only a few days ago. ""However, the reported possibility of extending vaccine passports to hospitality business is a slap in the face for one of the worst-affected sectors of the pandemic."" Plaid Cymru said ministers should base any decisions on new restrictions or lockdowns on emerging evidence of the seriousness of the Omicron variant. Delyth Jewell said: ""In the interim, being in a vacuum is not a good place to be, so businesses need to have clarity on whether there are going to be further restrictions.""

Gales and rain as Storm Barra sweeps UK,"Sleet and snow fall outside a pharmacy in Biggar, South Lanarkshire Strong winds, heavy rain and snow have hit parts of the UK, as Storm Barra sweeps across the country. Most of the UK was covered by severe yellow weather warnings on Tuesday - with only the far north of Scotland escaping the worst weather. Gales and blizzards have been reported, with wind gusts reaching 86mph at Aberdaron in Gwynedd. About 3,200 homes in north-east Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have lost power. But Storm Barra is not expected to be as bad as its predecessor, Arwen, which hit the UK 11 days ago and left thousands of homes without electricity. About 360 homes are still without power in the North East of England, an area in the path of the new storm. Flood warnings have been issued in28 places across the UK for Wednesday, including in Sunderland, Bournemouth, Aberystwyth and Orkney. This video can not be played Storm Barra brings strong winds, heavy rain and snow to NI The Met Officeweather warnings included,externala yellow warning for wind covering all of England and Wales, as well as south-west and east Scotland, which ended at midnight. A yellow warning of heavy snow for inland areas of Scotland also until midnight that also lasted until midnight. A yellow warning for wind for parts of south and south-west England, as well as the east coast and south of Wales is still in place - lasting until 18:00 GMT on Wednesday. As Storm Barra swept in from the Atlantic earlier on Tuesday, strong winds with gusts of up to 80mph were recorded in the Republic of Ireland. Schools closed across 12 counties in Ireland and 49,000 homes and businesses were without power.

The storm left 1,700 homes without powerin parts of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshireand also caused school closures and delays across the transport network. A Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks spokesman said: ""We are re-routing the network to restore customer supplies quickly where possible, and all faults will be worked on this evening and into the night."" Snow has already fallen in northern England and southern Scotland. High winds damaged the roof of a school in Stranraer, while a fallen tree blocked the A702 road in South Lanarkshire. Four schools also shut in Dumfries and Galloway. The storm is set to continue eastwards, with travel disruption, power outages and large waves in coastal areas possible, the Met Office said.

Asked whether it was acceptable for people to be without power for as long as they had been, he replied: ""No I don't think it is. Too many people have spent too long without power.""""I think that we need to learn the lessons for the future and make sure that we have better resilience against storms of this kind.

Edinburgh's giant pandas to stay another two years,"Tian Tian arrived in Scotland, along with Yang Guang, from China in 2011 Edinburgh Zoo's giant pandas will remain in Scotland for another two years, it has been confirmed. It was thought Yang Guang and Tian Tian would have to return to China under the terms of the initial 10-year deal. The zoo had been paying about Â£750,000 annually to China for the pandas but said that amount would be halved for the two-year extension. It was also confirmed that breeding would not be attempted over the next two years. In total, there have been eight unsuccessful attempts at artificial insemination, the latest one earlier this year. David Field, the chief executive of the Royal Zoological Society Scotland (RZSS), said they were ""thrilled"" the 10-year contract with the Chinese government had been extended. He said: ""Yang Guang and Tian Tian have helped millions of people connect with nature, so it is fantastic that they will be with us a little longer before we say goodbye, especially as the pandemic has made it much harder for people to visit them. ""We also hope that international travel restrictions will ease over the next two years, meaning our giant panda keepers will be able to travel with Yang Guang and Tian Tian to China and help them settle into their new homes. This will be ideal as they both have strong bonds with our panda team."" Yang Guang was given a new enclosure in 2019 Edinburgh Zoo has had financial pressures resulting from a Â£2m loss during Covid lockdown closures. During the pandemic, the zoo has taken a government loan, furloughed staff, made redundancies and launched a fundraising appeal, but was not eligible for the UK government's zoo fund, which was aimed at smaller zoos. The zoo is part of a number of conservation projects, including one to reintroduce Scottish wildcats. A number of natural and artificial insemination breeding attempts between the pandas were unsuccessful, and Mr Field said ""now is the time to move on"". 'Rock star' pandas - not exactly a love story Edinburgh's giant pandas may 'return to China' He added: ""A cub would have generated even more interest in giant pandas and given Tian Tian a wonderful opportunity to be a mother again, after she gave birth in China. ""We are very proud of the contribution we have made to giant panda breeding research alongside our partners at the University of Edinburgh and our findings have been of real benefit to international efforts to protect the species."" The RZSS said plans would now be made to convert the giant panda habitat at the zoo for a new species to arrive once Yang Guang and Tian Tian depart in 2023. The original 10-year deal involved annual donations of $1m (about Â£750,000) to conservation efforts in China. Mr Field said they would continue to make a ""substantial"" annual donation while the pandas remain in Edinburgh. It was later confirmed that would be $500,000 (about Â£375,000). He added: ""We are facing a biodiversity crisis and it is vital that we expand our work to protect more endangered animals around the world,"" he said. """"Many other animals still face the threat of extinction and we are excited about working with a new species at the zoo. ""We will decide on the species over the next year, with a crucial factor being how we can support conservation in the wild.""

LiveLiveTop UK officials grilled about Afghan exit claims3 minutes ago,"The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee was quizzing top civil servants about the UK's handling of the evacuation of Kabul in August The UK airlifted 15,000 people out as the Taliban took over but a whistleblower has described it as a chaotic and dysfunctional operation Raphael Marshall said thousands of emails with pleas for help went unread and animals were helped over people at risk Top Foreign Office civil servant Sir Philip Barton admits he should not have stayed on holiday as the Taliban advanced on the Afghan capital Boris Johnson meanwhile denies claims that he and his wife Carrie intervened to organise the rescue of animals But Labour's Chris Bryant produces a letter from the PM's aide to animal charity boss Pen Farthing about evacuations which he says is evidence of a ""cover-up"" Edited by Brian Wheeler There was plenty to digest as the Foreign Affairs Committee examined what a whistleblower called the chaotic and dysfunctional withdrawal from Kabul this summer. As we close the live page, here is a re-cap of the main things we heard: We've had some reaction from the committee's chair Tom Tugendhat, who says many Afghan allies and partners were ""abandoned"". He said: ""This crisis demanded, and deserved, the full attention of the
Foreign Office. It seems that junior staff members and soldiers bore most of
the burden, having been placed under huge pressure to make life-or-death
decisions with insufficient guidance, support or oversight. âThe evidence weâve heard today points to a lack of
leadership, urgency and adequate resourcing. âIt is deeply painful how badly we have let Afghanistan down. âI would like to reiterate my thanks to Raphael Marshall.
His powerful and compelling evidence has helped bring fundamental failures to
light.â Tom Tugendhat finishes the session by asking the witnesses to pass on ""enormous thanks"" to many of their teams who he says have been ""frankly extraordinarily courageous throughout a difficult period"". Sir Philip says he ""appreciates the sentiment"". Chris Bryant says he hasjust been sent a letter to Pen Farthing,externalfrom Trudy Harrison MP - the parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister -  in which she says: ""Animals under the care of Nowzad can be evacuated on a separate charter flight - the Ministry of Defence will ensure a flight is available."" ""This doesn't equate with what you've told us this afternoon,"" says Bryant. ""I'm not aware of the letter,"" replies Sir Philip adding: ""We've not set out this afternoon to mislead you."" ""It feels like a cover-up,"" the Labour MP says adding ""the prime minster's fingerprints are all over this."" Sir Philip repeats his assertion that he ""wasn't aware of the letter"". There follows a long and slightly awkward silence. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace gave the order Conservative Bob Seely returns to the subject of the animal evacuations. He asks if there was a ministerial instruction to help Pen Farthing's organisation, Nowzad. Nigel Casey, the PM's special representative for Afghanistan,  replies: ""There was clearly a ministerial decision to help in the narrow sense by agreement the UK military would facilitate the landing of the charter which Pen Farthing's organisation had chartered. ""Flight clearance was done at direction of the defence secretary,"" he adds. On August 27,Mr Wallace told BBC Newssupporters of Mr Farthing's animal charity rescue mission had ""taken up too much time of my senior commanders dealing with this issue when they should be focused on dealing with the humanitarian crisis"".  Sir Philip Barton says he does not believe Chris Bryant's characterisation of events is accurate. He says the evacuation was not ideal but it was right to try to get people out. The UK government honoured its commitment to those who were called forward and the Foreign Office is working with the Home Office on the Afghan resettlement scheme, he adds. Labour MP Chris Bryant has just challenged the diplomats' version of events, delivering a withering assessment of the situation as it unfolded over those days after Kabul fell. Here is what the MP said in full: ""What I think really happened is that ministers were desperate to please, they weren't courageous enough to say 'I'm sorry there's a limit to what I can do'. ""There wasn't enough preparation done from last year let alone from April this year to be able to do a proper evacuation of the numbers that we really knew we were likely to have to evacuate. We offered the prospect, the hope, the expectation, indeed, for lots and lots of people, that they might be able to come to the United Kingdom, cruelly in all honesty. ""And then when ministers had hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of emails from lots of MPs, and effectively the Foreign Office collaborated in making sure that ministers could say that 'we've ticked every single box' even though in truth not a single one of these names was ever really properly considered. ""That's what happened really, isn't it? And that's shameful."" ...effectively the Foreign Office collaborated in making sure that ministers could say that 'we've ticked every single box' Chris Bryant, Labour MP Labour's Chris Bryant asks how the government dealt with letters from MPs raising cases of people still in Afghanistan. Sir Philip says the Foreign Office replied to all MPs who had written by 6 September and adds that he is grateful to MPs for raising cases they may have missed. Bryant says he sent a letter on 20 August listing people who might need help - he received a reply on 16 September saying the cases had been passed to the Home Office. He asks if any of the cases were actually considered. Sir Philip says the Home Office is responsible for processing the cases of people who are not British nationals. Philip Barton tells the committee that decisions on who to help under the ""special cases"" scheme were decided based on a criteria drawn up by the then foreign secretary. The criteria included contribution to UK objectives, vulnerability and in very rare cases whether they held sensitive information. Tom Tugendhat asks if the lists of people to help were prepared by junior staff. Nigel Casey replies that individuals were ""sifted according to priority"" then put to panels of more senior officials - all of which included someone with Afghan experience on who should be prioritised. Labour's Chris Bryant asks how many journalists they estimated could be included in the special cases category Sir Philip says they thought there were about 1,200, 500 of whom ended up on flights. Nigel Casey says there were approaches from media groups including the BBC and Sky who wrote to the prime minister seeking help for particular individuals. He says ministers decided the priority had to be British nationals, then those on the resettlement scheme, and then those considered to be special cases. The MPs are back, and Labour's Chris Bryant resumes his questioning on ""special cases"" for evacuation. Reality Check Former Foreign
secretary, Dominic Raab has defended the UK's handling of the evacuation from
Afghanistan after a whistleblower â who worked in the Foreign Office at the
time - said the response had been chaotic. Mr Raab said the
UK evacuated more people than any other nation except the US. From 15 August to
the end of that month, 15,000 people were evacuated by the UK, including 8,000
Afghans and 5,000 British nationals, according to the government. The
whistleblower, Raphael Marshall said he estimated that
between 75,000 and 150,000 people applied for evacuation. The
US evacuated the largest number of people from Afghanistan in August. From 14
August to 28 August, it got 113,500 people out of the country. Other countries
evacuated much smaller numbers over that period, according to official
statements and press releases.  You can read more here. The proceedings have been paused so that the MPs can take part in a Commons vote. Chris Bryant asked if the system had been a mistake Labour's Chris Bryant wonders whether the three separate systems for processing eligible Afghans for evacuation was a ""terrible mistake"" and asks about the ""special cases concept"". Sir Philip says that special cases played a part in filling spare capacity on UK flights and that the then-foreign secretary, the defence secretary and home secretary were involved in choosing who counted as a special case. These ministers decided in the week of 16 August that spare capacity would be used to ensure special cases were evacuated. Nigel Casey - the PM's special representative for Afghanistan - says that an early meeting of the Cobra emergency committee decided that there should be a third way for people to apply to leave Afghanistan for those ineligible under the two other schemes. Intelligence officers, journalists and judges were among those who were considered under the ""special cases"" scheme, Bryant says. Individuals would then be prioritised according to factors decided by the ministers, Casey adds. Tom Tugendhat picks up the questions about who was on holiday and when. He notes that the people who were away in August included: the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the foreign secretary, the national security adviser and the senior civil servants at the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence. He asks Laurie Bristow if he had thought about taking a holiday. Bristow replies that he was in London from 7 -11 August as part of ""a planned rotation"" of staff. This video can not be played Chris Bryant queries Foreign Office staffing as the Taliban took over Afghanistan Foreign Office chief Sir Philip Barton again says he regrets taking a 17-day holiday at the height of the Afghan crisis. He says it was not clear Kabul would fall so soon when he went on leave. He says he went on holiday on 9 August and returned on the 26th - between which time Kabul fell to the Taliban and Britain launched an evacuation effort for UK nationals and eligible Afghans. Labour MP Chris Bryant says Sir Philip's statement on the holiday sounds ""less credible each every time you repeat it... it just feels a bit scripted now"". Sir Philip declines to speak about then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's holiday which occurred around the same time. Sir Philip says it is normal for secretaries of state and permanent secretaries to be away at the same time in holiday periods. Bryant asks when Sir Philip booked the holiday and says that if the booking was made after it became clear there was a crisis in Afghanistan it would amount to a ""dereliction of duty"". Sir Philip says there was ""no inevitability"" that Kabul would fall on 9 August but Bryant says evidence suggests that other organisations had predicted events would move quickly. He repeatedly declines to say where he was on holiday. Labour's Graham Stringer asks the ex-Afghanistan ambassador how many times he spoke to then-Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab ahead of the Taliban taking over. Sir Laurie Bristow replies that he spoke to Raab twice in the first fortnight of August, before the fall of Kabul. Stringer now asks how records of Afghans who'd helped the British forces were left behind in the embassy. ""We regret this very much,"" Philip Barton says. He adds that a team was designated to destroy sensitive information but acknowledges a mistake was made ""under immense pressure"". Bristow says he is ""absolutely mortified"" that it happened. Asked if any of those whose details were in the documents are still at risk, Barton replies: ""As far as I know - no."" Tory MP Alicia Kearns continues to question the diplomats on the impact of the evacuation of rescue animals on the withdrawal of Britons and eligible Afghans. Sir Laurie Bristow describes efforts to drawdown the UK's efforts closer to the airfield after the bomb attack at the airport's Abbey Gate - and says there were considerable time constraints. ""Couldn't UK troops have been processing people not animals?"", Kearns asks. Sir Laurie says the issue was not planes - or capacity on planes - and that the trade-off was not as simple as being between people and animals. The committee has been asking questions about how animals from the Nowzad charity were evacuated from Afghanistan. The organisation - run by Pen Farthing - was an animal shelter in Kabul which cared for dogs, cats and donkeys, some of them belonging to UK servicemen and women. When the Taliban took control of the capital, its supporters launched a vociferous campaign for evacuation, saying staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations and the animals were at risk ""because the Taliban considers companion animals, particularly dogs, unclean"". Mr Farthing and 150 animals were able to leave the country. His staff were left behind, but later made it safely to Pakistan. Tom Tugendhat asks how much staff time the Nowzad evacuation took up. ""I don't know,"" replies Philip Barton. Nigel Casey says ""permission for the charter had to be sought and supported by the Ministry of Defence but it didn't detract from our operation"". Tugendhat asks if a flight could be arranged for Nowzad, why couldn't it be arranged for the five-year-old son of an Afghan interpreter - who Tugendhat had been trying to help. ""We operated on the basis of advice coming from the military... we followed their instructions and took people out on the timetable they gave us,"" replies Casey. ""I don't think it would have been possible to evacuate anyone else,"" he says adding that negotiations with the Taliban to extend the deadline for evacuations had been unsuccessful.""

"Whistleblower describes 'chaos' of UK Afghan exitThousands of pleas for help went unread and the foreign secretary lacked urgency, an ex-official says.","The UK Foreign Office's handling of the Afghan evacuation after the Taliban seized Kabul was dysfunctional and chaotic, a whistleblower has said. Raphael Marshall said the process of choosing who could get a flight out was arbitrary and thousands of emails with pleas for help went unread. The then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions, he added. Mr Raab told the BBC lessons would be learned but the UK did a good job compared to other countries. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, the UKairlifted 15,000 people out of the country, including 5,000 British nationals, 8,000 Afghans and 2,000 children. Inwritten evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee,external, Mr Marshall said up to 150,000 Afghans who were at risk because of their links to Britain applied to be evacuated - but fewer than 5% received any assistance. ""It is clear that some of those left behind have since been murdered by the Taliban,"" he added. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office's top civil servant was repeatedly questioned by MPs about his decision to continue his holiday for 11 days after Kabul fell to the Taliban. Sir Philip Barton said he had ""reflected a lot"" on his decision, adding: ""If I had my time again I would have come back from my leave earlier than I did."" He insisted cover arrangements were in place and he had ""stayed in touch with the department all the way through the period"". But committee chairman Tom Tugendhat said he found Sir Philip's decision ""strange"" given Mr Raab had returned. PM intervened to evacuate animal charity - whistleblower How many people did the UK get out of Afghanistan? 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Ten days that shook Afghanistan Mr Raab said the two-week evacuation was ""the biggest operation in living memory"" of its kind and the UK had helped a larger number of people than any nation except the US. The former foreign secretary, who is now justice secretary, said the criticism of his decision-making was from a ""relatively junior desk officer"" but the main challenges were in verifying the identities of applicants on the ground and safely escorting them to the airport in Kabul, not in making decisions from Whitehall. This video can not be played Dominic Raab, who was replaced as foreign secretary, defends his role in the Afghanistan evacuation Other criticisms were ""rather dislocated from the operational pressures and conditions"", he said. ""I don't doubt there were challenges, I don't doubt there will be lessons to be learned but if you look at the facts, I think we did a good job by recent standards of evacuations and by international comparisons,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Mr Marshall, who was a senior desk officer at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) until he resigned in September, said there was inadequate staffing at the department's crisis centre, and staff would not normally be expected to work at weekends or overnight. Raphael Marshall, 25, was a senior desk officer at the Foreign Office and said thousands of pleas for help went unread There was also a lack of expertise and a lack of co-ordination between the department and the Ministry of Defence, he added. Mr Marshall also said Mr Raab took hours to answer emails and ""did not fully understand the situation"". And he said an instruction from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to evacuate dogs looked after by an animal charity went against Foreign Office criteria and meant people at risk of being murdered were left behind. Mr Johnson said the allegation that he intervened on this issue was ""complete nonsense"" and that the rescue operation was ""one of the outstanding military achievements of the last 50 years or more"", under ""pretty harrowing circumstances"". The key issues flagged by Foreign Office whistleblower Raphael Marshall include: Only 5% of the 150,000 people who requested help received any Nobody in the team dealing with requests had studied, had any detailed knowledge of Afghanistan, or had ever worked there No one spoke any Afghan languages, with calls to people asking for help conducted in English Decisions about who to rescue were arbitrary, and thousands of emails pleading for assistance were not even read The IT system was dysfunctional, with eight soldiers drafted in to help left sharing one computer Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions on difficult cases and did not fully understand the situation Animals from the Nowzad charity run by a former Marine were not in danger and evacuating them was at the direct expense of people at risk of death As the Taliban approached Kabul in August, there was one government scheme to evacuate those Afghans who had worked directly for the British government, and another to identify and help those who were at risk because of their broader links to the UK. Mr Marshall worked for the team of officials handling a group known as Afghan Special Cases. These included Afghan soldiers, politicians, journalists, civil servants, activists, aid workers, judges - and guards who had worked indirectly for the UK government via subcontractors. In the desperate days at the end of August as the Taliban advanced on Kabul, many of these people were emailing the FCDO to get permission for a flight out of the country. Mr Marshall said there were ""usually 5,000 unread emails in the inbox at any given moment"" and ""in thousands of cases emails were not even read"", including cases from MPs. He said the process of prioritising the applicants was ""arbitrary and dysfunctional"". The criteria used by the government were unhelpful and ambiguous, leading to confusion, he added. The decision to transport dogs from Pen Farthing's Nowzad shelter used up considerable capacity, so there was less space at the airport and fewer soldiers available to escort evacuees, Mr Marshall said. He said the UK government ended up transporting animals ""which were not at risk of harm at the direct expense of evacuating British nationals and people at risk of imminent murder, including interpreters who had served with the British Army"". Staff in the crisis centre who previously worked for the Department for International Development could not access FCDO computers because ""the DFID and FCO IT systems are not yet integrated. They were visibly appalled by our chaotic system"". Mr Marshall described how soldiers were brought in to help but many had not used the computer systems before and so mistakes were made. The computers had to be shared because FCDO IT had not issued passwords to unlock them. At one point eight soldiers shared one computer. During the evacuation there were chaotic scenes outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul Telephone calls to Afghans were made only in English, Mr Marshall said. There was no one who spoke Dari or Pashto. Mr Marshall said: ""I believe no member of the Afghan Special Cases team had studied Afghanistan, worked on Afghanistan previously, or had a detailed knowledge of Afghanistan. He added: ""One was clearly scared of being asked to make hundreds of life and death decisions about which they knew nothing."" He said: ""Most people in the FCDO crisis centre had a poor understanding of the actual situation at Kabul airport and the consequent urgency of calling people up as soon as possible."" This video can not be played Brigadier James Martin speaks about the UK's evacuation operation from Afghanistan Mr Marshall's report states the FCDO crisis centre sent notes up to Mr Raab's office to get decisions on difficult cases. But ""it took several hours for the foreign secretary to engage on any of these notes"" and when he did ""he could not decide on individual cases"" without seeing all the cases ""in a well-presented table"". Mr Marshall concluded: ""For the foreign secretary to make this request suggests he did not fully understand the situation."" He said, on another occasion, ""the foreign secretary declined to make a decision on whether to admit these people without a properly formatted submission with a table setting out multiple cases"". A source close to Mr Raab said: ""We evacuated over 500 special cases, including journalists, women's rights activists and extremely vulnerable individuals. ""The major practical challenge to evacuation was verifying identity and securing safe passage to the airport, not the speed of decision making. At all times, the team's focus was on saving lives."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy accused Mr Raab of ""complacency and indifference"" regarding the Afghan crisis, and said he ""should consider his position"". He said four months on, the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme - intended to help people who assisted the UK or who are at risk from the Taliban - is still not operational. People such as judges are ""in hiding, running for their lives"" as a result, Mr Lammy said. Chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said: ""The real question that needs answering is, where was everybody?"" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Marshall's evidence depicts a 25-year-old, at times completely on his own, dealing with a huge volume of requests for help, ""in a Foreign Office that was effectively a Mary Celeste at a time of national emergency"". Asked if it showed that the Foreign Office's work-from-home arrangements had failed, Mr Tugendhat said ""all hands needed to be on deck"" and ""whatever the working arrangements, they weren't working"". How the Taliban takeover changed my life Hours without food or water in Kabul airport 'hell' A UK government spokesperson said more than 1,000 FCDO staff worked tirelessly in challenging circumstances, and decisions on prioritisation had to be made quickly to help as many people as possible. It said the government was still working to help others leave and since the end of the operation had helped more than 3,000 people leave Afghanistan. ""Regrettably we were not able to evacuate all those we wanted to, but our commitment to them is enduring,"" they added.

LiveLiveOmicron appears more transmissible - No 101 minute ago,"Early indications suggest the Omicron variant of coronavirus is ""more transmissible"" than Delta, Downing Street says But much remains unknown and the government is not looking at introducing its Plan B level of restrictions, a spokesman tells reporters Scientists are yet to draw firm conclusions but are continuing to analyse samples of the virus and real-world data People travelling to the UK must now take a Covid test before their journey as well as a PCR test upon their return There are 437 confirmed cases of the highly-mutated Omicron variant in the UK Experts believe it could overtake Delta to become the dominant variant That's about it from our live page coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a reminder of the major headlines from today:  Today's coverage has been written by Doug Faulkner, James Harness, Yaroslav Lukov and Rebecca Morton and edited by Emma Harrison and Holly Wallis. Thanks for joining us. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Officially there have been just over 400 Omicron infections. But
thatâs just the tip of the iceberg. It is based on positive tests sent to labs to check for
variants, which only happens in a minority of cases. Because of a quirk in the way Omicron shows on PCR tests it is
possible to identify suspected cases too. Using this data, researchers at the University of East Anglia
believe there could have been five to six times as many Omicron cases as the
official total shows. This data is what is behind suggestions the number of cases is
doubling every three days or so and the conclusion that it is more
transmissible than Delta. What is not clear is why. To what extent is it down to Omicronâs
ability to get past immunity, greater infectiousness or because it has a
shorter incubation period? The answer to that could have a big bearing on how quickly and
how far infection levels will climb. Another unknown is what that will mean for serious illness. You
would expect reinfections or infections post-vaccination to be milder. If that is the case, the proportion of cases ending up in
hospital will drop. But even if it halves, if infection rates more than double,
pressure on the NHS will still increase. The threat of hospitals being overwhelmed is now back on the
table. The number of new Covid cases reported across the UK this week is the highest weekly figure since January. A total of 336,893 new cases have been
reported in the past seven days, including 45,691 on Tuesday. This is the highest number for a
seven-day period since the week to 16 January, when 339,956 were reported. Weekly cases during the second wave of the virus peaked at
417,620, for the seven days to 9 January. This video can not be played Gatwick passengers on new covid restrictions We asked passengers travelling through Gatwick Airport for their views on changes to Covid restrictions. Most are concerned about the cost and stress it adds to travelling, although some think there are benefits to the extra virus screening. Lauren Rochat-Greene, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is among those quarantining in a hotel at Gatwick, after flying back to the UK from Cape Town, via Geneva. She says she has already paid nearly Â£4,000 in Covid tests, flights and hotel quarantine costs to get back from South Africa, but also has a Â£10,000 fine hanging over her head. Having flown out to visit family when South Africa was on the green list, she says she had to stay an extra week in Cape Town before flying to Geneva in order to get home. ""As I got into Geneva they pulled me aside and said they're not accepting anyone from red list countries. They said the rules had changed in the last 24-48 hours. They wanted to send me back on a flight to South Africa but I'm a British citizen,"" she says. As her PCR test was expiring she says she was told to get on a flight or go back to South Africa, and was taken to get another test before being escorted to the plane, without being able to book a space in a quarantine hotel. She says when she arrived in Luton she was told she should not have come and was given a notice of intent to serve a fixed penalty notice. After a five-hour wait at Luton she says a quarantine hotel room was found for her at Gatwick. ""I had to pay immediately more than Â£2,000. All in all it's cost me almost Â£4,000 extra. And I have the possibility of a fixed penalty notice of Â£10,000 hanging over my head."" Holidaymakers returning from South Africa are considering court actionafter long-awaited trips ended in quarantine. Couples have told the BBC they have spent thousands of pounds in hotel fees despite following all the Covid rules before travelling. More than 40,000 peoplehave signed a petition against the overnight move,externalto add countries, including South Africa, to the red list in response to the discovery of the Omicron variant. A judicial review on making people pay for mandatory hotel quarantining is being sought at the High Court on Thursday. Kate and Alex Freed from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had already been forced to postpone their wedding four times by lockdowns before finally tying the knot and jetting off to Cape Town at the start of November. They describe the increase of hotel prices as ""disgusting"" and are angry the UK brought in its travel ban overnight without the previous grace periods. A spokesman for the Department for Health and Social Care says: ""The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme."" Earlier we heard from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who extended Scotland's work-from-home guidance until mid-January - but Downing Street says that is ""not our position"". The prime minister's official spokesman says ""we are obviously looking at incoming data on the Omicron variant"" but ""our position remains as set out, with the limited number of restrictions we have introduced so far"". See you in Paris soon? Many countries are re-introducing restrictions in response to thenew Omicron variant. There are regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These are often changing quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. We've analysed - country-by-country - key things a traveller from the UK needs to know about going to each of seven popular destinations, including Ireland, Spain, France, Italy and the US.

authorities say workers, including some in the medical profession, are using or
supplying fake Covid vaccination certificates to get round new regulations. A senior health
official said there was a market for forged documentation and that some health
workers were involved. People are known to
be buying bogus certificates from medical workers for as little as $12. It comes after
authorities banned members of the public from entering government offices
without proof of at least one vaccine from 1 December. Since mid-November
authorities have required proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test for
government employees to enter their offices. Employees who have not been
immunised are required to pay for the PCR test twice a week at a cost of at
least $40 each time. Egypt has set a target of vaccinating 40% of the
population of 102 million by the end of this year but millions are still
reluctant or unwilling to get the jab. Two people were killed and four injured, including a 10-year-old child, when a gunman opened fire inside a public services office in Moscow on Tuesday, Russian officials say. The suspect - who was later detained - reportedly started shooting after being told to put a face mask on. A source told Russia's Interfax news agency that the man opened fire when a guard tried to escort him out of the building in the south-east of the capital. A criminal investigation into the shooting has been launched. If convicted, the 45-year-old suspect could be jailed for life. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media have reported new cases of Covid-19 in multiple cities in the eastern province of Zhejiang. There are confirmed cases
of the virus in the cities of Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo. It is reporting two cases of the virus in Hangzhou, and a new case recorded in Shaoxing. On Monday it was reported that the city of Ningbo had confirmed three cases of the virus. Officials said a further five people have tested positive in the city, sparking fears of a wider outbreak. It is routine for large-scale testing drives to be ordered whenever fresh cases are identified. Ningboâs Zhenhai District has issued a level 1 emergency response and gone into lockdown. All schools have been closed, and flights have been cancelled from Ningbo into the capital city, Beijing. China has maintained a low number of cases due to its zero-Covid strategy - communities are locked down the moment fresh cases of the virus are identified. On Monday, Nigeria became the eleventh African country to be added to the UK's travel red list. It means only UK and Irish citizens, and UK residents, can arrive from there - and they must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Oche Ameh, a British citizen, is an engineer in Lagos, Nigeria, and had booked to travel back to the UK to spend Christmas with his family in Nottingham. However, the new restrictions mean he would have to quarantine over Christmas and New Year and also spend Â£2,285 on a hotel. ""It costs too much. I'm incredibly upset,"" he says. ""My kids are expecting to see their dad for Christmas. It's heart-breaking. As soon as the [travel] ban is lifted, I'll come home."" Julie, pictured with her partner Simon, had hoped to visit her family for Christmas We've been hearing from more people affected by the change to the UK's travel rules. Julie, 39, who lives in Sheffield, had been hoping to visit her family in France this Christmas for the first time in more than two years. However, she says the cost of tests, as well as worries about giving Covid to her vulnerable parents or grandparents, mean ""unfortunately, it looks like it's not going to happen"". When she looked at test prices online she found the actual prices on company websites were much higher than those advertised on the government site. ""The situation changed very quickly, and new rules arrived with such a short notice. The ferry also contacted us twice to change the times of the journey, making us feel like they keep cancelling more trips,"" she tells the BBC. ""It all feels very unstable and last thing we want is be stuck in France and not be able to come back home."" ""I feel sad to have to postpone my holidays and worried this is going to break my family's heart,"" she adds. A further 45,691 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, according to the latest figures. That's up from 39,716 cases on Tuesday last week. There were also a further 180 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. On Monday 329,165 booster jabs or third doses were given, taking the total to more than 20.9 million. A family have described how they were forced to book separate quarantine hotel rooms 100 miles apart because there were no bigger rooms available. Jennie Bianco, 42, from Sheffield, was in South Africa for work before she was joined by her husband and six-year-old son for a five-day holiday. But the day after they arrived the country was put on the travel red list, meaning they would have to quarantine for 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK. Jennie had already spent Â£200 to change their flights and Â£600 to book extra accommodation after she was told there wouldn't be family rooms available for another four days. However, despite several calls to the customer service line they were unable to secure a family room due to a lack of availability. It meant she had to pay Â£2,285 for the single room plus Â£2,610 for the room for her husband and son, rather than getting a discounted family room - and Jennie had to get help from her dad to afford the cost. There was also no option to request rooms in the same hotel. Her husband and son were placed in Milton Keynes, while she was in Gatwick. Jennie is also worried about the impact of being separated from her son, who is adopted. ""Especially after being together for so long
during Covid and the separation anxiety that comes with that. But for him, itâs
a particularly difficult situation,"" she tells the BBC. A government spokesperson said: ""The majority of passengers who have used the managed quarantine service have been satisfied with the service and we aim to keep families together.â As Omicron spreads across the globe, many people face an anxious wait to see if they will be able to travel for Christmas. Lucy, from London, lives in Kenya and is hoping to travel back to the UK to see her family on Monday. Kenya is not on the red list but she's worried that could change. She's also concerned about getting her test result in the required time. She tells the BBC some testing centres in Kenya are facing a ""substantial increase"" in the number of tests they are dealing with, so ""they're worried about being able to meet those needs"". ""I haven't seen my sister in two years. I saw my parents last year but couldn't get back last Christmas because of restrictions, especially in London, with the costs and everything it wasn't worth it,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends are also coming back who have lived abroad, a lot of them got married and had babies and I feel like I've really missed out over the past two years."" Instead of being congratulated for being one of the first countries in the world to identify the Omicron variant, Botswana has been penalised for it, the countryâs President Mokgweetsi Masisi has said.Masisi told BBC World Newsâs Lucy Hockings that the travel ban had left the southern African nation's economy throttled. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the booster jab campaign needs to go faster. ""A number of weeks ago we said we should move to at least 500,000 a day. As I understand it the figures this week are lower than last week,"" he says. The opposition leader says we ""are in a race now between this booster regime and the new variant"" and the government should have acted weeks ago, adding that the programme needs to be ramped up immediately. On Sunday 290,165 booster jabs were given, taking the total number of people who have received a booster or third dose to 20,580,644. That's 35.8% of the population over 12 in the UK. Here's how to get a booster jab. There is already ""immense pressure"" on hospitals even before the impact of the new Omicron variant is fully felt, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine says. Dr Nick Scriven tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme his hospital in Yorkshire is ""as busy as I can remember it"". ""Itâs not just Covid, the Covid wards area is actually beginning
to empty a little bit at the moment,"" he says. However, he adds that Covid patients tend to be in hospital a lot longer than people with other illnesses. If hospital admissions start to increase as the Omicron variant spreads, he says wards will be more crowded and nurses ""will be run off their feet"". Care may not be so ""dignified"" and there may be delays to less urgent treatment, he adds. People are being asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households Sturgeon says it is vital to ""strengthen compliance"" with existing measures to slow the spread of Omicron. People are already advised to work from home where practical, but she says employers are now being asked to ensure this is happening. If staff were working from home at the start of the pandemic, they should be asked to do so again, she adds. This advice will be in place until the middle of January, when it will be reviewed. People are also asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households. However, the first minister says she ""cannot guarantee"" further measures will not be needed. It is important to remain open to any proportionate measures, such as the extension of Covid certification, she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

Could council tax in Wales be about to change?,"This video can not be played A stallholder said a rise in council tax would be 'disappointing' Households in Wales could change their council tax bands as part of a proposed Welsh government shake up. Ministers are considering the first revaluation of residential properties since 2003. A consultation will take place next year. At the last revaluationa third of households,externalsaw their bills rise. Ministers say they want to make the tax fairer, but the Conservatives said the Welsh government should protect families from higher bills. The Welsh government said the revaluation does not necessarily mean tax bills will rise. The move ispart of the Welsh Labour government's deal with Plaid Cymru, which wassigned last week. Council tax to double for second home owners How much are council tax bills going up? Council tax could change under a Labour-Plaid deal The amount of council tax you pay depends on the value of your home, however the last time Welsh homes were valued was 18 years ago. Homes are graded into a bands from A to I, homes in band A - valued at less than Â£44,000 - pay the least council tax, and homes in band I - valued at more than Â£424,000 - pay the most. There are more homes in band C in Wales (valued from Â£65,001 - Â£91,000) than any other band, with residents on average paying Â£1,538 a year in council tax. Critics say council tax is out of date because it's based on old property values, and does not fairly tax people on lower incomes. A think tank has called for a revaluation but says reform could go further to fix the system - the consultation holds open the option of more fundamental changes beyond the current Senedd term, which ends in 2026. Council tax is used to partly fund local government run services, with the Welsh government also providing cash. The revaluation exercise, officials say, could include new bands added to the top or bottom ends of the scale to better reflect household wealth and people's ability to pay. How much council tax you pay is determined by the band your house is in Ministers want future revaluations to happen more frequently, and officials say increased house prices will not necessarily result in individuals paying more council tax. It is one of a number of measures ministers are looking at - including a review of Wales' council tax benefit system, and a review of discounts, exemptions and premiums. When the last revaluation took place, one in every three households in Wales saw their homes go up a council tax band - the classification that determines how much council tax a household pays - while 8% went down a band. There has been no revaluation since, although it remains the most recent such exercise in Great Britain, with Scotland and England still using house values from 1991. Properties in the same band pay different amounts depending on the local authority A Welsh government-commissionedstudy,externalby the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) called council tax ""out of date, regressive and distortionary"", with properties in ""increasingly arbitrary tax bands that may bear little relation to current reality"". It called for the tax to be both revalued and reformed, saying revaluation alone would have ""little effect on the average tax bills of different household types"", instead calling for a system where residents pay a tax pegged to the estimated value of a property, rather than a band. The study said that could see 21% of households in the bottom fifth of incomes see their tax bill fall by Â£200 a year, while 3% would see it increase by more than Â£200. David Phillips, of the IFS, said the revaluation was ""good news"" and it was welcome that there was more wide ranging reform planned in the long run. ""People may worry the big increases in property prices over the last two decades mean revaluation would lead to a big rise in average council tax bills,"" he said. ""But it wouldn't."" ""Average bills across Wales could easily be capped, like when business properties are revalued."" Mark Drakeford and Adam Price signed their co-operation deal last week In an interview withBBC Politics Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he was attracted to land value taxation ""as a fairer and better way of dealing with the way in which we pay for local services"". Such a system would see people pay council tax according to the value of the land they own, rather than the property built on it. He said it could take a decade to move to such a system, but added Plaid and Labour ministers had ""jointly committed to not allowing the unfairness of the current system to continue"". Rebecca Evans, Minister for Finance and Local Government, said: ""We want to modernise the council tax system and make it fairer. We want to make council tax more progressive in its design and delivery."" Sian Gwenllian, Plaid Cymru's lead designated member working with the Welsh government, added: ""We have long argued that the current system disproportionately impacts poorer areas and change is long overdue. ""We look forward to developing a fairer and more progressive system as we put our co-operation agreement with the Welsh government into action."" But the Welsh Conservatives' local government spokesman Sam Rowlands said: ""The last time a revaluation took place in Wales one in three families were hammered by higher bills - and as we recover from the challenges of the pandemic that simply can't happen again. ""Labour and their coalition buddies in Plaid should use some of the extra billions in funding from the UK government to properly fund local authorities and ensure families are not unjustifiably hit by higher council tax bills in the years to come."" However his party colleague, Monmouth MS Peter Fox, told the Senedd that the current system is ""not a particularly good tax"" and there was ""scope"" for a fairer system, citing the scale ofcouncil tax debt. ""I think we have to take a very cautious approach when we reform council tax in Wales that we don't actually disadvantage a whole swathe of people,"" he said. Welsh Local Government Association finance spokesman Anthony Hunt said: ""The announcement by the Welsh government today is welcomed and we support these initial steps being made to reform council tax and make it fairer. ""Council tax forms a large proportion of funding for local services, and funds large services like education and social care right down to smaller, but vital, services like environmental health and trading standards.""

Whistleblower describes 'chaos' of UK Afghan exit,"The UK Foreign Office's handling of the Afghan evacuation after the Taliban seized Kabul was dysfunctional and chaotic, a whistleblower has said. Raphael Marshall said the process of choosing who could get a flight out was arbitrary and thousands of emails with pleas for help went unread. The then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions, he added. Mr Raab told the BBC lessons would be learned but the UK did a good job compared to other countries. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, the UKairlifted 15,000 people out of the country, including 5,000 British nationals, 8,000 Afghans and 2,000 children. Inwritten evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee,external, Mr Marshall said up to 150,000 Afghans who were at risk because of their links to Britain applied to be evacuated - but fewer than 5% received any assistance. ""It is clear that some of those left behind have since been murdered by the Taliban,"" he added. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office's top civil servant was repeatedly questioned by MPs about his decision to continue his holiday for 11 days after Kabul fell to the Taliban. Sir Philip Barton said he had ""reflected a lot"" on his decision, adding: ""If I had my time again I would have come back from my leave earlier than I did."" He insisted cover arrangements were in place and he had ""stayed in touch with the department all the way through the period"". But committee chairman Tom Tugendhat said he found Sir Philip's decision ""strange"" given Mr Raab had returned. PM intervened to evacuate animal charity - whistleblower How many people did the UK get out of Afghanistan? 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Ten days that shook Afghanistan Mr Raab said the two-week evacuation was ""the biggest operation in living memory"" of its kind and the UK had helped a larger number of people than any nation except the US. The former foreign secretary, who is now justice secretary, said the criticism of his decision-making was from a ""relatively junior desk officer"" but the main challenges were in verifying the identities of applicants on the ground and safely escorting them to the airport in Kabul, not in making decisions from Whitehall. This video can not be played Dominic Raab, who was replaced as foreign secretary, defends his role in the Afghanistan evacuation Other criticisms were ""rather dislocated from the operational pressures and conditions"", he said. ""I don't doubt there were challenges, I don't doubt there will be lessons to be learned but if you look at the facts, I think we did a good job by recent standards of evacuations and by international comparisons,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Mr Marshall, who was a senior desk officer at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) until he resigned in September, said there was inadequate staffing at the department's crisis centre, and staff would not normally be expected to work at weekends or overnight. Raphael Marshall, 25, was a senior desk officer at the Foreign Office and said thousands of pleas for help went unread There was also a lack of expertise and a lack of co-ordination between the department and the Ministry of Defence, he added. Mr Marshall also said Mr Raab took hours to answer emails and ""did not fully understand the situation"". And he said an instruction from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to evacuate dogs looked after by an animal charity went against Foreign Office criteria and meant people at risk of being murdered were left behind. Mr Johnson said the allegation that he intervened on this issue was ""complete nonsense"" and that the rescue operation was ""one of the outstanding military achievements of the last 50 years or more"", under ""pretty harrowing circumstances"". The key issues flagged by Foreign Office whistleblower Raphael Marshall include: Only 5% of the 150,000 people who requested help received any Nobody in the team dealing with requests had studied, had any detailed knowledge of Afghanistan, or had ever worked there No one spoke any Afghan languages, with calls to people asking for help conducted in English Decisions about who to rescue were arbitrary, and thousands of emails pleading for assistance were not even read The IT system was dysfunctional, with eight soldiers drafted in to help left sharing one computer Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions on difficult cases and did not fully understand the situation Animals from the Nowzad charity run by a former Marine were not in danger and evacuating them was at the direct expense of people at risk of death As the Taliban approached Kabul in August, there was one government scheme to evacuate those Afghans who had worked directly for the British government, and another to identify and help those who were at risk because of their broader links to the UK. Mr Marshall worked for the team of officials handling a group known as Afghan Special Cases. These included Afghan soldiers, politicians, journalists, civil servants, activists, aid workers, judges - and guards who had worked indirectly for the UK government via subcontractors. In the desperate days at the end of August as the Taliban advanced on Kabul, many of these people were emailing the FCDO to get permission for a flight out of the country. Mr Marshall said there were ""usually 5,000 unread emails in the inbox at any given moment"" and ""in thousands of cases emails were not even read"", including cases from MPs. He said the process of prioritising the applicants was ""arbitrary and dysfunctional"". The criteria used by the government were unhelpful and ambiguous, leading to confusion, he added. The decision to transport dogs from Pen Farthing's Nowzad shelter used up considerable capacity, so there was less space at the airport and fewer soldiers available to escort evacuees, Mr Marshall said. He said the UK government ended up transporting animals ""which were not at risk of harm at the direct expense of evacuating British nationals and people at risk of imminent murder, including interpreters who had served with the British Army"". Staff in the crisis centre who previously worked for the Department for International Development could not access FCDO computers because ""the DFID and FCO IT systems are not yet integrated. They were visibly appalled by our chaotic system"". Mr Marshall described how soldiers were brought in to help but many had not used the computer systems before and so mistakes were made. The computers had to be shared because FCDO IT had not issued passwords to unlock them. At one point eight soldiers shared one computer. During the evacuation there were chaotic scenes outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul Telephone calls to Afghans were made only in English, Mr Marshall said. There was no one who spoke Dari or Pashto. Mr Marshall said: ""I believe no member of the Afghan Special Cases team had studied Afghanistan, worked on Afghanistan previously, or had a detailed knowledge of Afghanistan. He added: ""One was clearly scared of being asked to make hundreds of life and death decisions about which they knew nothing."" He said: ""Most people in the FCDO crisis centre had a poor understanding of the actual situation at Kabul airport and the consequent urgency of calling people up as soon as possible."" This video can not be played Brigadier James Martin speaks about the UK's evacuation operation from Afghanistan Mr Marshall's report states the FCDO crisis centre sent notes up to Mr Raab's office to get decisions on difficult cases. But ""it took several hours for the foreign secretary to engage on any of these notes"" and when he did ""he could not decide on individual cases"" without seeing all the cases ""in a well-presented table"". Mr Marshall concluded: ""For the foreign secretary to make this request suggests he did not fully understand the situation."" He said, on another occasion, ""the foreign secretary declined to make a decision on whether to admit these people without a properly formatted submission with a table setting out multiple cases"". A source close to Mr Raab said: ""We evacuated over 500 special cases, including journalists, women's rights activists and extremely vulnerable individuals. ""The major practical challenge to evacuation was verifying identity and securing safe passage to the airport, not the speed of decision making. At all times, the team's focus was on saving lives."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy accused Mr Raab of ""complacency and indifference"" regarding the Afghan crisis, and said he ""should consider his position"". He said four months on, the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme - intended to help people who assisted the UK or who are at risk from the Taliban - is still not operational. People such as judges are ""in hiding, running for their lives"" as a result, Mr Lammy said. Chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said: ""The real question that needs answering is, where was everybody?"" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Marshall's evidence depicts a 25-year-old, at times completely on his own, dealing with a huge volume of requests for help, ""in a Foreign Office that was effectively a Mary Celeste at a time of national emergency"". Asked if it showed that the Foreign Office's work-from-home arrangements had failed, Mr Tugendhat said ""all hands needed to be on deck"" and ""whatever the working arrangements, they weren't working"". How the Taliban takeover changed my life Hours without food or water in Kabul airport 'hell' A UK government spokesperson said more than 1,000 FCDO staff worked tirelessly in challenging circumstances, and decisions on prioritisation had to be made quickly to help as many people as possible. It said the government was still working to help others leave and since the end of the operation had helped more than 3,000 people leave Afghanistan. ""Regrettably we were not able to evacuate all those we wanted to, but our commitment to them is enduring,"" they added.

LiveLiveOmicron appears to be more transmissible - No 103 minutes ago,"Early indications suggest the Omicron variant of coronavirus is ""more transmissible"" than Delta, Downing Street says But much remains unknown and the government is not looking at introducing its Plan B level of restrictions, a spokesman tells reporters Scientists are yet to draw firm conclusions but are continuing to analyse samples of the virus and real-world data People travelling to the UK must now take a Covid test before their journey as well as a PCR test upon their return There are 437 confirmed cases of the highly-mutated Omicron variant in the UK Experts believe it could overtake Delta to become the dominant variant That's about it from our live page coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a reminder of the major headlines from today:  Today's coverage has been written by Doug Faulkner, James Harness, Yaroslav Lukov and Rebecca Morton and edited by Emma Harrison and Holly Wallis. Thanks for joining us. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Officially there have been just over 400 Omicron infections. But
thatâs just the tip of the iceberg. It is based on positive tests sent to labs to check for
variants, which only happens in a minority of cases. Because of a quirk in the way Omicron shows on PCR tests it is
possible to identify suspected cases too. Using this data, researchers at the University of East Anglia
believe there could have been five to six times as many Omicron cases as the
official total shows. This data is what is behind suggestions the number of cases is
doubling every three days or so and the conclusion that it is more
transmissible than Delta. What is not clear is why. To what extent is it down to Omicronâs
ability to get past immunity, greater infectiousness or because it has a
shorter incubation period? The answer to that could have a big bearing on how quickly and
how far infection levels will climb. Another unknown is what that will mean for serious illness. You
would expect reinfections or infections post-vaccination to be milder. If that is the case, the proportion of cases ending up in
hospital will drop. But even if it halves, if infection rates more than double,
pressure on the NHS will still increase. The threat of hospitals being overwhelmed is now back on the
table. The number of new Covid cases reported across the UK this week is the highest weekly figure since January. A total of 336,893 new cases have been
reported in the past seven days, including 45,691 on Tuesday. This is the highest number for a
seven-day period since the week to 16 January, when 339,956 were reported. Weekly cases during the second wave of the virus peaked at
417,620, for the seven days to 9 January. This video can not be played Gatwick passengers on new covid restrictions We asked passengers travelling through Gatwick Airport for their views on changes to Covid restrictions. Most are concerned about the cost and stress it adds to travelling, although some think there are benefits to the extra virus screening. Lauren Rochat-Greene, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is among those quarantining in a hotel at Gatwick, after flying back to the UK from Cape Town, via Geneva. She says she has already paid nearly Â£4,000 in Covid tests, flights and hotel quarantine costs to get back from South Africa, but also has a Â£10,000 fine hanging over her head. Having flown out to visit family when South Africa was on the green list, she says she had to stay an extra week in Cape Town before flying to Geneva in order to get home. ""As I got into Geneva they pulled me aside and said they're not accepting anyone from red list countries. They said the rules had changed in the last 24-48 hours. They wanted to send me back on a flight to South Africa but I'm a British citizen,"" she says. As her PCR test was expiring she says she was told to get on a flight or go back to South Africa, and was taken to get another test before being escorted to the plane, without being able to book a space in a quarantine hotel. She says when she arrived in Luton she was told she should not have come and was given a notice of intent to serve a fixed penalty notice. After a five-hour wait at Luton she says a quarantine hotel room was found for her at Gatwick. ""I had to pay immediately more than Â£2,000. All in all it's cost me almost Â£4,000 extra. And I have the possibility of a fixed penalty notice of Â£10,000 hanging over my head."" Holidaymakers returning from South Africa are considering court actionafter long-awaited trips ended in quarantine. Couples have told the BBC they have spent thousands of pounds in hotel fees despite following all the Covid rules before travelling. More than 40,000 peoplehave signed a petition against the overnight move,externalto add countries, including South Africa, to the red list in response to the discovery of the Omicron variant. A judicial review on making people pay for mandatory hotel quarantining is being sought at the High Court on Thursday. Kate and Alex Freed from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had already been forced to postpone their wedding four times by lockdowns before finally tying the knot and jetting off to Cape Town at the start of November. They describe the increase of hotel prices as ""disgusting"" and are angry the UK brought in its travel ban overnight without the previous grace periods. A spokesman for the Department for Health and Social Care says: ""The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme."" Earlier we heard from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who extended Scotland's work-from-home guidance until mid-January - but Downing Street says that is ""not our position"". The prime minister's official spokesman says ""we are obviously looking at incoming data on the Omicron variant"" but ""our position remains as set out, with the limited number of restrictions we have introduced so far"". See you in Paris soon? Many countries are re-introducing restrictions in response to thenew Omicron variant. There are regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These are often changing quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. We've analysed - country-by-country - key things a traveller from the UK needs to know about going to each of seven popular destinations, including Ireland, Spain, France, Italy and the US.

authorities say workers, including some in the medical profession, are using or
supplying fake Covid vaccination certificates to get round new regulations. A senior health
official said there was a market for forged documentation and that some health
workers were involved. People are known to
be buying bogus certificates from medical workers for as little as $12. It comes after
authorities banned members of the public from entering government offices
without proof of at least one vaccine from 1 December. Since mid-November
authorities have required proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test for
government employees to enter their offices. Employees who have not been
immunised are required to pay for the PCR test twice a week at a cost of at
least $40 each time. Egypt has set a target of vaccinating 40% of the
population of 102 million by the end of this year but millions are still
reluctant or unwilling to get the jab. Two people were killed and four injured, including a 10-year-old child, when a gunman opened fire inside a public services office in Moscow on Tuesday, Russian officials say. The suspect - who was later detained - reportedly started shooting after being told to put a face mask on. A source told Russia's Interfax news agency that the man opened fire when a guard tried to escort him out of the building in the south-east of the capital. A criminal investigation into the shooting has been launched. If convicted, the 45-year-old suspect could be jailed for life. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media have reported new cases of Covid-19 in multiple cities in the eastern province of Zhejiang. There are confirmed cases
of the virus in the cities of Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo. It is reporting two cases of the virus in Hangzhou, and a new case recorded in Shaoxing. On Monday it was reported that the city of Ningbo had confirmed three cases of the virus. Officials said a further five people have tested positive in the city, sparking fears of a wider outbreak. It is routine for large-scale testing drives to be ordered whenever fresh cases are identified. Ningboâs Zhenhai District has issued a level 1 emergency response and gone into lockdown. All schools have been closed, and flights have been cancelled from Ningbo into the capital city, Beijing. China has maintained a low number of cases due to its zero-Covid strategy - communities are locked down the moment fresh cases of the virus are identified. On Monday, Nigeria became the eleventh African country to be added to the UK's travel red list. It means only UK and Irish citizens, and UK residents, can arrive from there - and they must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Oche Ameh, a British citizen, is an engineer in Lagos, Nigeria, and had booked to travel back to the UK to spend Christmas with his family in Nottingham. However, the new restrictions mean he would have to quarantine over Christmas and New Year and also spend Â£2,285 on a hotel. ""It costs too much. I'm incredibly upset,"" he says. ""My kids are expecting to see their dad for Christmas. It's heart-breaking. As soon as the [travel] ban is lifted, I'll come home."" Julie, pictured with her partner Simon, had hoped to visit her family for Christmas We've been hearing from more people affected by the change to the UK's travel rules. Julie, 39, who lives in Sheffield, had been hoping to visit her family in France this Christmas for the first time in more than two years. However, she says the cost of tests, as well as worries about giving Covid to her vulnerable parents or grandparents, mean ""unfortunately, it looks like it's not going to happen"". When she looked at test prices online she found the actual prices on company websites were much higher than those advertised on the government site. ""The situation changed very quickly, and new rules arrived with such a short notice. The ferry also contacted us twice to change the times of the journey, making us feel like they keep cancelling more trips,"" she tells the BBC. ""It all feels very unstable and last thing we want is be stuck in France and not be able to come back home."" ""I feel sad to have to postpone my holidays and worried this is going to break my family's heart,"" she adds. A further 45,691 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, according to the latest figures. That's up from 39,716 cases on Tuesday last week. There were also a further 180 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. On Monday 329,165 booster jabs or third doses were given, taking the total to more than 20.9 million. A family have described how they were forced to book separate quarantine hotel rooms 100 miles apart because there were no bigger rooms available. Jennie Bianco, 42, from Sheffield, was in South Africa for work before she was joined by her husband and six-year-old son for a five-day holiday. But the day after they arrived the country was put on the travel red list, meaning they would have to quarantine for 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK. Jennie had already spent Â£200 to change their flights and Â£600 to book extra accommodation after she was told there wouldn't be family rooms available for another four days. However, despite several calls to the customer service line they were unable to secure a family room due to a lack of availability. It meant she had to pay Â£2,285 for the single room plus Â£2,610 for the room for her husband and son, rather than getting a discounted family room - and Jennie had to get help from her dad to afford the cost. There was also no option to request rooms in the same hotel. Her husband and son were placed in Milton Keynes, while she was in Gatwick. Jennie is also worried about the impact of being separated from her son, who is adopted. ""Especially after being together for so long
during Covid and the separation anxiety that comes with that. But for him, itâs
a particularly difficult situation,"" she tells the BBC. A government spokesperson said: ""The majority of passengers who have used the managed quarantine service have been satisfied with the service and we aim to keep families together.â As Omicron spreads across the globe, many people face an anxious wait to see if they will be able to travel for Christmas. Lucy, from London, lives in Kenya and is hoping to travel back to the UK to see her family on Monday. Kenya is not on the red list but she's worried that could change. She's also concerned about getting her test result in the required time. She tells the BBC some testing centres in Kenya are facing a ""substantial increase"" in the number of tests they are dealing with, so ""they're worried about being able to meet those needs"". ""I haven't seen my sister in two years. I saw my parents last year but couldn't get back last Christmas because of restrictions, especially in London, with the costs and everything it wasn't worth it,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends are also coming back who have lived abroad, a lot of them got married and had babies and I feel like I've really missed out over the past two years."" Instead of being congratulated for being one of the first countries in the world to identify the Omicron variant, Botswana has been penalised for it, the countryâs President Mokgweetsi Masisi has said.Masisi told BBC World Newsâs Lucy Hockings that the travel ban had left the southern African nation's economy throttled. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the booster jab campaign needs to go faster. ""A number of weeks ago we said we should move to at least 500,000 a day. As I understand it the figures this week are lower than last week,"" he says. The opposition leader says we ""are in a race now between this booster regime and the new variant"" and the government should have acted weeks ago, adding that the programme needs to be ramped up immediately. On Sunday 290,165 booster jabs were given, taking the total number of people who have received a booster or third dose to 20,580,644. That's 35.8% of the population over 12 in the UK. Here's how to get a booster jab. There is already ""immense pressure"" on hospitals even before the impact of the new Omicron variant is fully felt, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine says. Dr Nick Scriven tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme his hospital in Yorkshire is ""as busy as I can remember it"". ""Itâs not just Covid, the Covid wards area is actually beginning
to empty a little bit at the moment,"" he says. However, he adds that Covid patients tend to be in hospital a lot longer than people with other illnesses. If hospital admissions start to increase as the Omicron variant spreads, he says wards will be more crowded and nurses ""will be run off their feet"". Care may not be so ""dignified"" and there may be delays to less urgent treatment, he adds. People are being asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households Sturgeon says it is vital to ""strengthen compliance"" with existing measures to slow the spread of Omicron. People are already advised to work from home where practical, but she says employers are now being asked to ensure this is happening. If staff were working from home at the start of the pandemic, they should be asked to do so again, she adds. This advice will be in place until the middle of January, when it will be reviewed. People are also asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households. However, the first minister says she ""cannot guarantee"" further measures will not be needed. It is important to remain open to any proportionate measures, such as the extension of Covid certification, she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

She says she has already paid nearly Â£4,000 in Covid tests, flights and hotel quarantine costs to get back from South Africa, but also has a Â£10,000 fine hanging over her head. Having flown out to visit family when South Africa was on the green list, she says she had to stay an extra week in Cape Town before flying to Geneva in order to get home. ""As I got into Geneva they pulled me aside and said they're not accepting anyone from red list countries. They said the rules had changed in the last 24-48 hours. They wanted to send me back on a flight to South Africa but I'm a British citizen,"" she says. As her PCR test was expiring she says she was told to get on a flight or go back to South Africa, and was taken to get another test before being escorted to the plane, without being able to book a space in a quarantine hotel. She says when she arrived in Luton she was told she should not have come and was given a notice of intent to serve a fixed penalty notice. After a five-hour wait at Luton she says a quarantine hotel room was found for her at Gatwick. ""I had to pay immediately more than Â£2,000. All in all it's cost me almost Â£4,000 extra. And I have the possibility of a fixed penalty notice of Â£10,000 hanging over my head."" Holidaymakers returning from South Africa are considering court actionafter long-awaited trips ended in quarantine. Couples have told the BBC they have spent thousands of pounds in hotel fees despite following all the Covid rules before travelling. More than 40,000 peoplehave signed a petition against the overnight move,externalto add countries, including South Africa, to the red list in response to the discovery of the Omicron variant. A judicial review on making people pay for mandatory hotel quarantining is being sought at the High Court on Thursday. Kate and Alex Freed from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had already been forced to postpone their wedding four times by lockdowns before finally tying the knot and jetting off to Cape Town at the start of November. They describe the increase of hotel prices as ""disgusting"" and are angry the UK brought in its travel ban overnight without the previous grace periods. A spokesman for the Department for Health and Social Care says: ""The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme."" Earlier we heard from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who extended Scotland's work-from-home guidance until mid-January - but Downing Street says that is ""not our position"". The prime minister's official spokesman says ""we are obviously looking at incoming data on the Omicron variant"" but ""our position remains as set out, with the limited number of restrictions we have introduced so far"". See you in Paris soon? Many countries are re-introducing restrictions in response to thenew Omicron variant. There are regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These are often changing quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. We've analysed - country-by-country - key things a traveller from the UK needs to know about going to each of seven popular destinations, including Ireland, Spain, France, Italy and the US.

authorities say workers, including some in the medical profession, are using or
supplying fake Covid vaccination certificates to get round new regulations. A senior health
official said there was a market for forged documentation and that some health
workers were involved. People are known to
be buying bogus certificates from medical workers for as little as $12. It comes after
authorities banned members of the public from entering government offices
without proof of at least one vaccine from 1 December. Since mid-November
authorities have required proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test for
government employees to enter their offices. Employees who have not been
immunised are required to pay for the PCR test twice a week at a cost of at
least $40 each time. Egypt has set a target of vaccinating 40% of the
population of 102 million by the end of this year but millions are still
reluctant or unwilling to get the jab. Two people were killed and four injured, including a 10-year-old child, when a gunman opened fire inside a public services office in Moscow on Tuesday, Russian officials say. The suspect - who was later detained - reportedly started shooting after being told to put a face mask on. A source told Russia's Interfax news agency that the man opened fire when a guard tried to escort him out of the building in the south-east of the capital. A criminal investigation into the shooting has been launched. If convicted, the 45-year-old suspect could be jailed for life. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media have reported new cases of Covid-19 in multiple cities in the eastern province of Zhejiang. There are confirmed cases
of the virus in the cities of Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo. It is reporting two cases of the virus in Hangzhou, and a new case recorded in Shaoxing. On Monday it was reported that the city of Ningbo had confirmed three cases of the virus. Officials said a further five people have tested positive in the city, sparking fears of a wider outbreak. It is routine for large-scale testing drives to be ordered whenever fresh cases are identified. Ningboâs Zhenhai District has issued a level 1 emergency response and gone into lockdown. All schools have been closed, and flights have been cancelled from Ningbo into the capital city, Beijing. China has maintained a low number of cases due to its zero-Covid strategy - communities are locked down the moment fresh cases of the virus are identified. On Monday, Nigeria became the eleventh African country to be added to the UK's travel red list. It means only UK and Irish citizens, and UK residents, can arrive from there - and they must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Oche Ameh, a British citizen, is an engineer in Lagos, Nigeria, and had booked to travel back to the UK to spend Christmas with his family in Nottingham. However, the new restrictions mean he would have to quarantine over Christmas and New Year and also spend Â£2,285 on a hotel. ""It costs too much. I'm incredibly upset,"" he says. ""My kids are expecting to see their dad for Christmas. It's heart-breaking. As soon as the [travel] ban is lifted, I'll come home."" Julie, pictured with her partner Simon, had hoped to visit her family for Christmas We've been hearing from more people affected by the change to the UK's travel rules. Julie, 39, who lives in Sheffield, had been hoping to visit her family in France this Christmas for the first time in more than two years. However, she says the cost of tests, as well as worries about giving Covid to her vulnerable parents or grandparents, mean ""unfortunately, it looks like it's not going to happen"". When she looked at test prices online she found the actual prices on company websites were much higher than those advertised on the government site. ""The situation changed very quickly, and new rules arrived with such a short notice. The ferry also contacted us twice to change the times of the journey, making us feel like they keep cancelling more trips,"" she tells the BBC. ""It all feels very unstable and last thing we want is be stuck in France and not be able to come back home."" ""I feel sad to have to postpone my holidays and worried this is going to break my family's heart,"" she adds. A further 45,691 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, according to the latest figures. That's up from 39,716 cases on Tuesday last week. There were also a further 180 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. On Monday 329,165 booster jabs or third doses were given, taking the total to more than 20.9 million. A family have described how they were forced to book separate quarantine hotel rooms 100 miles apart because there were no bigger rooms available. Jennie Bianco, 42, from Sheffield, was in South Africa for work before she was joined by her husband and six-year-old son for a five-day holiday. But the day after they arrived the country was put on the travel red list, meaning they would have to quarantine for 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK. Jennie had already spent Â£200 to change their flights and Â£600 to book extra accommodation after she was told there wouldn't be family rooms available for another four days. However, despite several calls to the customer service line they were unable to secure a family room due to a lack of availability. It meant she had to pay Â£2,285 for the single room plus Â£2,610 for the room for her husband and son, rather than getting a discounted family room - and Jennie had to get help from her dad to afford the cost. There was also no option to request rooms in the same hotel. Her husband and son were placed in Milton Keynes, while she was in Gatwick. Jennie is also worried about the impact of being separated from her son, who is adopted. ""Especially after being together for so long
during Covid and the separation anxiety that comes with that. But for him, itâs
a particularly difficult situation,"" she tells the BBC. A government spokesperson said: ""The majority of passengers who have used the managed quarantine service have been satisfied with the service and we aim to keep families together.â As Omicron spreads across the globe, many people face an anxious wait to see if they will be able to travel for Christmas. Lucy, from London, lives in Kenya and is hoping to travel back to the UK to see her family on Monday. Kenya is not on the red list but she's worried that could change. She's also concerned about getting her test result in the required time. She tells the BBC some testing centres in Kenya are facing a ""substantial increase"" in the number of tests they are dealing with, so ""they're worried about being able to meet those needs"". ""I haven't seen my sister in two years. I saw my parents last year but couldn't get back last Christmas because of restrictions, especially in London, with the costs and everything it wasn't worth it,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends are also coming back who have lived abroad, a lot of them got married and had babies and I feel like I've really missed out over the past two years."" Instead of being congratulated for being one of the first countries in the world to identify the Omicron variant, Botswana has been penalised for it, the countryâs President Mokgweetsi Masisi has said.Masisi told BBC World Newsâs Lucy Hockings that the travel ban had left the southern African nation's economy throttled. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the booster jab campaign needs to go faster. ""A number of weeks ago we said we should move to at least 500,000 a day. As I understand it the figures this week are lower than last week,"" he says. The opposition leader says we ""are in a race now between this booster regime and the new variant"" and the government should have acted weeks ago, adding that the programme needs to be ramped up immediately. On Sunday 290,165 booster jabs were given, taking the total number of people who have received a booster or third dose to 20,580,644. That's 35.8% of the population over 12 in the UK. Here's how to get a booster jab. There is already ""immense pressure"" on hospitals even before the impact of the new Omicron variant is fully felt, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine says. Dr Nick Scriven tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme his hospital in Yorkshire is ""as busy as I can remember it"". ""Itâs not just Covid, the Covid wards area is actually beginning
to empty a little bit at the moment,"" he says. However, he adds that Covid patients tend to be in hospital a lot longer than people with other illnesses. If hospital admissions start to increase as the Omicron variant spreads, he says wards will be more crowded and nurses ""will be run off their feet"". Care may not be so ""dignified"" and there may be delays to less urgent treatment, he adds. People are being asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households Sturgeon says it is vital to ""strengthen compliance"" with existing measures to slow the spread of Omicron. People are already advised to work from home where practical, but she says employers are now being asked to ensure this is happening. If staff were working from home at the start of the pandemic, they should be asked to do so again, she adds. This advice will be in place until the middle of January, when it will be reviewed. People are also asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households. However, the first minister says she ""cannot guarantee"" further measures will not be needed. It is important to remain open to any proportionate measures, such as the extension of Covid certification, she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

Labour MP Harman to stand down at next election,"Harriet Harman entered the House of Commons in 1982 and served two brief stints as Labour leader Veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman has announced she will stand down at the next general election. She revealed her decision in an email to her local party in Camberwell and Peckham on Tuesday morning after almost 40 years as their MP. She promised to ""work energetically"" until the next polling day. But Ms Harman said she would then leave the Commons ""now confident that Labour is gaining strength under the leadership of Keir Starmer"". Labour MP Karen Buck called her a ""guiding light and inspiration for women in politics"", while former MP and now West Yorkshire Mayor, Tracey Brabin, called her ""the original glass ceiling smasher"". The 71-year-old became an MP in 1982 and has held a raft of posts in the party - including two brief stints as leader after Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband stepped down. She served as deputy leader for both men, but is perhaps better known for her feminist campaigning in Parliament and as Mother of the House - the woman with the longest continuous service in the Commons. Harman: Next Labour leader must be a woman Harman breaks record for long service Harman pushes for MPs' maternity leave In her email, Ms Harman said when she entered Parliament, she was one of just 11 female Labour MPs in a Commons that was 97% male. ""Now there are 104 Labour women and across all parties women MPs are a 'critical mass',"" she added. ""But there remains much more to be done till women genuinely share political power with men on equal terms and until women in this country are equal. ""I will leave the House of Commons with my feminism, my belief in Labour and my enthusiasm for politics undimmed."" Ms Harman pictured alongside her husband, fellow Labour MP Jack Dromey, in 1982 after winning her Peckham seat in a by-election Ms Harman took to Twitter to share some facts and figures about her time in Parliament. As well as fighting 10 general elections, she has served under seven prime ministers and eight Labour leaders. She has spoken in the Commons 9,850 times since November 1982. And she became a mother of three and grandmother to five. MPs have been paying tribute to Ms Harman, with shadow health secretary Wes Streeting calling her a ""trail-blazer, change-maker and champion"". His party colleague and shadow minister Jess Philips said: ""All my life Harriet has been in Parliament and as a woman that life would have been very different if she hadn't. ""Harriet Harman is my hero. I owe her a debt so big it cannot be repaid."" And Labour's Liz Kendall added: ""Harriet Harman has inspired so many of us in politics, and has blazed a trail for women and equality.

"Whistleblower describes 'chaos' of UK Afghan exitThousands of pleas for help went unread and the foreign secretary lacked urgency, an ex-official says.UK","The UK Foreign Office's handling of the Afghan evacuation after the Taliban seized Kabul was dysfunctional and chaotic, a whistleblower has said. Raphael Marshall said the process of choosing who could get a flight out was arbitrary and thousands of emails with pleas for help went unread. The then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions, he added. Mr Raab told the BBC lessons would be learned but the UK did a good job compared to other countries. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, the UKairlifted 15,000 people out of the country, including 5,000 British nationals, 8,000 Afghans and 2,000 children. Inwritten evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee,external, Mr Marshall said up to 150,000 Afghans who were at risk because of their links to Britain applied to be evacuated - but fewer than 5% received any assistance. ""It is clear that some of those left behind have since been murdered by the Taliban,"" he added. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office's top civil servant was repeatedly questioned by MPs about his decision to continue his holiday for 11 days after Kabul fell to the Taliban. Sir Philip Barton said he had ""reflected a lot"" on his decision, adding: ""If I had my time again I would have come back from my leave earlier than I did."" He insisted cover arrangements were in place and he had ""stayed in touch with the department all the way through the period"". But committee chairman Tom Tugendhat said he found Sir Philip's decision ""strange"" given Mr Raab had returned. PM intervened to evacuate animal charity - whistleblower How many people did the UK get out of Afghanistan? 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Ten days that shook Afghanistan Mr Raab said the two-week evacuation was ""the biggest operation in living memory"" of its kind and the UK had helped a larger number of people than any nation except the US. The former foreign secretary, who is now justice secretary, said the criticism of his decision-making was from a ""relatively junior desk officer"" but the main challenges were in verifying the identities of applicants on the ground and safely escorting them to the airport in Kabul, not in making decisions from Whitehall. This video can not be played Dominic Raab, who was replaced as foreign secretary, defends his role in the Afghanistan evacuation Other criticisms were ""rather dislocated from the operational pressures and conditions"", he said. ""I don't doubt there were challenges, I don't doubt there will be lessons to be learned but if you look at the facts, I think we did a good job by recent standards of evacuations and by international comparisons,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Mr Marshall, who was a senior desk officer at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) until he resigned in September, said there was inadequate staffing at the department's crisis centre, and staff would not normally be expected to work at weekends or overnight. Raphael Marshall, 25, was a senior desk officer at the Foreign Office and said thousands of pleas for help went unread There was also a lack of expertise and a lack of co-ordination between the department and the Ministry of Defence, he added. Mr Marshall also said Mr Raab took hours to answer emails and ""did not fully understand the situation"". And he said an instruction from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to evacuate dogs looked after by an animal charity went against Foreign Office criteria and meant people at risk of being murdered were left behind. Mr Johnson said the allegation that he intervened on this issue was ""complete nonsense"" and that the rescue operation was ""one of the outstanding military achievements of the last 50 years or more"", under ""pretty harrowing circumstances"". The key issues flagged by Foreign Office whistleblower Raphael Marshall include: Only 5% of the 150,000 people who requested help received any Nobody in the team dealing with requests had studied, had any detailed knowledge of Afghanistan, or had ever worked there No one spoke any Afghan languages, with calls to people asking for help conducted in English Decisions about who to rescue were arbitrary, and thousands of emails pleading for assistance were not even read The IT system was dysfunctional, with eight soldiers drafted in to help left sharing one computer Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions on difficult cases and did not fully understand the situation Animals from the Nowzad charity run by a former Marine were not in danger and evacuating them was at the direct expense of people at risk of death As the Taliban approached Kabul in August, there was one government scheme to evacuate those Afghans who had worked directly for the British government, and another to identify and help those who were at risk because of their broader links to the UK. Mr Marshall worked for the team of officials handling a group known as Afghan Special Cases. These included Afghan soldiers, politicians, journalists, civil servants, activists, aid workers, judges - and guards who had worked indirectly for the UK government via subcontractors. In the desperate days at the end of August as the Taliban advanced on Kabul, many of these people were emailing the FCDO to get permission for a flight out of the country. Mr Marshall said there were ""usually 5,000 unread emails in the inbox at any given moment"" and ""in thousands of cases emails were not even read"", including cases from MPs. He said the process of prioritising the applicants was ""arbitrary and dysfunctional"". The criteria used by the government were unhelpful and ambiguous, leading to confusion, he added. The decision to transport dogs from Pen Farthing's Nowzad shelter used up considerable capacity, so there was less space at the airport and fewer soldiers available to escort evacuees, Mr Marshall said. He said the UK government ended up transporting animals ""which were not at risk of harm at the direct expense of evacuating British nationals and people at risk of imminent murder, including interpreters who had served with the British Army"". Staff in the crisis centre who previously worked for the Department for International Development could not access FCDO computers because ""the DFID and FCO IT systems are not yet integrated. They were visibly appalled by our chaotic system"". Mr Marshall described how soldiers were brought in to help but many had not used the computer systems before and so mistakes were made. The computers had to be shared because FCDO IT had not issued passwords to unlock them. At one point eight soldiers shared one computer. During the evacuation there were chaotic scenes outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul Telephone calls to Afghans were made only in English, Mr Marshall said. There was no one who spoke Dari or Pashto. Mr Marshall said: ""I believe no member of the Afghan Special Cases team had studied Afghanistan, worked on Afghanistan previously, or had a detailed knowledge of Afghanistan. He added: ""One was clearly scared of being asked to make hundreds of life and death decisions about which they knew nothing."" He said: ""Most people in the FCDO crisis centre had a poor understanding of the actual situation at Kabul airport and the consequent urgency of calling people up as soon as possible."" This video can not be played Brigadier James Martin speaks about the UK's evacuation operation from Afghanistan Mr Marshall's report states the FCDO crisis centre sent notes up to Mr Raab's office to get decisions on difficult cases. But ""it took several hours for the foreign secretary to engage on any of these notes"" and when he did ""he could not decide on individual cases"" without seeing all the cases ""in a well-presented table"". Mr Marshall concluded: ""For the foreign secretary to make this request suggests he did not fully understand the situation."" He said, on another occasion, ""the foreign secretary declined to make a decision on whether to admit these people without a properly formatted submission with a table setting out multiple cases"". A source close to Mr Raab said: ""We evacuated over 500 special cases, including journalists, women's rights activists and extremely vulnerable individuals. ""The major practical challenge to evacuation was verifying identity and securing safe passage to the airport, not the speed of decision making. At all times, the team's focus was on saving lives."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy accused Mr Raab of ""complacency and indifference"" regarding the Afghan crisis, and said he ""should consider his position"". He said four months on, the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme - intended to help people who assisted the UK or who are at risk from the Taliban - is still not operational. People such as judges are ""in hiding, running for their lives"" as a result, Mr Lammy said. Chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said: ""The real question that needs answering is, where was everybody?"" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Marshall's evidence depicts a 25-year-old, at times completely on his own, dealing with a huge volume of requests for help, ""in a Foreign Office that was effectively a Mary Celeste at a time of national emergency"". Asked if it showed that the Foreign Office's work-from-home arrangements had failed, Mr Tugendhat said ""all hands needed to be on deck"" and ""whatever the working arrangements, they weren't working"". How the Taliban takeover changed my life Hours without food or water in Kabul airport 'hell' A UK government spokesperson said more than 1,000 FCDO staff worked tirelessly in challenging circumstances, and decisions on prioritisation had to be made quickly to help as many people as possible.

Breaking|Breaking newsWales expects significant wave of Omicron,"This video can not be played The Welsh government says it is expecting a significant wave of the Omicron variant of coronavirus this winter Wales stands on the brink of ""another potentially perilous moment"" ahead of an expected ""formidable wave"" of Omicron cases, First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned. Five cases have been found in Wales but this is expected to rise substantially, with a peak by the end of January. Plans for all adults to be offered abooster jabby the end of that month were announced. Mr Drakeford appealed to the public to take up the offer. Health Minister Eluned Morgan expressed concern the variant ""spreads very rapidly"". On Tuesday officials confirmed the fifth Omicron case in Wales, among 101 cases reported in the UK on the same day. It brings the total to 437. The variant is believed to be spreadingin the community in England. The prime minister's official spokesman has said Omicronappears more transmissible than Delta- the variant of coronavirus currently dominant in the UK. Live: Welsh government press conference All adults offered booster jab by end of January Could Wales go into another lockdown? Scotland's first minister says her government will be reviewing Covid restrictions on a daily basis due to arapid increasein cases of the variant there. In the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday Mark Drakeford said Wales stands at the brink of ""another potentially perilous moment"" in the pandemic. He said Wales has to ""brace ourselves for the potential for a formidable wave of new infections in the new year, potentially just six weeks from now, if we cannot slow the spread of this new variant"". Appealing for people to be vaccinated, he added: ""It is the best Christmas present you can give yourself and your family this year, and it's not too dramatic to say that it's an investment in making sure that you are here for a healthy and happy Christmas next year as well."" He spoke following a Welsh government press conference where his colleague Eluned Morgan refused to rule out tightening Covid rules. No new restrictions have yet been introduced in Wales in response to the new variant, but she said: ""We can't give you any assurances on that because we are still learning about the situation."" Ministers have instead stressed the need to take care over the festive period, and Ms Morgan recommended people take lateral flow tests before meeting friends over Christmas. ""It's clear people should act with caution,"" the minister said. Mark Drakeford is due to announce his latest review of coronavirus restrictions on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

The health minister said it was not yet known how sick the Omicron variant could make people. Hospital admissions in South Africa had gone go up from about 143 to 788 in two weeks, she said, but added that ""we don't know if that's a pattern we would see reflected in our population"". ""We don't know the extent to which vaccines will give us protection but we do think they will give us a lot more than having no vaccine at all. So that's why our plea today is please help us in this situation."" Is Omicron more harmful than other Covid variants? Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? Ms Morgan said: ""We are expecting a significant wave of Omicron to hit Wales. ""The modelling suggests that it will reach its peak by around the end of January, which is why there is an urgency in terms of getting people vaccinated and boosters done as soon as possible."" No new restrictions have been announced for the Christmas period in Wales Speaking with BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Cheryl Walter, a lecturer in microbiology at Hull University, said that South African clinicians have said for a while that they are only seeing mild disease in patients diagnosed with Omicron. ""In terms of potency, it might be transmitted more easily, and again that is unsurprising when you look at the rate of cases of Omicron and how quickly they have crept up. ""But anecdotal studies and clinicians are saying that the Omicron variant of the disease is relatively mind, which is really good news,"" she added. All cases of Omicron in Wales have so far been detected in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area. Dr Meng Khaw of Public Health Wales said the fifth individual, announced on Tuesday, had recently travelled. ""As we have said previously, an increase in cases of Omicron variant in Wales is to be expected,"" she said. The overall seven-day rolling case rate per 100,000 people has risen slightly to 493.3. There were two more deaths reported by Public Health Wales on Tuesday, bringing the total to 6,441. On Tuesday the Welsh government announced it would offer all adults a booster vaccine by the end of January, in line with targets announced last week in England and Scotland. It follows advice to bring forward the gap between second and third doses from six months to three - significantly increasing the number of adults eligible for a third dose. Plans include: More vaccination centres, with drive-through options and longer opening hours. Walk-in centres for over-65s without an appointment Asking for additional help from the military to allow some parts of Wales to double the number of vaccinations provided Students, fire services and council staff to provide help at clinics, alongside GPs and community pharmacies This will allow the NHS to ramp up the number of vaccinations from 19,000 a day to the goal of more than 200,000 a week. At Tuesday's press conference, Ms Morgan there may be a need ""to reduce some planned care"" in the NHS to run the booster programme ""but we're obviously hoping that we can keep our GP surgeries going as usual"". Some family doctors had ""stepped up and offered support, but we're not expecting that provision within our community to be reduced at this time"", Ms Morgan added. Tuesday marks one year since the first Covid-19 vaccination was administered in Wales Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Gill Richardson encouraged pregnant women to get vaccinated before the variant takes hold. She said intensive care admissions for unvaccinated pregnant women ""are really much higher than they should be"". According to recent figures, one in six patients receiving the ECMO treatment,Â the most intense form of intensive care,Â were pregnant. Dr Richardson accepted that the decision was "" very difficult"" and ""women are worried and concerned"". But she asked them to talk to their midwives and partners about the vaccine, ""because we have seen some real tragedies amongst pregnant ladies who have sadly left their families behind and succumbed to the Delta variant"". Welsh Conservative and shadow health minister Russell George said: ""I am pleased that the minister has finally heeded our calls to rapidly roll out booster jabs and redeploy our volunteer army, even implementing our proposal for walk-in centres which she called free-for-alls only a few days ago. ""However, the reported possibility of extending vaccine passports to hospitality business is a slap in the face for one of the worst-affected sectors of the pandemic."" Plaid Cymru said ministers should base any decisions on new restrictions or lockdowns on emerging evidence of the seriousness of the Omicron variant. Delyth Jewell said: ""In the interim, being in a vacuum is not a good place to be, so businesses need to have clarity on whether there are going to be further restrictions.""

Australian conman caught after six-month manhunt,"Australian conman Peter Foster, pictured in 2006 Australian serial conman Peter Foster has been arrested, six months after he failed to appear in a Sydney court over an alleged Bitcoin fraud. Mr Foster, 59, is accused of defrauding a Hong Kong man of A$1.7m (Â£900,000; $1,2m) in cryptocurrency. Last year he was arrested in Queensland and extradited to New South Wales, where he allegedly went on the run after being given bail. He was arrested in the state of Victoria on Tuesday. Mr Foster is accused of posing as a man called William ""Bill"" Dawson as part of an online scam. Police have alleged he received money from the Hong Kong man in several tranches between April 2019 and January 2020, in amounts ranging from about A$125,000 to $890,000. He faces multiple charges of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception, and publishing false or misleading material to obtain an advantage. At the time he went missing, he was on strict bail conditions that required him to surrender his passport, wear an electronic ankle bracelet, and not use the internet or a mobile phone. He was also barred from leaving his Sydney home unless it was a medical emergency or he was seeing police or his lawyers. Mr Foster was declared a fugitive after failing to appear in court on 20 May. The Australian Federal Police arrested him on Tuesday near the town of Gisborne, about an hour north-west of Melbourne. Mr Foster has previously been involved inhigh-profile previous scams, most notably involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie Blair, in 2002.

Facebook sued for $150bn over Rohingya hate speech,"Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar after a campaign of violence against them Dozens of Rohingya refugees in the UK and US have sued Facebook, accusing the social media giant of allowing hate speech against them to spread. They are demanding more than $150bn (Â£113bn) in compensation, claiming Facebook's platforms promoted violence against the persecuted minority. An estimated 10,000 Rohingya Muslims were killed during a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar in 2017. Facebook, now called Meta, says it has taken action to ""keep people safe"". But the company is accused of allowing ""the dissemination of hateful and dangerous misinformation to continue for years"". In the UK, a British law firm representing some of the refugees has written a letter to Facebook, seen by the BBC, alleging: Facebook's algorithms ""amplified hate speech against the Rohingya people"" The firm ""failed to invest"" in moderators and fact checkers who knew about the political situation in Myanmar The company failed to take down posts or delete accounts that incited violence against Rohingya It failed to ""take appropriate and timely action"", despite warnings from charities and the media In the US, lawyers fileda legal complaint,externalagainst Facebook in San Francisco, accusing it of being ""willing to trade the lives of the Rohingya people for better market penetration in a small country in Southeast Asia."" They cite Facebook posts that appeared in an investigation by the Reuters news agency, including one in 2013 stating: ""We must fight them the way Hitler did the Jews."" Another post said: ""Pour fuel and set fire so that they can meet Allah faster."" Facebook has more than 20 million users in Myanmar. For many, the social media site is their main or only way of getting and sharing news. Facebook admitted in 2018 that it had not done enoughto prevent the incitement of violence and hate speech against the Rohingya. This followed an independent report, commissioned by Facebook, that said the platform had created an ""enabling environment"" for the proliferation of human rights abuse. What happened in Myanmar was one of Facebook's first red flags. The social media site was hugely popular there - but the company didn't fully understand what was happening on its own platform. They weren't actively moderating content in local languages like Burmese and Rakhine. If they had, they would have seen anti-Muslim hate speech and disinformation about terrorist plots from the Rohingya. Critics say this helped fuel ethnic tensions that spilled over into brutal violence. Mark Zuckerberg has personally admitted to mistakes in the run up to widespread violence there, That's what makes this lawsuit particularly interesting - Facebook isn't denying that it could have done more. Whether or not that means they are legally culpable is a very different question though. Could this lawsuit get anywhere? It's possible, though unlikely. But as its parent company, Meta, tries to turn the focus away from Facebook - it finds Itself still haunted by past mistakes. The Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants in Myanmar and have been discriminated against by the government and public for decades. In 2017, the Myanmar military launched a violent crackdown in Rakhine state after Rohingya militants carried out deadly attacks on police posts. What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis The country where Facebook posts whipped up hate Thousands of people died and more than 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. There are also widespread allegations of human rights abuses, including arbitrary killing, rape and burning of land. In 2018, the UN accused Facebook of being ""slow and ineffective"" in its response to the spread of hatred online. Under US law, Facebook is largely protected from liability over content posted by its users. But the new lawsuit argues the law of Myanmar - which has no such protections - should prevail in the case. A Meta spokesperson said: ""We're appalled by the crimes committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar."" They said the company had built a team of Burmese speakers, banned Myanmar's military and ""taken action on harmful misinformation to help keep people safe"". ""We've also invested in Burmese-language technology to reduce the prevalence of violating content,"" the spokesperson added.

LiveLivePre-departure test now needed for UK arrivals3 minutes ago,"Early indications suggest the Omicron variant of coronavirus is ""more transmissible"" than Delta, Downing Street says But much remains unknown and the government is not looking at introducing its Plan B level of restrictions, a spokesman tells reporters Scientists are yet to draw firm conclusions but are continuing to analyse samples of the virus and real-world data People travelling to the UK must now take a Covid test before their journey as well as a PCR test upon their return There are 437 confirmed cases of the highly-mutated Omicron variant in the UK Experts believe it could overtake Delta to become the dominant variant That's about it from our live page coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a reminder of the major headlines from today:  Today's coverage has been written by Doug Faulkner, James Harness, Yaroslav Lukov and Rebecca Morton and edited by Emma Harrison and Holly Wallis. Thanks for joining us. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Officially there have been just over 400 Omicron infections. But
thatâs just the tip of the iceberg. It is based on positive tests sent to labs to check for
variants, which only happens in a minority of cases. Because of a quirk in the way Omicron shows on PCR tests it is
possible to identify suspected cases too. Using this data, researchers at the University of East Anglia
believe there could have been five to six times as many Omicron cases as the
official total shows. This data is what is behind suggestions the number of cases is
doubling every three days or so and the conclusion that it is more
transmissible than Delta. What is not clear is why. To what extent is it down to Omicronâs
ability to get past immunity, greater infectiousness or because it has a
shorter incubation period? The answer to that could have a big bearing on how quickly and
how far infection levels will climb. Another unknown is what that will mean for serious illness. You
would expect reinfections or infections post-vaccination to be milder. If that is the case, the proportion of cases ending up in
hospital will drop. But even if it halves, if infection rates more than double,
pressure on the NHS will still increase. The threat of hospitals being overwhelmed is now back on the
table. The number of new Covid cases reported across the UK this week is the highest weekly figure since January. A total of 336,893 new cases have been
reported in the past seven days, including 45,691 on Tuesday. This is the highest number for a
seven-day period since the week to 16 January, when 339,956 were reported. Weekly cases during the second wave of the virus peaked at
417,620, for the seven days to 9 January. This video can not be played Gatwick passengers on new covid restrictions We asked passengers travelling through Gatwick Airport for their views on changes to Covid restrictions. Most are concerned about the cost and stress it adds to travelling, although some think there are benefits to the extra virus screening. Lauren Rochat-Greene, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is among those quarantining in a hotel at Gatwick, after flying back to the UK from Cape Town, via Geneva. She says she has already paid nearly Â£4,000 in Covid tests, flights and hotel quarantine costs to get back from South Africa, but also has a Â£10,000 fine hanging over her head. Having flown out to visit family when South Africa was on the green list, she says she had to stay an extra week in Cape Town before flying to Geneva in order to get home. ""As I got into Geneva they pulled me aside and said they're not accepting anyone from red list countries. They said the rules had changed in the last 24-48 hours. They wanted to send me back on a flight to South Africa but I'm a British citizen,"" she says. As her PCR test was expiring she says she was told to get on a flight or go back to South Africa, and was taken to get another test before being escorted to the plane, without being able to book a space in a quarantine hotel. She says when she arrived in Luton she was told she should not have come and was given a notice of intent to serve a fixed penalty notice. After a five-hour wait at Luton she says a quarantine hotel room was found for her at Gatwick. ""I had to pay immediately more than Â£2,000. All in all it's cost me almost Â£4,000 extra. And I have the possibility of a fixed penalty notice of Â£10,000 hanging over my head."" Holidaymakers returning from South Africa are considering court actionafter long-awaited trips ended in quarantine. Couples have told the BBC they have spent thousands of pounds in hotel fees despite following all the Covid rules before travelling. More than 40,000 peoplehave signed a petition against the overnight move,externalto add countries, including South Africa, to the red list in response to the discovery of the Omicron variant. A judicial review on making people pay for mandatory hotel quarantining is being sought at the High Court on Thursday. Kate and Alex Freed from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had already been forced to postpone their wedding four times by lockdowns before finally tying the knot and jetting off to Cape Town at the start of November. They describe the increase of hotel prices as ""disgusting"" and are angry the UK brought in its travel ban overnight without the previous grace periods. A spokesman for the Department for Health and Social Care says: ""The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme."" Earlier we heard from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who extended Scotland's work-from-home guidance until mid-January - but Downing Street says that is ""not our position"". The prime minister's official spokesman says ""we are obviously looking at incoming data on the Omicron variant"" but ""our position remains as set out, with the limited number of restrictions we have introduced so far"". See you in Paris soon? Many countries are re-introducing restrictions in response to thenew Omicron variant. There are regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These are often changing quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. We've analysed - country-by-country - key things a traveller from the UK needs to know about going to each of seven popular destinations, including Ireland, Spain, France, Italy and the US. Read our full article here Egyptian
authorities say workers, including some in the medical profession, are using or
supplying fake Covid vaccination certificates to get round new regulations. A senior health
official said there was a market for forged documentation and that some health
workers were involved. People are known to
be buying bogus certificates from medical workers for as little as $12. It comes after
authorities banned members of the public from entering government offices
without proof of at least one vaccine from 1 December. Since mid-November
authorities have required proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test for
government employees to enter their offices. Employees who have not been
immunised are required to pay for the PCR test twice a week at a cost of at
least $40 each time. Egypt has set a target of vaccinating 40% of the
population of 102 million by the end of this year but millions are still
reluctant or unwilling to get the jab. Two people were killed and four injured, including a 10-year-old child, when a gunman opened fire inside a public services office in Moscow on Tuesday, Russian officials say. The suspect - who was later detained - reportedly started shooting after being told to put a face mask on. A source told Russia's Interfax news agency that the man opened fire when a guard tried to escort him out of the building in the south-east of the capital. A criminal investigation into the shooting has been launched. If convicted, the 45-year-old suspect could be jailed for life. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official Chinese media have reported new cases of Covid-19 in multiple cities in the eastern province of Zhejiang. There are confirmed cases
of the virus in the cities of Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo. It is reporting two cases of the virus in Hangzhou, and a new case recorded in Shaoxing. On Monday it was reported that the city of Ningbo had confirmed three cases of the virus. Officials said a further five people have tested positive in the city, sparking fears of a wider outbreak. It is routine for large-scale testing drives to be ordered whenever fresh cases are identified. Ningboâs Zhenhai District has issued a level 1 emergency response and gone into lockdown. All schools have been closed, and flights have been cancelled from Ningbo into the capital city, Beijing. China has maintained a low number of cases due to its zero-Covid strategy - communities are locked down the moment fresh cases of the virus are identified. On Monday, Nigeria became the eleventh African country to be added to the UK's travel red list. It means only UK and Irish citizens, and UK residents, can arrive from there - and they must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Oche Ameh, a British citizen, is an engineer in Lagos, Nigeria, and had booked to travel back to the UK to spend Christmas with his family in Nottingham. However, the new restrictions mean he would have to quarantine over Christmas and New Year and also spend Â£2,285 on a hotel. ""It costs too much. I'm incredibly upset,"" he says. ""My kids are expecting to see their dad for Christmas. It's heart-breaking. As soon as the [travel] ban is lifted, I'll come home."" Julie, pictured with her partner Simon, had hoped to visit her family for Christmas We've been hearing from more people affected by the change to the UK's travel rules. Julie, 39, who lives in Sheffield, had been hoping to visit her family in France this Christmas for the first time in more than two years. However, she says the cost of tests, as well as worries about giving Covid to her vulnerable parents or grandparents, mean ""unfortunately, it looks like it's not going to happen"". When she looked at test prices online she found the actual prices on company websites were much higher than those advertised on the government site. ""The situation changed very quickly, and new rules arrived with such a short notice. The ferry also contacted us twice to change the times of the journey, making us feel like they keep cancelling more trips,"" she tells the BBC. ""It all feels very unstable and last thing we want is be stuck in France and not be able to come back home."" ""I feel sad to have to postpone my holidays and worried this is going to break my family's heart,"" she adds. A further 45,691 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK, according to the latest figures. That's up from 39,716 cases on Tuesday last week. There were also a further 180 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. On Monday 329,165 booster jabs or third doses were given, taking the total to more than 20.9 million. A family have described how they were forced to book separate quarantine hotel rooms 100 miles apart because there were no bigger rooms available. Jennie Bianco, 42, from Sheffield, was in South Africa for work before she was joined by her husband and six-year-old son for a five-day holiday. But the day after they arrived the country was put on the travel red list, meaning they would have to quarantine for 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK. Jennie had already spent Â£200 to change their flights and Â£600 to book extra accommodation after she was told there wouldn't be family rooms available for another four days. However, despite several calls to the customer service line they were unable to secure a family room due to a lack of availability. It meant she had to pay Â£2,285 for the single room plus Â£2,610 for the room for her husband and son, rather than getting a discounted family room - and Jennie had to get help from her dad to afford the cost. There was also no option to request rooms in the same hotel. Her husband and son were placed in Milton Keynes, while she was in Gatwick. Jennie is also worried about the impact of being separated from her son, who is adopted. ""Especially after being together for so long
during Covid and the separation anxiety that comes with that. But for him, itâs
a particularly difficult situation,"" she tells the BBC. A government spokesperson said: ""The majority of passengers who have used the managed quarantine service have been satisfied with the service and we aim to keep families together.â As Omicron spreads across the globe, many people face an anxious wait to see if they will be able to travel for Christmas. Lucy, from London, lives in Kenya and is hoping to travel back to the UK to see her family on Monday. Kenya is not on the red list but she's worried that could change. She's also concerned about getting her test result in the required time. She tells the BBC some testing centres in Kenya are facing a ""substantial increase"" in the number of tests they are dealing with, so ""they're worried about being able to meet those needs"". ""I haven't seen my sister in two years. I saw my parents last year but couldn't get back last Christmas because of restrictions, especially in London, with the costs and everything it wasn't worth it,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends are also coming back who have lived abroad, a lot of them got married and had babies and I feel like I've really missed out over the past two years."" Instead of being congratulated for being one of the first countries in the world to identify the Omicron variant, Botswana has been penalised for it, the countryâs President Mokgweetsi Masisi has said.Masisi told BBC World Newsâs Lucy Hockings that the travel ban had left the southern African nation's economy throttled. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the booster jab campaign needs to go faster. ""A number of weeks ago we said we should move to at least 500,000 a day. As I understand it the figures this week are lower than last week,"" he says. The opposition leader says we ""are in a race now between this booster regime and the new variant"" and the government should have acted weeks ago, adding that the programme needs to be ramped up immediately. On Sunday 290,165 booster jabs were given, taking the total number of people who have received a booster or third dose to 20,580,644. That's 35.8% of the population over 12 in the UK. Here's how to get a booster jab. There is already ""immense pressure"" on hospitals even before the impact of the new Omicron variant is fully felt, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine says. Dr Nick Scriven tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme his hospital in Yorkshire is ""as busy as I can remember it"". ""Itâs not just Covid, the Covid wards area is actually beginning
to empty a little bit at the moment,"" he says. However, he adds that Covid patients tend to be in hospital a lot longer than people with other illnesses. If hospital admissions start to increase as the Omicron variant spreads, he says wards will be more crowded and nurses ""will be run off their feet"". Care may not be so ""dignified"" and there may be delays to less urgent treatment, he adds. People are being asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households Sturgeon says it is vital to ""strengthen compliance"" with existing measures to slow the spread of Omicron. People are already advised to work from home where practical, but she says employers are now being asked to ensure this is happening. If staff were working from home at the start of the pandemic, they should be asked to do so again, she adds. This advice will be in place until the middle of January, when it will be reviewed. People are also asked to do a lateral flow test before mixing with other households. However, the first minister says she ""cannot guarantee"" further measures will not be needed. It is important to remain open to any proportionate measures, such as the extension of Covid certification, she adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"New UK Covid travel rules come into forceUK-bound travellers must take a pre-departure test, while Omicron contacts must now self-isolate.","People coming to the UK must show proof of a negative Covid test before they travel, as new rules to limit spread of the Omicron variant come into effect. Contacts of a suspected Omicron case are already required to self-isolate for 10 days, including the fully vaccinated. There are currently 336 confirmed cases of the new variant in the UK. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has confirmed Omicron is spreading in the community in multiple areas of England. He told MPs on Monday the variant was spreading ""here and around the world"" and that there were people who have tested positive for Omicron in the UK ""with no links to international travel"". People arriving in the UK already had to self-isolate until they received a negative PCR test on day two after their arrival. With the introduction of the government's new measures, all travellers aged 12 and over will have to show proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test - even if they are fully vaccinated - before setting off. It must be taken in the two days before departure for the UK and private test providers must be used - so free NHS lateral flow kits are not allowed. What are the new Covid rules for travelling to the UK? Omicron: How do you detect it? Warnings Covid travel test prices are misleading Scientists have raised concerns about how Omicron could interact with current vaccines, given the number and form of the mutations it exhibits. Of the confirmed cases of the variant, 261 were in England, 71 in Scotland and four in Wales - while Northern Ireland is yet to have a confirmed case. Travel restrictions - which slow the influx of new cases - make the biggest difference when there is little Omicron in the country. Yet scientists have warned Omicron could overtake Delta to become the dominant variant within the next few weeks as it is already spreading here. The shorter gap between catching the virus and passing it on was used as the justification for pre-departure testing. But that difference in infectiousness will also accelerate the spread of Omicron that is already here. All the restrictions can do is buy time to understand what Omicron is capable of. It could still take weeks to understand how severe the variant is and what it means for the effectiveness of vaccines. The government previously announced it was ramping up the rollout of booster vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron, as well as reintroducing the requirement for face coverings to be worn on public transport and in shops. The UK has put restrictions on travel from many countries in Africa, with Nigeria becoming the11th country added to the red list. At least 21 Omicron cases in England have been linked to travel from there. Mr Javid confirmed 10,000 vaccinators were being recruited to expand the administering of third doses because ""when the virus adapts, we must adapt too"". He said 350 military personnel would be deployed in England to help give boosters, and more than 100 in Scotland. The health secretary added he understood the UK Health Security Agency was carrying out around half a million tests a day and capacity was expanding. On Monday, 51,459 cases of Covid were reported, as well as 41 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 20.5 million booster or third doses have been delivered - 35.8% of people aged over 12 -  after a further 290,165 were given on Sunday. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

Wall Street watchdogs probe Trump media firm deal,"Donald Trump's deal to float his social media firm on the stock market is being investigated by Wall Street watchdogs. Regulators are probing Digital World Acquisition Corp, the firm set to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). According to a filing on Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested documents about its investors and trading. TMTG plans to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year. The filing states that the SEC also asked to see information detailing the relationship between Digital World and TMTG. It also said that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is probing the deal as well. The SEC told the BBC it does not comment on the ""existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation"". The BBC has contacted TMTG for comment. Trump social media firm says it has raised $1bn Steve Bannon pleads not guilty to contempt charge Rights groups condemn Trump migrant policy return The SEC was requested by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last month, to investigate the proposed merger of the two firms for potential violations of securities laws. Digital World is a so-called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or ""blank cheque company"". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections. On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured $1bn from ""a diverse group of institutional investors"" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn. The former US president is still banned from Twitter and Facebook following the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. At the time he was banned Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram, according to a presentation on his company's website.

"Coastal areas braced for Storm Barra impactA rare red alert is in place in Ireland on Tuesday, while wind and snow are expected in parts of the UK.Northern Ireland","Storm Barra is set to hit early on Tuesday, just 10 days after Storm Arwen caused havoc in parts of the UK and Ireland Coastal areas across the UK are braced for the impact of Storm Barra later, while a rare red alert has been issued in the Republic of Ireland. The highest level of Irish weather service Met Ãireann'swarning affects counties Clare, Cork and Kerry,external, and schools are to close in 12 counties. It warns of severe and damaging gusts of more than 130km/h (80mph). Disruptive wind and some snow are expected in parts of northern England and Scotland, said the Met Office. Some flights have been cancelled, driving conditions are set to be difficult and there are fears of damage to buildings, power cuts and flooding. The second named storm this season, Storm Barra comes just 10 days after Storm Arwen struck on 26 November,causing disruption and three fatalities across the UK. Met Ãireann has warned Storm Barra will likely cause coastal flooding along parts of the south and western Irish coast, while disruption to power and travel is also likely. With a status orange warning - the second-highest level - in place for Clare, Limerick and Galway, and a yellow warning for all other counties, it has urged people to take action to protect themselves and their homes.

Whistleblower describes chaos of UK Afghan exit,"The UK Foreign Office's handling of the Afghan evacuation after the Taliban seized Kabul was dysfunctional and chaotic, a whistleblower has said. Raphael Marshall said the process of choosing who could get a flight out was arbitrary and thousands of emails with pleas for help went unread. The then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions, he added. Mr Raab told the BBC lessons would be learned but the UK did a good job compared to other countries. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, the UKairlifted 15,000 people out of the country, including 5,000 British nationals, 8,000 Afghans and 2,000 children. Inwritten evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee,external, Mr Marshall said up to 150,000 Afghans who were at risk because of their links to Britain applied to be evacuated - but fewer than 5% received any assistance. ""It is clear that some of those left behind have since been murdered by the Taliban,"" he added. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office's top civil servant was repeatedly questioned by MPs about his decision to continue his holiday for 11 days after Kabul fell to the Taliban. Sir Philip Barton said he had ""reflected a lot"" on his decision, adding: ""If I had my time again I would have come back from my leave earlier than I did."" He insisted cover arrangements were in place and he had ""stayed in touch with the department all the way through the period"". But committee chairman Tom Tugendhat said he found Sir Philip's decision ""strange"" given Mr Raab had returned. PM intervened to evacuate animal charity - whistleblower How many people did the UK get out of Afghanistan? 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Ten days that shook Afghanistan Mr Raab said the two-week evacuation was ""the biggest operation in living memory"" of its kind and the UK had helped a larger number of people than any nation except the US. The former foreign secretary, who is now justice secretary, said the criticism of his decision-making was from a ""relatively junior desk officer"" but the main challenges were in verifying the identities of applicants on the ground and safely escorting them to the airport in Kabul, not in making decisions from Whitehall. This video can not be played Dominic Raab, who was replaced as foreign secretary, defends his role in the Afghanistan evacuation Other criticisms were ""rather dislocated from the operational pressures and conditions"", he said. ""I don't doubt there were challenges, I don't doubt there will be lessons to be learned but if you look at the facts, I think we did a good job by recent standards of evacuations and by international comparisons,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Mr Marshall, who was a senior desk officer at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) until he resigned in September, said there was inadequate staffing at the department's crisis centre, and staff would not normally be expected to work at weekends or overnight. Raphael Marshall, 25, was a senior desk officer at the Foreign Office and said thousands of pleas for help went unread There was also a lack of expertise and a lack of co-ordination between the department and the Ministry of Defence, he added. Mr Marshall also said Mr Raab took hours to answer emails and ""did not fully understand the situation"". And he said an instruction from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to evacuate dogs looked after by an animal charity went against Foreign Office criteria and meant people at risk of being murdered were left behind. Mr Johnson said the allegation that he intervened on this issue was ""complete nonsense"" and that the rescue operation was ""one of the outstanding military achievements of the last 50 years or more"", under ""pretty harrowing circumstances"". The key issues flagged by Foreign Office whistleblower Raphael Marshall include: Only 5% of the 150,000 people who requested help received any Nobody in the team dealing with requests had studied, had any detailed knowledge of Afghanistan, or had ever worked there No one spoke any Afghan languages, with calls to people asking for help conducted in English Decisions about who to rescue were arbitrary, and thousands of emails pleading for assistance were not even read The IT system was dysfunctional, with eight soldiers drafted in to help left sharing one computer Dominic Raab was slow to make decisions on difficult cases and did not fully understand the situation Animals from the Nowzad charity run by a former Marine were not in danger and evacuating them was at the direct expense of people at risk of death As the Taliban approached Kabul in August, there was one government scheme to evacuate those Afghans who had worked directly for the British government, and another to identify and help those who were at risk because of their broader links to the UK. Mr Marshall worked for the team of officials handling a group known as Afghan Special Cases. These included Afghan soldiers, politicians, journalists, civil servants, activists, aid workers, judges - and guards who had worked indirectly for the UK government via subcontractors. In the desperate days at the end of August as the Taliban advanced on Kabul, many of these people were emailing the FCDO to get permission for a flight out of the country. Mr Marshall said there were ""usually 5,000 unread emails in the inbox at any given moment"" and ""in thousands of cases emails were not even read"", including cases from MPs. He said the process of prioritising the applicants was ""arbitrary and dysfunctional"". The criteria used by the government were unhelpful and ambiguous, leading to confusion, he added. The decision to transport dogs from Pen Farthing's Nowzad shelter used up considerable capacity, so there was less space at the airport and fewer soldiers available to escort evacuees, Mr Marshall said. He said the UK government ended up transporting animals ""which were not at risk of harm at the direct expense of evacuating British nationals and people at risk of imminent murder, including interpreters who had served with the British Army"". Staff in the crisis centre who previously worked for the Department for International Development could not access FCDO computers because ""the DFID and FCO IT systems are not yet integrated. They were visibly appalled by our chaotic system"". Mr Marshall described how soldiers were brought in to help but many had not used the computer systems before and so mistakes were made. The computers had to be shared because FCDO IT had not issued passwords to unlock them. At one point eight soldiers shared one computer. During the evacuation there were chaotic scenes outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul Telephone calls to Afghans were made only in English, Mr Marshall said. There was no one who spoke Dari or Pashto. Mr Marshall said: ""I believe no member of the Afghan Special Cases team had studied Afghanistan, worked on Afghanistan previously, or had a detailed knowledge of Afghanistan. He added: ""One was clearly scared of being asked to make hundreds of life and death decisions about which they knew nothing."" He said: ""Most people in the FCDO crisis centre had a poor understanding of the actual situation at Kabul airport and the consequent urgency of calling people up as soon as possible."" This video can not be played Brigadier James Martin speaks about the UK's evacuation operation from Afghanistan Mr Marshall's report states the FCDO crisis centre sent notes up to Mr Raab's office to get decisions on difficult cases. But ""it took several hours for the foreign secretary to engage on any of these notes"" and when he did ""he could not decide on individual cases"" without seeing all the cases ""in a well-presented table"". Mr Marshall concluded: ""For the foreign secretary to make this request suggests he did not fully understand the situation."" He said, on another occasion, ""the foreign secretary declined to make a decision on whether to admit these people without a properly formatted submission with a table setting out multiple cases"". A source close to Mr Raab said: ""We evacuated over 500 special cases, including journalists, women's rights activists and extremely vulnerable individuals. ""The major practical challenge to evacuation was verifying identity and securing safe passage to the airport, not the speed of decision making. At all times, the team's focus was on saving lives."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy accused Mr Raab of ""complacency and indifference"" regarding the Afghan crisis, and said he ""should consider his position"". He said four months on, the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme - intended to help people who assisted the UK or who are at risk from the Taliban - is still not operational. People such as judges are ""in hiding, running for their lives"" as a result, Mr Lammy said. Chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said: ""The real question that needs answering is, where was everybody?"" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Marshall's evidence depicts a 25-year-old, at times completely on his own, dealing with a huge volume of requests for help, ""in a Foreign Office that was effectively a Mary Celeste at a time of national emergency"". Asked if it showed that the Foreign Office's work-from-home arrangements had failed, Mr Tugendhat said ""all hands needed to be on deck"" and ""whatever the working arrangements, they weren't working"". How the Taliban takeover changed my life Hours without food or water in Kabul airport 'hell' A UK government spokesperson said more than 1,000 FCDO staff worked tirelessly in challenging circumstances, and decisions on prioritisation had to be made quickly to help as many people as possible.

'The Taliban takeover changed my life',"Afghans have been sharing how their lives have changed since the Taliban takeover The Taliban's sudden sweep to power in Afghanistan has upended lives across the country. When a reporter recently asked Afghans to describe their jobs before and after, the powerful responses showed how many are dealing with radically changed circumstances. The BBC has been speaking with some of those - from office workers to activists - who wanted to share their stories. Ahmed was working as an office manager with an Afghan private company before the Taliban seized power. He had been working there since September 2019. ""It was a good time for me because I was working and supporting my sisters who were at university and school,"" he told the BBC. ""I had a good salary at that time and that was almost enough for my family too because I was saving money and sending some home for food."" ""I had many friends at work and all of them lost their jobs and became jobless,"" he added. ""But now life is more difficult for me, especially for my family, because there is no job for people here and no way of income for families."" Ahmed says life has become more difficult since the Taliban came to power Ahmed is the only son and the eldest in his family. His father, who is around 60 years old, cannot work because of his age and an issue with his knee. ""It makes me feel more responsible,"" he said, adding that the price of food is increasing daily. ""It is boring for us every day."" Zahra was studying at university just before the Taliban takeover and has not been able to resume her classes. ""The perfect period of my life was when I was a medical student,"" she said. ""I tried for two years to get my dream score in the university enrolment exam and it was worth it. It hurts because I tried a lot but I returned with empty hands."" ""Life now is not living. It is surviving and breathing without any purpose. This is not the life that I was dreaming of when I was a school student and getting ready for the university enrolment exam. ""I was in love with studying with my friends and I really miss being a student,"" she said. Zahra says most of her time now is spent at home and she misses being able to go out ""without any hesitation"". ""I'm working to improve my English and learn new things from books but unfortunately the situation is depressing. ""Maybe we will return to our studies one day,"" she added. Sana was involved in women's rights activism in Afghanistan. ""Before the Taliban came, we were deprived of many of our rights but we were happy because we had some freedom,"" she said. ""We could study, work, go out with our friends, sit together, argue and laugh."" ""We were happy to fight for our rights together..... we tried to change laws but suddenly everything changed and we moved away from our homeland."" Sana says everything 'feels like a bad dream' She is currently living in Iran and has a visa for Germany but has not yet left. ""I hope this is like a bad dream and I wake up and return home soon. It is hard for me to be away from my motherland,"" she said. ""It is hard for me to lose everything we made. I am physically alive but I miss my family and home. I miss my people, my language, the efforts we made. ""I have migrated but my soul is left in Afghanistan and it is wounded."" Sayed was working as a journalist and anchor for one of the largest media outlets in Afghanistan. ""I miss my professional life as a journalist, and all the dreams I had to progress in my professional career back home. I feel devastated to remember the moments now,"" he said. Sayed was working on the day the Taliban took control of Kabul and by that afternoon, things had already changed. ""Our office was almost empty, all female staff had left the office and our technical team had changed their clothes to that of ordinary people."" Sayed is in the US and seeking asylum as a refugee. His family remain in Afghanistan. ""The 20 years' progress and sacrifice were all shattered and everything is ruined, including my hopes and dreams in a matter of hours,"" he said. ""Everything fell apart so quickly, I still can't believe it. ""Life is tough now being away from loved ones in a totally different environment, where I can absorb the trauma, which is easier said than done.""
