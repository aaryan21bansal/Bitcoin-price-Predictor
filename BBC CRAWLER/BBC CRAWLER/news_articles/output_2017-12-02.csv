Trump says Flynn's Russia dealings lawful,"This video can not be played Trump on Russia inquiry: ""What has been shown is no collusion"" Donald Trump has responded to a guilty plea by his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying Mr Flynn's actions as a member of his transition team ""were lawful"". Mr Flynn has entered a plea deal and agreed to co-operate with an inquiry into alleged collusion with Russia. The deal, for a lesser charge than he might have faced, prompted speculation that he has incriminating evidence. The president wrote on Twitter on Saturday that he had ""nothing to hide"". Mr Flynn is co-operating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia ahead of the 2016 election. On Saturday, a day after Mr Flynn's indictment, it emerged that a veteran FBI agent had been dismissed from Mr Mueller's team after the discovery that he had sent anti-Trump text messages. Peter Strzok was removed from the investigation in summer, a spokesman for the special counsel's office, told theNew York Times,external. Saturday was a momentous day for Mr Trump, after his sweepingtax reform billfinally scraped through the senate in the early hours of the morning with 51 votes to 49. But as he left the White House hours after the vote he was quick to address Michael Flynn's admission the day before of lying to the FBI. ""What has been shown is no collusion, no collusion. There has been absolutely no collusion. So we're very happy,"" he told reporters. In denying that Mr Flynn had acted unlawfully as part of his transition team, Mr Trump appeared in his tweet to admit that he knew the former general had lied to the FBI before he fired him in February - contradicting the president's account at the time.

Analysts say if Mr Trump knew that Mr Flynn had lied to the FBI, at a time when he appeared to pressure then-FBI director James Comey to drop the agency's investigation into the former general, it could amount to obstruction of justice by the president. Matthew Miller, a former Obama administration Justice Department official, said in a tweet: ""Oh my god, he just admitted to obstruction of justice. If Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he asked Comey to let it go, then there is your case."" Sources close to the president told the Washington Post that the tweet had been drafted by Mr Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, who later apologised and said he should have been more careful with his language. The White House has yet to comment. Meanwhile,the New York Times reported,externalthat it had obtained internal emails sent by Mr Trump's transition team that disputed the White House assertion that Mr Flynn acted alone in his contacts with Russian officials. Could Trump be guilty of obstruction of justice? How Comey testimony damaged Trump In one email quoted by the paper, a senior adviser appeared to say that Russia had ""just thrown the U.S.A. election to him"", referring to Mr Trump. A White House lawyer told the paper that the adviser, KT McFarland, had meant only that the Democrats were portraying it that way. Under the terms of the plea deal with Mr Mueller, Mr Flynn admitted making false statements to the FBI, a significantly lesser charge than he might have faced for illegally dealing with Russian officials. Analysts say the deal suggests that the former general has evidence implicating one or more senior members of the Trump administration. Mr Flynn has admitted lying about his contact with the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December 2016 - after Mr Trump was elected but before he became president. This video can not be played After Flynn's guilty plea, what next for the Russia investigation? The charging documents against Mr Flynn state that he was directed to make contact with Russian officials by a ""very senior member"" of the Trump transition team. Several US news organisations report the very senior official now under the spotlight is Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law. US intelligence agencies say Russia's President Vladimir Putin directed a state effort to influence the US election in favour of Mr Trump. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied that his campaign or transition team colluded in Russian actions. Mr Flynn was questioned by the FBI shortly after Mr Trump took office in January about his December meetings with Mr Kislyak. He was forced to resign in February, 23 days into his job. According to the FBI's statement of offence signed by Mr Flynn, he discussed Russia's response to US sanctions as well as a UN Security Council resolution on Israel, at the direction of the Trump team. Under the Logan Act it is illegal for a private US citizen, as Mr Flynn was during the transition period, to conduct foreign affairs without the permission or involvement of the US government. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe The charge of making false statements normally carries up to five years in prison, but under the terms of his plea deal Mr Flynn faces a lighter sentence of only up to six months, court filings show. The administration has sought to distance itself from Mr Flynn. White House lawyer Ty Cobb said on Friday: ""Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn."" Who is Michael Flynn? Six big takeaways from Flynn's plea deal Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Michael Flynn previously served in the Obama administration before being fired. Mr Obama reportedly advised his successor not to hire the former general, but Mr Trump appointed him to one of the most senior positions in the country. Mr Flynn is not the first former Trump official to be charged. In October, Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his business associate Rick Gates were accused of conspiring to defraud the US in dealings with Ukraine (both deny the charges). Another ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, has also pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents. Six big takeaways from the Flynn deal Crowds shout at Michael Flynn at court.

Social mobility board quits in protest,"This video can not be played Mr Milburn said Brexit meant ministers were unlikely to have the energy to tackle ""one of the biggest challenges"" facing the UK All four members of the board of the government's Social Mobility Commission have stood down in protest at the lack of progress towards a ""fairer Britain"". Ex-Labour minister Alan Milburn, who chairs the commission, said he had ""little hope"" the current government could make the ""necessary"" progress. The government was too focused on Brexit to deal with the issue, he said. The government said Mr Milburn's term had come to an end and it had already decided to get some ""fresh blood"" in. The commission is charged with monitoring the government's progress in ""freeing children from poverty and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to fulfil their potential"". In hisresignation letter,externalto Theresa May, published in The Observer, Mr Milburn said he did not doubt her ""personal belief"" in social justice, but he saw ""little evidence of that being translated into meaningful action"". He said individual ministers, such as the education secretary, had shown a deep commitment to social mobility. But it had ""become obvious that the government as a whole is unable to commit the same level of support"". Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Sour grapes? Political point scoring? Neither, according to the former Labour minister and his colleagues on the board who include a former Conservative education secretary. Their frustration demonstrates the extent to which Brexit is all-consuming for the government. Leaving the EU is taking up so much time, energy and effort that there is little capacity for anything else to get done. Even on an issue which is a personal priority for the prime minister. Mr Milburn, a former health secretary, took up his role at the commission in July 2012, under the coalition government led by David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said divisions in Britain were becoming wider - pointing to the ongoing squeeze on wages. The government lacked the ""bandwidth"" to tackle social division while also dealing with Brexit, he said, describing his task as being like ""pushing water uphill"". Mr Milburn said Education Secretary Justine Greening had been a ""champion for the cause"" and had wanted him to stay in post - which Ms Greening, who also appeared on the show, would not be drawn on. ""He has done a fantastic job, but his term had come to an end and I think it was about getting some fresh blood into the commission,"" she said. She denied the government lacked the will to tackle inequality, but admitted more needed to be done. In areport published last week,external, the commission said economic, social and local divisions laid bare by the Brexit vote needed to be addressed to prevent a rise in far right or hard left extremism. It said London and its commuter belt appeared to be a ""different country"" to coastal, rural and former industrial areas, with young people there facing lower pay and fewer top jobs. The worst places to grow up poor The resignations come as Mrs May, who entered Downing Street in July 2016 promising to tackle the ""burning injustices"" that hold back poorer people, faces questions over the future of senior minister Damian Green - who is effectively her second in command - and is under pressure as Brexit talks continue. In an interview in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Milburn said: ""There has been indecision, dysfunctionality and a lack of leadership."" Theresa May pledged to ""make Britain a country that works for everyone"" when she became PM The government said it was making ""good progress"" on social mobility and focusing on disadvantaged areas. It said it had already told Mr Milburn it planned to appoint a new chair and would hold an open application process for the role. It said it was committed to fighting injustice ""and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to go as far as their talents will take them"". It highlighted its increase of the national living wage, cuts in income tax for the lowest paid and doubling of free childcare in England. The process of appointing a new chairperson and commissioners would begin as soon as possible, it added. The other board members standing down include deputy chair of the commission and Tory former education secretary Baroness Shephard. Paul Gregg, a professor of economic and social policy at the University of Bath, and David Johnston, the chief executive of the Social Mobility Foundation charity, are also leaving. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said the resignations came as ""no surprise"". ""As inequality has grown under the Tories, social mobility has totally stalled,"" he said. ""How well people do in life is still based on class background rather than on talent or effort."" Mr Milburn said he would be setting up a new social mobility institute, independent of the government.

A new model for social mobility?,"Ben Hopkins is heading for a US university On the steps of Downing Street, Theresa May pledged to promote social mobility, to make Britain a country that works for everyone. She pointed out that a white working-class boy is currently less likely than anyone else to go to university, and that the privately educated dominated the ""top professions"". Her cabinet has the highest proportion of state-educated ministers since Clement Attlee was prime minister in 1945. Justine Greening is the first education secretary to have been wholly educated at a comprehensive school. However, promising social mobility and delivering it are different things, as previous governments have learned. For decades now, the charity the Sutton Trust has been the standard-bearer for social mobility in Britain, developing schemes to help pupils from less advantaged backgrounds gain access to elite universities, and helping them into the professions. The trust's chief executive, Lee Elliot Major, said the Brexit vote underlines the need for a broader policy now, as it exposed a divided country. Many areas which voted Leave are those same areas where opportunities are fewest. Mr Elliot Major said: ""The political vote that we saw was a direct consequence of social immobility."" One of the Sutton Trust's newest schemes, in partnership with the Fulbright Commission, helps teenagers to apply to American universities and win scholarships to pay the fees. It is very competitive. There are 10 applicants for every place. Just 61 British students are going to the US on the scheme this year. Ben Hopkins, aged 18, from the village of Wheaton Aston in Staffordshire, will soon be heading for Bowdoin in Maine, where he has won a scholarship. It is one of the most highly rated liberal arts colleges in the US, with fees of $62,000 (Â£48,000) a year. Ben Hopkins worried whether he would fit in at Oxford Ben does not come from a privileged background. His father is a machinist, his mother a teaching assistant. Neither went to university. The family live in a modest, though immaculate, home, on the outskirts of the village. South Staffordshire is one of the more affluent parts of the Midlands, with a lower rate of unemployment than the national average. It is a Conservative area. Nearly 65% voted Leave on 23 June. Those I spoke to cited fears over immigration. Ben's mother, Tracy, told me he had always been very committed to his schoolwork, and he perseveres until he gets something right: ""He's a perfectionist."" She said she wasn't a ""tiger mother"". Ben had always set his own pace. Both parents are very supportive of their son and proud of his achievement. Ben told me his teachers had helped him greatly. Some gave up their own free time to give him extra lessons. He was a pupil at the local comprehensive, Wolgarston High, in the nearby market town of Penkridge. It is rated ""good"" by Ofsted, and improving. It currently gets some of the best A-level results in South Staffordshire. Every year, some pupils go to Russell Group universities, and sometimes students go to Oxford or Cambridge. However, Ben told me that when he visited Oxford he wondered whether he would fit in, as so many students seemed to have gone to private school. Headteacher Philip Tapp says there is very little in the local area to inspire and raise aspirations Adam Simmonds, head of sixth form at Wolgarston High, said others occasionally felt the same, as there is a strong sense of community in this part of South Staffordshire, and some 18-year-olds do not want to leave. ""Sometimes it's a powerful draw, their experiences in this locality, and they don't want to give that up to go to, well any university, actually,"" he said. ""We've had students with three As at A-level who've decided to stay at home because they like staying at home."" Though Stafford is just over an hour from London by train, Ben had only visited the capital once before he went for the Sutton Trust assessment. The school headteacher, Philip Tapp, said he was working to arrange more trips for all students. He said there was very little in the local area to inspire and raise aspirations. So what made Ben such an exception? His family, his teachers and ultimately, himself. No-one told him about the Sutton Trust: he discovered it online. Adam Simmonds described Ben, outgoing head boy, as an ""elder statesman"" of the school whom everyone respected and felt they could talk to. Lee Elliot Major, chief executive of the Sutton Trust, urged the new government to consider how to extend social mobility to help more people. He said; ""We can pick talent and then catapult it into opportunity, as with our US programme where you have amazing young people who are going to the Ivy League and other leading universities. ""But what about those areas that are left behind? What about the children who don't go on those programmes? And I think no-one at the moment has got the answer to that."" The new government is considering reversing the ban on new grammar schools, as a way of promoting social mobility. But that's controversial - many argue it will not work. David Skelton, of the conservative think tank Renewal, said he thought a more sophisticated and complex approach was needed now. He said: ""1950s England should not be our model."" He suggested more streaming in schools could be effective, and he endorsed the comments of the new minister for skills, Robert Halfon, who has said apprenticeships should be more highly valued and more could be done to improve vocational and technical training, such as that provided by university technical colleges.

"Egyptian lawyer guilty of inciting rapeNabih al-Wahsh said it was a ""national duty"" to rape and harass women who wear ripped jeans.6h6 hours agoMiddle East","Nabih al-Wahsh has previously denied the Holocaust An Egyptian lawyer has been sentenced to three years in prison for saying that women who wear ripped jeans should be raped in punishment. Nabih al-Wahsh, a prominent conservative, was also fined 20,000 Egyptian pounds (Â£839; $1,130). The lawyer made the remarks on a TV panel show in October, during a debate on a draft law on prostitution. ""Are you happy when you see a girl walking down the street with half of her behind showing?"" he said. He added: ""I say that when a girl walks about like that, it is a patriotic duty to sexually harass her and a national duty to rape her."" Mr Wahsh said that women who wore revealing clothing were ""inviting men to harass them"", and said ""protecting morals is more important than protecting borders"". The prosecutor brought charges against Mr Wahsh after a public outcry. The National Council for Women's Rights condemned the remarks, saying they were a ""flagrant call"" for rape, in violation of ""everything in the Egyptian constitution"". The council has now filed a complaint about the statement to the Supreme Council for Media Regulation about the broadcast which aired on 19 October. Mr Wahsh has previously called the Holocaust ""imaginary"" and declared himself a proud anti-Semite. ""If I see any Israeli, I will kill him,"" he said during a separate TV panel show. In October last year, Mr Wahsh was involved in a TV studio brawl with a cleric, after the cleric suggested women should not necessarily have to wear a headscarf.

Chief vet defends larger hen cages,"Battery cages for chickens were banned in the EU in 2012 Some cages for hens provide a ""necessary defence"" against bird flu, the government's chief vet has said. In a tweet, Nigel Gibbens said the larger pens, which replaced so-called battery cages in 2012, have welfare benefits and offer more space. It comes after 10 leading British vets, who believe caging hens is unethical, said his ""brazen endorsement"" was ""extremely disappointing"". They said the restricted space was ""seriously detrimental to welfare"". Battery cages for chickens were banned in the EU in 2012. The ruling said that if laying hens were to be held they must be in enriched - also known as colony - cages instead. The enriched cages provided extra space to nest, scratch and roost and the guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), is that each bird in an enriched cage must have at least 750 square centimetres of space. The minimum for battery cages was 550 square centimetres. Despite the banning of battery cages, a number of leading retailers have announced that they are moving towards selling free-range eggs only. But at the Egg and Poultry Industry Conference in October, Mr Gibbens called this a ""regrettable move"" and said cages ""have a lot going for them"".

""Hens in cages cannot carry out fundamental species-specific behaviours"", they added. The group dismissed his claims about protection against bird flu saying there are other options to manage the threat and urged the chief vet to take a ""more progressive position"". Mr Gibbens laterdefended his view on Twitter,externaland said: ""Free range risks disease that is really bad for welfare."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police criticised over Green porn claims,"This video can not be played Damian Green speaking to reporters outside his home in his constituency of Ashford Ex-detectives who disclosed that legal pornography was found on Damian Green's office computer are in ""dangerous territory"", a former police chief says. Sir Peter Fahy, ex-chief constable of Greater Manchester, said it was vital police were ""not involved in politics"". And a watchdog warned that serving officers could be sacked or prosecuted for leaking confidential information. First Secretary of State Mr Green denies watching or downloading pornography on his computer. The allegations were first made last month by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, who led a 2008 inquiry into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched. Mr Quickmade his claims,externalafter the Cabinet Office launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". Davis 'warns No 10 not to sack Green' 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer And then on Friday, retired Met detective Neil Lewis said ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's parliamentary computer in 2008. Despite being told about Mr Lewis's role examining Mr Green's computers, the Cabinet Office inquiry has not contacted him to give evidence. Sir Peter, Greater Manchester's chief constable for seven years, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the former officers had a duty to protect confidential information uncovered during an investigation. He said: ""It is very dangerous territory for a police officer to be making judgements about whether a politician is lying or not. ""That should only happen in a criminal investigation, and even then, ultimately it is for a court to decide."" Peter Fahy, a former chief constable, said police had a duty to protect confidential information Scotland Yard's department for professional standards is examining allegations that Mr Lewis had disclosed confidential information. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said the police's special powers were inseparable from ""obligations of special trust"". This trust required every officer ""to respect and keep confidential information which they obtain in the course of their duties, and which is irrelevant to their inquiries and discloses no criminal conduct"", he said. Mr Grieve accused the two former officers of ""freelancing"" ""If a police officer broke that trust whilst serving as a police officer, he or she would face disciplinary action and could be dismissed. ""In certain circumstances, such action could also constitute a criminal offence."" The obligation was enduring and ""does not end"" when a police officer retires, he said. According to the College of Policing'sCode of Ethics,external, which applies to forces in England and Wales, police agree to disclose information ""only in the proper course of my duties"". Tory MPs, including Brexit Secretary David Davis, have backed Mr Green - effectively Theresa May's second-in-command - saying it was wrong for such claims to emerge through the media. On Friday, sources close to David Davis told the BBC the Brexit Secretary had warned Downing Street not to sack Mr Green as a result of a ""wrongful attempt by former officers to do him down"". One said Mr Davis might be willing to resign over the issue, although another stressed no threat had been made. This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC ""It's right that allegations of misconduct towards individuals are properly investigated,"" said an associate of Mr Davis. ""But police officers have a duty of confidentiality which should be upheld"". Ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the two ex-police officer's actions were ""very worrying"" and smacked of the ""police state"". Mr Grieve, attorney general in David Cameron's government between 2010 and 2014,  described the decision by the officers to release the information from a police investigation dating back to 2008 as a ""flagrant breach"" of their code of conduct. ""Eight years later they choose to put material that an ordinary citizen would be prohibited from acquiring under data protection rules into the public domain on their own judgement,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""I find it very worrying. ""If you think something is relevant, you do it by proper official means. ""You do not go freelancing as these two officers have done... ""We give the police powers that other people do not have. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers."" However, former Gloucestershire chief constable Tim Brain said that the information was in the public interest. He told Newsnight that the officers had come forward with what they considered ""relevant information"" to an ongoing inquiry. Mr Brain said: ""Let's just think about this as a workplace computer and to think whether we are happy that people, our MPs, can have this kind of material on what is an official computer."" The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Other MPs to criticise the action of the former officers included the chairman of the Commons culture committee, Damian Collins. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the Cabinet Office ""should receive and see any evidence"" that's pertinent to its investigation. The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said ""police are not above the law"" and their actions had been ""totally wrong"". Speaking to reporters at his Kent home on Friday, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along and I still maintain - it is the truth - that I did not download or look at pornography on my computer, but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that.""

Legal action considered on universal credit,"The children's commissioner told BBC Scotland he cannot rule out legal action on the issue Scotland's children's commissioner has said he may consider legal action over the Universal Credit rollout if it further disadvantages young people. Bruce Adamson said poverty was the biggest human rights issue facing children in Scotland. He told the BBC reforms to the benefits systems could be resulting in some children going without basics like a warm home and hot meals. The UK government said Universal Credit was helping people improve their lives. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the system was ""working"" and that as a result of Universal Credit people were ""moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system"". What do Universal Credit reforms mean? Call to fix 'flaws' in Universal Credit What is universal credit? The controversial measure, which is being rolled out across the UK, brings six existing benefit payments into one. It faced criticism over claims some people had to wait six weeks for their first payment, contributing to a rise in debt, rent arrears and evictions. Chancellor Philip Hammond announced changes aimed at speeding up claim times in his autumn budget last month. Mr Adamson said he was engaging with ministers, from the both the UK and Scottish governments, about the impact the benefit changes were having on the human rights of children and young people. He called for ""political leadership"" on the issue, but said he could not rule of the possibility of legal action in the future. In an extended interview broadcast onBBC Radio Scotland on Sunday, the children's commissioner said: ""Poverty is the biggest human rights issue facing children in Scotland at the moment. ""And there's a number of issues around the way in which Universal Credit is calculated and how it is paid. But this leads to a much, much deeper issue. We are talking about the rights of children and the right to benefit from social security. ""We are talking about things like having a warm and secure place to live, having regular hot, nutritious meals and also the ability to access things like transport to get to school and to enjoy social and cultural activities that we know are so important to their development."" Asked if there was any prospect of legal redress in Scotland, Mr Adamson said: ""While we don't have the Convention on the Rights of the Child within our domestic law yet, we do have the Humans Rights Act which brings in the European Convention on Human Rights and the courts look very closely if a state falls below that minimum standard required, where the state fails to provide those basics of life. ""So certainly if children in Scotland aren't getting those basic things then legal action may be the way to take this forward. But it's not the best way."" He added: ""We really need political leadership here and we need to make sure that we are never in a situation where children are going without the basics that they need."" The Unite union organised a day of action on Universal Credit on Saturday, with demonstrations held around Scotland The DWP spokesman said no-one who needed support had to wait six weeks. He added: ""In December, claimants can request an advance of up to 50% of their first payment and a further 50% in January if they need it, repayable over 12 months. ""Universal Credit lies at the heart of our commitment to help people improve their lives and raise their incomes. It provides additional, tailored support to help people move into work and stop claiming benefits altogether."" Speaking on the BBC'sSunday Politics Scotland programme,Brexit Minister Mike Russell said he thought the Scottish government would be ""very sympathetic"" to potential legal action against Universal Credit if it infringed the human rights of children. He said: ""The approach of the UK government on social security and welfare is truly appalling. It is impoverishing people. It is leading to despair. ""I think anybody who is standing up against that and arguing for a practical resolution, to what are awful, ideological problems being brought by the Tories, I think deserves all the support he can get."" On Saturday, a day of action, organised by the Unite union, saw demonstrations staged at various locations around Scotland protesting against changes to the benefits system.

Egyptian lawyer guilty of inciting rape,"Nabih al-Wahsh has previously denied the Holocaust An Egyptian lawyer has been sentenced to three years in prison for saying that women who wear ripped jeans should be raped in punishment. Nabih al-Wahsh, a prominent conservative, was also fined 20,000 Egyptian pounds (Â£839; $1,130). The lawyer made the remarks on a TV panel show in October, during a debate on a draft law on prostitution. ""Are you happy when you see a girl walking down the street with half of her behind showing?"" he said. He added: ""I say that when a girl walks about like that, it is a patriotic duty to sexually harass her and a national duty to rape her."" Mr Wahsh said that women who wore revealing clothing were ""inviting men to harass them"", and said ""protecting morals is more important than protecting borders"". The prosecutor brought charges against Mr Wahsh after a public outcry. The National Council for Women's Rights condemned the remarks, saying they were a ""flagrant call"" for rape, in violation of ""everything in the Egyptian constitution"". The council has now filed a complaint about the statement to the Supreme Council for Media Regulation about the broadcast which aired on 19 October. Mr Wahsh has previously called the Holocaust ""imaginary"" and declared himself a proud anti-Semite. ""If I see any Israeli, I will kill him,"" he said during a separate TV panel show. In October last year, Mr Wahsh was involved in a TV studio brawl with a cleric, after the cleric suggested women should not necessarily have to wear a headscarf.

Barclays axes Kaspersky anti-virus perk,"Barclays has stopped offering free Kaspersky anti-virus products to new customers following an official warning about Russian security software. The bank emailed 290,000 online banking customers on Saturday to say the move was a ""precautionary decision"". UK cyber-security chiefs arewarning government departments not to use software from Russian companiesfor systems relating to national security. Barclays said it treated the security of its customers ""very seriously"". A spokesman for Kaspersky said it was ""disappointed"" that Barclays had discontinued its offer to new customers. The National Cyber Security Centre - the UK's authority on cyber security and part of GCHQ - is writing to all government departments telling them Russian security software could be exploited by the Kremlin. But officials stressed they were not saying members of the public or companies should stop using Kaspersky products, which are used by about 400 million people globally. Barclays told customers it would no longer offer free Kaspersky software ""following the information that's been shared in the news"" - but advised people with the software already installed that they did not need to take any action. It wrote: ""The UK government has been advised... to remove any Russian products from all highly sensitive systems classified as secret or above. ""We've made the precautionary decision to no longer offer Kaspersky software to new users. ""However, there's nothing to suggest that customers need to stop using Kaspersky."" It went on: ""At this stage there is no action for you to take. It's important that you continue to protect yourself with anti-virus software."" The 290,000 people who received emails from Barclays are all online banking customers, who had downloaded Kaspersky in the past decade as part of a 12-month free trial offered by the bank. Many of these customers, who could include individuals employed by the government, could have ended their subscription once the free trial ended. Ian Levy, the NCSC's technical director, said there was no evidence the guidance to government departments should apply to the wider public. ""For example, we really don't want people doing things likeripping out Kaspersky software at large,externalas it makes little sense,"" he said. A spokesman for Barclays said: ""Even though this new guidance isn't directed at members of the public, we have taken the decision to withdraw the offer of Kaspersky software from our customer website.""

Far-right meeting sparks Germany protests,"Five demonstrations were planned to coincide with the AfD convention on Saturday in Hanover, said reports Several people have been hurt in clashes between police and anti-fascist demonstrators in the city of Hannover. Protesters were trying to blockade the far-right Alternative for Germany's first conference since it entered parliament after September's elections. Once the delayed conference began, delegates elected Alexander Gauland as co-leader along with JÃ¶rg Meuthen. Both hardliners, their election suggests the party is continuing its march further to the right. Georg Pazderski, the party's regional head in Berlin and a relative moderate, failed to get delegates' backing for the leadership. AfD won 12.6% of the vote in Germany's federal elections in September, becoming the third biggest force in the Bundestag after the centre-right and social democrat SPD. They had never entered the federal parliament before but are now eyeing a real chance of becoming Germany's main opposition party. If Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat alliance agrees a coalition deal with Martin Schulz's social democrats, AfD with 94 MPs would become the biggest non-government party. Just how far to the right is AfD? 'We are the 87%', say AfD opponents Why so many voters in the east chose AfD Angela Merkel's hollow victory German election: Why this is a turning point With temperatures near freezing, Hanover police used water cannon, batons and pepper spray to clear a path for the 600 delegates. One demonstrator's leg was broken after he chained himself to a barricade, while an officer was hit on the hand by a flying bottle. Ten protesters were taken into custody. A total of five demonstrations were scheduled in the northern city on Saturday. Some 6,000 people joined a pro-immigration rally in the city centre and another rally called by trade unions was expected to draw thousands later. When the conference got under way an hour late, Mr Meuthen hailed delegates for helping the party achieve national success within five years of being founded. He said the party was attracting support from voters put off by the other parties' ""pathetic childish games"" amid an ongoing struggle to form a coalition government. The party has veered to the right since its inception as an anti-euro force, promoting anti-immigration and anti-Islam policies in its election campaign. But this sharp turn has created tension within its own ranks, with former co-leader Frauke Petry quitting within days of the election. The delegates on Saturday confirmed the AfD's rightward trajectory, backing Mr Gauland, the leader of the parliamentary party, for the co-leadership. Mr Gauland, who has pledged to stop ""the invasion of foreigners"" into Germany, said he had ""allowed my friends to convince me to step in"". This video can not be played Post-war politics of Germany: A history of division and unity Delegates defeated a motion to install Mr Meuthen as the AfD's only president, They are also due to elect a new executive board to decide the ideological direction of the party and debate policy motions.

The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Other MPs to criticise the action of the former officers included the chairman of the Commons culture committee, Damian Collins. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the Cabinet Office ""should receive and see any evidence"" that's pertinent to its investigation. The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said ""police are not above the law"" and their actions had been ""totally wrong"". Speaking to reporters at his Kent home on Friday, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along and I still maintain - it is the truth - that I did not download or look at pornography on my computer, but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that.""

The strange animal jargon spoken by business people," Alligator Spread:When an investor will never be able to make a profit on the transactions they make. This is because the charges involved are higher than the profit made.The spread refers to the difference between the highest and lowest assets. The spread ""eats the investor"", leading to the name Alligator Spread. Bear Market:A bear market occurs when a stock market enters a long-term decline (so more than two months). If you have a fall of 20%, then you enter a bear market. Bull Market:A bull market is the opposite - it's when the price of shares on the stock market is rising. Bull or Bear? An easy way to remember the difference is to think of how the animals attack - a bull thrusts its horns upwards while a bear swats down with its big paws. Cash Cow:An item that keeps providing a constant cash flow with very little maintenance. Once the initial capital outlay has been paid off, the cash cow generates funds which can be used elsewhere.After all, a cow produces milk for many years - so the supply is often considered a guaranteed income. Examples include Cornflakes, Coca Cola and Ford Transit vans. Dragon Bonds:These bonds, which are issued by Asian nations, are denominated in US dollars. They are used to attract foreign investment and are considered stable investments.They were introduced by the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and are commonly used in China.

Legal action considered on benefit changes,"The children's commissioner told BBC Scotland he cannot rule out legal action on the issue Scotland's children's commissioner has said he may consider legal action over the Universal Credit rollout if it further disadvantages young people. Bruce Adamson said poverty was the biggest human rights issue facing children in Scotland. He told the BBC reforms to the benefits systems could be resulting in some children going without basics like a warm home and hot meals. The UK government said Universal Credit was helping people improve their lives. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the system was ""working"" and that as a result of Universal Credit people were ""moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system"". What do Universal Credit reforms mean? Call to fix 'flaws' in Universal Credit What is universal credit? The controversial measure, which is being rolled out across the UK, brings six existing benefit payments into one. It faced criticism over claims some people had to wait six weeks for their first payment, contributing to a rise in debt, rent arrears and evictions. Chancellor Philip Hammond announced changes aimed at speeding up claim times in his autumn budget last month. Mr Adamson said he was engaging with ministers, from the both the UK and Scottish governments, about the impact the benefit changes were having on the human rights of children and young people. He called for ""political leadership"" on the issue, but said he could not rule of the possibility of legal action in the future. In an extended interview broadcast onBBC Radio Scotland on Sunday, the children's commissioner said: ""Poverty is the biggest human rights issue facing children in Scotland at the moment. ""And there's a number of issues around the way in which Universal Credit is calculated and how it is paid. But this leads to a much, much deeper issue. We are talking about the rights of children and the right to benefit from social security. ""We are talking about things like having a warm and secure place to live, having regular hot, nutritious meals and also the ability to access things like transport to get to school and to enjoy social and cultural activities that we know are so important to their development."" Asked if there was any prospect of legal redress in Scotland, Mr Adamson said: ""While we don't have the Convention on the Rights of the Child within our domestic law yet, we do have the Humans Rights Act which brings in the European Convention on Human Rights and the courts look very closely if a state falls below that minimum standard required, where the state fails to provide those basics of life. ""So certainly if children in Scotland aren't getting those basic things then legal action may be the way to take this forward. But it's not the best way."" He added: ""We really need political leadership here and we need to make sure that we are never in a situation where children are going without the basics that they need."" The Unite union organised a day of action on Universal Credit on Saturday, with demonstrations held around Scotland The DWP spokesman said no-one who needed support had to wait six weeks. He added: ""In December, claimants can request an advance of up to 50% of their first payment and a further 50% in January if they need it, repayable over 12 months. ""Universal Credit lies at the heart of our commitment to help people improve their lives and raise their incomes. It provides additional, tailored support to help people move into work and stop claiming benefits altogether."" Speaking on the BBC'sSunday Politics Scotland programme,Brexit Minister Mike Russell said he thought the Scottish government would be ""very sympathetic"" to potential legal action against Universal Credit if it infringed the human rights of children. He said: ""The approach of the UK government on social security and welfare is truly appalling. It is impoverishing people. It is leading to despair. ""I think anybody who is standing up against that and arguing for a practical resolution, to what are awful, ideological problems being brought by the Tories, I think deserves all the support he can get."" On Saturday, a day of action, organised by the Unite union, saw demonstrations staged at various locations around Scotland protesting against changes to the benefits system.

"Chief vet defends larger hen cagesOn Twitter, Nigel Gibbens says the pens are a ""necessary defence"" against bird flu.4h4 hours agoUK","Battery cages for chickens were banned in the EU in 2012 Some cages for hens provide a ""necessary defence"" against bird flu, the government's chief vet has said. In a tweet, Nigel Gibbens said the larger pens, which replaced so-called battery cages in 2012, have welfare benefits and offer more space. It comes after 10 leading British vets, who believe caging hens is unethical, said his ""brazen endorsement"" was ""extremely disappointing"". They said the restricted space was ""seriously detrimental to welfare"". Battery cages for chickens were banned in the EU in 2012. The ruling said that if laying hens were to be held they must be in enriched - also known as colony - cages instead. The enriched cages provided extra space to nest, scratch and roost and the guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), is that each bird in an enriched cage must have at least 750 square centimetres of space. The minimum for battery cages was 550 square centimetres. Despite the banning of battery cages, a number of leading retailers have announced that they are moving towards selling free-range eggs only. But at the Egg and Poultry Industry Conference in October, Mr Gibbens called this a ""regrettable move"" and said cages ""have a lot going for them"".

Trump victory as Senate backs tax overhaul,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""It's the largest tax decrease in the history of our country by far"" US senators have passed a sweeping tax cuts bill, paving the way for Donald Trump's first big legislative victory. The package would mark the biggest tax overhaul since the 1980s. It was passed by 51 votes to 49, after a series of amendments in a marathon session. Democrats complained it only benefited the wealthy and big business. The plan sees a sharp cut in corporation tax, but a Senate committee finding has warned it would add $1tn (Â£742bn) to the budget deficit. President Trump wants the measures enacted by the end of the year and he congratulated Republicans for taking the US ""one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families"". The Senate will now have to merge its legislation with that passed last month by the House of Representatives, before it can be signed into law by the president. Reality Check: Will tax plan hurt Trump? Does the US debt of $20tn matter? How does US tax plan compare to other countries? On Saturday, a triumphant Mr Trump told supporters at a New York fundraiser: ""So last night we passed in the history of the country, the largest tax cuts and reform... what we're doing is, if you look at it, we're going to grow the country, we're going to grow jobs. We're going to be growing everything."" Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell overcame a pocket of Republican resistance to get the bill through The move is as a major victory for Mr Trump, who since taking office has struggled to get major legislative movement in Congress - including fulfilling his vow to repeal and replace Obamacare. His presidency has also been dogged by an independent investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 US election and possible collusion with his campaign team.On Friday, ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn became the Trump administration's most senior member to be charged in the investigation. This video can not be played Trump on Russia inquiry: ""What has been shown is no collusion"" Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The US Senate, a seemingly insurmountable roadblock for the Republican agenda for much of this year, has at last given its assent to a major piece of legislation. Perhaps unsurprisingly it was sweeping tax cuts - always beloved by conservatives - that finally brought the party together and gave President Donald Trump the opportunity to claim a landmark legislative achievement. It wasn't always pretty. Senate negotiators were handwriting amendments to the massive bill practically up until the final votes were taken. Deals within deals were cut to satisfy recalcitrant legislators. Democrats howled at the permanent cuts provided to corporations, while middle-class taxpayer benefits had sunset clauses. In the end, however, a combination of hope and fear were enough to drag a slim majority into the yes column. The hope is that a booming economy will give Republicans a chance to run on their tax policy when they stand before voters next November. The fear was that yet another failure would have led to a revolt among the party's big donors and traditional business constituencies. The House and Senate must now smooth out differences in their bills and vote on the compromise. It's not the end of the race, but the finish line is in sight. Presiding over the Senate, Vice-President Mike Pence declared the 51-49 victory to applause from Republicans in the early hours of Saturday morning. The final draft of the bill went through several changes in order to bring reluctant Republicans on board. Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the Senate. Random tax provisions you may have missed Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the corporate tax rate would be permanently lowered from 35% to 20%, while future foreign profits of US-based firms would be mainly exempt from tax. President Trump said the new code would be so simple that taxes could be filed on a postcard The measures were passed despite the non-partisan Senate Joint Committee on Taxation warning on Thursday that the bill would add significantly to the federal deficit over a decade. The committee's findings contradicted a White House claim that economic growth would compensate for the tax cuts. Most Americans across all income levels would see modest tax breaks until 2026 and the committee said after that families earning under $75,000 a year would likely face higher taxes. Some opponents highlighted a measure that would end a requirement introduced under Obamacare for most taxpayers to buy health insurance or face a fine. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, scrapping the mandate would push up insurance premiums and lead to 13 million people losing cover by 2027. There were some last minute changes, including a $10,000 property tax deduction as requested by Senator Susan Collins, one of the Republicans who had been reluctant to back the bill. After the vote, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his opponents would pay the price at the ballot box in mid-term elections next year. ""My Republican friends will ultimately pay consequences for this bill in 2018 and beyond. The Republican party will never again be the party of tax cuts for middle-class people,"" he warned. He said the measures would endanger social security and medical provision. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders was among the most vocal critics, declaring during the debate that the American treasury was ""being looted"". Bernie Sanders said the bill would benefit the wealthiest people and largest corporations But Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who succeeded in bringing dissenting party members into line, said the legislation would prove to be ""just what the country needs to get growing again"". He brushed aside complaints that it was pushed through without proper scrutiny, saying: ""Everybody had plenty of opportunity to see the measure. You complain about process when you're losing and that's what you heard on the floor tonight."" Republican Senator Bill Cassidy also praised the bill, saying ""working families and middle-income families across the nation will be better off"". Allow Twitter content?

Democrats were angry about the last-minute revisions, complaining that they had not been given enough time to digest the nearly 500-page document, with handwritten changes to the legislation. The only Republican senator who refused to back the legislation was Bob Corker. ""I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that... could deepen the debt burden on future generations,"" he said.

Will tax plan hurt Trump?,"The claim:US President Donald Trump will not benefit from a Republican tax plan that has been passed by the US senate - and he might even have to pay more. Reality Check verdict:It is difficult to see how the president would have to pay more under the proposed tax plan. Mr Trump has pushed hard for the tax cuts, saying it is a ""once-in-a-generation chance"" for the nation. At the same time, he has said that for him - personally - the new tax plan is not good news. ""This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me,"" he told his supporters in St Charles, Missouri, on Wednesday. ""Believe me, this is not good for me."" Allow Twitter content?

He is the first president in more than four decades not to publicly release his tax returns while running for office. But from what we know about the structure of his businesses, Mr Trump actually stands to benefit from his party's tax plan. Daniel Shaviro, a taxation professor at NYU's Law School, points to aspects of the Senate tax bill that would help the president. First, there are changes in the estate tax and lowering the so-called ""pass-through"" rates on businesses. The ""pass-through"" tax rates affect income derived from partnerships and companies that are known as limited liability. The president owns hundreds of these kinds of businesses and would benefit from a redesign of this tax code. The repeal of the alternative minimum tax would also be hugely beneficial to Mr Trump, say analysts. In the end, said Mr Shaviro, the president would find himself in a dramatically different situation, one that many other US taxpayers would envy. Mr Shaviro said the president would come out better than many people in the US. ""A 28-year-old associate with a New York City law firm will pay taxes at a higher rate than he will,"" said Mr Shaviro. One area where Mr Trump could find himself out of pocket is the Republican proposal to eliminate a federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes. But it may be a small price for him to pay in light of the other goodies in the tax plan.

Does $20tn US debt matter?,"US debt is soaring. Does it matter? Republicans are planning to pass a massive tax cut, despite their own avowed fiscal conservatism and warnings the legislation could increase the federal deficit by at least $1tn. US national debt passed $20tn earlier this year, so could the imprudence of lapsed budget hawks clip the wings of the American economic eagle? More than half the 2016 budget was spent on retirement and healthcare programmes. As the US population ages, that's expected to grow. The debt itself is fuelling thefastest-growing spending item,external: the Congressional Budget Office expects annual net interest payments, which totalled about $240bn in 2016, to hit $770bn in 2027. The US ran an average budget deficit of 2.8% of GDP between 1967 and 2016. But that increased in recent years, spurred by the Great Recession a decade ago, when tax revenue dried up and the government increased its spending to try to spur a rebound. Historically US debt has tended to spike during wars and economic crisis. Total debt, including obligations to programmes such as Social Security, more than doubled between 2000-10, when it exceeded $12tn. It represented 128% of GDP last year,according to the OECD,external. That was lower than Portugal (146%) and Greece (185%) similar to the UK (123%), but more than double Denmark (53%) and Sweden (60%). Economists argue that high levels of public spending crowd out private investment, eventually hurting growth. A high debt load could also constrain the options of the US the next time it needs to borrow. In recent years, concern about the debt has subsided, since borrowing costs have been unusually low. The US has been ""spoiled"" by low interest rates ""We've been kind of spoiled by low interest rates,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management. But he warns that if government interest rates rise it ""would potentially impact future social programmes"". Analysts say the US has the capacity to sustain high borrowing levels. But there are concerns about the medium-term debt, says Charles Seville, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, which gives the US its top credit grade of AAA. ""Unlike most other very highly rated countries the debt is increasing,"" he said. Foreign investors - including governments - owned $6.25tn, or more than a quarter of total US debtat the end of July,external. Chinese investors were the largest foreign holders of US debt at $1.1tn, followed closely by investors from Japan. The increasing role of foreign investors is a shift from earlier decades, when most US debt was owed domestically. Chinese investors were the largest foreign holders of US debt at $1.1tr, followed closely by investors from Japan. About 70% of the foreign holders were governments in 2016. If foreign demand suddenly changed, the US would be vulnerable, said Karen Dynan, a Harvard economist who served in the US Treasury Department under the Obama administration. ""Anything that could produce a sharp swing in that demand could have the potential to raise rates on our debt in a way that would make our fiscal position worse,"" she said. Higher interest rates for the government would hit the private sector, raising costs for borrowing. It could also have geo-political repercussions. The UK faced a somewhat similar dynamic in 1956, during the Suez Crisis, when it wanted to take military action after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Co. At the time sterling was under pressure, but the US refused to provide help unless the UK ceased the military action. However, the mighty US dollar remains the linchpin of the global economic system for now. Economists say the US need not ever pay its debts back entirely, so long as the economy keeps growing enough to cover the payments. But because of the risks, they point out, it's prudent to reduce the current load.

"Police criticised over Green porn claimsFormer chief constable says ex-officers are in ""dangerous territory"" by disclosing porn allegations.6h6 hours agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Damian Green speaking to reporters outside his home in his constituency of Ashford Ex-detectives who disclosed that legal pornography was found on Damian Green's office computer are in ""dangerous territory"", a former police chief says. Sir Peter Fahy, ex-chief constable of Greater Manchester, said it was vital police were ""not involved in politics"". And a watchdog warned that serving officers could be sacked or prosecuted for leaking confidential information. First Secretary of State Mr Green denies watching or downloading pornography on his computer. The allegations were first made last month by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, who led a 2008 inquiry into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched. Mr Quickmade his claims,externalafter the Cabinet Office launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". Davis 'warns No 10 not to sack Green' 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer And then on Friday, retired Met detective Neil Lewis said ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's parliamentary computer in 2008. Despite being told about Mr Lewis's role examining Mr Green's computers, the Cabinet Office inquiry has not contacted him to give evidence. Sir Peter, Greater Manchester's chief constable for seven years, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the former officers had a duty to protect confidential information uncovered during an investigation. He said: ""It is very dangerous territory for a police officer to be making judgements about whether a politician is lying or not. ""That should only happen in a criminal investigation, and even then, ultimately it is for a court to decide."" Peter Fahy, a former chief constable, said police had a duty to protect confidential information Scotland Yard's department for professional standards is examining allegations that Mr Lewis had disclosed confidential information. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said the police's special powers were inseparable from ""obligations of special trust"". This trust required every officer ""to respect and keep confidential information which they obtain in the course of their duties, and which is irrelevant to their inquiries and discloses no criminal conduct"", he said. Mr Grieve accused the two former officers of ""freelancing"" ""If a police officer broke that trust whilst serving as a police officer, he or she would face disciplinary action and could be dismissed. ""In certain circumstances, such action could also constitute a criminal offence."" The obligation was enduring and ""does not end"" when a police officer retires, he said. According to the College of Policing'sCode of Ethics,external, which applies to forces in England and Wales, police agree to disclose information ""only in the proper course of my duties"". Tory MPs, including Brexit Secretary David Davis, have backed Mr Green - effectively Theresa May's second-in-command - saying it was wrong for such claims to emerge through the media. On Friday, sources close to David Davis told the BBC the Brexit Secretary had warned Downing Street not to sack Mr Green as a result of a ""wrongful attempt by former officers to do him down"". One said Mr Davis might be willing to resign over the issue, although another stressed no threat had been made. This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC ""It's right that allegations of misconduct towards individuals are properly investigated,"" said an associate of Mr Davis. ""But police officers have a duty of confidentiality which should be upheld"". Ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the two ex-police officer's actions were ""very worrying"" and smacked of the ""police state"". Mr Grieve, attorney general in David Cameron's government between 2010 and 2014,  described the decision by the officers to release the information from a police investigation dating back to 2008 as a ""flagrant breach"" of their code of conduct. ""Eight years later they choose to put material that an ordinary citizen would be prohibited from acquiring under data protection rules into the public domain on their own judgement,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""I find it very worrying. ""If you think something is relevant, you do it by proper official means. ""You do not go freelancing as these two officers have done... ""We give the police powers that other people do not have. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers."" However, former Gloucestershire chief constable Tim Brain said that the information was in the public interest. He told Newsnight that the officers had come forward with what they considered ""relevant information"" to an ongoing inquiry. Mr Brain said: ""Let's just think about this as a workplace computer and to think whether we are happy that people, our MPs, can have this kind of material on what is an official computer."" The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Other MPs to criticise the action of the former officers included the chairman of the Commons culture committee, Damian Collins. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the Cabinet Office ""should receive and see any evidence"" that's pertinent to its investigation. The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said ""police are not above the law"" and their actions had been ""totally wrong"". Speaking to reporters at his Kent home on Friday, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along and I still maintain - it is the truth - that I did not download or look at pornography on my computer, but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that.""

End of tumble dryer replacement angers MPs,"MPsare demanding to know,externalwhy the white goods manufacturer Whirlpool ended a product replacement scheme for dangerous tumble dryers. The Commons business committee says one million of the defective machines remain in UK homes. Last week, a coronerblamed a fault in a Whirlpool dryerfor a 2014 fire that killed two men in north Wales. The firm says it is still offering free repairs, but ended a Â£50 offer for a replacement machine after demand fell. The affected machines include dryers manufactured under the Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan or Proline brands between April 2004 and October 2015. After problems with the machines first emerged, Whirlpool initially told customers that the dryers were safe to use but should not be left unattended, but later said the machines should be unplugged until they could be repaired. With growing waiting lists for a repair, the company then said it would allow customers to purchase a replacement dryer for the reduced price of Â£50. The Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee has written to Whirlpool, asking why it has now chosen to end this replacement scheme. Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves accused the US manufacturer of ""falling significantly short of their responsibilities"" and asked why boss Ian Moverly failed to mention the end of the replacement scheme when he gave evidence to her committee in October. Tumble dryer firm's repairs 'too slow' Sears stops selling Whirlpool appliances Whirlpool said anyone with an affected dryer was still eligible for a free repair, and should contact them immediately to arrange it. It said in a statement: ""After two years of extensive measures to raise awareness, the number of consumers coming forward has fallen sharply. ""This suggests that few affected appliances remain in service."" It told customers who still owned one of the appliances it was ""never too late"" to get in touch. Doug McTavish and Bernard Hender died in the fire at the flat in Llanrwst It continued: ""Previously, consumers who wished to upgrade their products to a newer model were offered the additional option of a brand-new dryer in exchange for a small contribution to the total cost. ""The scheme has now ended due to a fall in demand."" The coroner fromthe inquests into the deaths of Doug McTavish and Bernard Henderin Llanrwst, north Wales, told Whirlpool that it had to ""take action"". He said the fire was caused ""on the balance of probabilities"" by an electrical fault with the door switch on the dryer. He described evidence presented at the inquest by Whirlpool as ""defensive and dismissive"" and said the company's approach was an ""obstacle"" to finding steps to prevent future fires. Hisfinal report has been sent to the company,external, which has until 26 December to respond. Consumer group Which? criticised both Whirlpool and the government, which it called on to step in. The company's managing director of home products and services, Alex Neill, said: 'It is completely unacceptable that Whirlpool has shut down its replacement scheme for these dangerous tumble dryers. ""It is irresponsible that despite one million households potentially still using an affected machine, Whirlpool seems unwilling to do everything possible to deal with this issue.

"Chief vet defends larger hen cagesOn Twitter, Nigel Gibbens says the pens are a ""necessary defence"" against bird flu.6m7 minutes agoUK","Battery cages for chickens were banned in the EU in 2012 Some cages for hens provide a ""necessary defence"" against bird flu, the government's chief vet has said. In a tweet, Nigel Gibbens said the larger pens, which replaced so-called battery cages in 2012, have welfare benefits and offer more space. It comes after 10 leading British vets, who believe caging hens is unethical, said his ""brazen endorsement"" was ""extremely disappointing"". They said the restricted space was ""seriously detrimental to welfare"". Battery cages for chickens were banned in the EU in 2012. The ruling said that if laying hens were to be held they must be in enriched - also known as colony - cages instead. The enriched cages provided extra space to nest, scratch and roost and the guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), is that each bird in an enriched cage must have at least 750 square centimetres of space. The minimum for battery cages was 550 square centimetres. Despite the banning of battery cages, a number of leading retailers have announced that they are moving towards selling free-range eggs only. But at the Egg and Poultry Industry Conference in October, Mr Gibbens called this a ""regrettable move"" and said cages ""have a lot going for them"".

UK warning of Russian anti-virus softwareThe government issues a new warning about the security risks of using Russian anti-virus software.14h14 hours agoUK,"The British government has issued a fresh warning about the security risks of using Russian anti-virus software. The National Cyber Security Centre is to write to all government departments warning against using the products for systems related to national security. The UK cyber-security agency will say the software could be exploited by the Russian government. Security firm Kaspersky Labs, accused in the US of being used by the Russian state for espionage, denied wrongdoing. Kaspersky Labs is widely used by consumers and businesses across the globe, although they are not being advised to stop using the software, as well as by some parts of the UK government. Officials stress they are not recommending members of the public or companies stop using Kaspersky products, which are used by about 400 million people globally. Barclays hasstopped offering free Kaspersky software to customersas a ""precautionary decision"". On Saturday, the UK bank emailed 290,000 online banking customers who had downloaded Kaspersky over the past decade - but advised those with the software already installed to take no action. A Barclays spokesman said: ""Even though this new guidance isn't directed at members of the public, we have taken the decision to withdraw the offer."" Kaspersky defends its role in NSA breach Russian security firm Kaspersky denies spy agency work For it to work, anti-virus software like that sold by Kaspersky Labs requires extensive access to files on computers and networks to scan for malicious code. It also requires the ability to communicate back to the company in order to receive updates and share data on what it finds. However, the concern is that this could be used by the Russian state for espionage. Officials say the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)'s decision is based on a risk analysis, rather than evidence that such espionage has already taken place. In the new government guidance, Ian Levy, NCSC's technical director, said: ""Given we assess the Russians do cyber-attacks against the UK for reasons of state, we believe some UK government and critical national systems are at increased risk."" The NCSC is understood to have been in dialogue with Kaspersky Labs and says it will explore ways of mitigating the risks to see if a system can be developed to independently verify the security of its products. It comes amid heightened concern about Russian activity against the UK. Last month, Prime Minister Theresa May warned the Russian state was acting against the UK's national interest in cyberspace. Following her warning, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the NCSC, said Russia had targeted British infrastructure, including power and telecoms. Eugene Kaspersky ""Beyond this relatively small number of systems, we see no compelling case at present to extend that advice to the wider public sector, more general enterprises, or individuals,"" Mr Levy said. ""Whatever you do, don't panic. ""For example, we really don't want people doing things like ripping out Kaspersky software at large as it makes little sense."" Kaspersky has faced a series of accusations in the US press in recent months. It responded to one claim, that it downloaded classified US material from a home computer in the US, by presenting a detailed explanation of what took place. It has always said there is no truth to the claims. Earlier this week, Eugene Kaspersky, chief executive and co-founder of the company, told me: ""We don't do anything wrong. We would never do that. It's simply not possible."" He denied claims the Russian state could use the company. ""It's not true that the Russian state has access to the data. There are no facts about that,"" he added. Mr Kaspersky said that if he was ever asked by the Russian state to hand over data he would move his company out of the country.

Police 'breached' code in Green porn case,"This video can not be played Damian Green speaking to reporters outside his home in his constituency of Ashford Ex-detectives who disclosed that legal pornography was found on Damian Green's office computer are in ""dangerous territory"", a former police chief says. Sir Peter Fahy, ex-chief constable of Greater Manchester, said it was vital police were ""not involved in politics"". And a watchdog warned that serving officers could be sacked or prosecuted for leaking confidential information. First Secretary of State Mr Green denies watching or downloading pornography on his computer. The allegations were first made last month by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, who led a 2008 inquiry into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched. Mr Quickmade his claims,externalafter the Cabinet Office launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". Davis 'warns No 10 not to sack Green' 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer And then on Friday, retired Met detective Neil Lewis said ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's parliamentary computer in 2008. Despite being told about Mr Lewis's role examining Mr Green's computers, the Cabinet Office inquiry has not contacted him to give evidence. Sir Peter, Greater Manchester's chief constable for seven years, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the former officers had a duty to protect confidential information uncovered during an investigation. He said: ""It is very dangerous territory for a police officer to be making judgements about whether a politician is lying or not. ""That should only happen in a criminal investigation, and even then, ultimately it is for a court to decide."" Peter Fahy, a former chief constable, said police had a duty to protect confidential information Scotland Yard's department for professional standards is examining allegations that Mr Lewis had disclosed confidential information. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said the police's special powers were inseparable from ""obligations of special trust"". This trust required every officer ""to respect and keep confidential information which they obtain in the course of their duties, and which is irrelevant to their inquiries and discloses no criminal conduct"", he said. Mr Grieve accused the two former officers of ""freelancing"" ""If a police officer broke that trust whilst serving as a police officer, he or she would face disciplinary action and could be dismissed. ""In certain circumstances, such action could also constitute a criminal offence."" The obligation was enduring and ""does not end"" when a police officer retires, he said. According to the College of Policing'sCode of Ethics,external, which applies to forces in England and Wales, police agree to disclose information ""only in the proper course of my duties"". Tory MPs, including Brexit Secretary David Davis, have backed Mr Green - effectively Theresa May's second-in-command - saying it was wrong for such claims to emerge through the media. On Friday, sources close to David Davis told the BBC the Brexit Secretary had warned Downing Street not to sack Mr Green as a result of a ""wrongful attempt by former officers to do him down"". One said Mr Davis might be willing to resign over the issue, although another stressed no threat had been made. This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC ""It's right that allegations of misconduct towards individuals are properly investigated,"" said an associate of Mr Davis. ""But police officers have a duty of confidentiality which should be upheld"". Ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the two ex-police officer's actions were ""very worrying"" and smacked of the ""police state"". Mr Grieve, attorney general in David Cameron's government between 2010 and 2014,  described the decision by the officers to release the information from a police investigation dating back to 2008 as a ""flagrant breach"" of their code of conduct. ""Eight years later they choose to put material that an ordinary citizen would be prohibited from acquiring under data protection rules into the public domain on their own judgement,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""I find it very worrying. ""If you think something is relevant, you do it by proper official means. ""You do not go freelancing as these two officers have done... ""We give the police powers that other people do not have. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers."" However, former Gloucestershire chief constable Tim Brain said that the information was in the public interest. He told Newsnight that the officers had come forward with what they considered ""relevant information"" to an ongoing inquiry. Mr Brain said: ""Let's just think about this as a workplace computer and to think whether we are happy that people, our MPs, can have this kind of material on what is an official computer."" The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Other MPs to criticise the action of the former officers included the chairman of the Commons culture committee, Damian Collins. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the Cabinet Office ""should receive and see any evidence"" that's pertinent to its investigation. The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said ""police are not above the law"" and their actions had been ""totally wrong"". Speaking to reporters at his Kent home on Friday, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along and I still maintain - it is the truth - that I did not download or look at pornography on my computer, but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that.""

"Cameron: I 'didn't solve' dementia costFormer PM tells the Financial Times there needs to be a way to meet ""catastrophic"" care costs.2h2 hours agoUK","David Cameron has said his government was unable to solve the ""huge"" challenge of funding social care for the UK's ageing population. Mr Cameron told theFinancial Times,externalthat a way now had to be found to meet ""catastrophic"" dementia care costs. ""We didn't solve that problem,"" the former prime minister, now president of Alzheimer's Research UK, said. While in office, he pledged to set a cap on lifetime care costs at Â£72,000, starting from age 65, by 2020.

Israel 'targets Syrian military base',"File photo: A Russian Pantsir-S1 anti-air defence system in Syria, 2015 Israel launched surface-to-surface missiles at a military installation outside the Syrian capital Damascus overnight, Syrian state TV reports. The attack caused damage but two missiles were intercepted, it added. The Israeli military has not confirmed it carried out the strike. UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights earlier reported explosions near Damascus, which it said were caused by a suspected Israeli missile attack. The extent of the damage is not yet clear although the TV report spoke of ""material losses"" at the base. Head of the Syrian Observatory, Rami Abdel Rahman, told the AFP news agency the strike destroyed an arms depot - but his group did not know who it belonged to. Israel has hit weapons sites before, in a bid to prevent arms being transferred to Syria's Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Arms convoys in particular have been singled out by the Israeli air force. According to the Syrian Observatory the attack took place near El-Kiswah, a few miles south of Damascus. Iran building base in Syria - claim 'Israeli jets hit Syrian chemical site' Last month the BBC revealed a claim that Iran was building a permanent military base near the town. A series of satellite images showed construction at the location of the alleged base, which was made known to the BBC by a western intelligence source. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously warned that Israel would not allow Iran to establish any military presence in Syria.

Two more cat deaths linked to killer,"Rusty, a one-year-old cat, was deliberately mutilated and left on the doorstep of its owner's home The so-called Croydon cat killer is now believed to be responsible for killing and mutilating five cats in the Northampton area after two more deaths emerged. Police released details of three cat deaths between August and last weekend, but have confirmed two further cases. The unnamed cats were found in Duston. Police said the five deaths were now being treated as part of a Metropolitan Police investigation looking into hundreds of killings across England. The Met and animal charity Snarl (South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty) believe more than 400 animals have been killed in the same manner since 2015. The five Northampton cats were all dismembered in a similar way - with their heads cut off - leading police and the charity to believe they are the work of one person. The animals were then left for the owners or members of the public to find. The first wasleft in a plastic bag on the owner's doorstepand the latest victim's body wasplaced on top of a carnear its owner's home. 28 August: The body of Rusty was dumped in a bag on the owner's doorstep in Betjeman Court in Northampton 6 September: Cat Topsy was left outside the owner's home in the Kingsley area 7 October: The mutilated body of a pet cat was found in Duston (name not released) 13 November: Dismembered pet cat was discovered in Duston (name not released) 18 November: Cat ""deliberately mutilated"" and left on car roof in Mendip Road, Northampton Source: Snarl and Northamptonshire Police The latest cat death has prompted Northamptonshire Police to issue advice to owners, which includes keeping all cats and rabbits indoors at night. The Met began investigatinga series of ""gruesome"" killings, which initially began in the Croydon area in 2015, after Snarl raised concerns. The suspect initially became known as the ""Croydon cat killer"". The death of Taz, whose body was found in his owner's Hertfordshire garden, is one of many linked to the same killer Tony Jenkins, co-founder of Snarl, believes the same person has now claimed the lives of hundreds of cats and rabbits across England, and may well travel as part of his or her work. The Met launched Operation Takahe to investigate the links between animal deaths and in September experts at anew forensic lab in Surrey began re-examining some of the corpsesfor new evidence.

"Cameron: I 'didn't solve' dementia costFormer PM tells the Financial Times there needs to be a way to meet ""catastrophic"" care costs.1h44 minutes agoUK","David Cameron has said his government was unable to solve the ""huge"" challenge of funding social care for the UK's ageing population. Mr Cameron told theFinancial Times,externalthat a way now had to be found to meet ""catastrophic"" dementia care costs. ""We didn't solve that problem,"" the former prime minister, now president of Alzheimer's Research UK, said. While in office, he pledged to set a cap on lifetime care costs at Â£72,000, starting from age 65, by 2020. But Theresa May has since said the level of a potential cap would be subject to consultation. Mr Cameron, who was appointed to Alzheimer's Research UK in January,resigned as prime minister in 2016after the Brexit vote result andstepped down as an MP later last year. His plans were put on hold in July 2015 after insurers proved reluctant to introduce policies so that people could insure against their care costs, up to a Â£72,000 limit. ""The disappointment I had was I was hoping that a combination of the cap on care costs would help to deliver an insurer's model, where a market would grow up where everyone could insure themselves against the cost of long-term care,"" he said. ""We just haven't cracked that yet."" Mr Cameron described dementia as a ""world of darkness"" - and recalled visiting people in care homes in his Oxfordshire constituency while still an MP. ""They were completely disconnected from their surroundings, their relatives, their friends and their lives,"" he said.

How much of your salary is spent on rent?Tenants living in London see twice as much of their salary going to their landlord than those in the North.11h11 hours agoBusiness,"Tenants typically spend more than a quarter of their monthly salary before tax on rent, official figures show, but there are wide regional variations. They paid an average of 27% of their gross salary to their landlord in England in 2016, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows. The picture varies across the country. In London, tenants spent nearly half (49%) of their salary on rent. In northern England, this falls to just under a quarter of salary (23%). Given the proportion of salary being spent on rent, a campaign is aiming to ensure regular rent payments are included in tenants' credit records. Tenants in the South East of England, East of England and the South West all paid more of their salary on rent than the average across England. In areas of Wales, the proportion of salary spent on rent ranged from 18% to 29%, according to theONS data,external, which does not cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. Your biggest financial decision - in charts Tenants are more likely to be young and at a greater threat of getting into debt that they struggle to repay than many homeowners. While the cost of servicing a mortgage has fallen since the financial crisis, the cost of renting in some parts of the country has risen sharply. Acampaign is being conductedaiming at ensuring credit rating agencies take regular rent payments into account on an individual's credit profile, given that such a large proportion of salary is being spent on rent. This is being led in the House of Lords by Lord Bird, the founder of the Big Issue magazine, which is sold on the streets by homeless people. He said it was unfair that mortgage applicants were unable to rely on rent payment history as proof that they would be safe to lend to when buying a home. Speaking to the BBC, he said that the situation was another example of how many people on lower incomes faced higher costs than the better off. Lord Bird is the founder of the Big Issue He said that there was a chance that those with a chequered payment history could be excluded from products or even a place to live, and solutions needed to be found for that problem. There was also no clear-cut examples across the world of such a system of rent being considered by credit reference agencies working well. The government has argued that new technology should allow rental payment history to eventually be used as evidence to lenders of a good record of repayments. However, Lord Bird said: ""Many people in the rented sector may not have the skills or the digital profile to do this. Something needs to be done for the mass of people."" He told the BBC that it was a ""terrible situation"" that so much of the UK's wealth was tied up in property, rather than businesses.

N Korea threat prompts Hawaii siren test,"This video can not be played The siren has a different tone from a natural disaster warning siren The US state of Hawaii has tested a nuclear attack warning siren for the first time since the end of the Cold War.

Mr Flynn is the most senior member of the administration to be indicted. He also revealed he was co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. Significantly, a statement made by Mr Flynn to prosecutors appears to implicate a more senior, though unnamed, Trump team official - indicating the direction in which Mr Mueller's investigation may be heading. Numerous US media outlets said the senior official now under the spotlight is Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law. Mr Flynn appeared in court in front of Judge Rudolph Contreras Appearing in a federal court in Washington DC, he admitted to one count of knowingly making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"". Six big takeaways from Flynn's plea deal Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? According to an AFP reporter in court, the judge accepted Mr Flynn's guilty plea and said he would not face trial. Mr Flynn then issued a statement in which he said: ""I recognise that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right"". He said his plea and co-operation deal ""reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country"". The retired Army lieutenant-general is unlikely to serve more than six months in prison. Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words The White House issued a statement saying that ""nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn"". A presidential appearance in front of reporters was then cancelled. As he was escorted from court by FBI agents, a handful of protesters shouted ""criminal"" and ""lock him up"", echoing a chant he led against Hillary Clinton during the Republican party convention last year. Mr Flynn was forced to resign 23 days into his job in February, a month after he was questioned by the FBI for misleading the White House about meeting then Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the transition period, before Mr Trump took office. Then, just over a week ago, US media said his legal team had told the president's lawyers they could no longer discuss the case, prompting suggestions that he had begun co-operating with prosecutors. Who is Michael Flynn? How did we get to this point? It is not clear why he did not tell the truth to investigators. Butit is illegal for a private US citizen, as Mr Flynn was during the transition, to conduct foreign affairs without the permission or involvement of the US government. According tothe charge sheet,external, Michael Flynn is accused of: falsely telling FBI agents that on or about 29 December 2016 he did not ask Mr Kislyak to ""refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day"" failing to recall that Mr Kislyak had later told him Russia was moderating its response to the sanctions as a result of his request falsely saying that, on or about 22 December 2016, he did not ask Mr Kislyak to ""delay the vote on or defeat a pending United Nations Security Council resolution"". The discussion came a day beforethe Obama administration decided not to veto a resolutionasserting that Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory ""had no legal validity"" making false statements about the Turkish government's involvement and supervision of a project that his intelligence company was taking part in. Mr Flynn is not the first former Trump official to be charged. In October, Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his business associate Rick Gates were accused of conspiring to defraud the US in dealings with Ukraine (both deny the charges). Another ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, has also pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America reporter Michael Flynn lost his prized national security adviser post because of December 2016 conversations he had with Sergei Kislyak. Now he's facing criminal charges. That's bad news for Mr Flynn, but it could be even worse news for Donald Trump, who reportedly directly lobbied former FBI Director James Comey to back off the Flynn investigation before firing the top law man. Mr Flynn has told Robert Mueller's team that he spoke with Trump presidential transition officials before and after reaching out to Mr Kislyak, and was instructed on how to handle the call. This contradicts public assertions made by the president himself that Mr Flynn was operating independently and against orders. If the former national security adviser has evidence that corroborates his claims, it would be the biggest bombshell yet in this wide-ranging investigation. It's clear the special counsel investigation is casting a very wide net, and Mr Mueller just landed his biggest fish yet.

How much of your salary is spent on rent?,"Tenants typically spend more than a quarter of their monthly salary before tax on rent, official figures show, but there are wide regional variations. They paid an average of 27% of their gross salary to their landlord in England in 2016, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows. The picture varies across the country. In London, tenants spent nearly half (49%) of their salary on rent. In northern England, this falls to just under a quarter of salary (23%). Given the proportion of salary being spent on rent, a campaign is aiming to ensure regular rent payments are included in tenants' credit records. Tenants in the South East of England, East of England and the South West all paid more of their salary on rent than the average across England. In areas of Wales, the proportion of salary spent on rent ranged from 18% to 29%, according to theONS data,external, which does not cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. Your biggest financial decision - in charts Tenants are more likely to be young and at a greater threat of getting into debt that they struggle to repay than many homeowners. While the cost of servicing a mortgage has fallen since the financial crisis, the cost of renting in some parts of the country has risen sharply. Acampaign is being conductedaiming at ensuring credit rating agencies take regular rent payments into account on an individual's credit profile, given that such a large proportion of salary is being spent on rent. This is being led in the House of Lords by Lord Bird, the founder of the Big Issue magazine, which is sold on the streets by homeless people. He said it was unfair that mortgage applicants were unable to rely on rent payment history as proof that they would be safe to lend to when buying a home. Speaking to the BBC, he said that the situation was another example of how many people on lower incomes faced higher costs than the better off. Lord Bird is the founder of the Big Issue He said that there was a chance that those with a chequered payment history could be excluded from products or even a place to live, and solutions needed to be found for that problem. There was also no clear-cut examples across the world of such a system of rent being considered by credit reference agencies working well. The government has argued that new technology should allow rental payment history to eventually be used as evidence to lenders of a good record of repayments. However, Lord Bird said: ""Many people in the rented sector may not have the skills or the digital profile to do this. Something needs to be done for the mass of people."" He told the BBC that it was a ""terrible situation"" that so much of the UK's wealth was tied up in property, rather than businesses.

Fishing nations agree Arctic moratorium,"The world's major fishing nations have agreed a moratorium on commercial fishing in the Arctic Ocean, before it has even become established. Much of the Arctic was once permanently frozen but global warming means its waters are becoming more accessible. The deal is expected to last for 16 years while research is carried out into the existing marine ecosystem. The moratorium was agreed by Canada, Russia, China, the US, the EU, Japan, Iceland, Denmark and South Korea. It covers an area of about 2.8m sq km (1m sq miles) - roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea. No commercial fisheries exist in Arctic waters yet. ""This is one of the rare times when a group of governments actually solved a problem before it happened,"" said David Balton, US ambassador for oceans and fisheries. ""In the future if fish stocks are plentiful enough to support a commercial fishery there, they will be part of the management system and presumably their vessels will have the opportunity to fish for those stocks."" Conservationists applauded the deal. Trevor Taylor, of the Canadian group Oceans North, said fish and marine mammals that many Arctic communities relied upon would now be protected.

"Two more cat deaths linked to killerFive mutilated cats have been found in the Northampton area, prompting warnings from police.7h7 hours agoNorthampton","Rusty, a one-year-old cat, was deliberately mutilated and left on the doorstep of its owner's home The so-called Croydon cat killer is now believed to be responsible for killing and mutilating five cats in the Northampton area after two more deaths emerged. Police released details of three cat deaths between August and last weekend, but have confirmed two further cases. The unnamed cats were found in Duston. Police said the five deaths were now being treated as part of a Metropolitan Police investigation looking into hundreds of killings across England. The Met and animal charity Snarl (South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty) believe more than 400 animals have been killed in the same manner since 2015. The five Northampton cats were all dismembered in a similar way - with their heads cut off - leading police and the charity to believe they are the work of one person. The animals were then left for the owners or members of the public to find. The first wasleft in a plastic bag on the owner's doorstepand the latest victim's body wasplaced on top of a carnear its owner's home. 28 August: The body of Rusty was dumped in a bag on the owner's doorstep in Betjeman Court in Northampton 6 September: Cat Topsy was left outside the owner's home in the Kingsley area 7 October: The mutilated body of a pet cat was found in Duston (name not released) 13 November: Dismembered pet cat was discovered in Duston (name not released) 18 November: Cat ""deliberately mutilated"" and left on car roof in Mendip Road, Northampton Source: Snarl and Northamptonshire Police The latest cat death has prompted Northamptonshire Police to issue advice to owners, which includes keeping all cats and rabbits indoors at night. The Met began investigatinga series of ""gruesome"" killings, which initially began in the Croydon area in 2015, after Snarl raised concerns. The suspect initially became known as the ""Croydon cat killer"". The death of Taz, whose body was found in his owner's Hertfordshire garden, is one of many linked to the same killer Tony Jenkins, co-founder of Snarl, believes the same person has now claimed the lives of hundreds of cats and rabbits across England, and may well travel as part of his or her work. The Met launched Operation Takahe to investigate the links between animal deaths and in September experts at anew forensic lab in Surrey began re-examining some of the corpsesfor new evidence.

Absconded murderer is arrested,"William Kerr was spotted in Ipswich town centre following a media appeal A murderer who absconded from an open prison has been arrested. William Kerr, 56, an inmate at HMP Hollesley Bay, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, went missing at about 15:00 GMT on Friday. Suffolk Police launched a manhunt after he failed to return to a rendezvous point in Ipswich where he had been released for a few hours. Kerr, also known as Billy, was jailed for life in 1998 for the murder of Maureen Comfort in Leeds. She was found strangled to death in a cupboard at her flat. Maureen Comfort was found strangled to death in 1996 Suffolk Police, which had advised members of the public not to approach Kerr, said he was apprehended after a member of public spotted him in the centre of Ipswich. ""Officers attended immediately and he was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre pending his transfer back to the prison system,"" the force said. ""Suffolk Police would like to thank everybody who reported potential sightings of him during his absence."" In April 2015, Kerr absconded from a bail hostel in Hull, sparking a major police hunt and an appeal on BBC Crimewatch. He was arrested in the Waterloo area of London at the end of April 2015.

US Senate passes sweeping tax cuts bill,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""It's the largest tax decrease in the history of our country by far"" US senators have passed a sweeping tax cuts bill, paving the way for Donald Trump's first big legislative victory. The package would mark the biggest tax overhaul since the 1980s. It was passed by 51 votes to 49, after a series of amendments in a marathon session. Democrats complained it only benefited the wealthy and big business. The plan sees a sharp cut in corporation tax, but a Senate committee finding has warned it would add $1tn (Â£742bn) to the budget deficit. President Trump wants the measures enacted by the end of the year and he congratulated Republicans for taking the US ""one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families"". The Senate will now have to merge its legislation with that passed last month by the House of Representatives, before it can be signed into law by the president. Reality Check: Will tax plan hurt Trump? Does the US debt of $20tn matter? How does US tax plan compare to other countries? On Saturday, a triumphant Mr Trump told supporters at a New York fundraiser: ""So last night we passed in the history of the country, the largest tax cuts and reform... what we're doing is, if you look at it, we're going to grow the country, we're going to grow jobs. We're going to be growing everything."" Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell overcame a pocket of Republican resistance to get the bill through The move is as a major victory for Mr Trump, who since taking office has struggled to get major legislative movement in Congress - including fulfilling his vow to repeal and replace Obamacare. His presidency has also been dogged by an independent investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 US election and possible collusion with his campaign team.On Friday, ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn became the Trump administration's most senior member to be charged in the investigation. This video can not be played Trump on Russia inquiry: ""What has been shown is no collusion"" Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The US Senate, a seemingly insurmountable roadblock for the Republican agenda for much of this year, has at last given its assent to a major piece of legislation. Perhaps unsurprisingly it was sweeping tax cuts - always beloved by conservatives - that finally brought the party together and gave President Donald Trump the opportunity to claim a landmark legislative achievement. It wasn't always pretty. Senate negotiators were handwriting amendments to the massive bill practically up until the final votes were taken. Deals within deals were cut to satisfy recalcitrant legislators. Democrats howled at the permanent cuts provided to corporations, while middle-class taxpayer benefits had sunset clauses. In the end, however, a combination of hope and fear were enough to drag a slim majority into the yes column. The hope is that a booming economy will give Republicans a chance to run on their tax policy when they stand before voters next November. The fear was that yet another failure would have led to a revolt among the party's big donors and traditional business constituencies. The House and Senate must now smooth out differences in their bills and vote on the compromise. It's not the end of the race, but the finish line is in sight. Presiding over the Senate, Vice-President Mike Pence declared the 51-49 victory to applause from Republicans in the early hours of Saturday morning. The final draft of the bill went through several changes in order to bring reluctant Republicans on board. Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the Senate. Random tax provisions you may have missed Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the corporate tax rate would be permanently lowered from 35% to 20%, while future foreign profits of US-based firms would be mainly exempt from tax. President Trump said the new code would be so simple that taxes could be filed on a postcard The measures were passed despite the non-partisan Senate Joint Committee on Taxation warning on Thursday that the bill would add significantly to the federal deficit over a decade. The committee's findings contradicted a White House claim that economic growth would compensate for the tax cuts. Most Americans across all income levels would see modest tax breaks until 2026 and the committee said after that families earning under $75,000 a year would likely face higher taxes. Some opponents highlighted a measure that would end a requirement introduced under Obamacare for most taxpayers to buy health insurance or face a fine. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, scrapping the mandate would push up insurance premiums and lead to 13 million people losing cover by 2027. There were some last minute changes, including a $10,000 property tax deduction as requested by Senator Susan Collins, one of the Republicans who had been reluctant to back the bill. After the vote, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his opponents would pay the price at the ballot box in mid-term elections next year. ""My Republican friends will ultimately pay consequences for this bill in 2018 and beyond. The Republican party will never again be the party of tax cuts for middle-class people,"" he warned. He said the measures would endanger social security and medical provision. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders was among the most vocal critics, declaring during the debate that the American treasury was ""being looted"". Bernie Sanders said the bill would benefit the wealthiest people and largest corporations But Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who succeeded in bringing dissenting party members into line, said the legislation would prove to be ""just what the country needs to get growing again"". He brushed aside complaints that it was pushed through without proper scrutiny, saying: ""Everybody had plenty of opportunity to see the measure. You complain about process when you're losing and that's what you heard on the floor tonight."" Republican Senator Bill Cassidy also praised the bill, saying ""working families and middle-income families across the nation will be better off"". Allow Twitter content?

US Senate passes sweeping tax cuts billThe biggest tax overhaul since the 1980s is passed amid warnings it will worsen the budget deficit.,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""It's the largest tax decrease in the history of our country by far"" US senators have passed a sweeping tax cuts bill, paving the way for Donald Trump's first big legislative victory. The package would mark the biggest tax overhaul since the 1980s. It was passed by 51 votes to 49, after a series of amendments in a marathon session. Democrats complained it only benefited the wealthy and big business. The plan sees a sharp cut in corporation tax, but a Senate committee finding has warned it would add $1tn (Â£742bn) to the budget deficit. President Trump wants the measures enacted by the end of the year and he congratulated Republicans for taking the US ""one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families"". The Senate will now have to merge its legislation with that passed last month by the House of Representatives, before it can be signed into law by the president. Reality Check: Will tax plan hurt Trump? Does the US debt of $20tn matter? How does US tax plan compare to other countries? On Saturday, a triumphant Mr Trump told supporters at a New York fundraiser: ""So last night we passed in the history of the country, the largest tax cuts and reform... what we're doing is, if you look at it, we're going to grow the country, we're going to grow jobs. We're going to be growing everything."" Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell overcame a pocket of Republican resistance to get the bill through The move is as a major victory for Mr Trump, who since taking office has struggled to get major legislative movement in Congress - including fulfilling his vow to repeal and replace Obamacare. His presidency has also been dogged by an independent investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 US election and possible collusion with his campaign team.On Friday, ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn became the Trump administration's most senior member to be charged in the investigation. This video can not be played Trump on Russia inquiry: ""What has been shown is no collusion"" Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The US Senate, a seemingly insurmountable roadblock for the Republican agenda for much of this year, has at last given its assent to a major piece of legislation. Perhaps unsurprisingly it was sweeping tax cuts - always beloved by conservatives - that finally brought the party together and gave President Donald Trump the opportunity to claim a landmark legislative achievement. It wasn't always pretty. Senate negotiators were handwriting amendments to the massive bill practically up until the final votes were taken. Deals within deals were cut to satisfy recalcitrant legislators. Democrats howled at the permanent cuts provided to corporations, while middle-class taxpayer benefits had sunset clauses. In the end, however, a combination of hope and fear were enough to drag a slim majority into the yes column. The hope is that a booming economy will give Republicans a chance to run on their tax policy when they stand before voters next November. The fear was that yet another failure would have led to a revolt among the party's big donors and traditional business constituencies. The House and Senate must now smooth out differences in their bills and vote on the compromise. It's not the end of the race, but the finish line is in sight. Presiding over the Senate, Vice-President Mike Pence declared the 51-49 victory to applause from Republicans in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Honduras moves to quash election unrestThe army and police get extra powers and an overnight curfew is imposed after Sunday's disputed vote.2h2 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Maria Martinez, a supporter of Salvador Nasralla, said protesters were ""defending the rights of the people"" Honduras has given its army and police more powers to contain unrest following violent protests over last Sunday's disputed presidential election. Government official Ebal Diaz said ""constitutional guarantees"" had been suspended and a curfew imposed. Earlier, the publication of election results was delayed when the main opposition candidate demanded more than 5,000 ballot boxes be recounted. Salvador Nasralla says he has evidence of electoral fraud. Violent demonstrations since the election have left one person dead and 20 injured. Riot police fired tear gas at angry opposition supporters in the capital Tegucigalpa on Friday, near the centre where the results were due to be announced. Elsewhere, protesters blocked major roads and set vehicles alight. Opposition supporters claim President HernÃ¡ndez is trying to steal the election ""The suspension of constitutional guarantees was approved so that the armed forces and the national police can contain this wave of violence that has engulfed the country,"" Mr Diaz said on national television. He said a curfew would be in place between 18:00 and 06:00 for the next 10 days. Analysis: Will Grant, BBC Central America Correspondent After a day of street protests that spilled over into violence, a senior government official confirmed on Honduran TV that certain constitutional powers were being suspended and a curfew would be in place. It came after what was supposed to be the announcement of the official result of the presidential election. Instead, the opposition alliance that is crying foul - alleging fraud by the electoral authorities - boycotted a hand count of around 1,000 ballot boxes. They are demanding a full recount in three disputed regions, amounting to more like 5,000 boxes. Supporters of main opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla say they have evidence of vote tampering and are refusing to end their protests until the electoral court listens to their demands. Meanwhile, the sitting President, Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez, has a narrow lead and his centre-right National Party is confident of eventually sealing his re-election. At this stage, neither side looks willing to work with the other and an already volatile situation in Honduras is now in serious danger of running out of control. At the beginning of the week Mr Nasralla, whose supporters are deeply suspicious of the tribunal that counts the ballots, had established a lead of five percentage points. But with more than 90% of ballots reportedly counted, incumbent President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez moved ahead of his rival. Mr Nasralla accused the authorities of manipulating the results. Tensions eased temporarily on Wednesday when both candidates signed a document vowing to respect the final result after every disputed vote had been scrutinised. But another pause in counting - attributed by the electoral tribunal to a computer glitch - led to Mr Nasralla saying a few hours later that the document ""had no validity"". Distrust over the count is partly due to the fact that the tribunal is appointed by Congress, which is controlled by Mr HernÃ¡ndez's National Party, and partly due to the sudden reversal of Mr Nasralla's initial lead. There has also been criticism of the slow pace of the count, which came to a 36-hour halt after the first partial results were released on Monday.

Fishing nations agree Arctic moratoriumA new deal protects stocks in Arctic waters becoming more accessible because of global warming.1h36 minutes agoWorld,"The world's major fishing nations have agreed a moratorium on commercial fishing in the Arctic Ocean, before it has even become established. Much of the Arctic was once permanently frozen but global warming means its waters are becoming more accessible. The deal is expected to last for 16 years while research is carried out into the existing marine ecosystem. The moratorium was agreed by Canada, Russia, China, the US, the EU, Japan, Iceland, Denmark and South Korea. It covers an area of about 2.8m sq km (1m sq miles) - roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea. No commercial fisheries exist in Arctic waters yet. ""This is one of the rare times when a group of governments actually solved a problem before it happened,"" said David Balton, US ambassador for oceans and fisheries. ""In the future if fish stocks are plentiful enough to support a commercial fishery there, they will be part of the management system and presumably their vessels will have the opportunity to fish for those stocks."" Conservationists applauded the deal. Trevor Taylor, of the Canadian group Oceans North, said fish and marine mammals that many Arctic communities relied upon would now be protected.

Toys R Us prepares to shut 25 stores,"Around 25 Toys R Us stores could close if its new debt deal with creditors is approved Toys R Us is preparing to close around a quarter of its 106 UK stores, with the loss of hundreds of jobs, the BBC understands. The closures would form part of a deal to renegotiate debts owed by the company to its landlords - which must be agreed by 75% of its creditors. The toy giant, which has around 3,000 workers, is looking to move away from its ""big-box"" out-of-town store model. Christmas trading and gift cards are not expected to be affected. The company is seeking approval from its board and US parent company to enter talks with the landlords. Specialist restructuring firm Alvarez and Marsal is understood to be drafting a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) on its behalf. It hopes to strike a deal on Toys R Us's debts which will allow it to continue trading without being pursued for the money it owes. A Toys R Us spokesperson would not comment on the CVA proceedings, shop closures or job losses. The CVA process is separate to bankruptcy protection proceedings involving Toys R Us's US parent company, which were announced in September. Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle, from Insight With Passion, said the challenge facing Toys R Us is a common theme of retailers. ""Toy retailers, fashion retailers, everyone is going to reduce the size of their stores. It's coming. In the coming 24 months you will see a lot more of this sort of news,"" Ms Hardcastle said. Ms Hardcastle said Toys R Us was particularly exposed to the rise in e-commerce because customers are most comfortable buying toys and electronics online as they offer big-name, trusted brands. ""There isn't a bigger branded industry. If I'm buying Lego: Lego is Lego, is Lego"". ""Toys R Us has aisles and aisles stacked high with products, but they will never win that fight with the internet."" Ms Hardcastle said Toys R Us was stuck between the extensive range and lower pricing of online retail and the theatrics and free entertainment offered by toy stores such as Hamleys, Lego and Disney stores.

Green claims 'flagrant police breach',"This video can not be played Damian Green speaking to reporters outside his home in his constituency of Ashford Ex-detectives who disclosed that legal pornography was found on Damian Green's office computer are in ""dangerous territory"", a former police chief says. Sir Peter Fahy, ex-chief constable of Greater Manchester, said it was vital police were ""not involved in politics"". And a watchdog warned that serving officers could be sacked or prosecuted for leaking confidential information. First Secretary of State Mr Green denies watching or downloading pornography on his computer. The allegations were first made last month by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, who led a 2008 inquiry into Home Office leaks which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched. Mr Quickmade his claims,externalafter the Cabinet Office launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". Davis 'warns No 10 not to sack Green' 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer And then on Friday, retired Met detective Neil Lewis said ""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's parliamentary computer in 2008. Despite being told about Mr Lewis's role examining Mr Green's computers, the Cabinet Office inquiry has not contacted him to give evidence. Sir Peter, Greater Manchester's chief constable for seven years, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the former officers had a duty to protect confidential information uncovered during an investigation. He said: ""It is very dangerous territory for a police officer to be making judgements about whether a politician is lying or not. ""That should only happen in a criminal investigation, and even then, ultimately it is for a court to decide."" Peter Fahy, a former chief constable, said police had a duty to protect confidential information Scotland Yard's department for professional standards is examining allegations that Mr Lewis had disclosed confidential information. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said the police's special powers were inseparable from ""obligations of special trust"". This trust required every officer ""to respect and keep confidential information which they obtain in the course of their duties, and which is irrelevant to their inquiries and discloses no criminal conduct"", he said. Mr Grieve accused the two former officers of ""freelancing"" ""If a police officer broke that trust whilst serving as a police officer, he or she would face disciplinary action and could be dismissed. ""In certain circumstances, such action could also constitute a criminal offence."" The obligation was enduring and ""does not end"" when a police officer retires, he said. According to the College of Policing'sCode of Ethics,external, which applies to forces in England and Wales, police agree to disclose information ""only in the proper course of my duties"". Tory MPs, including Brexit Secretary David Davis, have backed Mr Green - effectively Theresa May's second-in-command - saying it was wrong for such claims to emerge through the media. On Friday, sources close to David Davis told the BBC the Brexit Secretary had warned Downing Street not to sack Mr Green as a result of a ""wrongful attempt by former officers to do him down"". One said Mr Davis might be willing to resign over the issue, although another stressed no threat had been made. This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC ""It's right that allegations of misconduct towards individuals are properly investigated,"" said an associate of Mr Davis. ""But police officers have a duty of confidentiality which should be upheld"". Ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the two ex-police officer's actions were ""very worrying"" and smacked of the ""police state"". Mr Grieve, attorney general in David Cameron's government between 2010 and 2014,  described the decision by the officers to release the information from a police investigation dating back to 2008 as a ""flagrant breach"" of their code of conduct. ""Eight years later they choose to put material that an ordinary citizen would be prohibited from acquiring under data protection rules into the public domain on their own judgement,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""I find it very worrying. ""If you think something is relevant, you do it by proper official means. ""You do not go freelancing as these two officers have done... ""We give the police powers that other people do not have. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers."" However, former Gloucestershire chief constable Tim Brain said that the information was in the public interest. He told Newsnight that the officers had come forward with what they considered ""relevant information"" to an ongoing inquiry. Mr Brain said: ""Let's just think about this as a workplace computer and to think whether we are happy that people, our MPs, can have this kind of material on what is an official computer."" The allegations date back to November 2008 when the Conservatives were in opposition and Damian Green was their immigration spokesman He embarrassed the Labour government with a series of leaks about illegal immigration and other issues Police raided his Parliamentary office as part of an inquiry into how he got his hands on confidential documents His office computer was seized and he was detained for nine hours - sparking fury among Tory MPs No charges were brought against the MP or civil servant Christopher Galley, who passed unauthorised material to Mr Green, although the official was sacked The officer in charge of the inquiry, Bob Quick - widely criticised by Tory MPs for the raid - resigned six months later over an alleged security breach But a month ago, Mr Quick disclosed that pornographic material had been found on the seized computer, adding that the police had not pursued the matter at the time or told Mr Green about it The matter has since been investigated by the Cabinet Office as part of a wider inquiry into claims of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby The inquiry is believed to centre on the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Other MPs to criticise the action of the former officers included the chairman of the Commons culture committee, Damian Collins. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions the Cabinet Office ""should receive and see any evidence"" that's pertinent to its investigation. The DUP's leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said ""police are not above the law"" and their actions had been ""totally wrong"". Speaking to reporters at his Kent home on Friday, Mr Green said: ""I have maintained all along and I still maintain - it is the truth - that I did not download or look at pornography on my computer, but obviously while the investigation is going on, I can't say any more than that.""

Hawaii dusts off nuclear attack siren,"This video can not be played The siren has a different tone from a natural disaster warning siren The US state of Hawaii has tested a nuclear attack warning siren for the first time since the end of the Cold War. The resumption of the monthly tests comes amid a growing threat from North Korea's missile and nuclear programme. Pyongyang has tested a series of ballistic missiles and in September carried out its sixth nuclear test. Hawaii, in the Pacific, already has a monthly test of sirens warning of natural disasters, including tsunamis. The nuclear attack signal uses a different, wavering tone, warning residents and tourists to stay indoors and await further instructions. What damage could North Korea do? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? North Korea's missile programme The last time a nuclear attack warning siren was tested in the state was in the 1980s in the final years of the Cold War. But it sounded again on Friday morning and will be repeated on the first business day of every month. Vern Miyagi, who heads the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, said it was""critically important"" for the public to understand what the different tones mean, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported,external. A missile launched from North Korea could strike Hawaii within 20 minutes of launch, the paper added. Hawaii hosts the US military headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region. North Korea recently tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile which it claims can hit anywhere on the mainland United States. Experts say the Hwasong-15 appears capable of transporting a nuclear warhead, although it is unclear if Pyongyang is yet capable of making a weapon small enough to be fitted on to a missile.

If you have a fall of 20%, then you enter a bear market. Bull Market:A bull market is the opposite - it's when the price of shares on the stock market is rising. Bull or Bear?

How much of your salary is spent on rent?Tenants living in London see twice as much of their salary going to their landlord than those in the North.,"Tenants typically spend more than a quarter of their monthly salary before tax on rent, official figures show, but there are wide regional variations. They paid an average of 27% of their gross salary to their landlord in England in 2016, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows. The picture varies across the country. In London, tenants spent nearly half (49%) of their salary on rent. In northern England, this falls to just under a quarter of salary (23%). Given the proportion of salary being spent on rent, a campaign is aiming to ensure regular rent payments are included in tenants' credit records. Tenants in the South East of England, East of England and the South West all paid more of their salary on rent than the average across England. In areas of Wales, the proportion of salary spent on rent ranged from 18% to 29%, according to theONS data,external, which does not cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. Your biggest financial decision - in charts Tenants are more likely to be young and at a greater threat of getting into debt that they struggle to repay than many homeowners. While the cost of servicing a mortgage has fallen since the financial crisis, the cost of renting in some parts of the country has risen sharply. Acampaign is being conductedaiming at ensuring credit rating agencies take regular rent payments into account on an individual's credit profile, given that such a large proportion of salary is being spent on rent. This is being led in the House of Lords by Lord Bird, the founder of the Big Issue magazine, which is sold on the streets by homeless people. He said it was unfair that mortgage applicants were unable to rely on rent payment history as proof that they would be safe to lend to when buying a home. Speaking to the BBC, he said that the situation was another example of how many people on lower incomes faced higher costs than the better off. Lord Bird is the founder of the Big Issue He said that there was a chance that those with a chequered payment history could be excluded from products or even a place to live, and solutions needed to be found for that problem. There was also no clear-cut examples across the world of such a system of rent being considered by credit reference agencies working well. The government has argued that new technology should allow rental payment history to eventually be used as evidence to lenders of a good record of repayments. However, Lord Bird said: ""Many people in the rented sector may not have the skills or the digital profile to do this. Something needs to be done for the mass of people."" He told the BBC that it was a ""terrible situation"" that so much of the UK's wealth was tied up in property, rather than businesses.

US tax vote looms despite deficit alert,"Protesters rally against the bill outside Congress earlier this week Republicans who control the US Senate say they are confident of passing the biggest tax cuts since the Reagan era as soon as Friday. Party leaders sounded bullish after three Republican holdouts said yes despite a Senate committee finding it would add $1tn (Â£742bn) to the deficit. The committee's report contradicts a White House claim that economic growth would compensate for the tax cuts. President Donald Trump wants the measure enacted by Christmas. The nonpartisan Senate Joint Committee on Taxation found on Thursday that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would add significantly to the federal deficit over a decade. Reality Check: Will tax plan hurt Trump? Does the US debt of $20tn matter? How does US tax plan compare to other countries? But Senators Ron Johnson, Jeff Flake and Steve Daines said on Friday they would support the legislation, which includes steep corporate tax cuts. Mr Daines, of Montana, and Mr Johnson, of Wisconsin, and Mr Flake, of Arizona, were among a dwindling band of Republicans on the fence. ""After weeks of fighting for Main Street businesses including Montana's farmers and ranchers, I've decided to support the Senate tax cut bill which provides significant tax relief for Main Street businesses,"" Mr Daines said in a statement. John Cornyn, majority whip of the chamber, said he is confident the party has the votes to pass the bill. ""We are confident of the 50 and would like to build on that,"" he said. Senate Republicans can afford to lose just two members of their party if they are to succeed. Mr Trump says the new code will be so simple, taxes can be filed on a postcard The votes of Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and James Lankford of Oklahoma were also being courted by the Republican leadership. The party's fiscal conservatives have for years lamented the nation's debt time bomb. Republican Tax Plan: What you may have missed But despite the Senate committee's deficit warning, the party is full steam ahead on the bill. If it passes, the Senate would need to merge its legislation with that passed last month by the House of Representatives. The reconciled bill would then be sent to the president's desk for his signature to be enacted into law. Under the Senate bill, the corporate tax cut would not go into effect until 2019, instead of going into effect immediately. The Senate bill would repeal the requirement that individuals have health insurance or face a fine. That is not included in the House plan. The Senate bill does not allow households to deduct anything for state and local property taxes, a sticking point for lawmakers in high-cost states. The House plan allows families to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes. The Senate bill doubles the amount of money exempt from inheritance tax. The House plan would also eventually eliminate the inheritance tax entirely. The Senate bill maintains seven tax brackets, but cuts the top rate to 38.5%, while the House would slim the number of brackets to four, preserving a top rate of 39.5%. The Senate preserves some popular benefits for people with medical expenses and student loans, which the House would eliminate. The details of the Senate bill remain in flux. The heart of the proposal is a move to slash the corporate rate from 35% to 20%, a move that supporters say will make the US more competitive. But as a vote nears, some senators have raised the possibility of lowering the rate to 22%, in an effort to reduce the cost of the proposal. The plan would also boost the amount individuals and families can deduct from their tax bill, while eliminating other targeted benefits. That change is meant to simplify tax filing for the average household. But the bill's effects would be much broader. For example, the Senate has proposed eliminating a requirement that people have health insurance - a change that would rock US insurance markets. Wall Street expects to benefit from lower rates, as companies use additional cash to buy back shares or pay out higher dividends. But the effects of the changes are mixed for households. Wealthy families would benefit from proposals such as one that would increase the amount exempt from inheritance tax. Analyses suggest some lower- and middle-class families would eventually see higher bills as other benefits expire. One of the most controversial parts of the bill is a measure that would stop allowing families to deduct their state and local taxes from their federal bills. The issue is especially important in high-tax states, many of which are Democratic. Reality Check: Has US debt fallen under President Trump?

Stepdad jailed for 1968 fireplace murder,"David Dearlove claimed Paul Booth was injured when he fell out of bed A man who swung his toddler stepson by the ankles and smashed his head into a fireplace has been been jailed for a minimum of 13 years. David Dearlove, 71, murdered 19-month-old Paul Booth at their home in Stockton-on-Tees in October 1968. Paul's brother Peter, who was three years old when he witnessed the attack after he crept downstairs for a drink, went to police in 2015. A jury at Teesside Crown Court convicted Dearlove of murdering Paul. The Facebook post that caught a killer David Dearlove was convicted of murder and three child cruelty charges The inquest into Paul's death in 1968 recorded an open verdict. But in 2015, Peter went to the police after seeing a photo on Facebook of his little brother sitting on Dearlove's knee. He said as a three-year-old he had seen Dearlove, now of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, swinging Paul round their living room and witnessed the boy's head striking the fireplace. Paul Booth was 19 months old when he died During the trial, Dearlove insisted Paul suffered the fatal head injury when he fell out of bed onto a concrete floor, although he told police when he was arrested in 2015 that the toddler collapsed in the living room. He claimed he changed his story because he had forgotten the events of 1968. The court heard Dearlove had been violent towards Peter and Paul as well as their sister Stephanie Marron who also accused him of cruelty,saying he punched her and pulled her down the stairs. Paul Booth had suffered bruising less than a month before his death A mannequin was used to show jurors how Paul Booth's injuries were inflicted Home Office pathologist Mark Egan demonstrated how the toddler could have died by swinging a doll by the ankles and banging its head on the surface of the witness box, causing some of the 10 men and two women of the jury to weep. He also said he believed it would have taken separate blows to cause the ""z-shaped"" skull fracture on the side of Paul's head. Dearlove was also convicted of three child cruelty charges. Sentencing, Mr Justice Males told him: ""You were a young and no doubt immature man. ""You were also a cruel man and you made the lives of those three young children a misery."" Dearlove swung Paul Booth by his ankles, smashing the toddler's head against the living room fireplace The Crown Prosecution Service said it had not been able to exhume Paul's body as burial records had been lost, with the case relying on the documents prepared for his inquest at the time. In a statement after the verdict, the Booth family said Dearlove's actions ""not only physically killed Paul but also destroyed his memory"". ""He was buried into an unmarked grave the location of which remains unknown and he was not spoken about for many years."" Det Insp Mark Dimelow, from Cleveland Police, said the murder investigation had been ""challenging due to its historic nature"". ""I want to pay tribute to Paul's family and other witnesses who provided such an emotive testimony and I praise their bravery in having to relive events from 50 years ago,"" he added.
