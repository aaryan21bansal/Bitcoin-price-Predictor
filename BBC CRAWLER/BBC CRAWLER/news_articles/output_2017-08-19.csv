Seaside town 'in lockdown' amid disorder,"Cromer Pier said its Theatre Bar was closed on the advice of police A seaside town reportedly went into ""lockdown"" on Saturday night as disorder forced pubs and bars in the resort to shut. Venues in Cromer, Norfolk, closed for the ""safety of customers and staff"". Some remained closed on Sunday. Norfolk Police said extra officers were on patrol following ""low level disorder"", but there were no arrests. The force said pubs ""made the decision to close"" after thefts and anti-social behaviour. Police said reports of a stabbing were unfounded, but they said there had been thefts from shops and pubs and officers had been called to reports of groups refusing to leave pubs and not paying for drinks at an Indian restaurant. Aryun Nessa has suffered bruising after her arm was trapped by a door while she tried to get people to leave a restaurant The wife of the owner of the Masala Twist restaurant said she was pinned behind a door by six women shouting abuse as she screamed that they were breaking her arm on Saturday night. Aryun Nessa said she and her husband, together with their young daughter and nephew, had been trying to get up to 40 people to leave their restaurant after they started shouting and stealing bottles of beer. ""The door was shut on my arm - I am quite badly bruised and it's very painful,"" she said. ""It's a lovely town - calm, quiet, with lovely people, but after last night's experience it has got me thinking what are we doing here."" Police were carrying out extra patrols in the traditional seaside town on Sunday Some businesses in the town have chosen to remain shut on Sunday North Norfolk District Council said a group of travellers in 23 caravans had set up camp in the town's Runton Road clifftop car park but most had now left. Council leader Tom FitzPatrick said said they arrived on Friday evening and the council had served a notice on Saturday for them to leave. At the scene Jenny Kirk, BBC News Coming to Cromer today, at first glance you would not know there had been any problems last night. The streets are bustling, as you would expect, with holidaymakers eating ice-creams and chips. However, if you look more closely some of the shops and businesses that would have been trading on a peak summer Sunday have closed - including several town pubs that shut following reports of disturbances. But the leader of the district council and the town mayor - both of whom I have spoken to today - wanted to stress that the seaside resort was a safe place to be and very much open for visitors. Residents said a group of people had been fighting in the town, which they had described as ""in lockdown"". In a statement on itsFacebook page,externalon Saturday, Cromer Pier said its Theatre Bar was closed along with other pubs in the town. ""Apologies for any inconvenience whilst we support our local police in bringing a difficult situation in the town under control,"" it said. North Norfolk District Council said travellers were illegally camped on a seafront car park Nearby in East Runton, holidaymaker Chris Perry said up to 20 police cars and dog units arrived after the landlord at a campsite bar refused to serve some people. Police confirmed they attended the site. The town has been hosting its annual carnival week, which finished on Friday, and draws in about 250,000 people to north Norfolk, according to the organisers. The chairman of the carnival committee, Tony Shipp, said people taking part in a parade on Friday had been pelted with objects including bottles. ""It's been a fantastic carnival week but this has taken the shine off things,"" he said. A cafe owner from the resort said businesses had taken a ""huge hit"" on what should have been their busiest weekend of the year. Laurie Scott said: ""There was a large group of people in town, causing some commotion and being very intimidating concerning businesses, so much so that... all of the pubs in Cromer - maybe six, seven, eight pubs - were closed at 7pm to guarantee the safety of their customers and staff."" The town has staged its annual carnival this week which featured an appearance by the Red Arrows on Wednesday North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb said: ""Certainly from the people I've talked to in the town, what happened yesterday was pretty intolerable and it is really important that the police deal very firmly with the perpetrators of this."" Supt Malcolm Cooke of Norfolk Police said: ""We acknowledge there have been a number of incidents in Cromer over the weekend, which will understandably cause concern. ""However, I can assure residents these incidents have been dealt with appropriately and are of a nature routinely dealt with in towns such as Cromer on a busy August weekend."" Pubs, restaurants and shops in nearby Sheringham also closed early on Saturday because of concern the problems in Cromer might spread, according to organisers of a festival and visitors to the town.

French fighter jet 'tracks' Jet2 flight,"The fighter jet stayed with the Jet2 plane for about 15 minutes A passenger on board a plane flying from Spain to Birmingham has told of the ""terrifying"" moment holidaymakers realised their aircraft was being shadowed by a French fighter jet. The Jet2 plane, travelling to the UK from Malaga, was joined in the skies by the jet for about 15 minutes on Friday. Passenger Sarah Hatfield, said: ""It was so close I could read the writing on its tail fin."" Carrier Jet2 said it was awaiting a response from the French air force. Ms Hatfield, from Quarry Bank in the West Midlands, who was travelling with husband Ian and their 13-year-old daughter Emily, said: ""Someone spotted the French jet and told the cabin crew, who I presume told the Jet2 pilots. Low-cost carrier Jet2 has a base at Birmingham Airport ""The air stewardess then announced there was nothing to worry about. ""Ian was terrified and it didn't help that loads of other passengers came by us to look out at it."" The family photographed the aircraft seemingly tracking Flight LS1204 and said the feeling on board was ""a mixture of excitement at seeing the fighter so close up and terror as to if we were about to get shot down."" A spokesperson for Jet2 said: ""We are awaiting clarification from the French air traffic authorities, as to why a military aircraft was apparently tracking our aircraft"".

Trumps skip ceremony amid boycott threat,"The White House said Donald and Melania Trump extended their ""sincerest congratulations"" to award recipients US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are to skip an arts awards ceremony to allow those taking part ""to celebrate without political distraction"", the White House says. Some of those due to take part in the Kennedy Center Honors had said they would boycott the White House reception held before the awards ceremony. The honours recognise the lifetime contributions of performing artists. Many artists have been angered by Mr Trump's plans to scrap funding. In his budget outline in March, he pushed for the end of federal support for public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts. President Trump is also mired in controversy over his response to recent violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia. Republicans and Democrats alike have criticised him for insisting that anti-racism protesters were also to blame for the violence that ended in the death of a woman. The White House said in a statement: ""The president and first lady have decided not to participate in this year's [Kennedy Center Honors] activities to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction. ""First Lady Melania Trump, along with her husband President Donald J Trump, extend their sincerest congratulations and well wishes to all of this year's award recipients for their many accomplishments."" Those being honoured are Carmen de Lavallade, singer Gloria Estefan, hip-hop artist LL COOL J, singer Lionel Richie and TV producer Norman Lear Dancer and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade, who is due to be honoured at the December ceremony, said earlier this week that she would boycott the related White House reception for honourees. ""In light of the socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our existing leadership is choosing to engage in, and in keeping with the principles that I and so many others have fought for, I will be declining the invitation to attend the reception at the White House,""she said in a statement.,external Singer Lionel Richie had also suggested he might not attend, telling the NBC Today programme: ""I'm not really happy with what's going on right now with the controversies. They're weekly, daily, hourly."" TV producer Norman Lear, who is to receive a lifelong artistic achievement award, also said he would not attend the White House reception. ""It is more important now than ever that we stand up for artists, for artistic expression, and for the valiant fight that artists fight to reveal the wonder and oneness of the human spirit,"" he said.

Thousands oppose Boston right-wing rally,"This video can not be played How a day of rival protests unfolded Tens of thousands of anti-racism protesters have opposed the ""Free Speech"" rally in the US city of Boston that featured right-wing speakers. The rally on Boston Common, which attracted only a small crowd, disbanded early and the participants were escorted out by police. The organisers had said they would not give a platform to racism or bigotry. Tensions are high after violent demonstrationsin Charlottesville, Virginialast weekend turned deadly. The Boston Herald reported that up to 30,000 people attended the protest. Demonstrators had gathered at a Boston sports centre and then marched en masse to the common. Those at the conservative rally were confined to the bandstand area on Boston Common. Crowds of anti-racism protesters surrounded the bandstand but were kept some distance away. Hundreds of police were deployed and clashes broke out later between some police and anti-rally protesters. Police clashed with some protesters outside the park Large crowds of anti-racism demonstrators make their way to Boston Common Police said that officers had had rocks and bottles of urine thrown at them. Thirty-three people have been arrested. Many anti-rally protesters wore stickers showing the face of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who died when a car was driven into a crowd of counter-protesters at last Saturday's far-right rally in Charlottesville. Who was Heather Heyer? ""It's time to do something. We are out here to add an extra body to the numbers of those who resist,"" said Katie Zipps, who travelled from Malden, north of Boston, for the protest. The crowd chanted ""No Nazis, no KKK, no fascists in the USA!"" and carried banners with slogans such as ""Stop pretending your racism is patriotism"". Boston Mayor Marty Walsh later thanked the counter-demonstrators, who he said ""came out to share the message of love, not hate."" ""To fight back on the white supremacists and the Nazis that were coming to our city, I want to thank everyone who came,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Cassini skims Saturn's atmosphere,"Cassini will ""dip its toes"" into the atmosphere during the final passes The Cassini probe has begun the final phase of its mission to Saturn. The satellite has executed the first of five ultra-close passes of the giant world, dipping down far enough to brush through the top of the atmosphere. It promises unprecedented data on the chemical composition of Saturn. It also sets the stage for the probe's dramatic end-manoeuvre next month when it will plunge to destruction in the planet's atmosphere. Cassini is currently flying a series of loops around Saturn that thread the gap between its atmosphere and its rings. Monday's swing-by saw the spacecraft go closer than ever before to the cloud tops - skimming just 1,600km (1,000 miles) above them, at 04:22 GMT (05:22 BST) on Monday. This low pass was designed to allow the probe to directly sample the gases of the extended upper-atmosphere. Saturn's bulk composition is thought to be about 75% hydrogen with the rest being helium (bar some trace components), explains Nicolas Altobelli, the European Space Agency's Cassini project scientist. ""It's expected that the heavier helium is sinking down,"" he told BBC News. ""Saturn radiates more energy than it's absorbing from the Sun, meaning there's gravitational energy which is being lost. And so getting a precise measure of the hydrogen and helium in the upper layers sets a constraint on the overall distribution of the material in the interior."" Cassini will send all the data back to Earth during its next contact on Tuesday. Dipping down into the atmosphere should create a drag on the spacecraft, requiring Cassini to use its thrusters to maintain a stable flight configuration and stop itself from tumbling. But the mission's scientists think any buffeting effects ought to be manageable. They are hopeful that when the post-pass analysis is done, the probe will be permitted to go even lower on the remaining four dip-downs before 15 September's goodbye plunge. Artwork: Cassini is running the narrow gap between the top of the planet's atmosphere and the rings The Cassini mission still has some big outstanding questions about Saturn. One of these relates to the length of a day on the planet. Researchers know it is roughly 10-and-a-half hours, but they would like a more precise number. The solution should come by looking for an offset between the magnetic field and the planet's rotation axis, but frustratingly all the probe's observations to date show these two features to be almost perfectly aligned. ""All magnetic field theory as we know it requires an offset,"" said Linda Spilker, the US space agency's Cassini project scientist. ""To generate a field, you need to keep the currents in the metallic hydrogen layer inside Saturn flowing, and without the offset the thinking is that the field would simply go away. ""What's going on? Is something shielding our ability to see the offset, or do we simply need a new theory? But without the tilt, without being able to see the tiny wobble, we cannot be more precise about the length of a day."" Dr Spilker said the mission team would continue to work on the problem. Cassini is a joint venture between the US, European and Italian space agencies. They are ending the probe's operations after 20 years because it is running low on fuel and will soon become uncontrollable. Scientists want to avoid the possibility of a future collision with Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus, which could conceivably support simple microbial life. And the only way to prevent that is to deliberately drive the probe to destruction in the atmosphere of the giant planet.

Sir Bruce Forsyth: 8 little-known facts,"Sir Bruce Forsyth, whohas died at the age of 89, hosted some of the biggest shows on British TV of the past 60 years - from Sunday Night at the London Palladium to Strictly Come Dancing. As well as the prime time game shows for which he was best known, there were many other sides to his long career, from movies to a TV sitcom and attempts to crack America. Sir Bruce is the only entertainer whose career spanned the entire TV era. He made his first appearance at the age of 11 on Come and Be Televised in 1939, just three years after regular BBC TV broadcasts began. He performed a song and tap dance routine and was interviewed by the programme's host Jasmine Bligh, who asked what his ambition was. He replied: ""I want to become a star and buy my mum a fur coat."" Days later, BBC TV was suspended because of the outbreak of war. Bruce turned professional three years later and his first advert in trade paper The Stage read: ""Bruce Forsyth: available for anything."" But he didn't find stardom until the age of 30, when he was chosen to host Sunday Night at the London Palladium on ITV. Before that, he was a jobbing performer on the variety circuit. ""I gave myself five years and I thought, if I don't do any good in five years, I don't want to end up being a frustrated performer [so] I'll get out of the business,"" he said. ""And the five years were nearly up, and I got the job at the Palladium."" Eileen Gourlay and Bruce Forsyth starred in Little Me After finding fame, he made his West End musical debut in 1964 in a show called Little Me, about fictional Hollywood diva Belle Poitrine. The show had come from Broadway, and Bruce played her various male patrons. The Times' drama critic described him as ""omni-competent"" and concluded that ""the honours of the evening go to the multiple performance of Bruce Forsyth as a senile slum landlord, thick-spectacled doughboy, leather-jacketed German film director, and egregiously patrician lover of Miss Poitrine's dreams"". Sir Bruce with Julie Andrews (left) and Beryl Reid in Star! That musical led him to the movies, with a role in Star!, the 1968 biopic of British actress Gertrude Lawrence, played by Julie Andrews. Sir Bruce played her tough vaudevillian father, and the film was nominated for seven Oscars - although none were for Sir Bruce's acting. He later said he wished he had done more acting. ""I'd like to have done more of that, but in Britain we tend to pigeonhole people. ""In Britain I'm really known as the game show [host]. That's the pigeonhole they've put me in, and that's where I'm stuck."" He also appeared in Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971. But he missed out on a role that could have really launched his film career - Fagin in the 1968 filmed version of Oliver! Brucie released a string of singles in the 1960s and '70s, although none made it to the charts. Some were novelty songs related to his TV career - like 1959'sI'm In Charge,external, named after his Sunday Night at the London Palladium catchphrase. There were other jolly pop songs, and in 1968 he sung the odd patriotic dittyI'm Backing Britain,external, the anthem of a campaign to boost the economy by urging workers to work an extra half an hour a day for free. And he appeared on Top of the Pops in 1975 performing Barry Manilow's Sandra, withlyrics,externalthat now sound horribly sexist, beginning: ""She's a great little housewife/Though sometimes she talks like a fool."" He was eager to replicate his British success across the Atlantic. In 1979, he took his one-man show to Broadway, which he described as ""a dream come true"". But he was angered when the British press seized on the negative reviews and described it as ""the most controversial episode of my professional career"". Seven years later, he returned to the US with an ABC game show called Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak. A YouTube clip,externalshows the enthusiastic American crowd greeting him with chants of ""Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!"" Despite that, and despite him showing his usual warmth and repartee, he didn't quite translate to a US audience and the show didn't last beyond its initial three-month run. He would have tried again to break the States - but his priorities lay with his family. ""I'd liked to have made it in America very much indeed, but it wasn't to be and I think I would have gone back there again and kept going on having a go for America,"" he said. ""Because I think with me being the all-round entertainer I could have stood a good chance. ""But at that time of making a decision, I met my darling wife Wilnelia and it sort of changed my attitude towards my life in general."" Sir Bruce left game shows behind for a while to star in a Thames TV sitcom in 1986 and 87. He played officious, overbearing supermarket manager Cecil Slinger in Slinger's Day - a sequel to Tripper's Day, which ended when its star Leonard Rossiter died in 1984. Sir Bruce's attempt at scripted TV comedycan be found on YouTube,external. As the new millennium dawned, it seemed that his career was fading. Play Your Cards Right had been axed by ITV - leading Brucie to havea rare fit of public anger,external, saying the channel's controller David Liddiment had ""embarrassed me, humiliated me, and shown me no respect whatsoever"". But a few years later, he was watching Have I Got News for You - which uses guest hosts - when Wilnelia turned to him and said: ""You could do that show."" He replied: ""I was just thinking the same thing, darling."" So he phoned team captain Paul Merton, who put his name forward to the producers. That appearance, which included a memorable round of Play Your Iraqi Cards Right, reminded the nation of the Brucie magic and directly led to his booking for Strictly Come Dancing, which launched the following year. If it had ever been in doubt, his status as a national treasure was assured.

Briton injured in Finland: 'I'm not a hero',"This video can not be played Hassan Zubier says heâs âno heroâ after being caught up in Finland attack A British man who went to the aid of victims of a knife attack in Finland has told the BBC he is ""not a hero"". Hassan Zubier, a paramedic born in Kent who now lives in Sweden, said he did ""what he was trained for"" when a knifeman stabbed two women to death in the city of Turku on Friday. Mr Zubier - who was injured during the attack - kicked the knifeman as he tried to save a woman's life. Police in Finland are treating the attack as a terrorist incident. Mr Zubier, 45, who was born in Dartford, was on holiday in Turku when he was caught up in the attack. Finland knifeman 'targeted women' He said he saw a man stabbing a woman as she lay on the ground. ""I saw the severe injuries she had,"" he told the BBC from his hospital bed, adding that he went over to try to stop the bleeding. ""The man came back. He tried to stab me. I kicked him off. He ran away. He came back. ""Then I felt someone like hitting me in the back. People screamed.  I was trying to save her life."" But the woman's injuries were so severe that she died in his arms. Hassan Zubier suffered serious injuries during the attack Mr Zubier said he was not a hero, but a ""human being who cares for other human beings"". ""It may sound silly, but that's me. I would do it again, anytime, because the world is such a dark place and if we don't help each other, who's going to help us? ""At the same time, a girl lost her life. I think it's so upsetting that I couldn't save her. This is the world we live in at this time."" The knifeman, an 18-year-old Moroccan, was arrested after being shot by police. Four other Moroccans have been held. The two women stabbed to death were both Finnish while eight people were injured. This video can not be played ""We won't ever give in"": Defiant message from eyewitness Anttoni Numminen Police say the knifeman appeared to choose women as targets, with six of the eight wounded being female. Prime Minister Juha Sipila told a press conference that Finland had experienced a terror attack for the first time.

Head teacher 'locked children in rooms',"Alison Earl was the head teacher at Tollgate Primary School from 2014 to 2015 A head teacher who punished children by locking them in rooms has been found guilty of unprofessional conduct. The National College for Teaching and Leadership panel was told children at Tollgate Primary School in Bury St Edmunds could regularly be heard ""shouting or crying"" from the rooms. Alison Earl admitted leaving children in the rooms, but denied it was for an ""inappropriate"" amount of time. The education secretary is to rule on what disciplinary action she will face. The hearing heard, under Mrs Earl's leadership, staff would put children into solitary confinement for bad behaviour. It was heard staff would hold the handle from outside so children could not get out. The handle was then moved higher up the door so the children could not reach it, the panel was told. In summer 2015, a second room, known as the ""blue room"", was created. It was about 2m (7ft) by 1.5m (5ft) and teachers could not observe it from the main corridor. A few children were put into solitary confinement in this room, the panel was told. Mrs Earl said she expected staff to supervise children who were put into solitary confinement, but the panel said it had no evidence to support her claim. The 55-year-old, however, did admit putting children at risk. The panel said Mrs Earl had shown a ""lack of insight into the impact of the room upon the wellbeing and safety of pupils and a disregard for the law and guidance"". Mrs Earl had been the head teacher at the school between 2014 and 2015. She resigned in December 2015 after an investigation was carried out.

Cars left dangling as car park collapses,"No-one was injured in the collapse Vehicles have been left dangling from the edge of a city centre car park after it partially collapsed. Part of a wall came away at the NCP Nottingham City site in Cumberland Place shortly after 04:00 BST. A spokesman for NCP said the front fascia had ""fallen"" and road closures were in place. Structural engineers are at the scene assessing the situation. No-one was injured in the collapse. It is not yet known when the car park will reopen George Cook, of Scunthorpe, had parked his car at the site and was staying nearby. ""I heard a bang at about 03:30,"" he said. ""I was not sure what it was, I looked out the window, but couldn't see anything. ""I came back and cars were over hanging the car park. It was a bit of a shock. Thankfully one was not mine."" Staff and structural engineers are on site The spokesman for the NCP said staff were on site helping any customers who had cars inside the building. It is not yet known when the car park will reopen, but people are being allowed in to collect their cars.

IS losses 'increasing UK terror threat',"This video can not be played IS is inspiring home-grown attackers rather than sending them to the front line, Ben Wallace says The UK terror threat is increasing as so-called Islamic State loses territory in Syria and Iraq, the security minister has said. Ben Wallace said extremists were trying to carry out attacks in the UK because they were either unable to join IS overseas or had returned from there. He said Europe was now under ""constant attack"" from terror groups. Mr Wallace also warned there needed to be more understanding of the anti-terrorism programme Prevent. It comes after IS said it was behind theBarcelona attack on 17 Augustwhen a van drove down Las Ramblas, killing 13 and injuring scores more. The terror group lost its Mosul stronghold to Iraqi forces last month and international efforts to bring down its ""capital"" Raqqa in Syria continue. IS seized Raqqa in 2014 and established its headquarters there, with former prime minister David Cameron calling it ""the head of the snake"". Mr Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think the threat is still increasing, partly driven by the fact Isis is collapsing in Syria and people are either unable to get out there to fight for Isis and so they look to do something at home, or also because people have come back and tried to inspire people with their stories and tales of the caliphate. ""I think those two things mean that the threat is to some extent increasing."" IS says it was behind the Barcelona attack on 17 August The security minister also said it was vital for people to engage with the government's anti-terrorism programme, Prevent, which aims to stop people from becoming radicalised. But he said he disagreed with comments from the police lead for Prevent who said the programme should be compulsory. Under the scheme, police and other organisations try to build relationships with the public - including faith leaders, teachers and doctors - and urge them to report any concerns to them, but currently any engagement is voluntary. Mr Wallace added that he had ordered the release of more information to increase understanding of Prevent and its successes to get more people to engage with it. ""There's no ifs and buts nowadays. ""If we're going to stop these people who use everyday items such as vehicles and kitchen knives to murder people on our streets, we are going to have to all engage together with Prevent and we are having real success when we do that."" Mr Wallace added: ""We must offer an alternative and help people be protected from that [radicalisation].""

Barcelona attack terror cell 'dismantled',"Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, has emerged as the main suspect in the Barcelona attack The jihadist cell behind the attack in Barcelona that left 13 people dead on Thursday has been fully dismantled, the Spanish government says. Officials reached this conclusion ""after examining the people who died, the people who were arrested and carrying out identity checks"", Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said. But the regional Catalan government said there could be further arrests, as a key suspect is still being sought. A special Mass is due to be held later. The service in memory of the victims will take place at Barcelona's famous Sagrada Familia Cathedral, and will be attended by King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain. Thursday's attack in the Catalan capital saw a van driven at high speed along Las Ramblas where it smashed into dozens of people walking along the pedestrianised avenue popular with tourists and residents alike. Spanish police are searching for Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who they suspect may be the driver who escaped the scene on foot. Only hours later, early on Friday, there was a second van attack in Cambrils, west of Barcelona. This video can not be played WATCH: What is the mood in Barcelona? A woman was killed and police shot dead five suspected attackers, including Moussa Oukabir, 17, originally reported as the key suspect in the Barcelona attack. Oukabir is suspected of using his brother's documents to rent the van used in Barcelona and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, that was intended as a getaway vehicle. The terror cell is reported to comprise 12 men. The Catalan Interior Minster, Joaquim Forn, stressed that the police operation could not be considered over until all those suspected of being part of the cell were in custody. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows the van speeding down Las Ramblas Police say the suspects had been planning more sophisticated attacks, but an explosion on Wednesday at a house in the town of Alcanar deprived them of bomb material, so they carried out simpler attacks using vehicles. Police have found the remains of at least three people at the Alcanar house, El Pais newspaper reports. Abouyaaqoub lived in the town of Ripoll to the north of Barcelona. Three people have been arrested in Ripoll, and one in Alcanar. In Ripoll the apartment of an imam was raided on Saturday. Another van, a Renault Kangoo, is also being sought, amid reports it may have been driven across the border into France.

Sacked Bannon vows to 'go to war',"Mr Trump reportedly grew weary of Mr Bannon taking credit Donald Trump's former chief strategist has vowed to go to war against the president's opponents, after being fired from his job at the White House. Steve Bannon, who has returned as head of ultra-conservative website Breitbart News, said he would fight for the agenda that won Mr Trump the election. ""I've got my hands back on my weapons,"" he said. ""It's Bannon the Barbarian."" Mr Bannon helped shape the America First campaign message but fell foul of more moderate White House forces. The 63-year-old has been accused of voicing anti-Semitic and white supremacist views. He isthe latest high-profile figure to leave the White House team. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn; press secretary Sean Spicer; chief of staff Reince Priebus and communications director Anthony Scaramucci have all gone. Mr Trump paid tribute to Mr Bannon in an early-morning tweet on Saturday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There had been suggestions Mr Trump was under renewed pressure to sack Mr Bannon following the violence at a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend, when a car was driven into counter-protesters, killing a woman. But he toldthe Weekly Standard,externalthat he had informed Chief of Staff John Kelly and Mr Trump on 7 August that he would announce his resignation on the 14th.

In his Weekly Standard interview, Mr Bannon said: ""The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over. ""We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It'll be something else. And there'll be all kinds of fights, and there'll be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over.""

Mr Bannon added: ""I built a [expletive] machine at Breitbart. And now I'm about to go back, knowing what I know, and we're about to rev that machine up."" Breitbart itself carried the headline: 'Populist Hero' Stephen K Bannon Returns Home to Breitbart. News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow said: ""Breitbart gained an executive chairman with his finger on the pulse of the Trump agenda."" Breitbart executive Joel Pollak responded to the return of Mr Bannon with a singled-worded, hashtag tweet: #WAR. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Steve Bannon may be out as a senior White House adviser, but Bannonism - if that's what it can properly be called - is still firmly entrenched in the White House. Donald Trump has repeatedly boasted that the success of his presidential campaign should properly be attributed to him, not Mr Bannon. And, in the end, Mr Bannon's desire to take credit for that win may have been what did him in. It certainly wasn't because of any sharp ideological divides between the president and the former head of Breitbart News. Border security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - all were themes that Mr Trump ran on from the start, which Mr Bannon only sharpened and focused. They're also issues Mr Trump has pushed in recent weeks, even as Mr Bannon has been increasingly marginalised. Mr Bannon's firing will be seen as a win for chief of staff John Kelly, whose attempts to instil discipline in the White House will get a boost without the free-wheeling Mr Bannon roaming the hallways. Trump was Trump before Mr Bannon came on the scene, however. And as the rollercoaster ride that was politics this week indicates, the president isn't changing anytime soon. Mr Trump raised eyebrows this year when he elevated Mr Bannon to the National Security Council, the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs. But he was subsequently removed in a move that was seen as a sign of National Security Adviser HR McMaster's growing influence over the president. The photo that highlights White House turmoil Mr Bannon has reportedly feuded with Mr McMaster as well as Gary Cohn, the director of the president's National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs chief viewed as a ""globalist"". Mr Cohn, along with President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter, Ivanka Trump, were viewed as threats to Mr Bannon's White House agenda. Mr Trump had reportedly grown weary of Mr Bannon taking credit for his victory and also saw him as a serial leaker of information to the press. Mr Bannon's interview this week with the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, also reportedly infuriated the president. The White House aide was quoted as dismissing the idea of a military solution in North Korea, undercutting Mr Trump.

Thousands defy Boston right-wing rally,"This video can not be played How a day of rival protests unfolded Tens of thousands of anti-racism protesters have opposed the ""Free Speech"" rally in the US city of Boston that featured right-wing speakers. The rally on Boston Common, which attracted only a small crowd, disbanded early and the participants were escorted out by police. The organisers had said they would not give a platform to racism or bigotry. Tensions are high after violent demonstrationsin Charlottesville, Virginialast weekend turned deadly. The Boston Herald reported that up to 30,000 people attended the protest. Demonstrators had gathered at a Boston sports centre and then marched en masse to the common. Those at the conservative rally were confined to the bandstand area on Boston Common. Crowds of anti-racism protesters surrounded the bandstand but were kept some distance away. Hundreds of police were deployed and clashes broke out later between some police and anti-rally protesters. Police clashed with some protesters outside the park Large crowds of anti-racism demonstrators make their way to Boston Common Police said that officers had had rocks and bottles of urine thrown at them. Thirty-three people have been arrested. Many anti-rally protesters wore stickers showing the face of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who died when a car was driven into a crowd of counter-protesters at last Saturday's far-right rally in Charlottesville. Who was Heather Heyer? ""It's time to do something. We are out here to add an extra body to the numbers of those who resist,"" said Katie Zipps, who travelled from Malden, north of Boston, for the protest. The crowd chanted ""No Nazis, no KKK, no fascists in the USA!"" and carried banners with slogans such as ""Stop pretending your racism is patriotism"". Boston Mayor Marty Walsh later thanked the counter-demonstrators, who he said ""came out to share the message of love, not hate.""

Thousands defy far-right rally in Boston,"This video can not be played How a day of rival protests unfolded Tens of thousands of anti-racism protesters have opposed the ""Free Speech"" rally in the US city of Boston that featured right-wing speakers. The rally on Boston Common, which attracted only a small crowd, disbanded early and the participants were escorted out by police. The organisers had said they would not give a platform to racism or bigotry. Tensions are high after violent demonstrationsin Charlottesville, Virginialast weekend turned deadly. The Boston Herald reported that up to 30,000 people attended the protest. Demonstrators had gathered at a Boston sports centre and then marched en masse to the common. Those at the conservative rally were confined to the bandstand area on Boston Common. Crowds of anti-racism protesters surrounded the bandstand but were kept some distance away. Hundreds of police were deployed and clashes broke out later between some police and anti-rally protesters. Police clashed with some protesters outside the park Large crowds of anti-racism demonstrators make their way to Boston Common Police said that officers had had rocks and bottles of urine thrown at them. Thirty-three people have been arrested.

Who was Heather Heyer? ""It's time to do something. We are out here to add an extra body to the numbers of those who resist,"" said Katie Zipps, who travelled from Malden, north of Boston, for the protest.

Trumps skips ceremony amid boycott threat,"The White House said Donald and Melania Trump extended their ""sincerest congratulations"" to award recipients US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are to skip an arts awards ceremony to allow those taking part ""to celebrate without political distraction"", the White House says. Some of those due to take part in the Kennedy Center Honors had said they would boycott the White House reception held before the awards ceremony. The honours recognise the lifetime contributions of performing artists. Many artists have been angered by Mr Trump's plans to scrap funding. In his budget outline in March, he pushed for the end of federal support for public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts. President Trump is also mired in controversy over his response to recent violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia. Republicans and Democrats alike have criticised him for insisting that anti-racism protesters were also to blame for the violence that ended in the death of a woman. The White House said in a statement: ""The president and first lady have decided not to participate in this year's [Kennedy Center Honors] activities to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction. ""First Lady Melania Trump, along with her husband President Donald J Trump, extend their sincerest congratulations and well wishes to all of this year's award recipients for their many accomplishments."" Those being honoured are Carmen de Lavallade, singer Gloria Estefan, hip-hop artist LL COOL J, singer Lionel Richie and TV producer Norman Lear Dancer and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade, who is due to be honoured at the December ceremony, said earlier this week that she would boycott the related White House reception for honourees. ""In light of the socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our existing leadership is choosing to engage in, and in keeping with the principles that I and so many others have fought for, I will be declining the invitation to attend the reception at the White House,""she said in a statement.,external Singer Lionel Richie had also suggested he might not attend, telling the NBC Today programme: ""I'm not really happy with what's going on right now with the controversies. They're weekly, daily, hourly."" TV producer Norman Lear, who is to receive a lifelong artistic achievement award, also said he would not attend the White House reception. ""It is more important now than ever that we stand up for artists, for artistic expression, and for the valiant fight that artists fight to reveal the wonder and oneness of the human spirit,"" he said.

New manhunt for Barcelona attack driver,"Abouyaaqoub, 22, is believed to be on the run The driver in Thursday's van attack that killed 13 people in a tourist area of Barcelona may still be alive and on the run, Spanish police say. They are hunting for Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, now named by Spanish media as the suspected driver. A man previously reported as the key suspect, Moussa Oukabir, 17, was one of five men killed by police after a later attack in Cambrils, west of Barcelona. Police say the suspects had been planning more sophisticated attacks. They said blasts on Wednesday at a house in the town of Alcanar deprived plotters of bomb material, so they carried out simpler attacks using vehicles. Abouyaaqoub, 22, lived in the town of Ripoll to the north of Barcelona. Three people have been arrested in Ripoll and one person in Alcanar. What we know so far Barcelona tells world 'I'm not afraid' This video can not be played WATCH: What is the mood in Barcelona? Oukabir had previously been seen as the central figure, but police now think that Abouyaaqoub is the main suspect. Oukabir is suspected of using his brother's documents to rent the van used in the Barcelona attack and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, that was intended as a getaway vehicle. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows the van speeding down Las Ramblas Another van, a Renault Kangoo, is also being sought, amid reports it may have been driven across the border into France. In the early hours of Friday police shot dead five attackers, including Oukabir, in Cambrils after the men drove a car into pedestrians, killing one woman and injuring six other people. The attackers' vehicle overturned and when the men got out they were quickly fired upon by police. One of the attackers was reportedly brandishing a knife. Barcelona rejects hate after attacks The men were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts but these proved to be fake. American honeymooner killed in Barcelona Spain attacks timeline Spain's long anti-terror experience Officials believe a cell of at least a dozen people was operating at the Alcanar house, which was being used as a bomb factory to prepare more devastating attacks than those in Barcelona and Cambrils. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said on Saturday that the cell had been ""totally dismantled"", but that security measures around the country were being increased, particularly in tourist areas. However, the Catalan regional government suggested several more suspects were still at large. Special police controls are being introduced at Saturday's two La Liga football matches in Barcelona and Girona. The nation's security alert level is staying unchanged as there is no information suggesting an imminent attack. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas attack, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it.

He was widely reported to be missing. However, the Catalan police, responding to inquiries,tweeted,externalthat they had neither been looking for nor found any missing child. The victims and the injured had all been located, they said. Catalan emergency services gave a new breakdown of the injured on Saturday: Barcelona attack: 12 critical, 24 serious, 11 less serious, 3 minor Cambrils attack:1 serious, 2 less serious, 1 minor More on the victims The Mellouli family from Tunisia on holiday in Barcelona Pegged on strings between the lamp-posts and plane trees on the packed boulevard, more and more sheets of white paper flap in the breeze. Imprinted with a red love heart, each contains a message left by a stroller, reflecting on the attack. Messages of love for Barcelona abound but there is anger too. ""Now we need to take action,"" reads one. ""I don't want to run any more. Let's not run away from them, let's run after them."" The Mellouli family's message, in French, says: ""Sousse (Tunisia) supports Barcelona against terrorism"". Sousse, the holiday resort where a gunman killed 38 people just over two years ago, now shares sorrow with Barcelona. ""We are very upset by what happened here,"" says the father, Slah, who is here on holiday with his family. ""We are all against terrorism. Islam is against terrorism too. What happened here is not Islam. Nobody can be safe from terrorism now and we must unite against it.""

Hassan Zubier, a paramedic born in Kent who now lives in Sweden, said he did ""what he was trained for"" when a knifeman stabbed two women to death in the city of Turku on Friday. Mr Zubier - who was injured during the attack - kicked the knifeman as he tried to save a woman's life. Police in Finland are treating the attack as a terrorist incident.

""I saw the severe injuries she had,"" he told the BBC from his hospital bed, adding that he went over to try to stop the bleeding. ""The man came back. He tried to stab me. I kicked him off. He ran away. He came back. ""Then I felt someone like hitting me in the back. People screamed.  I was trying to save her life."" But the woman's injuries were so severe that she died in his arms. Hassan Zubier suffered serious injuries during the attack Mr Zubier said he was not a hero, but a ""human being who cares for other human beings"". ""It may sound silly, but that's me.

Briton injured in Finland 'not a hero' The ages of the casualties ranged from 15 to 67, police said, but gave no more details. PM Juha Sipila told a press conference that Finland had experienced a terror attack for the first time. Police said in a statement: ""The act had been investigated as murder, but during the night we received additional information which indicates that the criminal offences are now terrorist killings."" They said the identity of the 18-year-old Moroccan was known, but they have not released it. At a later press briefing, they said the suspect had arrived in Finland in 2016 and had ""been part of the asylum process"". Crista Granroth, from the National Bureau of Investigation, said: ""It seems that the suspect chose women as his targets, because the men who were wounded were injured when they tried to help, or prevent the attacks."" She said six of the eight wounded people were women. Candles were lit at the scene of the stabbings in Turku In addition to the four other arrests, an international search warrant has been issued for a sixth suspect. The 18-year-old Moroccan is still being treated in hospital for a gunshot wound to the leg. Two other people are also still in hospital. The UK embassy in Finland said it had ""been in touch with the British national and offered consular support"". The attack happened in the Puutori/Market Square area of Turku. Police said the alarm was raised at 16:02 local time (13:02 GMT) on Friday, when a man was reported to have attacked passers-by with a knife. Witnesses said he then ran to a nearby square and stabbed more people before he was shot in the thigh. Police said he was arrested at 16:05. One eyewitness, Laura Laine, told Reuters: ""First thing we heard was a young woman, screaming like crazy. I thought it's just kids having fun... but then people started to move around and I saw a man with a knife in his hand, stabbing a woman. ""Then a person ran towards us shouting 'he has a knife' and everybody from the terrace ran inside. Next, a woman came into the cafe. She was crying hysterically, down on her knees, saying someone's neck has been slashed open."" Flags are being flown at half-mast in Finland. Interior Minister Paula Risikko said on Twitter: ""Terrorists want to pit people against each other. We will not let this happen. Finnish society will not be defeated by fear or hatred.""

Big Ben's light to be switched off,"A lamp at the top of Elizabeth Tower - which is switched on in the evening whenever Parliament is sitting - is to stop shining for the first time in more than 70 years. The Ayrton Light, located above the Great Bell - known as Big Ben - needs to be fully dismantled and restored. A temporary light will replace it. Installed in 1885, it was previously turned off only during both world wars. Big Ben will not chime regularly until 2021because of repairs to the tower. How do you take a good photo of Big Ben? Big Ben's bongs to fall silent until 2021 The light is said to have been installed at the request of Queen Victoria, so that she could see from Buckingham Palace when members of either the Commons or the Lords were sitting after dark. It is named after Acton Smee Ayrton, a Liberal politician who was First Commissioner of Works between 1869 and 1873. It is not yet known when the light will switch off, or how long it will be off for. Big Ben will not be heard from midday on Monday. The House of Commons has said it will look again at the length of time it will be silenced after ""concerns"". The Ayrton light Parliament said it had to protect workers carrying out the renovations. But Prime Minister Theresa May said ""it can't be right"" that the bell will not chime regularly again for four years. It will still sound for important events including New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday. The Great Bell forms part of the Great Clock in the Elizabeth Tower - commonly known as Big Ben It weighs 13.7 tonnes and the Elizabeth Tower stands 96m (315ft) tall Every hour it strikes an E note, and every 15 minutes four ""quarter bells"" chime To stop the chimes, the striking hammers will be locked until 2021 How do you take a good photo of Big Ben?

Rare 6th Century pendant found in field,"The Anglo-Saxon pendant was found in a field near Attleborough on Monday A rare 6th Century gold pendant featuring images from a Byzantine coin has been found by a metal detectorist more than 1,500 years after being made. The early Anglo-Saxon pendant is imprinted with an image of Emperor Justinian and is thought to have been made in France. It was found by Godfrey Pratt in a field near Attleborough, Norfolk. Mr Pratt said he had made some finds which were of archaeological interest, but this one was ""bling"". Mr Pratt, who lives near the town, said: ""It appeared to be a golden bottle-top but when I looked closer I found it to be something far more significant. ""I recognised it to be a gold pendant... it's extremely rare. ""Very few have been found in the UK."" Mr Pratt, who has been metal detecting for six years, said he was known at his club as the ""king of bling because of the trinkets I bring in,"" but he had never previously found gold. He has since informed the Norfolk Historic Environment Record (HER) and the county's museum service about his discovery. Metal detectorist Godfrey Pratt said he knew the find was interesting when he set eyes on it Finds officer Adrian Marsden said it was ""rare"" and made from high-quality gold. Dr Marsden said the piece of jewellery had possibly gone into the ground in a burial, ""probably as a very much-loved pendant."" He said it could indicate there was a cemetery on the field where it was found. ""There could be more stuff out there, time will tell,"" said Dr Marsden. Mr Pratt started searching the site with a team from the Norfolk Heritage Recovery Group in Norwich as part of a project approved by the Norfolk HER. The pendant will go to the coroner and then to the British Museum for valuation.

Bid to end Polanski rape case fails,"Roman Polanski (R) raped Samantha Geimer in 1977 A court in Los Angeles has refused a plea by a sex-abuse victim of the film director Roman Polanski to have the 40 year-old rape case dismissed. Samantha Geimer, who is now 54, had told the Los Angeles Superior Court she had forgiven him and wanted to move on. But the judge ruled that her testimony was evidence of the damage done to her, and that Polanski had to face justice. The director fled to France after being accused of drugging and raping Ms Geimer - then 13 years old - in 1977. He had admitted statutory rape and served 42 days in prison. He left over concern that his plea bargain deal would be scrapped. In June, Ms Geimer told the court that she felt the case should be dropped: ""I would implore you to do this for me, out of mercy for myself,"" she said. But in his ruling on Friday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon said the case could not be rejected ""merely because it would be in the victim's best interest"". ""As eloquently described by Ms Geimer, his conduct continues to harm her and compounds the trauma of the sexual assault committed against her that gave rise to this case,"" he said. The slow-burning Polanski saga The ruling comes just days after another woman said she had been sexually molested by Mr Polanski in 1973, when she was 16. The woman, named only as Robin, cannot sue Polanski because of the statute of limitation, but said she could testify against him in the case involving Ms Geimer. The French-Polish director's lawyer said his client was disappointed by the ruling, but would not be returning to the US.

"Bye Bye Bannon, Washington's second most powerful man","Chief strategist Steve Bannon has become the latest casualty of the Trump White House Is Steve Bannon the second most powerful man in the world? The question was posed by Time magazine back in February, when it placed the then White House chief strategist on its coveted cover. Bannon was said to be Donald Trump's alter ago, a Svengali-like figure whose fingerprints were everywhere: from the fiercely nationalistic ""American carnage"" inaugural address to the decision to leave the Paris Climate Change Agreement, from the botched travel ban to the White House onslaught against the ""fake media"" - who Bannon memorably labelled ""the opposition party."" His crumpled appearance was a form of power dressing. He was said to be the only West Wing adviser allowed into the Oval Office without a suit and tie. He was also the fiercest proponent of the ""Let Trump be Trump"" doctrine, an unbending approach which the chief campaign strategist believed had won the billionaire the White House. The cover of Time magazine showed Bannon at the height of his powers, but it may also have set in motion his eventual downfall. The magazine labelled him ""The Great Manipulator"", a description that reportedly ""annoyed"" Donald Trump - a president not used to sharing the limelight and unaccustomed to being cast as a puppet. In the court of Donald Trump, there would be no powers behind the throne. In the warring West Wing, which often makes Game of Thrones look like a Sunday school outing, Bannon became the most aggressive combatant. At least until the arrival of the short-lived Anthony Scaramucci, whosepersonal feud with Bannonproduced the most memorable (and unprintable) insult ever uttered on the record by a White House aide. On his enemies list were Trump advisers he derided as ""globalists"" - the president's daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, the National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, the deputy national security adviser Dina Powell and the national economics adviser Gary Cohn. In early April, the New York Times reported that relations between Bannon and Kushner had reached the ""point of breakdown"", without any hope of reconciliation. The photo that highlights White House turmoil The White House revolving door: Who's gone? ""Here's the reason there's no middle ground,"" Mr Bannon reportedly told the president's influential son-in-law. ""You're a Democrat."" To Bannon, the globalists obstructed his beloved America First agenda. They were dangerously moderate, metropolitan liberals who did not truly want Trump to be Trump. Bannon was reportedly at odds with the more moderate members of Trump's inner circle like Jared Kushner (right) During this power struggle, Bannon had formed an improbable relationship of convenience with Reince Preibus, a member of the Republican establishment and the first White House chief of staff. However, when Preibus was replaced as chief of staff by the former marine general John Kelly it looked as if Bannon would soon be shown the door. One wonders now how long Bannon allies like the presidential adviser Sebastian Gorka will now survive. Bannonism lives on in the White House Bannon will return to Breitbart News, a right-wing favoured source of news and views for many of Donald Trump's most loyal, red-capped supporters. Journalists close to Bannon believe he will not necessarily turn his Breitbart firepower on Donald Trump, but rather the ""globalists"".Jonathan Swan of Axios reports,externalthe website will go ""thermonuclear"" against ""globalists"". Bannon has also apparently told associates he will turn the website into ""a killing machine"". As Maggie Haberman, the New York Times' impeccably-sourced White House reporter notes: ""Bannon is much more of a problem for the White House staff from the outside than inside it."" Bannon is a powerhouse of the American right-wing news media through Brietbart Many of Trump's most diehard supporters will doubtless see his departure as a betrayal, a breach of faith. The administration's most powerful nationalist no longer occupies a West Wing office. A Bannon-less White House will produce a Trump-lite White House. Who is left behind to urge Trump to be Trump? Joel B. Pollak, a senior editor at Breitbart, reacted to the news of Bannon's exit with aone-word tweet,external: ""#WAR."" Then he penned a rapid response column, warning: ""It may turn out to be the beginning of the end for the Trump administration."" Bannon himself evidently takes a different view. Following his resignation, he told his biographer Joshua Green: ""If there's any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents - on Capitol Hill, in the media and in corporate America."" Trump doubtless believes that he can still rely on the loyalty of the Bannon right. His tweets often seem aimed squarely at those people. But Bannon helped amplify his nativist messaging. He was the president's most influential hard right guarantor, a key emissary to his most admiring and energised constituency. Paradoxes abound about the timing of his exit. It came in the week that Trump seemed to be at his most Trump-like, with his highly controversial ""both sides to blame"" reaction to the deadly violence in Charlottesville and his forays into the historical culture wars over Confederate statues Bannon leaves at the end of the most overtly nationalist few days of the Trump presidency. Another irony is that it was Bannon wholabelled the white supremacists""a collection of clowns"" - precisely the sort of language that many mainstream Republicans hoped the president himself would use. Steve Bannon will no longer be cast as the second most powerful man in the world, or America, or Washington. But he arguably remains the most influential figure on the insurgent right, a constituency that Donald Trump is reliant upon for a second term in the White House.

'Didn't he do well' - Sir Bruce mourned,"Sir Bruce Forsyth in trademark pose, here at Glastonbury Festival Saturday morning's papers are full of tributes to Sir Bruce Forsyth. The headlines, as expected, make full use of a couple of his most famous catchphrases - ""nice to see you"" and ""didn't he do well"". For the Daily Express,external, Brucie was ""Mr Showbusiness from top to toe"" who had the nation glued to their TV screens. So much so, it says, that publicans campaigned to have Sunday Night at the Palladium start an hour later to stop pubs from emptying just before the show started at 21:00. The Daily Mirror agrees,externalthat he captured the nation with an ""old-school, sequinned brand of showbiz"" that was somehow timeless. According to the Daily Mail,external, Sir Bruce was ""a perennially good-humoured life enhancer, who was never mean or malicious"". Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Michael Hogan says the presenter was part of our ""cultural DNA"" and the last of the BBC's great entertainers. ""We are not afraid"" is theheadline in the i newspaper,external, referring to defiant chants from the crowds who took to the streets in Barcelona to pay their respects to those injured in Thursday's terrorist attacks. But the Express says,externalthat message of defiance must be matched by serious action. For the Telegraph,external, the atrocity is an opportunity for Britain and the EU to put aside their differences, and operate as allies in a dangerous world. Europeans, it says must do what the extremists refuse to do - accept our differences and forge a new partnership. The Sun takes a similar line,external, saying that Brexit does not mean we will desert our fellow Europeans in a time of crisis. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Guardian has a warning from Stephen Hawking,externalthat the NHS is heading towards a US-style insurance system. The physicist tells the paper that the crisis in the health service has been caused by political decisions - including underfunding and cuts - and the new contract imposed on junior doctors. The government defended its record on the NHS, and insisted it is committed to a system that is free at the point of use. The Times is somewhat dismissive,externalof Sir Vince Cable's foray into the world of fiction, especially his attempts at a sex scene. His novel, Open Arms, is out next month. Although it is a political thriller, there is barely a Liberal Democrat in sight - although according to Sir Vince that is not because he thinks his party is marginal. The Times begs to differ. No doubt, it says, he focuses on Labour and the Tories because describing any sort of three-way split would be beyond his ability as a writer. According to theTelegraph,external, commuters in London next week could be treated to an unusual sight as they cross Green Park.
