'One smoke leads to daily habit for most',"At least two-thirds of those who try cigarettes go on to become daily smokers, even if only temporarily, research suggests. Data from the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand found 60.3% of people had tried smoking and an estimated 68.9% of those progressed to a daily habit. The study's authors said the research showed the ""remarkable hold"" cigarettes could establish after one experience. They said it confirmed the importance of stopping cigarette experimentation. Why young people are now less likely to smoke Quit smoking campaign backs e-cigs Themeta-analysis, published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research,external, was based on 215,000 respondents to eight surveys between 2000 and 2016 contained in the Global Health Data Exchange. Lead researcher Prof Peter Hajek, from Queen Mary University of London, said it was the first time the link between trying a first cigarette and becoming a regular smoker had been documented in such a large set of data. ""We've found that the conversion rate from first-time smoker to daily smoker is surprisingly high, which helps confirm the importance of preventing cigarette experimentation in the first place,"" he said. ""The UK is seeing a dramatic reduction in smoking at the moment and this tallies with recent findings that only 19% of 11- to 15-year-olds have ever tried a cigarette, so the good news is that we are on the right track."" In 2016, 15.5% of adults from the UK smoked - about 7.6 million people - according to the Office for National Statistics, down from 19.9% in 2010. In the same period, 19.3% of 18- to 24-year-olds were smokers, compared with 25.8% in 2010. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health, called for the greater government regulation of tobacco sales. ""The government is refusing to introduce licensing for tobacco retailers, even though there is strong support for this both from the public and retailers,"" she said. However, the study's authors said there were limitations to the research. One was that the surveys had yielded different results for the proportions who had progressed to becoming daily smokers - from 52% in one in the US to 82% in one in the UK - which meant the 68.9% figure was an estimate, as a weighted average of the figures. The authors also said there were questions about the accuracy of people's recall of their smoking history. Public health minister Steve Brine said: ""Britain is a world leader in tobacco control, and thanks to our tough action smoking rates in England are at an all-time low. ""We recently launched a new tobacco control plan to map the path to a smoke-free generation and are working to educate people about the risks and support them to quit for good.""

Farron regrets saying gay sex not a sin,"This video can not be played Speaking on Premier Christian Radio he said he had been ""foolish and wrong"" Tim Farron has said he regrets stating he did not believe gay sex was a sin during last year's general election. The ex-Lib Dem leader told Christian Radio he had been ""foolish and wrong"" and had spoken partly to try and get the issue of his faith ""off the table"". The committed Christian said the focus on his beliefs stopped him getting his message across during the campaign. ""It was a little bit like having your main advertising hoarding permanently damaged and vandalised,"" he said. Mr Farron also said he had been right to step down immediately after the election, in which the party did not make as much ground as it had hoped, saying he found himself in a situation where ""either I let the party down or I compromised my faith"". Farron: I don't think gay sex is a sin Christianity is seen as dangerous - Farron During the six-week long campaign, he was asked repeatedly about his religious beliefs and, specifically, about whether he believed gay sex was a sin. After initially appearing not to answer the question directly, he said he did not want people getting the ""wrong impression"" about his views, telling the BBC ""I don't believe that gay sex is a sin"". In an interview with Premier Christian Radio, Mr Farron - who is now the party's environment spokesman as well as MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale - said he now regretted not being honest with himself at the time and admitted his answers had been motivated, partly, by political expediency. Asked whether he had felt under pressure to deal with the issue while touring the country, he replied: ""The bottom line is, of course, I did."" ""There are things - including that - that I said that I regret. There was a sense I felt I had to get this off my table: here's a general election, a great opportunity for the Liberal Democrats... and all they wanted to do was talk about my Christian beliefs and what it meant."" This video can not be played What Tim Farron told the BBC during the election campaign ""I would say foolishly and wrongly, [I] attempted to push it away by giving an answer that, frankly, was not right."" Part of the difficulty he said he found himself wrestling with was the different understanding of what sin constitutes for Christians and non-Christians. ""In the end, if you are a Christian you have a very clear idea of what sin is. It is us falling short of the glory of God, and that is something all of us equally share. ""So to be asked that question is essentially to persecute one group of human beings because sin is something, Jesus excepted, we are all guilty of. But if you are not a Christian, what does sin mean? It is to be accused of something, to be condemnatory, and so we are talking different languages. While he said he could have tried to explain the Bible's teaching on sex and sexuality, he said it would have been ""naive in the extreme"" to expect journalists to give him a hearing on the theological details. Reflecting on his experience, he said that while he did not believe there was ""a wicked agenda"" to marginalise or ridicule Christians, he said there was a risk of society becoming ""tolerant of everything apart from the things we don't like"". He added: ""There are some who just can't comprehend that somebody can have really strong convictions and be a Bible-believing Christian on the one hand and at the same time really passionately believing in people's rights to make their own choices, which essentially is what liberalism is."" Sir Vince Cable, who succeeded Mr Farron as leader, was quick to stress that his colleague's views did not represent party policy. Allow Twitter content?

M&S to stop selling 'cauliflower steak',"The supermarket said the plastic tray packaging was designed to protect the product Marks and Spencer says it will stop selling its ""cauliflower steak"" after shoppers mocked the product. The veggie steak - two slices of cauliflower and a lemon and herb drizzle - was being sold for Â£2. Customers argued a whole cauliflower could be bought for Â£1 in its shops and raised concerns about excess packaging. An M&S spokeswoman said: ""We work hard to create quick and convenient meals for customers; however on this occasion we didn't get it right."" The cauliflower steak was part of the new M&S Veggie range and after an introductory offer, which reduced the price by 20%, it would have cost Â£2.50. The range was aimed at customers wanting a ""quick and convenient vegetarian meal option"",M&S told BBC Three. On Tuesday, the retailer said the plastic tray packaging was there to protect the product and that it was ""widely recyclable"". Allow Twitter content?

University bosses face pay limit rules,"Universities have been under pressure over senior pay University heads will be barred from being involved in setting their own salaries, under a new fair-pay code announced in the wake of claims of excessive pay for vice-chancellors. Senior pay would also be expected not to rise more quickly than the average for other academic staff. The voluntary code has been drawn up by the Committee of University Chairs. But the chief executive of the new Office for Students, Nicola Dandridge, said the proposals were ""insufficient"". She said that ""people are rightly concerned by the level of pay"", and not just the ""process"" by which it was decided. University heads' pay was put under intense scrutiny last year, with accusations of ""fat cat"" salaries and claims that some university leaders were overpaid and out of touch. The vice-chancellor of theUniversity of Bath stepped down amid the protests. After a meeting last month with the then universities minister, Jo Johnson,university leaders agreed to produce new guidelines on pay. Mr Johnson had called for restraint and had threatened the intervention of a new regulator. University leaders have now produced details of self-regulated rules, promising more transparency and a commitment that ""no-one can have any part in deciding their own remuneration"". ""Society has a right to know that taxpayers' funds are being properly used and that the institution is being managed in the interest of students, the economy and society,"" say the new rules. ""Senior post-holders must be fairly - but not excessively - rewarded for their work."" The proposals, out for consultation within the higher-education sector until March, emphasise the need for independence and expertise in the committees deciding senior pay. Universities will be expected to show how this pay relates to other staff. They will have to publish the ""pay multiples"" between the vice-chancellors' earnings and average salaries. If that multiple changes, the rules say that universities will have to publish an explanation. And vice-chancellors' earnings will have to include the value of any other benefits and bonuses. Chris Sayers, chair of the Committee of University Chairs, said the regulations would help to ""justify our decisions"" over pay. ""We need to keep senior post-holders' pay under review, and be able to justify our decisions. ""We must enshrine the values of transparency, fairness and accountability at the heart of our procedures to ensure we maintain the trust required for the long-term success of our world-leading sector.""

Armed heist at Ritz Paris nets millions,"Police guard the hotel's rear entrance on Cambon street Armed robbers have seized millions of euros worth of merchandise from a jewellery shop at the famous Ritz Hotel in Paris. Five men armed with axes smashed a window at the shop inside the hotel at about 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT), French media report. Three men have been arrested, police said, while others remain on the run. It is not clear whether any of the loot, estimated to be worth more than â¬4m (Â£3.5m), was recovered. The luxurious five-star Ritz is located in Place VendÃ´me, in Paris' historical first district on the right bank of the river Seine. The ministry of justice lies next door. The hotel includes a gallery shopping area near its rear entrance, which it says hosts five shops and 95 ""showcases"", selling jewellery, watches and luxury clothing. The Ritz is among the most luxurious hotels in Paris Local newspaper Le Parisien, citing a police source, reports that the robbery was interrupted by an officer on patrol, but two people escaped on a motorised scooter. The city's police commissioner issued a statement on Twitter thanking officers for their quick reactions, which led to the arrest of three men. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb also offered praise, saying they were ""a credit to our police"". Eyewitnesses reported a heavy police presence in the area. One hotel employee told the AFP news agency: ""We heard a loud noise and lots of racket in the street"". ""Passers-by took refuge in the hotel. We didn't know what was going on until someone told us there had been a robbery."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Woman 'killed dad and buried him',"This video can not be played Forensic teams at a property in Reddish after remains were found in a garden A man whose body was found buried in a garden was allegedly killed by his daughter several years ago, the BBC understands. Greater Manchester Police said a woman made a confession at Cheadle Heath police station on Sunday. On Tuesday, remains believed to be of Kenneth Coombes, were found in a garden in Matlock Road, Reddish, near Stockport. A 63-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder. It is thought the remains found in Reddish are that of Kenneth Coombes The woman was named locally as Barbara Coombes. A force spokesman said the man had not been formally identified but his family had been informed and was being supported. Forensic officers have been searching the address since the discovery Det Insp Dan Clegg said: ""The investigation is still in its early stages and many questions still need answers. ""We will continue our work at the scene and hope in the coming days we can piece together the exact circumstances surrounding the man's death. ""I would like to thank the community for their support and we will do all that we can to find out what happened."" The cordon on this quiet suburban street has now been extended a second time. After the grim discovery of human remains on Tuesday, the road was shut and the cordon now extends to 200ft as police continue to search the crime scene. Forensic teams have worked through the night with much of the work focusing on the rear end of the garden. Workmen at the property next door have been told they cannot work today as the search continues. Door-to-door inquiries have been made in Matlock Road, where residents have been asked if they knew Mr Coombes. The questionnaire suggests he would have been in his late 80s in 2005 and electoral records appear to confirm he lived at the address. One neighbour said the discovery was ""shocking and strange"" Yvonne Harrison, who lives a few doors away from the crime scene, spoke of her ""horror"" at the discovery. ""It's really shocking and very strange,"" she said. Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ""You never expect anything like this on your doorstep. ""All the neighbours are shocked and everyone is talking about it, but no-one seems to know much about that family."" Neighbour Stella Ashton added: ""We just saw the forensic teams and assumed there had been a break-in. ""Police came yesterday. Just asked if I had heard anything, any whispers. ""I didn't hear anything other than she lived with her parents, many years ago her mum died and shortly afterwards her dad wasn't seen again."" One neighbour said the discovery was ""shocking and strange"" She added: ""This morning I had to come out with my two children because they get the private school bus at the end of this road. ""It was a bit daunting this morning when it was dark and police would only escort them one by one through, they wouldn't let the children walk through on their own.""

"It takes two to tango, Hammond tells EU","The EU's ""relative silence"" about the kind of post-Brexit relations it wants with the UK must end, Philip Hammond is to tell German business leaders. There is ""little, if any signal"" from the EU about its priorities for talks on future co-operation due to begin in March, the chancellor is claiming. ""They say it takes two to tango,"" he will say in in Berlin. ""Both sides need to be clear about what they want."" The EU has warned the UK cannot cherry-pick the kind of arrangement it wants. The second phase of Brexit negotiations, covering transitional arrangements after the UK leaves in March 2019 and future economic and security co-operation, are set to begin officially in March. UK's no-deal Brexit worries 'surprise' EU Barnier's hamper treat from Brexiteers Juncker: Don't believe Brexit won't happen However, internal discussions within the EU about the framework of future relations have already begun following December's first-phase agreement on so-called divorce issues, like money and citizens' rights. Mr Hammond and Brexit Secretary David Davis are aiming to lay down a marker for the talks ahead when they address the Die Welt Economic Summit. In his speech, the chancellor will say the EU must ""put behind"" it any talk of punishing the UK for voting to leave the 28-member bloc and concentrate on maximising the mutual benefits of close co-operation in areas such as defence, education, science, technology and culture. ""I know the repeated complaint from Brussels has been that the UK ""hasn't made up its mind what type of relationship it wants,"" he will say. ""But in London, many feel that we have little, if any, signal of what future relationship the EU27 would like to have with a post-Brexit Britain."" Earlier on Wednesday, in a joint-article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, the two men argued that financial services were pivotal to the ""bespoke"" Brexit trade deal wanted by the UK. They acknowledge that their stated objective of leaving the EU's internal market and customs union means the UK will not be able to enjoy all the benefits it currently does as a member of the EU after leaving. The EU has warned the UK it cannot hope to get a special deal for the City of London Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor He is taking his message to the heart of Europe. In a speech to business leaders in Berlin tonight, the chancellor will say it is time for the European Union to engage more positively in the Brexit negotiations. And stop talking about ""punishing"" the UK over Brexit. After months of grumpy noises from Brussels over a perceived lack of clarity from the UK, Philip Hammond will say that Britain needs to hear about the ambition the EU has for a deep trading relationship with the UK. My sources point out that with Australia, Canada and America all making positive overtures about free trade agreements with Britain, the lack of a similar offer from the EU could lead to unintended consequences. Logically, ""no deal"" could be one of those. And certainly the present tone of the debate from the EU is damaging the chances of a positive outcome of the Brexit negotiations, my sources say. Read Kamal's full blog But they insist the EU's desire to protect the integrity of the single market for its other 27 members is ""not inconsistent"" with the UK's desire for the most comprehensive agreement possible. ""It makes no sense to either Germany or Britain to put in place unnecessary barriers to trade in goods and services that would only damage businesses and economic growth on both sides of the Channel,"" they write. ""So as Brexit talks now turn to trade, the UK will look to negotiate a new economic partnership with the EU - the most ambitious in the world - that recognises the extraordinary levels of interconnectedness and co-operation that already exist between us. ""We should use the imagination and ingenuity that our two countries and the EU have shown in the past, to craft a bespoke solution."" The UK's preferred model for a post-Brexit deal is what Mr Davis has described as Canada plus, plus, plus - a reference to Canada's low-tariff free trade deal with the EU but with services included as well as goods. The two men make clear in the article that unrestricted trade in services - which makes up about 80% of the UK economy - will be pivotal to any successful deal, as will financial and regulatory co-operation within Europe. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned the UK it cannot hope to get a special deal for the City of London and that its options have narrowed as a result of it turning its back on the single market. UK-based banks and financial firms are worried they will lose the passporting rights that allow them to trade freely in the EU after Brexit - an outcome that is likely to see firms moving jobs to the continent. Separately, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has urged Conservative backbenchers to not view everything through the ""prism of Brexit"", says BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Dr Fox told the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs on Wednesday to focus on the ""bigger picture"", pointing toan increase in UK manufacturing ordersand expectations thatthe economy will growin the next quarter. He said there was a political danger in suggesting events were ""because of"" or ""despite"" Brexit because the government could lose credit for the economic recovery - that it would not ""own"" the recovery. He is also believed to have told his Conservative colleagues that Labour remained in a state of confusion on Brexit and that some of their voting record on the withdrawal bill could be used as a weapon against them in key constituencies.

Bigamist found out by TV appearance jailed,"Daniel Gundry had married a second woman in the Seychelles by forging documents A bigamist who was caught out when his wife saw him on live television with another woman has been jailed. Daniel Gundry's wife Helen Gundry was watching Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway in March 2016 when she spotted him with Susan Brooker. Gundry, 39, of Ashford, Surrey, initially denied he had married Ms Brooker but later admitted bigamy. Magistrates sitting in Warrington said he was guilty of deceiving both women and causing them ""humiliation"". As Gundry was jailed for six months, Helen Gundry, from Warrington, and their daughter left the court in tears. Daniel and Helen Gundry married in 1998 and had lived apart for several years but the court heard Gundry had told his wife he wanted to get back together. While watching the ITV show with their daughter, Helen Gundry was shocked to see her estranged husband, who they thought was working in Dubai, appear in one of the items. He was among the guests being taken to the surprise live wedding of Ms Brooker's sister. Helen Gundry said she is ""glad"" her estranged husband had ""finally been found out"" Following the programme, Mrs Gundry discovered through social media that he had married again and both women made complaints to Cheshire Police. Gundry initially said he had only had a blessing in the Seychelles with Ms Brooker but the court heard he had married her by forging documents. The court was also told he deceived both women over money. Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway had staged a surprise wedding, which Daniel Gundry attended In a victim impact statement, Mrs Gundry told how she had suffered sleepless nights and depression. ""He has been lying for a long time so I'm just glad that finally he's been found out,"" she said after the sentencing. Ms Brooker said her whole world had caved in and her life was ""going in slow motion"". The district judge said he had caused both women ""embarrassment, shame and humiliation"". Gundry, who was not legally represented, told the court he accepted in full the damage he had caused.

"'One smoke leads to daily habit for most'The study's authors say the research shows the ""remarkable hold"" cigarettes can establish after one experience.16h16 hours agoHealth","At least two-thirds of those who try cigarettes go on to become daily smokers, even if only temporarily, research suggests. Data from the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand found 60.3% of people had tried smoking and an estimated 68.9% of those progressed to a daily habit. The study's authors said the research showed the ""remarkable hold"" cigarettes could establish after one experience. They said it confirmed the importance of stopping cigarette experimentation. Why young people are now less likely to smoke Quit smoking campaign backs e-cigs Themeta-analysis, published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research,external, was based on 215,000 respondents to eight surveys between 2000 and 2016 contained in the Global Health Data Exchange. Lead researcher Prof Peter Hajek, from Queen Mary University of London, said it was the first time the link between trying a first cigarette and becoming a regular smoker had been documented in such a large set of data. ""We've found that the conversion rate from first-time smoker to daily smoker is surprisingly high, which helps confirm the importance of preventing cigarette experimentation in the first place,"" he said. ""The UK is seeing a dramatic reduction in smoking at the moment and this tallies with recent findings that only 19% of 11- to 15-year-olds have ever tried a cigarette, so the good news is that we are on the right track."" In 2016, 15.5% of adults from the UK smoked - about 7.6 million people - according to the Office for National Statistics, down from 19.9% in 2010. In the same period, 19.3% of 18- to 24-year-olds were smokers, compared with 25.8% in 2010. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health, called for the greater government regulation of tobacco sales. ""The government is refusing to introduce licensing for tobacco retailers, even though there is strong support for this both from the public and retailers,"" she said. However, the study's authors said there were limitations to the research. One was that the surveys had yielded different results for the proportions who had progressed to becoming daily smokers - from 52% in one in the US to 82% in one in the UK - which meant the 68.9% figure was an estimate, as a weighted average of the figures. The authors also said there were questions about the accuracy of people's recall of their smoking history. Public health minister Steve Brine said: ""Britain is a world leader in tobacco control, and thanks to our tough action smoking rates in England are at an all-time low. ""We recently launched a new tobacco control plan to map the path to a smoke-free generation and are working to educate people about the risks and support them to quit for good.""

UK manufacturing output best for 10 years,"UK manufacturing output is expanding at its fastest rate since early 2008 after recording a seventh consecutive month of growth in November. Renewable energy projects, boats, aeroplanes and cars for export helped make output 3.9% higher in the three months to November than in 2016. Official figures also show industrial output rose,externalby 0.4% in November. Construction output in the three months to November fell by 2%, compared with the previous three months. That was the industry's biggest quarterly fall since August 2012, with the only bright spot for the sector being a 1.2% increase in new housing. For the month of November, total production was estimated to have increased by 0.4% compared with the previous month, with the biggest contribution coming from energy supply. This increased by 3.2%, mainly because the temperature was warmer than average in October, but colder than average in November. Economic growth had slowed in the first nine months of 2017 with higher inflation caused by the fall in sterling after the Brexit referendum, although the UK economy did grow by 0.4% in the three months to September. While the manufacturing figures are good, it is important to note that the sector only makes up roughly 10% of the economy. British manufacturing is riding high on two big trends - a weaker currency and global growth. Sterling's fall in value following the Brexit referendum has made UK exports more competitive. And for the first time since the financial crisis,  the three main engines of global growth - the USA, China and Europe - are performing strongly at the same time. That has led to car exports, for example, rising rapidly - contributing to a narrowing of the trade deficit with the rest of the world. That's the difference in value between what we import and what we export. Domestically, the economic picture is more subdued, with growth still sluggish. The weak construction figures are testament to that. But, helped by that positive world outlook, Britain's manufacturing sector has not seen such quarterly buoyancy since April 2008. And it is enjoying its strongest run of growth since 1997. Read Kamal's blog here Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: ""UK manufacturers were, in the main, in good shape as 2017 came to a close, with the majority of sub-sectors enjoying growth. ""Manufacturers' expectations for the year ahead point to output and export growth being maintained through this year on the back of continuing support from a burgeoning global economy. ""This, together with an ongoing commitment from government to deliver on its industrial strategy, will be crucial in helping to propel the sector forward,"" she said. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The downturn in construction activity has been driven by new work in the private commercial sector, which was 5.4% lower in the three months to November than in the previous three months. ""Looking ahead, Brexit uncertainty is likely to continue to hit commercial projects, while the planned 4.5% decline in public sector investment in 2018/19 will additionally dampen the sector.""

How polluted is your street?,"Cyclists wear masks against pollution in London Marylebone Road and Hyde Park Corner, both in central London, have the most polluted postcodes in Britain, says a new study on air quality. The data comes from a project to map concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) across the country. However, the results also show that large parts of Britain have relatively clean air. Diesel vehicles are a key source of NO2 gas, which has been linked to respiratory disease. While this study only concentrates on NO2 pollution, scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present. You can see what air quality is like in your area by entering your postcode in the search below. The data represents an average for 2016 and does not include Northern Ireland. Sorry, your browser does not support this tool Source: MappAir100 by EarthSense If you cannot view the postcode search, please clickhere,externalto reload the page. Although dirty air doesn't kill people directly, it's estimated to contribute to shortening the lives of 40,000 people a year in the UK. Pollution is thought to undermine the health of people with heart or lung problems. Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? Air pollution 'harms mental performance' Even low air pollution may damage heart All the BBC's news on air pollution A new analysis by the company EarthSense,externalshows NO2 concentrations in 100x100m squares across the UK. The company's technical director, Prof Roland Leigh, says it is the most detailed model yet for assessing air quality in Britain. ""By focussing it down we can really isolate the hotspots of poor air quality, and better target our solutions."" Air pollution levels in London could stay above legal limits for the next decade if action isn't taken Prof Leigh says it's important to be aware of bad pollution levels where you live, or near schools or your route to work, but that no areas in Britain are bad enough that people should avoid exercising outside. ""Air quality is actually getting better in Britain, and we are in a better state than a large number of countries -particularly across Asia. ""In Britain, it's always better to be outside exercising than inside avoiding pollution, even in the worst areas."" Keep away from the busiest roads - pollution concentrates around the heaviest traffic Use side roads - these are cleaner because there is so much less traffic Watch out for hotspots of dirty air - engines are often left running in stationary traffic. This can create ""urban canyons"" of pollution, particularly around traffic lights, so stand back after pushing the button before crossing the road When walking up a hill always stick to the side where traffic is flowing down the hill, away from the brunt of the fumes. This will always be the cleaner alternative Basic face-masks are not worth the hassle - these trap dust but little else, while heavy-duty versions are cumbersome. Scientists recommend avoiding busy roads instead In the study, each area is rated on a scale from 1, least polluted, to 6, most polluted. More than four in five postcodes in Great Britain fall into the least polluted category (1). The scale is worked out based on a probability that each area will break the annual legal limit for NO2. Areas fall foul if they average more than 40 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre. Fewer than 1% of postcodes are rated either 4 or 5, and no postcodes in Great Britain fall into the highest category - six - for areas that average over 100 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre. Three-quarters of the postcodes with theworst ratings are in London. Those outside the capital include other built-up areas as well as otherwise rural locations near motorways. Three-quarters of the postcodes which reach level five out of six are in London The company has largely based its analysis on traffic emissions, the dominant source of NO2 in the UK. In many big cities, such as London, safe limits on harmful particulates and nitrogen oxides, including NO2, are regularly breached. In the last few years, the campaign groupClientEarth has won a number of rulings against the UK governmentover air pollution. These legal challenges forced ministers to draw up plans to tackle the problem and meet EU targets on NO2. However, a recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience suggested that targets for reducing NO2 pollution could be achieved more quickly than the government expects. This was because government projections did not take into account that as cars age, they produce less of the harmful gas. Updated 8 February 2018: This article has been updated to clarify that the EarthSense study on air quality concentrates only on NO2 pollution. Scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present. Further work is being carried out to cover particulate matter.

MP calls for ban on energy drinks,"This video can not be played Justin Bartholomew's family are calling for energy drinks regulation An MP has called for a ban on high-caffeine energy drinks for under-16s, following the suicide of a 25-year-old constituent. Maria Caulfield raised the issue in Prime Minister's Questions. She said Justin Bartholomew's family were ""convinced"" his intake of more than 15 cans a day had increased his anxiety and contributed to his death. Theresa May said the government had taken action over high-sugar drinks and would continue to look at the evidence. Supermarket chain Waitrose recently announced it was banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children aged under 16, following concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children. Waitrose bans sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to under-16s Teachers call for ban on energy drinks in schools Ms Caulfield asked whether, given the actions of Waitrose and campaigners, including Jamie Oliver, the prime minister would consider a national ban. Mrs May said the MP for Lewes had raised a ""tragic case"" and recognised energy drinks high in sugar could be damaging to young people's health. She said the government had introduced the soft drinks industry levy - a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, which takes effect in April 2018. This video can not be played Conservative Maria Caulfield calls for a crackdown on high-energy drinks But the Department of Health and Social Care would continue to look at the issue and the scientific evidence, the prime minister said. The British Soft Drinks Association has said energy drinks have been ""deemed safe"" by regulators but are not marketed or promoted to under-16s. Existing industry labelling guidelines require any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to carry a high-caffeine content warning and state it is not recommended for children. Last month, campaign group Action on Sugar found that typical serving sizes of energy drinks, at 500ml (nearly a pint), were larger than for other sugary drinks and were ""completely inappropriate for children to consume"".

Riots over child's murder in Pakistan,"This video can not be played The rape and murder of six-year-old Zainab sparked outrage in Pakistan. Two protesters have died in rioting over the latest in a series of child murders in the Pakistani city of Kasur. The body of six-year-old Zainab was found in a rubbish dump on Tuesday, several days after she went missing. She had been raped and strangled. Angry demonstrators say the authorities are doing little to stem the spate of abductions, sexual assaults and killings. Police in Kasur say there have been 12 similar murders in the past two years. They say five of them are linked to one suspect who is being hunted by hundreds of officers and DNA samples have been taken from 90 possible suspects. The two protesters were killed after police shot at an angry crowd attempting to storm a police headquarters in Kasur, about 20km (12 miles) south of Lahore. Zainab's murder has sparked outrage across the rest of Pakistan. Well-known film and cricket stars demanded the killer be caught andthe military offered support to the police,external. Protesters say the authorities are doing little to stop the killings Zainab went missing on her way to a Koran recital. Her body was found about 2km from her home. However, Zainab's family say the police did not take action after they reported her disappearance and it was relatives who recovered CCTV footage of Zainab's movements before she disappeared, not the police. The footage showing a girl being led by the hand by a man was circulated widely on social media. ""If the police would have acted immediately, the culprit would have been caught,""Zainab's father told Geo TV,externalas he arrived back in the capital Islamabad from Saudi Arabia, where he had been on a pilgrimage. The Pakistani girl paraded naked for 'honour' Fighting sexual harassment in Pakistan Police say similar incidents appear to be taking place in Kasur every other month. Last month, a nine-year-old girl went missing in the city centre after going to the shops near her home. She managed to escape her captor and return home but has been left severely traumatised by her ordeal, reports say. Zainab's murder has led to widespread anger on social media, where the hashtag #JusticeforZainab was one of the top trending topics worldwide. Actors and cricketers were among those demanding the murderer's arrest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

MP calls for ban on energy drinks School bans sausage rolls from lunch boxes What can my child eat at school? The Charles Dickens School says confiscated food and drink will not be returned to pupils The school issued a statement saying it had notified parents it would be monitoring what food and drinks students brought into the school. ""We had noticed a deterioration in concentrations, learning and behaviour particularly from students bringing into school large multi-packs of unhealthy food, snacks and drinks."" The school said healthy eating was part of its programme to ""support students' ability to concentrate, learn and behave well"". The school's announcement has had a mixed reaction on social media. Jennifer Keen posted on Facebook: ""My son attends this school and I have questioned this, the explanation I received was lots of children are coming to school with 2 litre bottles of coke, big bags of sweets and energy drinks in their bags and being too wired to learn effectively, ""I am in total agreement with this especially the devil energy drinks as they can lead to severe cardiac issues!

Bigamist caught out on live TV jailed,"Daniel Gundry had married a second woman in the Seychelles by forging documents A bigamist who was caught out when his wife saw him on live television with another woman has been jailed. Daniel Gundry's wife Helen Gundry was watching Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway in March 2016 when she spotted him with Susan Brooker. Gundry, 39, of Ashford, Surrey, initially denied he had married Ms Brooker but later admitted bigamy. Magistrates sitting in Warrington said he was guilty of deceiving both women and causing them ""humiliation"". As Gundry was jailed for six months, Helen Gundry, from Warrington, and their daughter left the court in tears. Daniel and Helen Gundry married in 1998 and had lived apart for several years but the court heard Gundry had told his wife he wanted to get back together. While watching the ITV show with their daughter, Helen Gundry was shocked to see her estranged husband, who they thought was working in Dubai, appear in one of the items. He was among the guests being taken to the surprise live wedding of Ms Brooker's sister. Helen Gundry said she is ""glad"" her estranged husband had ""finally been found out"" Following the programme, Mrs Gundry discovered through social media that he had married again and both women made complaints to Cheshire Police. Gundry initially said he had only had a blessing in the Seychelles with Ms Brooker but the court heard he had married her by forging documents. The court was also told he deceived both women over money. Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway had staged a surprise wedding, which Daniel Gundry attended In a victim impact statement, Mrs Gundry told how she had suffered sleepless nights and depression. ""He has been lying for a long time so I'm just glad that finally he's been found out,"" she said after the sentencing. Ms Brooker said her whole world had caved in and her life was ""going in slow motion"". The district judge said he had caused both women ""embarrassment, shame and humiliation"". Gundry, who was not legally represented, told the court he accepted in full the damage he had caused.

Kodak soars on crypto-currency plansZano: Zombie drone whirs back to lifeVideoVideoRobot battles BBC at game of ScrabbleHey Google: Why is Alexa still winning?VideoVideo,"Kodak is to rent out Bitcoin mining rigs to the public Shares in photo firm Eastman Kodak soared nearly 120% after it revealed plans to mint its own crypto-currency, the KodakCoin. The US firm said it was teaming up with London-based Wenn Media Group to carry out the initial coin offering (ICO). It is partof a blockchain-based initiative,externalto help photographers control their image rights. Kodak also detailed plans to install rows of Bitcoin mining rigs at its headquarters in Rochester, New York. Details of this second scheme - which is being branded the Kodak KashMiner - were outlined at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Customers will pay up-front to rent mining capacity. Kodak is the latest in a series of companies to see its value jump after revealing plans for blockchain-related activity. ""This is a phenomenon we saw back during the dot com days in the late 1990s where traditional companies would mention some kind of internet strategy and their stock price would jump up,"" commented Garrick Hileman from the University of Cambridge. ""When you see stock prices moving like this it does appear to be troubling - it's hard to say if there's a bubble but it certainly is indicative of a frothy investment market."" Kodak developed a digital camera in 1975, but decided not to commercialise the technology at the time, and its hesitation to leave behind its film heritage is thought by some to have contributed to it filing for bankruptcy protection years later in 2012. Kodak now embraces digital photography but was initially wary of the format Since that collapse, Kodak has licensed its brand to a variety of manufacturers, with the mark appearing on batteries, printers, drones, tablet computers and digital cameras. The KashMiner operation will be run by Spotlite, a licensee that had previously teamed up with Kodak to use its brand to market LED lights. More from CES:,external Samsung launches giant modular TV Disobedient robot derails LG's event Hands-on with HTC's untethered VR headset Short story dispenser spits out tales Mining involves carrying out processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions. Any Bitcoins generated by Kodak KashMiner will be shared between the customer and the business. Each of the mining rig boxes - which include computer processors and fans to keep them cool - will use about the same amount of electricity as running a hairdryer around the clock. But the scheme will be able to take advantage of Kodak's on-site power generating plant, which has had spare capacity since Kodak's heyday. Kodak's Bitcoin mining operation will be based at its Rochester headquarters The company says it can power each rig for four cents per kilowatt hour, which is significantly cheaper than running a rig at home. At Bitcoin's current value, an up-front investment of $4,000 (Â£2,954) for 24 months of mining could earn a profit of $500 a month, Spotlite's Halston Mikail told the BBC. But anybody hoping to join the gamble would have to wait, as capacity is already sold out, Mr Mikail added. ""At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand,"" he said. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and some analysts fear its value could crash, resulting in a loss for those who had paid up-front for mining capacity. But Mr Mikail said the rigs could be put to work on other tasks if Bitcoin faltered. ""Bitcoin could be a bubble. But the blockchain industry is not a bubble,"" he said. ""It's a solid platform built on mathematics and it will survive."" Kodak's other initiative, the KodakCoin, is being created as part of an effort to build a global ledger of picture rights ownership that photographers can add their work to. Associated KodakOne software will be used to crawl the web and find pictures that have been used without permission. The company said it would then ""manage the licensing process,"" so the photographer can be paid, in KodakCoin. ""Kodak has always sought to democratise photography and make licensing fair to artists,"" said Kodak chief executive Jeff Clarke. ""These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that."" The company's shares traded more than 130% above their opening price after the announcement before closing the day 119.4% higher. But one expert had doubts. ""Storing the information in a blockchain doesn't protect your copyright any more than copyright law already does,"" commented David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain. ""Notice how they're marketing it: they state a problem, then say the blockchain can solve it. But there's no mechanism by which the blockchain could do that. ""This doesn't do anything that signing up for Shutterstock or Getty Images wouldn't."" Even so, some think Kodak will not be the last household name to associate itself with an ICO. ""I expect we are going to see more major brands releasing their own tokens and currencies to support various products and services,"" commented Mr Hileman.

Zano: Zombie drone whirs back to lifeVideoVideoRobot battles BBC at game of ScrabbleHey Google: Why is Alexa still winning?VideoVideo,"One of the original Zano drones has had its firmware replaced to allow it to fly again at CES A group of developers are attempting to revive the Zano drone - one of Kickstarter's most notorious failures. The handheld quadcopter raised Â£2.3m from more than 12,000 backers on the crowdfunding platform before the project imploded in 2015. The resulting scandalprompted a probe that,externalfound fault with all involved. The Zano Camera project is one of several initiatives on show at the CES expo that make use of seized assets from failed crowdfunding campaigns. The person leading the effort is Vernon Kerswell, chief executive of Extreme Fliers, a London-based micro drone manufacturer. His company paid just over Â£100,000 to buy the assets of Zano's original developer - the Swansea, Wales-headquartered Torquing Group - after it collapsed. ""Zano was deeply flawed and there was a lot of issues with the software and the hardware, and that's ultimately why they never shipped [en masse],"" he told the BBC at the Las Vegas trade show. ""But a lot of the technology was very interesting and way ahead of what else was out there at the time. ""Drone companies out there would never risk putting unproven technologies in their flagship products. ""But we can use it as a platform to test new ideas and build a group of passionate developers."" This video can not be played Rory tested the Zano drone ahead of its release The project involves open-sourcing the intellectual property involved in the Zano drones, so that enthusiasts across the globe can work together to tackle the fact the limited number of units that made it into backers' hands are now effectively ""undead"". ""There are about 1,000 units out there that shipped but they were bricked when the company went bankrupt because the computer server that they were dependent on was switched off,"" explained Mr Kerswell. More from CES 2018: Kodak soars on KodakCoin and Bitcoin plans Hands-on with HTC's untethered VR headset Jetpack pilot suffers fear of heights Scribbles turned into fine art by AI app If he receives enough support for the not-for-profit venture, he believes an app could be released as soon as April that could upload new firmware to the drones via wi-fi. This would allow them to be controlled by their users without the support of an external server. If there is demand, Mr Kerswell also suggested further units could be manufactured. But he said that changes to the hardware's design would be necessary first. The arms of existing Zano drones, he explained, were too fragile meaning the rotor blades snapped off if they suffered a minor collision. A downwards-facing camera should also be added, he said, to make it possible for the drones to fly on the spot. In addition, he said different antennas and infrared sensors would be required to deliver the kind of range and obstacle-avoidance consumers now expected. For now, the entrepreneur is able to demonstrate one of the original units flying again at CES's Eureka Park start-up zone, and he has launched a website wherehe promises to let the public track progress,external. Another drone on show at CES has already been put on sale after returning from the dead. The Lily Next Generation resembles the drone's original design US-based Lily Robotics raised more than $34m (Â£25.1m) via its own website after publishing aYouTube video that showed its throw-and-go quadcopter,external- the Lily Camera - navigating its own flight path and surviving a dunk in water. However, the company was wound down a year ago after it said it had failed to secure further funds from investors. Its assets were subsequently acquired by another Californian firm, Mota, which released the Lily Next Generation drone late last year, albeit without the waterproofing originally promised. ""We think the worldwide brand awareness far outweighs any risk,"" a spokesman said about retaining Lily's name. ""We launched... in October 2017, and it's been selling very well since."" The makers of the Skully Fenix AR say the headset will deliver improved specs over the original design Skully Technologies is also at the trade fair with a hi-tech ""intelligent"" motorcycle helmet based on the work of a failed $2.4m Indiegogo campaign. The Skully Fenix AR promises users a heads-up display, a blindspot camera and hands-free phone calls among other features. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company used the show to announce that the product should be ready to go on sale in the summer. It has pledged to give some units away to the project's original backers even though it says it has not formal obligation to do so.

Hey Google: Why is Alexa still winning?VideoVideo,"Google has been loudly advertising its virtual assistant in Las Vegas during the CES tech show If victory belongs to whoever's virtual assistant can interact with the most unlikely range of household appliances, then Amazon has already won. The firm's voice-activated digital helper has been added to a bathroom mirror that can - via cloud service Kohler Konnect - pass commands to smart kitchen taps, a shower system and even a smart toilet. ""That means 'Alexa, ask Kohler to flush my toilet' is something you might end up saying in the near future,"" musedBlair Hanley Frank at news site Venturebeat,external. Who needs a copy of Reader's Digest when Alexa is free for a chat, instead? In all seriousness, the battle to be your smart home's virtual butler is hotly contested and a huge range of gadgets on show at the latest CES tech show in Las Vegas now boast ways for users to interact with them via assistants including Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri and others. But it's the rivalry between Amazon and Google that is particularly noticeable. ""By day four of CES we will be reporting when a gadget doesn't have Alexa or Google Assistant,""quipped Dieter Bohn,external, executive editor of tech news site The Verge. ""Alexa, it's too hot!"" - you might one day interact with the Alexa-enabled Moen digital shower this way Among the devices featuring Google Assistant are many new smart speakers, including models made by Altec Lansing, JBL and LG. The breezy aide has also recently been adopted by two of the biggest TV brands - Sony and LG. At CES 2017, LG invited Amazon on stage at its press conference in order to showcase Alexa inside a variety of devices but this year, the honour of an appearance fell to Google. The tech giant's Assistant is also being added to more car entertainment systems, thanks to Android Auto, where it enables a hands-free means of checking in on Google apps. Significantly, the aide is nowcompatible with smart displays,externalincluding four devices shown off at CES. These will, importantly, allow users to watch YouTube videos. Google recentlyblocked YouTube from Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo Show,externaldevices - which feature screens - so, for the moment, access to the world's biggest video platform may be seen as a deal-breaker for some. But the variety of devices packing Alexa certainly appears to be growing ever broader. From the bathroom appliances mentioned above to an LG fridge that uses Alexa to relay recipe directions while you cook, Amazon's assistant is the one making the most in-roads when it comes to smart versions of traditional ""white goods"" products. The Amazon Echo Show which is, currently, without YouTube However, one manufacturer - Whirlpool - appeared unwilling to choose a favourite. It allows the user to pick Alexa or Google Assistant when setting up voice activation on smart appliances like the firm's range oven and microwave. One of the more eagerly covered gadgets of CES this year is a set of $1,000 (Â£740) smart glasses made by Vuzix. These too have Alexa built in, which helps the wearer - for example - navigate through web content projected in the upper right part of his or her vision.

More from CES:,external Kodak soars on KodakCoin and Bitcoin plans Hybrid watch hides screen behind hands When will AI deliver for humans? Hands-on with HTC's untethered VR headset For analyst Simon Bryant at market research firm Futuresource, the current leader is easy to identify. ""There's no question that the momentum is with Amazon,"" he told the BBC. ""[The firm] has proven that there is a logical use case for a hands-free assistant in the smart home."" However, he doesn't think that fridges and bath tubs are where Alexa will really become indispensable for home users, not least because most people don't replace such items often. And there could be trouble ahead for Amazon, he adds, when it attempts to take Alexa to markets beyond the US and Europe. ""Amazon's reach geographically is still pretty limited and language support [on Alexa] is very poor,"" he explained. ""Google has many more languages... so moving forward there are question marks about how long Amazon can sustain the growth."" Not everyone is convinced that voice-activated fridges are the future Adam Wright, a tech analyst at IDC, agreed that the voice assistant show-down was now a ""two-horse race"".

Thousands on Iran death row may be spared,"Amnesty International called on Iran to abolish the death penalty for all crimes Thousands of Iranians who have been sentenced to death for drug crimes could be spared following a softening in the country's law. Capital punishment has been abolished for some drug offences, and the head of the judiciary has said all cases on death row can be reviewed. The move is set to be applied retroactively, meaning some 5,000 prisoners could escape execution. Iran executes hundreds of people every year, mostly for drug offences. In August, Iran's parliament raised the threshold on the amount of drugs that would be considered a capital offence. Under the previous law, possessing 30g of cocaine would trigger the death penalty but that has been increased to 2kg (4.4lb). The limit on opium and marijuana has been increased tenfold to 50kg. Iranian minister calls for fewer executions Iran's drug addicts 'more than double' in six years 'Disturbing rise' in global executions Judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani told local media that most death sentences would be reduced to extended jail terms. Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, from Iran Human Rights (IHR), an independent NGO based in Norway, welcomed the law change. ""If implemented properly, this change in law will represent one of the most significant steps towards reduction in the use of the death penalty worldwide,"" he told the BBC. But he expressed concern that those on death row might not be able to take advantage. An Iranian policeman guards 3,000kg (6,600lb) of opium seized from drug smugglers ""Since most of those sentenced to death for drug offences belong to the most marginalised parts of Iranian society, it is not given that they have the knowledge and resources to apply for commuting their sentence,"" he said. Human rights group Amnesty International also welcomed the news, but said it would like to see further progress. ""The Iranian authorities must stop using the death penalty for drug-related offences, with a view to eventually abolishing it for all crimes,"" a spokeswoman said. ""There are currently an estimated 5,000 people on death row for such offences across the country. About 90% of them are first-time offenders aged between 20 and 30 years old."" The group quoted an official who said that, since 1988, Iran had executed 10,000 people for drug crimes. In 2016, Iran's then justice minister said he was looking for an ""effective punishment"" for criminals instead of execution. Mostafa Pourmohammadi said he thought the number of capital crimes should be revised and the death penalty kept for ""corrupt people"".

Zano: Zombie drone whirs back to life,"One of the original Zano drones has had its firmware replaced to allow it to fly again at CES A group of developers are attempting to revive the Zano drone - one of Kickstarter's most notorious failures. The handheld quadcopter raised Â£2.3m from more than 12,000 backers on the crowdfunding platform before the project imploded in 2015. The resulting scandalprompted a probe that,externalfound fault with all involved. The Zano Camera project is one of several initiatives on show at the CES expo that make use of seized assets from failed crowdfunding campaigns. The person leading the effort is Vernon Kerswell, chief executive of Extreme Fliers, a London-based micro drone manufacturer. His company paid just over Â£100,000 to buy the assets of Zano's original developer - the Swansea, Wales-headquartered Torquing Group - after it collapsed. ""Zano was deeply flawed and there was a lot of issues with the software and the hardware, and that's ultimately why they never shipped [en masse],"" he told the BBC at the Las Vegas trade show. ""But a lot of the technology was very interesting and way ahead of what else was out there at the time. ""Drone companies out there would never risk putting unproven technologies in their flagship products. ""But we can use it as a platform to test new ideas and build a group of passionate developers."" This video can not be played Rory tested the Zano drone ahead of its release The project involves open-sourcing the intellectual property involved in the Zano drones, so that enthusiasts across the globe can work together to tackle the fact the limited number of units that made it into backers' hands are now effectively ""undead"". ""There are about 1,000 units out there that shipped but they were bricked when the company went bankrupt because the computer server that they were dependent on was switched off,"" explained Mr Kerswell. More from CES 2018: Kodak soars on KodakCoin and Bitcoin plans Hands-on with HTC's untethered VR headset Jetpack pilot suffers fear of heights Scribbles turned into fine art by AI app If he receives enough support for the not-for-profit venture, he believes an app could be released as soon as April that could upload new firmware to the drones via wi-fi. This would allow them to be controlled by their users without the support of an external server. If there is demand, Mr Kerswell also suggested further units could be manufactured. But he said that changes to the hardware's design would be necessary first. The arms of existing Zano drones, he explained, were too fragile meaning the rotor blades snapped off if they suffered a minor collision. A downwards-facing camera should also be added, he said, to make it possible for the drones to fly on the spot. In addition, he said different antennas and infrared sensors would be required to deliver the kind of range and obstacle-avoidance consumers now expected. For now, the entrepreneur is able to demonstrate one of the original units flying again at CES's Eureka Park start-up zone, and he has launched a website wherehe promises to let the public track progress,external. Another drone on show at CES has already been put on sale after returning from the dead. The Lily Next Generation resembles the drone's original design US-based Lily Robotics raised more than $34m (Â£25.1m) via its own website after publishing aYouTube video that showed its throw-and-go quadcopter,external- the Lily Camera - navigating its own flight path and surviving a dunk in water. However, the company was wound down a year ago after it said it had failed to secure further funds from investors. Its assets were subsequently acquired by another Californian firm, Mota, which released the Lily Next Generation drone late last year, albeit without the waterproofing originally promised. ""We think the worldwide brand awareness far outweighs any risk,"" a spokesman said about retaining Lily's name. ""We launched... in October 2017, and it's been selling very well since."" The makers of the Skully Fenix AR say the headset will deliver improved specs over the original design Skully Technologies is also at the trade fair with a hi-tech ""intelligent"" motorcycle helmet based on the work of a failed $2.4m Indiegogo campaign. The Skully Fenix AR promises users a heads-up display, a blindspot camera and hands-free phone calls among other features. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company used the show to announce that the product should be ready to go on sale in the summer. It has pledged to give some units away to the project's original backers even though it says it has not formal obligation to do so.

Hey Google: Why is Alexa still winning?,"Google has been loudly advertising its virtual assistant in Las Vegas during the CES tech show If victory belongs to whoever's virtual assistant can interact with the most unlikely range of household appliances, then Amazon has already won. The firm's voice-activated digital helper has been added to a bathroom mirror that can - via cloud service Kohler Konnect - pass commands to smart kitchen taps, a shower system and even a smart toilet. ""That means 'Alexa, ask Kohler to flush my toilet' is something you might end up saying in the near future,"" musedBlair Hanley Frank at news site Venturebeat,external. Who needs a copy of Reader's Digest when Alexa is free for a chat, instead? In all seriousness, the battle to be your smart home's virtual butler is hotly contested and a huge range of gadgets on show at the latest CES tech show in Las Vegas now boast ways for users to interact with them via assistants including Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri and others. But it's the rivalry between Amazon and Google that is particularly noticeable. ""By day four of CES we will be reporting when a gadget doesn't have Alexa or Google Assistant,""quipped Dieter Bohn,external, executive editor of tech news site The Verge. ""Alexa, it's too hot!"" - you might one day interact with the Alexa-enabled Moen digital shower this way Among the devices featuring Google Assistant are many new smart speakers, including models made by Altec Lansing, JBL and LG. The breezy aide has also recently been adopted by two of the biggest TV brands - Sony and LG. At CES 2017, LG invited Amazon on stage at its press conference in order to showcase Alexa inside a variety of devices but this year, the honour of an appearance fell to Google. The tech giant's Assistant is also being added to more car entertainment systems, thanks to Android Auto, where it enables a hands-free means of checking in on Google apps. Significantly, the aide is nowcompatible with smart displays,externalincluding four devices shown off at CES. These will, importantly, allow users to watch YouTube videos. Google recentlyblocked YouTube from Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo Show,externaldevices - which feature screens - so, for the moment, access to the world's biggest video platform may be seen as a deal-breaker for some. But the variety of devices packing Alexa certainly appears to be growing ever broader. From the bathroom appliances mentioned above to an LG fridge that uses Alexa to relay recipe directions while you cook, Amazon's assistant is the one making the most in-roads when it comes to smart versions of traditional ""white goods"" products. The Amazon Echo Show which is, currently, without YouTube However, one manufacturer - Whirlpool - appeared unwilling to choose a favourite. It allows the user to pick Alexa or Google Assistant when setting up voice activation on smart appliances like the firm's range oven and microwave. One of the more eagerly covered gadgets of CES this year is a set of $1,000 (Â£740) smart glasses made by Vuzix. These too have Alexa built in, which helps the wearer - for example - navigate through web content projected in the upper right part of his or her vision.

""There's no question that the momentum is with Amazon,"" he told the BBC. ""[The firm] has proven that there is a logical use case for a hands-free assistant in the smart home."" However, he doesn't think that fridges and bath tubs are where Alexa will really become indispensable for home users, not least because most people don't replace such items often. And there could be trouble ahead for Amazon, he adds, when it attempts to take Alexa to markets beyond the US and Europe. ""Amazon's reach geographically is still pretty limited and language support [on Alexa] is very poor,"" he explained. ""Google has many more languages... so moving forward there are question marks about how long Amazon can sustain the growth."" Not everyone is convinced that voice-activated fridges are the future Adam Wright, a tech analyst at IDC, agreed that the voice assistant show-down was now a ""two-horse race"". He pointed out that both Google and Amazon have made it easy for developers to create new actions or skills that people can use when interacting with either Alexa or Google Assistant. Of course, for many consumers a virtual assistant is still very much a novelty.

Ethiopia bans foreign adoptions,"Angelina Jolie adopted her daughter from Ethiopia in 2005 Ethiopia has banned the adoption of children by foreigners amid concerns they face abuse and neglect abroad. Ethiopia is one of the biggest source countries for international adoptions by US citizens, accounting for about 20% of the total. Celebrities Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are among those who have adopted children from Ethiopia. However, in 2013, aUS couple were convicted of killing an adopted Ethiopian girl. That case triggered a debate about foreign adoption, the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa says. The adoption process in Ethiopia has also faced serious questions with rights groups saying that it was prone to abuse by human traffickers who saw it as lucrative market. Two years ago, Denmark stopped the adoption of children from Ethiopia. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Out of Ethiopia: Is international adoption an ethical business? Lawmakers now say orphans and other vulnerable children should be cared for under locally available support mechanisms in order to protect them. But some MPs said that the country has insufficient local services to cater for vulnerable children. More than 15,000 Ethiopian children have been adopted in the US since 1999. Many are also taken to European countries such as Spain, France and Italy. Emmanuel Igunza, BBC Africa, Addis Ababa Debate over foreign adoptions in Ethiopia has been rife since the 2013, so the country's ban didn't come as a major surprise. The question now is what will happen to the thousands of orphans and vulnerable children who can no longer be adopted? Parliament says the country's social services should be able to handle the numbers and more importantly local adoptions are still permitted. However, adoption is not a big part of Ethiopia's culture and many orphans find themselves shuttled between relatives or on the streets. Ethiopia is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, but millions of people live in poverty. Although there is a fast growing safety net programme to cushion the poorest from the ravages of droughts, critics say the country simply doesn't have the capacity to deal with the huge number of orphans. The coordinator of a children's orphanage in Addis Ababa, who asked not to be named, said that they would find a way to look after the children in the country. ""These are our children. We are already seeing many Ethiopians choosing to sponsor one child or two through their education and other needs."" ""For now things are just up in the air,"" she added. ""But who knows, it might be reversed and these needy children will find families, here or abroad."" Out of Ethiopia: Is international adoption an ethical business?

Rescuers search for California survivors,"This video can not be played A resident describes how he helped rescue a baby from the mud Rescue workers in southern California are searching for survivors after mudslides and flooding in which at least 15 people have died. More than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal road have been closed and police said the scene ""looked like a World War One battlefield"". A group of 300 people are reportedly trapped in Romero Canyon neighbourhood east of Santa Barbara, with rescue efforts due to resume at daybreak. The death toll is expected to rise. More than 50 people have been rescued already but many places are still inaccessible. Several roads are closed, including the major Highway 101. In pictures: Mudslides cause chaos Some 163 people have been taken to hospital. Twenty had ""storm-related injuries"" and four were critically hurt. Fire department workers rescued a woman from a collapsed house in Montecito The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been scorched by December's huge wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. The Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) says the risk of flooding stays ""significantly higher"" for up to five years after a wildfire,external. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. In some places mud was waist-deep, officials said. Thousands had to leave their homes, many for the second time in two months.The emergency services declared an exclusion zone,external, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. Those who have stayed in the area have been warned to boil their tap water before drinking it. Boulders the size of cars rolled down hills and slammed into roadways Heavy rain run-off caused a mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked off their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason. Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, reports the BBC's Los Angeles correspondent James Cook. County Fire Captain Dave Zaniboni said that five people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito, possibly as a result of the storm. The upmarket neighbourhood includes homes owned by celebrities such as actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and broadcaster Oprah Winfrey. The US Coast Guard has sent ""multiple airships to support rescue operations"" and warned the public not to fly drones, otherwise the flights would be grounded. This comes after arecord-setting year of $306bn (Â£226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costsin the United States, with 2017 the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Montecito is home to celebrities such as actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and media mogul Oprah Winfrey. On Instagram, Ms Winfrey said her property had escaped the worst as she toured the scene, but described the house next door as ""devastated"". The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been burned by December's huge wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. The Federal Emergency Management Agency saysthe risk of flooding stays ""significantly higher"" for up to five years after a wildfire,external. Thousands had to leave their homes, many for the second time in two months.The emergency services declared an exclusion zone,external, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. The US Coast Guard has sent ""multiple airships to support rescue operations"" and warned the public not to fly drones, saying it would cause the flights to be grounded. The destruction comes after arecord-setting year of $306bn (Â£226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costsin the United States, with 2017 the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. California has suffered severe drought in five out of six of the past years.

Coco-nuts! Shoppers query plastic wrapping,"Genuine Coconut - which sell for Â£3 apiece - says the film is recyclable The sight of hard-shelled coconuts wrapped in a plastic-style film has left shoppers scratching their heads. For some, it is another example of pointless packaging, which is adding to the piles of plastic waste. The boss of Sainsbury's, one of the supermarkets selling the Â£3 ready-to-drink coconuts, agreed in a BBC interview that it seemed ""daft"". But the coconuts' supplier says the film is fully recyclable and keeps the water fresh for much longer. The Genuine Coconut company says the film is not a standard plastic and is made from recycled materials. It comes just a day after similar questions were raised aboutcauliflowers sliced into Â£2 ""steaks""and sold by Marks and Spencer in plastic wrapping. So has our food supply gone coco-nuts, or does the packaging help prevent another problem: food waste? The ""Genuine Coconut"" is wrapped in film, and comes with a pull top and straw to drink the coconut water. It is also sold by Waitrose, Marks and Spencer and Ocado, and compares with a normal coconut that sells at about 80p. The supplier of the coconuts - which come from Thailand - says the film helps to give them a longer shelf life of 40 days without using chemicals. But one customer asked: ""Was a coconut shell not good enough protection?"" Another Twitter user, Alex Morss, a blogger and ecologist, said: ""This coconut is not sold in its natural container, without processing, as nature intended... Plastic wrap/straws are not natural, sustainable or biodegradable."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Asked about the coconut controversy, Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coupe, told the BBC he'll ""certainly be asking some questions about why we wrap coconuts in plastic"". But he also said it is important to remember that packaging helps to protect some products. ""It does play a part in making sure we don't increase the food waste in our business as well, so there's always a trade-off to be made,"" Mr Coupe said. TheUK uses 3.7 million tonnes of plastic a year, according to trade organisation Plastics Europe, and recent changes in China have made it more difficult to process. Ministers are trying to tackle waste by making it simpler for people to recycle and byplanning to extend the 5p charge on plastic bagsto all retailers. Customers pull off a tab on the coconut and drink the water with a straw Some shops are already taking steps to reduce plastic waste. For example, Sainsbury's says it has reduced its packaging by 30% over the last five years. In the US, pre-peeled mandarins in plastic packaging wereremoved from sale by Whole Foods Marketafter a customer's photo and tweet went viral. But the Spanish company behind Genuine Coconut says the wrapping is specially designed and can be recycled. It is an ""anti-steam film"" that is recyclable and prevents the water inside the coconut from spoiling and evaporating. This replicates the coconut's original green coating, the company says, and so helps it to stay fresh for longer without preservatives and chemicals. Without the film, the coconuts could not be classed as organic, the company adds. A Sainsbury's spokeswoman said the supermarket had no plans to review the availability of a product that is ""organic and comes in packaging that is fully recyclable"".

"MP calls for ban on energy drinksMaria Caulfield raised the issue after the suicide of a constituent, whose family said energy drinks contributed to his anxiety.","This video can not be played Justin Bartholomew's family are calling for energy drinks regulation An MP has called for a ban on high-caffeine energy drinks for under-16s, following the suicide of a 25-year-old constituent. Maria Caulfield raised the issue in Prime Minister's Questions. She said Justin Bartholomew's family were ""convinced"" his intake of more than 15 cans a day had increased his anxiety and contributed to his death. Theresa May said the government had taken action over high-sugar drinks and would continue to look at the evidence. Supermarket chain Waitrose recently announced it was banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children aged under 16, following concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children. Waitrose bans sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to under-16s Teachers call for ban on energy drinks in schools Ms Caulfield asked whether, given the actions of Waitrose and campaigners, including Jamie Oliver, the prime minister would consider a national ban. Mrs May said the MP for Lewes had raised a ""tragic case"" and recognised energy drinks high in sugar could be damaging to young people's health. She said the government had introduced the soft drinks industry levy - a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, which takes effect in April 2018. This video can not be played Conservative Maria Caulfield calls for a crackdown on high-energy drinks But the Department of Health and Social Care would continue to look at the issue and the scientific evidence, the prime minister said. The British Soft Drinks Association has said energy drinks have been ""deemed safe"" by regulators but are not marketed or promoted to under-16s. Existing industry labelling guidelines require any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to carry a high-caffeine content warning and state it is not recommended for children. Last month, campaign group Action on Sugar found that typical serving sizes of energy drinks, at 500ml (nearly a pint), were larger than for other sugary drinks and were ""completely inappropriate for children to consume"".

Sri Lanka removes alcohol ban for womenFemales over 18 are permitted to buy alcohol legally for the first time in more than 60 years.1han hour agoAsia,"The majority of women in Sri Lanka see alcohol consumption as contrary to the nation's culture Sri Lanka is to allow women over the age of 18 to buy alcohol legally for the first time in more than 60 years. The government said that it was amending a 1955 law that it agreed was discriminatory against women. The amendment to the law, announced on Wednesday, also means that women will be permitted without prior approval to work in places that sell alcohol. While the previous law was not always strictly enforced, many Sri Lankan women have welcomed the change. Women took to social media to thank the government for its decision, which was announced by Sri Lanka's Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera. Under the new law, women will no longer require the approval of the state's excise commissioner in order to work or drink ""in licensed premises"", including restaurants. While the move has been widely welcomed, some argue that it might lead to more women becoming addicted to alcohol. In Sri Lanka, a majority of women traditionally choose not to drink alcohol as they see it as contrary to Sri Lankan culture. However in 2016, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, who runs an anti-alcohol campaign in the country, said that alcohol consumption among Sri Lankan women had increased ""drastically"" in recent years.

As Simon Mayo knows, presenting at drivetime often means eating dinner during the songs ""Although we've known each other for over 20 years, we've never presented a show together,"" said Mayo in a statement. ""And given that Jo is quite brilliant, it's high time we put that right."" ""What a thrill to be working with Simon on this exciting new show,"" added Whiley. ""It's going to be great fun and listeners can look forward to some incredible music and chat, as well as being introduced to some fantastic new talent along the way. Cannot wait! "" Their pairing results in an extra hour of radio, with the drivetime slot extended from 17:00 to 20:00 every weekday, except Friday - when Tony Blackburn's Golden Hour remains from 19:00 to 20:00. As a result, the weekly Blues, Jazz, Folk and Country shows will move one hour later - starting at 20:00 from Monday to Thursday. According to figures published by the BBC last July, Mayo currently receives a salary in the range Â£350,000 - Â£399,999, while Whiley is paid Â£150,000 - Â£199,999. Although they will receive equal pay for their upcoming show, there will still be a disparity in their total salaries, as Mayo presents a weekly show for 5 Live, and Whiley hosts events including Glastonbury for BBC television.

Michael Douglas' pre-emptive sex denial,"Michael Douglas described the situation as a ""nightmare"" Michael Douglas has spoken out to deny a claim of improper sexual conduct, before it has even been made public. The Hollywood star said he ""felt the need to get ahead"" of the situation and to share his ""concerns"" before a story was published. He said a former employee was accusing him of performing a sex act in front of her more than 30 years ago. Douglas told Deadline,external: ""This is a complete lie, fabrication, no truth to it whatsoever."" He said his lawyer contacted him in December, telling him a media outlet was planning to run a story about the woman's claims. Douglas said the woman was also alleging he ""blackballed"" her so she couldn't get another job after he fired her, that he used ""colourful language"" in front of her and ""spoke raunchily"" in private conversations with his friends on the phone. ""It's extremely painful,"" said Douglas, describing the situation as a ""nightmare"". ""I pride myself on my reputation in this business, not to mention the long history of my father and everything else. I don't have skeletons in my closet, or anyone else who's coming out or saying this. I'm bewildered why, after 32 years, this is coming out, now."" He said he ""had the choice of waiting for a story to come out"" and trying to defend himself, or to ""share with the public, a little ahead of the story, my thoughts and concerns"". The woman is a writer but hasn't been identified. Douglas told Deadline: ""I've worked with women my entire life. It has never been an issue."" He said there was no evidence against him, adding: ""I can only imagine this has come up to hurt someone, or to benefit someone in a book deal so they can write a chapter on me."" He added: ""I support the #metoo movement with all my heart. I have always supported women, along the way."" But he warned: ""This is the kind of step that can set that movement back. ""Being accused, without a chance [to defend yourself] in court. To not even really have the information in front of you, to be able to argue or defend yourself. There is no due process, no chance of seeing evidence in front of me from my accuser. It worries me."" He said he had the support of his family and the film studios he's currently working with, but admitted he was ""fearful"". ""I'm hurt, really hurt and offended and I wonder if people realise when you do something like this, it hurts a lot more than just one person,"" he added. Douglas' wife Catherine Zeta-Jones and his father Kirk Douglas appeared on stage at the Golden Globes. His 101-year-old father received a standing ovation at Sunday's ceremony.

Trump move to end Dreamers scheme blocked,"Daca supporters have held protest rallies against President Trump's decision to scrap the programme A US judge has blocked attempts by the White House to end a programme barring the deportation of children brought illegally to the US by parents. In September, President Donald Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme. But San Francisco's Judge William Alsup ruled it must stay in place while litigation against the move continues. The Obama-era scheme protects some 800,000 people, and also provides temporary permits for work and study. Trump and Democrats 'to work on Daca Dreamers law' Trump: 'I have great love' for Daca Dreamers In his ruling, Judge Alsup stated that ""the government is hereby ordered and enjoined, pending final judgment herein or other order, to maintain the Daca programme on a nationwide basis on the same terms and conditions as were in effect before the rescission"". He said the justice department's argument that the scheme was illegal was based on a ""flawed legal premise"". The district judge ordered the government to process renewal applications from people who had previously been covered. However, this would not be the case for those who had never before received protection under the programme. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders described the ruling as ""outrageous"". ""An issue of this magnitude must go through the normal legislative process,"" she said. ""President Trump is committed to the rule of law, and will work with members of both parties to reach a permanent solution that corrects the unconstitutional actions taken by the last administration."" Shortly afterwards,Mr Trump attacked the ruling on Twitter,external. ""It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts,"" he wrote. This video can not be played The US president said he had ""great love"" for Daca Dreamers Despite scrapping the programme in September, President Trump delayed enforcement to give Congress until March to enact a replacement plan for Daca recipients, who are known as ""Dreamers"". On Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans announced that they would work together on a new immigration bill to protect border security, chain migration, the visa lottery system and the Daca. A glimpse of a different Trump in action Democrats have repeatedly said that they will block any legislation that contains funding for the border wall with Mexico - a key campaign pledge of Mr Trump's. The scheme was created in 2012 by then President Barack Obama to shield children of undocumented immigrants from deportation. It also provided work and study permits for those it covered. In order to qualify for Daca, applicants under the age of 30 were required to submit personal information to the Department of Homeland Security, including addresses and phone numbers. They had to pass an FBI background check, have a clean criminal background, and either be in school, recently graduated or have been honourably discharged from the military. In exchange, the US government agreed to ""defer"" any action on their immigration status for a period of two years. The majority of dreamers are from Mexico and other Latin American countries. The justice department has said no current Daca recipients will be affected by the decision to scrap the scheme before 5 March 2018, but no new applications will be taken.

Army ads 'won't appeal to new soldiers',"This video can not be played The new adverts from the Army are voiced by serving soldiers Critics have said an Army recruitment campaign, which promotes the emotional support given to troops, will fail to target those most likely to sign-up. New radio, TV and online adverts seek to address concerns potential soldiers might have about religion or sexuality. Retired Colonel Richard Kemp said the new Â£1.6m campaign would not solve the Army's ""recruiting crisis"". But General Sir Nick Carter, head of the Army, said the campaign reflected the country's changing demography. The new adverts, which are all voiced by serving soldiers, are part of the Army's ""belonging campaign"". They ask: ""What if I get emotional?"", ""Can I be gay in the Army?"" and ""Do I have to be a superhero?"" In one, a Muslim soldier explains how the army has allowed him to practise his faith. Colonel Kemp - the former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, who served in the Army until 2006 - said while the adverts were aimed at a number of minority groups, they missed out the Army's core recruitment pool. ""I think what the Army needs to do in order to deal with its recruiting problem is not to specifically appeal to minorities - of course, the more people from all parts of society who join the better. ""But it's even more important than that to fill the Army up with people who want to fight and want to be soldiers. And this, I don't think, will do that."" Instead, he called for the Army to focus on retention problems and deal with its ""impenetrable"" application process and the ""horrific bureaucracy"" surrounding it. Major General Timothy Cross, who retired in 2007, said the Army was ""really struggling"" with recruitment and should not be trying to be ""jolly nice to people"". By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent These are not the kind of recruitment adverts most people would probably expect from the Army. The emphasis is on the emotional rather than the physical, a sense of excitement, and the usual images of military hardware. Some will see them as a sign the Army has gone soft by focussing on people's worries. They will question whether it's another sign of pandering to political correctness. But like most large organisations, the Army wants to be seen as modern and a reflection of the society it represents. That means an emphasis on being open to all - regardless of gender, race, religion or class. It fits in with the head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter's mantra of ""maximising people's talent"" regardless of background. But he also insists that combat ethos and fighting power remain the Army's priority. These adverts just might not give that impression. However, Sir Nick said the traditional recruit had been young, white men, aged from 16-25, but demographic changes meant there were now ""not as many of those around as there once were"". ""Our society is changing and I think it is entirely appropriate for us therefore to try and reach out to a much broader base to get the talent we need in order to sustain combat effectiveness,""he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said applications to the British Army had gone up by 30-35% in the past nine months. ""What is interesting is we are now getting new types of applicant and that's why we need to adjust the approach we are using to how we nurture them into the Army."" The campaign comes just weeks after plans to scrap the Army's ""be the best"" slogan for being ""dated, elitist and non-inclusive"" were halted,according to the Mail on Sunday,,externalby Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. Sir Nick said ""Be the best"" remained the Army's ""institutional slogan"" but the current advertising campaign focused on notions of ""belonging and team-building"". Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a former Army officer and Afghanistan veteran, backed the army's attempt to attract recruits from different backgrounds. He said: ""There is no point asking the Army to reflect the society from which it is drawn and then knocking them for conducting an evidence-based change of course on recruitment."" Labour's Wes Streeting agreed, adding ""for former senior officers to point out that the Army has a recruitment problem and then knock the Army for attempting to address that issue through a positive and inclusive recruitment campaign seems thoroughly wrongheaded"". The Army put plans to abandon its crest on hold after opposition from the defence secretary The new adverts come against a backdrop of the Army straining to retain and recruit soldiers for a number of years. A report, compiled by Conservative MP Mark Francois, last year,externalwarned the armed forces were ""hollowing out"" due to recruitment issues, blaming high employment rates and demographic changes within the UK. He said problems seem ""unlikely to abate in the years immediately ahead"" and the scale of the challenge must ""not be underestimated"". Between April 2016 and March 2017, 8,194 soldiers joined the British Army. However, 9,775 left during the same period, with family life and ""opportunities outside the forces"" among the reasons given. About 10% of members of the UK regular forces are women, and 7.5% come from black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) communities.

Hospital's cancer care 'unsustainable',"This video can not be played Theresa May was challenged over the leaked Oxford hospital memo at Prime Minister's Questions Cancer care at an NHS specialist hospital is becoming ""unsustainable"" because of staff shortages, its boss has warned. A memo to Oxford's Churchill Hospital staff,which was leaked to The Times,external, said chemotherapy cycles could be cut. The memo from head of chemotherapy Dr Andrew Weaver says patients face delays as nurse numbers were about 40% down. A hospital trust spokesman stressed no decisions had yet been made that may affect treatment. Theresa May was asked to apologise to cancer patients by Labour MP Luciana Berger, who challenged her over the memo at Prime Minister's Questions earlier. In response, she said the hospital had ""made clear there are absolutely no plans to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or reduce the number of cycles of treatment"". Dr Weaver wrote the hospital did not have enough nurses trained to deal with medication at its day treatment unit. ""As a consequence we are having to delay chemotherapy patients' starting times to four weeks,"" he wrote. A memo to staff at Oxford's Churchill Hospital has been leaked An Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman told the BBC starting times were usually within four weeks, but understood the memo to mean they may have to be pushed back to the ""furthest limits"" of this time frame. He said the hospital had met the national cancer waiting time standard of starting chemotherapy within 31 days of a clinical decision having been made, despite increases in cancer patient numbers. But the memo also suggested cutting back on treatment to alleviate symptoms from six cycles to four. ""I know that many of us will find it difficult to accept these changes but the bottom line is that the current situation with limited numbers of staff is unsustainable,"" Dr Weaver adds. The thought of cancer treatment being delayed or withheld is shocking. But this is really a simple case of supply and demand. Cancer cases are becoming more common - and the numbers of staff employed to care for these patients are not rising quickly enough to keep up. A recent Cancer Research UK report found that the non-surgical workforce had increased by 4% in the past three years. The problem is that cancer incidence has risen by 8% each year. Many staff who provided feedback cited staff shortages as a key problem with chemotherapy nurses saying some of the gaps have even had to be plugged by nurses not properly trained in providing the treatment. Cancer services, just like A&E, are undoubtedly struggling to keep up. The trust spokesman said: ""We have not made any decisions to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or to reduce the number of cycles of chemotherapy treatment which patients with cancer receive. ""The internal email from Dr Andrew Weaver sets out some of the challenges facing our chemotherapy service, with his ideas for how to tackle these issues, and invites constructive comments and alternative proposals from other cancer doctors and clinical staff. ""However, it does not represent a change to our formal policy for chemotherapy treatment. ""We would like to reassure our patients that no changes to chemotherapy treatment have been made or will be made before thorough consideration has been given to all possible options."" He said that, like the rest of the NHS, the trust faced an ""ongoing challenge to recruit nursing staff"" and as well as recruiting nurses from overseas it was looking at ""rapid access to chemotherapy education and training"" for new staff. Chemotherapy cycles could be reduced from six cycles to four, the memo suggested David Bailey, who is receiving treatment at the hospital, said: ""This is quite a surprise. My treatment has been exemplary and I can't complainâ¦ and as far as I'm aware I'm set for a six-cycle course. ""What would concern me though is if I'm a new patient, or a relative of a patient, who's diagnosed."" Mr Bailey, who is also a nurse and a Unison representative, added: ""Recruiting staff in Oxford is a problem. It's the most expensive city outside of London to live."" Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said it was ""totally unacceptable"" that shortages could lead to delays. ""Immediate action needs to be taken by the government to deal with this, otherwise problems like the one at Oxford will become more widespread and more severe,"" he said. Dr Karen Roberts, chief nursing officer at Macmillan Cancer Support said: ""Such a situation is deeply worrying and delays cause untold distress to patients. ""A decision like this highlights challenges facing those working in cancer care. ""Hardworking clinicians would do everything in their power to avoid such a scenario, but this indicates that extreme staffing pressures are beginning to affect the quality of treatment patients receive."" Roz Pearce at Healthwatch Oxfordshire said she had not previously been aware of a shortage in the department and called it ""very worrying for patients"". PM challenged over leaked memo.

Call for under-16s high energy drinks ban,"Theresa May has been asked to consider a UK-wide ban on the sale of high energy drinks to under-16s. Conservative MP Maria Caulfield said a constituent's daily intake of 15 energy drinks may have contributed to his suicide. The British Soft Drinks Association said the drinks and their ingredients had been ""deemed safe"" by regulators and were not marketed to under-16s. Last week, Waitrose pledged age checks on those buying high-caffeine drinks. The supermarket said that for drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, people would be asked to prove their age from 5 March. Why our school bans energy drinks Energy drink + alcohol = trouble? Does drinking fizz make you fat? In the first prime minister's questions since Christmas, Tory vice-chairwoman Ms Caulfield told MPs her constituent ""was just 25 when he committed suicide late last year"". She added: ""His family are convinced that his intake of high energy drinks - over 15 cans a day - increased his anxiety and contributed to his death."" Theresa May paid tribute to those involved in the ""tragic case"" and passed on the ""thoughts and sympathies"" of the House of Commons. Responding to the question, she said she recognised the concerns and that a soft drinks levy had been introduced. From April 2018, companies that produce sugar-sweetened drinks will have to pay the taxin an effort to tackle the nation's obesity problem. Mrs May said: ""We know that energy drinks high in sugar can be damaging to children's health. ""We're supporting schools and parents to make healthier choices and to be able to identify those through clearer labelling [and] through campaigns."" She added it was an issue for the newly-named Department of Health and Social Care and would continue to be looked at. The British Soft Drinks Association, which represents the industry, said it had had a voluntary code of practice since 2010 to help customers make ""informed choices"". It added: ""Energy drinks are not marketed or promoted to under-16s and all beverages carry an advisory note stating: Not recommended to children. ""Energy drink manufacturers have taken all possible steps to be clear about the suitability of energy drinks. Retailers, schools and parents all have a role to play in educating children about caffeine and sugar consumption from all sources.""

Four accused of Â£1.3m Bermuda fraud,"Joel Ishmail, Samantha Bevan, Jeffrey Bevan and Paul Charity deny the fraud An accountant and his ex-headmistress wife fiddled Â£1.3m from the Bermuda government to buy luxury cars and properties, a court has heard. Jeffrey and Samantha Bevan, of Cwmbran, Torfaen, are accused of laundering proceeds of Â£1.7m ($2.4m) stolen cash to spend on a lavish lifestyle. Joel Ismail, 42, and Paul Charity, 52, both of Leicester, are also accused of taking part in the fraud. They have denied all charges and are on trial at Cardiff Crown Court. The court heard Mr Bevan, a qualified accountant, began illegally taking taxpayers' money after moving his family to Bermuda in 2011. The 50-year-old moved for a Â£80,000-a-year job as payments manager in the office of the Accountant General of Bermuda while his 52-year-old wife taught at a school on the island. The father-of-two is accused of making 52 bogus payments to himself before illegally transferring the money back to the UK in the name of the married couple. This was allegedly used to pay off the Â£140,000 mortgage on their house, invest in 11 properties in Newport, Swansea, Glasgow and Nottingham and buy two Mercedes Benz cars. Prosecutor Tim Evans described Mr Bevan as a ""gambling addict"" with a ""fascination with risk and trying to win big"". Paddy Power revealed Mr Bevan had made 18,853 bets online between November 2008 and May 2014. He deposited more than Â£2m into his account on the site, later withdrawing the remaining Â£1,539,400. Bermuda is a British overseas territory off the east coast of America The jury was told Mr Bevan quit his job after less than three years to move back to Wales - blaming his mother's poor health and the children's schooling. An investigation in Bermuda uncovered a series of bogus payments including Â£65,000 ($89,000) to Chevron International and another for Â£52,000 ($71,000) to the Sylvia Richardson Care facility, the court heard. Mr Evans said: ""Mr Bevan had gone by then. He went because he knew that he was about to be rumbled for a massive fraud."" Mr Bevan claimed the payments were for overtime while working for the Bermuda government, saying he earned Â£295 ($400) per hour working 35-hours a week but worked 50 hours a week on top of that. Mr Evans said: ""His defence will be that every cent of the $2.4 million was effectively overtime, over and above his basic and overtime hours, presumably tax free, and paid voluntarily and legitimately by the Bermudan government."" Mr Evans said members of the Bermudan government would give evidence ""about how ridiculous his claim is"". Mr Evans said Mrs Bevan must have seen money pour into their joint account and ""at the very least suspected that it was the proceeds of dishonest criminal conduct"". The jury heard Mr Bevan was being prosecuted for the Â£1.3m ($1.7m) which ""found its way to the UK"" but not the $441,995 he allegedly spent while still in Bermuda, as he could not be prosecuted for alleged offences committed in Bermuda in a UK court. Mr and Mrs Bevan deny 13 counts of converting criminal property and three counts of transferring criminal property. Friend Mr Ismail and financial advisor Mr Charity deny converting criminal property. Mr Charity, who is accused of deleting e-mails to conceal them from the police investigation, also denies perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.

5p plastic bag charge set to be extended,"The 5p charge for plastic bags in large shops in England could be extended to cover nearly all retailers, as part of government plans for the environment. Environment Secretary Michael Gove told a meeting of the cabinet that he wanted to tackle our ""throwaway culture"". Shops with fewer than 250 employees are currently exempt from the charge, which since beingintroduced in Englandin October 2015 has cut plastic use. The government is set to unveil its 25-year environment plan on Thursday. Briefing the cabinet on Tuesday, Mr Gove said the government was ""determined to tackle the throwaway culture which plastics encapsulate"". All you need to know about the 5p charge Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem 'Tidal wave of waste' hits storm beaches Four ideas to tackle coffee cup waste The 5p charge on single-use plastic bags in England has contributed to a reduction of nearly 90% in their use, the government said. Wales,ScotlandandNorthern Irelandintroduced their charges in 2011, 2014 and 2013 respectively and have also seen significant drops in usage. The charge applies to every new plastic bag used at large stores in England - but only shops or chains with 250 or more full-time employees. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there would be a consultation on extending the 5p charge in England. Chris Noice from the Association of Convenience Stores welcomed the government's plans as being ""good for the environment and good for the retailers taking part"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""approval for carrier bag charging is now very high"" among the association's 33,500 members, and more than a third of the shops it represents have already adopted the idea voluntarily. He said: ""There was a bit of an adjustment period when the initial legislation came in in England. But everyone is pretty comfortable with it now."" Plastic bags at airport shops or on board trains, planes or ships are currently not included, and neither are paper bags. More broadly, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would take a stand against the ""profligate"" use of natural resources with its 25-year plan. Last week, she said 50 million trees would be planted in a ""Northern Forest"" stretching along the M62 corridor between Liverpool and Hull over the coming 25 years, to boost natural habitats and give people access to more woodland.

MPs took part in a debate on defence in the Commons today, with Labour's Vernon Coaker underlining the ""intensification of the risks our country faces"" and urging Parliament to address those threats. In the Lords, peers debated issues including the performance of housebuilders and the role of social media companies. That's where we leave our coverage of the House of Lords for tonight - you can continue to watch the final debate using the video tab above. Thanks for joining us. Role of social media debate House of LordsParliament Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Minister Lord Ashton of Hyde says the EU recently published guidelines on how online platforms should react to illegal activities online, with further consultation on the matter. As long as the UK remains a member of the EU and bound by its rules, the UK will continue to contribute to policy in this area, he adds. As the UK leaves the EU, the UK will be forming its own policy on this matter; the government has allocated Â£9m for a planned data, ethics and innovation body, he says. The government intends to develop policies ""to make the UK the safest place to be online"". House of Lords tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Role of social media debate House of LordsParliament Labour's spokesperson Lord Griffiths of Burry Port says he believes ""this is a key moment"" for ""the fourth industrial revolution,"" in order to set rules and standards. Twitter and Facebook have both indicated their readiness in engaging in a dialogue on online practices, he says. He adds that the government could introduce a code of practice, underpinned in statute, for the social media companies, even an independent regulator; these regulations have already been recommended by Sky, he adds. Role of social media debate House of LordsParliament Baroness Jenkin of Kennington says that no-one can claim ""that this is the most digitally aware workplace in the country"". She says that she recently had to explain to a colleague that, as he wasn't on Twitter, it would be impossible for him to have any followers. He had presumed that he might have had followers on the social platform. Most women in a recent survey said they didn't report abuse online, as they didn't think the platforms would act, she says. She adds that Conservative candidates have received death threats and abuse from online sources during the most recent election, quoting to the Lords some strong words exchanged over Twitter. Role of social media debate House of LordsParliament Crossbencher Viscount Waverley uses his speech to alert the Lords to the use of government-sponsored disruption of news outlets. He says that social networks could use their algorithms which spread fake news to identify fake news ""in the first place"". He says the government should invest ""in media literacy and education programmes"". ""We must work with the social platforms and civil society groups, not against them, to close such loopholes as anonymous accounts and hyper-partisan rhetoric,"" he adds. Defence questions House of CommonsParliament Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood defends the reshuffle, saying there's been ""a huge jump in numbers"" of women on the frontbenches and ""let's not forget the prime minister is a woman"". As the UK leaves the EU, he continues, ""we remain a formidable force"" and part of ""a coalition of the willing"" which will respond to crises as they arise. This determination is what's important, he adds, ""not what organisations we might or might not be part of"". He says the defence budget is the fifth-largest in the world and the government has pledged to fund it above the rate of inflation. Defence questions House of CommonsParliament Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith winds up for Labour, outlining that the armed forces face ""immense uncertainty"" and ""significant funding gaps"". She stresses that in the context of Brexit, the UK ""must not turn inwards"" but uphold its international obligations, including those to Nato. She says spending 2% of GDP on defence ""does not go as far when growth is being downgraded"" and ""you cannot do security on the cheap"". She praises the controversial armed forces advertising campaign if it helps ""remove perceptions that deter potential applications"". The former education secretary, Justine Greening, questions Amber Rudd, who has taken her role as minister for women and equalities, about sex and relationship education in schools. This video can not be played Role of social media debate House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat Baroness Benjamin says that every day over a billion people use Facebook to share images and talk to people, but, she adds, aBBC investigation in 2017found that up to 80% of images reported to Facebook for showing sexual images of children were not acted upon. ""Corporations are blatantly avoiding the moral responsibility to protect those vulnerable children and young people in our society,"" she adds. She says that a Times investigation last month found that child sex abuse images continue to be published on YouTube. Defence questions House of CommonsParliament The SNP's defence spokesman, Stewart McDonald, points out that following the reshuffle the Ministry of Defence is ""an all-male, all-white department"" - in the same week it launches a diversity campaign. He says if he were a minister he'd be ""embarrassed"" to defend their record, focusing on the way the public-sector pay cap is affecting armed forces personnel. He adds that they ""really need to address"" armed forces' housing, some of which, he says, would not be fit for a dog. Role of social media debate House of LordsParliament ""Anything which spreads knowledge across the globe is a good thing,"" says Conservative Lord Black of Brentwood, who is also executive director of the Telegraph Media Group, ""but we have to be clear at the same time about its consequences for our society and our democracy"". He says that things have changed so rapidly in 20 years, that Google and Facebook have ""effectively become public utilities"". It's estimated that by 2020, 70% of all advertising spend will be with Google and Facebook, he adds. Free media ""must remain the custodian of democratic debate and scrutiny"", he states. Role of social media debate House of LordsParliament ""The content we consume does shape how we view ourselves, others, and the world,"" says the Bishop of Gloucester. She says that previous generations had newspapers and television to consume content, but now modern consumer and children have access to ""huge swathes of unregulated content"". She cites research carried out in 2016 which showed that 80% of teenagers had seen or come across online hate against a specific group. Role of social media debate House of LordsParliament Crossbencher Viscount Colville of Culross, himself a producer and journalist working for ITN and the BBC, rings alarm bells at the decline of quality journalism in the UK and the western world. He says some media research shows that half of people's media consumption comes from posts shared by friends, only 4% from publishers themselves. Referring to Facebook, he says that high quality websites sit alongside websites peddling rumour. He says that Ofcom and the BBC ""must hold fast"" to ensure the continuation of impartial broadcast news in the UK. People trust news in the UK, not so in the US, he adds.

House of LordsParliament Crossbench peer Baroness Kidron is introducing her debate about the role of social media and online platforms as news and content publishers. She says the big social networks have ""unparalleled power, no collective oversight and unlimited piles of cash"". Social networks have been in the spotlight for content that appears on their platforms in recent years, from ""fake news"" spread on Facebook during the 2016 US Presidential Election, abuse on Twitter and the behaviour of YouTube stars such as Logan Paul. The video blogger attracted a storm of protestand was reprimanded by the siteafter uploading a video in which he discovered a dead body in Japan's so-called 'suicide forest'. Companies like Facebook and YouTube argue that they are just platforms and are not responsible for content that appears on them. Despite this, both platforms are spending money on original content,with Facebook reportedly investing a billion dollars in 2018.,external Chinese waste import ban debate House of LordsParliament Minister Lord Gardiner of Kimble calls the debate ""timely"", giventoday's announcement that the government will aim to eradicate ""avoidable"" plastic waste by 2042. He says that his department is doing its bit, having just banned plastic cups at DEFRA HQ in Westminster. He says that China's decision to ban imports of waste plastic ""underlines why progress is imperative...we must reduce the amount of waste we produce overall"" and ""we need to reduce the amount we are exporting around the world"". Defence questions House of CommonsParliament Labour's Ruth Smeeth expresses concerns over ""holes in the defence budget"", arguing that the commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence ""should be a minimum, not a target"". She criticises the government for giving ""limited strategic consideration"" to the armed forces, and for giving the impression that its foreign policy starts and ends with the phrase ""Brexit means Brexit"". The priority should be to maintain an Army which is ""flexible, highly trained and capable of deploying quickly"", she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdictIt was the first PMQs in 2018 and the first since Theresa May reshuffled her government.10m11 minutes agoUK Politics,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have gone head-to-head in the first Prime Minister's Questions of 2018. What happened? Mr Corbyn started the new year the way he ended the last one, with an attack on the government's handling of the health service. Armed with statistics on the number of people waiting in ambulances outside Accident and Emergency units, he seized on Mrs May's comment to the BBC that ""nothing's perfect"" when asked about the pressures facing the NHS. Did she have any ""words of comfort"" for those affected, he asked? Mrs May repeated her apology to those who have had planned operations cancelled to cope with the surge in demand, but said the NHS had been better prepared than ever before for the winter pressures. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will make sure those operations are reinstated as soon as possible."" She then went on the attack, asking the Labour leader to apologise for saying - in a previous PMQs - that mental health budgets had been cut. Children's mental health budgets have been ""raided"", Mr Corbyn replied, before moving on to this week's reshuffle and saying that Mrs May had wanted to sack Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt ""but was too weak to do it"". Mr Hunt stayed in his post and has a beefed-up job title, with social care added to the name of his department. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""What words of comfort does the PM have to the 17,000 patients waiting in the back of ambulances."" Not for the first time, the two leaders continued trading blows on the NHS - Mr Corbyn hammering home his message on the cancelled operations, and Mrs May accusing Labour of ""deprioritising"" health spending in Wales, where it controls the health service. After Mr Corbyn said NHS cash was ""feathering the nests of shareholders in private health companies"", Mrs May - shouting to overcome barracking from the opposition benches - said private sector involvement had increased under Labour. The Labour leader was not the only MP to raise the NHS - Conservative MP Andrew Murrison suggested a royal commission should be established to look at the future of the service.

It was Mrs May's first Commons appearance since she changed her ministerial line-up, and she was flanked by her new ""right hand man"" David Lidington, who was given a key role in the place of the sacked Damian Green. As well as the references to Mr Hunt's position, the sight of former education secretary Justine Greening on the backbenches was a sign that things hadn't gone entirely as planned (she refused a move and quit the government). There was also an early reference to the ""housing secretary"", the new job title given to Sajid Javid. The SNP's Ian Blackford focused on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill and how the UK government plans to repatriate powers from Brussels. Allow Twitter content?

Despite having promised a power ""bonanza"" for the devolved administration, the bill is ""nothing more than a power grab from Scotland"", Mr Blackford said. The UK and Scottish governments are locked in a dispute over what will happen to powers which are currently exercised from Brussels - whether those powers move to Westminster or to the devolved nations after Brexit. Mrs May said the government was seeking to improve the section of the bill in question, and that the ministers were ""intensifying"" their discussions with Holyrood. This week it was confirmed that the proposed changes to the billhad been delayed. Another SNP MP, Pete Wishart, asked the PM to rank her Brexit efforts on a scale of one to 10 - she replied that the government was ""getting on with the job"" and he earned a telling-off from John Bercow for holding up a ""nul points"" sign.

Not the obvious phrase that comes to mind at PMQs, but that was what the new deputy chairman of the Conservatives, James Cleverly, asked the prime minister to give to her domestic agenda (""not me, don't worry"", he told MPs). ""I don't think he's ever had the kiss that he once asked for,"" Mrs May replied, to laughter. Wondering what was this all about? It's a long-running joke that dates back to Mr Cleverly'sanswer to a ""snog, marry, avoid"" questionon BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics.

Pollution hotspots revealed,"Cyclists wear masks against pollution in London Marylebone Road and Hyde Park Corner, both in central London, have the most polluted postcodes in Britain, says a new study on air quality. The data comes from a project to map concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) across the country. However, the results also show that large parts of Britain have relatively clean air. Diesel vehicles are a key source of NO2 gas, which has been linked to respiratory disease. While this study only concentrates on NO2 pollution, scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present. You can see what air quality is like in your area by entering your postcode in the search below. The data represents an average for 2016 and does not include Northern Ireland.

Although dirty air doesn't kill people directly, it's estimated to contribute to shortening the lives of 40,000 people a year in the UK. Pollution is thought to undermine the health of people with heart or lung problems. Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? Air pollution 'harms mental performance' Even low air pollution may damage heart All the BBC's news on air pollution A new analysis by the company EarthSense,externalshows NO2 concentrations in 100x100m squares across the UK. The company's technical director, Prof Roland Leigh, says it is the most detailed model yet for assessing air quality in Britain. ""By focussing it down we can really isolate the hotspots of poor air quality, and better target our solutions."" Air pollution levels in London could stay above legal limits for the next decade if action isn't taken Prof Leigh says it's important to be aware of bad pollution levels where you live, or near schools or your route to work, but that no areas in Britain are bad enough that people should avoid exercising outside. ""Air quality is actually getting better in Britain, and we are in a better state than a large number of countries -particularly across Asia. ""In Britain, it's always better to be outside exercising than inside avoiding pollution, even in the worst areas."" Keep away from the busiest roads - pollution concentrates around the heaviest traffic Use side roads - these are cleaner because there is so much less traffic Watch out for hotspots of dirty air - engines are often left running in stationary traffic. This can create ""urban canyons"" of pollution, particularly around traffic lights, so stand back after pushing the button before crossing the road When walking up a hill always stick to the side where traffic is flowing down the hill, away from the brunt of the fumes. This will always be the cleaner alternative Basic face-masks are not worth the hassle - these trap dust but little else, while heavy-duty versions are cumbersome. Scientists recommend avoiding busy roads instead In the study, each area is rated on a scale from 1, least polluted, to 6, most polluted. More than four in five postcodes in Great Britain fall into the least polluted category (1). The scale is worked out based on a probability that each area will break the annual legal limit for NO2. Areas fall foul if they average more than 40 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre. Fewer than 1% of postcodes are rated either 4 or 5, and no postcodes in Great Britain fall into the highest category - six - for areas that average over 100 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre. Three-quarters of the postcodes with theworst ratings are in London. Those outside the capital include other built-up areas as well as otherwise rural locations near motorways. Three-quarters of the postcodes which reach level five out of six are in London The company has largely based its analysis on traffic emissions, the dominant source of NO2 in the UK. In many big cities, such as London, safe limits on harmful particulates and nitrogen oxides, including NO2, are regularly breached. In the last few years, the campaign groupClientEarth has won a number of rulings against the UK governmentover air pollution. These legal challenges forced ministers to draw up plans to tackle the problem and meet EU targets on NO2. However, a recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience suggested that targets for reducing NO2 pollution could be achieved more quickly than the government expects. This was because government projections did not take into account that as cars age, they produce less of the harmful gas. Updated 8 February 2018: This article has been updated to clarify that the EarthSense study on air quality concentrates only on NO2 pollution. Scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present. Further work is being carried out to cover particulate matter.

Hospital's cancer care 'unsustainable'A memo to staff says patients face treatment delays because of staff shortages.2h2 hours agoOxford,"This video can not be played Theresa May was challenged over the leaked Oxford hospital memo at Prime Minister's Questions Cancer care at an NHS specialist hospital is becoming ""unsustainable"" because of staff shortages, its boss has warned. A memo to Oxford's Churchill Hospital staff,which was leaked to The Times,external, said chemotherapy cycles could be cut. The memo from head of chemotherapy Dr Andrew Weaver says patients face delays as nurse numbers were about 40% down. A hospital trust spokesman stressed no decisions had yet been made that may affect treatment. Theresa May was asked to apologise to cancer patients by Labour MP Luciana Berger, who challenged her over the memo at Prime Minister's Questions earlier. In response, she said the hospital had ""made clear there are absolutely no plans to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or reduce the number of cycles of treatment"". Dr Weaver wrote the hospital did not have enough nurses trained to deal with medication at its day treatment unit. ""As a consequence we are having to delay chemotherapy patients' starting times to four weeks,"" he wrote. A memo to staff at Oxford's Churchill Hospital has been leaked An Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman told the BBC starting times were usually within four weeks, but understood the memo to mean they may have to be pushed back to the ""furthest limits"" of this time frame. He said the hospital had met the national cancer waiting time standard of starting chemotherapy within 31 days of a clinical decision having been made, despite increases in cancer patient numbers. But the memo also suggested cutting back on treatment to alleviate symptoms from six cycles to four. ""I know that many of us will find it difficult to accept these changes but the bottom line is that the current situation with limited numbers of staff is unsustainable,"" Dr Weaver adds. The thought of cancer treatment being delayed or withheld is shocking. But this is really a simple case of supply and demand. Cancer cases are becoming more common - and the numbers of staff employed to care for these patients are not rising quickly enough to keep up. A recent Cancer Research UK report found that the non-surgical workforce had increased by 4% in the past three years. The problem is that cancer incidence has risen by 8% each year. Many staff who provided feedback cited staff shortages as a key problem with chemotherapy nurses saying some of the gaps have even had to be plugged by nurses not properly trained in providing the treatment. Cancer services, just like A&E, are undoubtedly struggling to keep up. The trust spokesman said: ""We have not made any decisions to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or to reduce the number of cycles of chemotherapy treatment which patients with cancer receive. ""The internal email from Dr Andrew Weaver sets out some of the challenges facing our chemotherapy service, with his ideas for how to tackle these issues, and invites constructive comments and alternative proposals from other cancer doctors and clinical staff. ""However, it does not represent a change to our formal policy for chemotherapy treatment. ""We would like to reassure our patients that no changes to chemotherapy treatment have been made or will be made before thorough consideration has been given to all possible options."" He said that, like the rest of the NHS, the trust faced an ""ongoing challenge to recruit nursing staff"" and as well as recruiting nurses from overseas it was looking at ""rapid access to chemotherapy education and training"" for new staff. Chemotherapy cycles could be reduced from six cycles to four, the memo suggested David Bailey, who is receiving treatment at the hospital, said: ""This is quite a surprise. My treatment has been exemplary and I can't complainâ¦ and as far as I'm aware I'm set for a six-cycle course. ""What would concern me though is if I'm a new patient, or a relative of a patient, who's diagnosed."" Mr Bailey, who is also a nurse and a Unison representative, added: ""Recruiting staff in Oxford is a problem. It's the most expensive city outside of London to live."" Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said it was ""totally unacceptable"" that shortages could lead to delays. ""Immediate action needs to be taken by the government to deal with this, otherwise problems like the one at Oxford will become more widespread and more severe,"" he said. Dr Karen Roberts, chief nursing officer at Macmillan Cancer Support said: ""Such a situation is deeply worrying and delays cause untold distress to patients. ""A decision like this highlights challenges facing those working in cancer care. ""Hardworking clinicians would do everything in their power to avoid such a scenario, but this indicates that extreme staffing pressures are beginning to affect the quality of treatment patients receive."" Roz Pearce at Healthwatch Oxfordshire said she had not previously been aware of a shortage in the department and called it ""very worrying for patients"". PM challenged over leaked memo.

"Deneuve: Men have right to 'hit on' womenShe is one of 100 French women who warn of a new ""puritanism"" after recent sexual harassment rows.1han hour agoEurope","Catherine Deneuve has been in more than 100 films in a career spanning decades French actress Catherine Deneuve has said that men should be ""free to hit on"" women. She is one of 100 French women who wrote an open letter, warning about a new ""puritanism"" sparked by recent sexual harassment scandals. It deplores a wave of ""denunciations"", following rape allegations made against US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. A group of French feminists condemned the letter, accusing the signatories of trivialising sexual violence. Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex, but has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"". Harvey Weinstein scandal: Who has accused him of what? The letter by French women writers, performers and academics was published in France's Le Monde newspaper on Tuesday. ""Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone's knee or try to steal a kiss,"" it said. ""Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack."" Harvey Weinstein has been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the body behind the Oscars The authors argued that there was a new ""puritanism"" afoot in the world. They said that while it was legitimate and necessary to speak out against the abuse of power by some men, the constant denunciations have spiralled out of control. According to the writers, this is creating a public mood in which women are seen as powerless, as perpetual victims. ""As women we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power, takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality."" Deneuve is by far the most prominent of them. The other 99 women who signed the document include some well-known figures, such as actress Christine Boisson; conservative journalist Ãlisabeth LÃ©vy; Brigitte Lahaie, a 1970s porn star who is now a talk-show host; Catherine Millet, a writer and magazine editor. There are also lesser-known names from the worlds of entertainment, the arts, the media, and academia. Most of the signatories, however, are professionals who are not known to the French public. The letter has stirred debate in France. On Wednesday a group of about 30 feminists issued a statement accusing Deneuve and her co-signatories of seeking to ""close the lid"" on the scandals uncovered by the Weinstein case, and of ""pouring scorn"" on victims of sexual violence. On social media, many expressed either anger or sadness at the open letter.One Twitter user (in French) regretted the inability of women to speak with one voice,external, saying they had ""failed to agree"". The backlash against the letter, however, has not been front-page news and is not trending on Twitter in France. The reason may be that controversy over exposing sex pests has been rumbling on for several months now in France. The debate has mostly pitted those belonging to the older generation, who view #Metoo and similar campaigns as a threat to the sexual liberation achieved in the 1960s, against younger, activist types who feel that the battle against harassment is the latest stage in the fight for women's rights. She is not known as an activist star.  However, last year the 74-year-old spoke out against social media campaigns shaming men accused of harassing women. Women and men from all over the globe who have been sexually harassed have been sharing their stories across social media using the hashtag #MeToo. In France, Twitter users are using #Balancetonporc  (""rat on your dirty old man"") to encourage women to name and shame their attackers. How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Ms Deneuve, an Oscar-nominated actress, has been in more than 100 films, making her debut in 1957.

"Army ads 'won't appeal to new soldiers'Critics question the Army's new recruitment drive, which focuses on sexuality, emotion and religion.18m18 minutes agoUK","This video can not be played The new adverts from the Army are voiced by serving soldiers Critics have said an Army recruitment campaign, which promotes the emotional support given to troops, will fail to target those most likely to sign-up. New radio, TV and online adverts seek to address concerns potential soldiers might have about religion or sexuality. Retired Colonel Richard Kemp said the new Â£1.6m campaign would not solve the Army's ""recruiting crisis"". But General Sir Nick Carter, head of the Army, said the campaign reflected the country's changing demography. The new adverts, which are all voiced by serving soldiers, are part of the Army's ""belonging campaign"". They ask: ""What if I get emotional?"", ""Can I be gay in the Army?"" and ""Do I have to be a superhero?"" In one, a Muslim soldier explains how the army has allowed him to practise his faith. Colonel Kemp - the former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, who served in the Army until 2006 - said while the adverts were aimed at a number of minority groups, they missed out the Army's core recruitment pool. ""I think what the Army needs to do in order to deal with its recruiting problem is not to specifically appeal to minorities - of course, the more people from all parts of society who join the better. ""But it's even more important than that to fill the Army up with people who want to fight and want to be soldiers. And this, I don't think, will do that."" Instead, he called for the Army to focus on retention problems and deal with its ""impenetrable"" application process and the ""horrific bureaucracy"" surrounding it. Major General Timothy Cross, who retired in 2007, said the Army was ""really struggling"" with recruitment and should not be trying to be ""jolly nice to people"". By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent These are not the kind of recruitment adverts most people would probably expect from the Army. The emphasis is on the emotional rather than the physical, a sense of excitement, and the usual images of military hardware. Some will see them as a sign the Army has gone soft by focussing on people's worries. They will question whether it's another sign of pandering to political correctness. But like most large organisations, the Army wants to be seen as modern and a reflection of the society it represents. That means an emphasis on being open to all - regardless of gender, race, religion or class. It fits in with the head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter's mantra of ""maximising people's talent"" regardless of background. But he also insists that combat ethos and fighting power remain the Army's priority. These adverts just might not give that impression. However, Sir Nick said the traditional recruit had been young, white men, aged from 16-25, but demographic changes meant there were now ""not as many of those around as there once were"". ""Our society is changing and I think it is entirely appropriate for us therefore to try and reach out to a much broader base to get the talent we need in order to sustain combat effectiveness,""he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said applications to the British Army had gone up by 30-35% in the past nine months. ""What is interesting is we are now getting new types of applicant and that's why we need to adjust the approach we are using to how we nurture them into the Army."" The campaign comes just weeks after plans to scrap the Army's ""be the best"" slogan for being ""dated, elitist and non-inclusive"" were halted,according to the Mail on Sunday,,externalby Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. Sir Nick said ""Be the best"" remained the Army's ""institutional slogan"" but the current advertising campaign focused on notions of ""belonging and team-building"". Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a former Army officer and Afghanistan veteran, backed the army's attempt to attract recruits from different backgrounds. He said: ""There is no point asking the Army to reflect the society from which it is drawn and then knocking them for conducting an evidence-based change of course on recruitment."" Labour's Wes Streeting agreed, adding ""for former senior officers to point out that the Army has a recruitment problem and then knock the Army for attempting to address that issue through a positive and inclusive recruitment campaign seems thoroughly wrongheaded"". The Army put plans to abandon its crest on hold after opposition from the defence secretary The new adverts come against a backdrop of the Army straining to retain and recruit soldiers for a number of years. A report, compiled by Conservative MP Mark Francois, last year,externalwarned the armed forces were ""hollowing out"" due to recruitment issues, blaming high employment rates and demographic changes within the UK. He said problems seem ""unlikely to abate in the years immediately ahead"" and the scale of the challenge must ""not be underestimated"". Between April 2016 and March 2017, 8,194 soldiers joined the British Army. However, 9,775 left during the same period, with family life and ""opportunities outside the forces"" among the reasons given. About 10% of members of the UK regular forces are women, and 7.5% come from black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) communities.

"Coco-nuts! Shoppers query plastic wrappingSainsbury's boss agrees the wrapping on coconuts is ""daft"" - but its supplier says it is recyclable.15m15 minutes agoBusiness","Genuine Coconut - which sell for Â£3 apiece - says the film is recyclable The sight of hard-shelled coconuts wrapped in a plastic-style film has left shoppers scratching their heads. For some, it is another example of pointless packaging, which is adding to the piles of plastic waste. The boss of Sainsbury's, one of the supermarkets selling the Â£3 ready-to-drink coconuts, agreed in a BBC interview that it seemed ""daft"". But the coconuts' supplier says the film is fully recyclable and keeps the water fresh for much longer. The Genuine Coconut company says the film is not a standard plastic and is made from recycled materials. It comes just a day after similar questions were raised aboutcauliflowers sliced into Â£2 ""steaks""and sold by Marks and Spencer in plastic wrapping. So has our food supply gone coco-nuts, or does the packaging help prevent another problem: food waste? The ""Genuine Coconut"" is wrapped in film, and comes with a pull top and straw to drink the coconut water. It is also sold by Waitrose, Marks and Spencer and Ocado, and compares with a normal coconut that sells at about 80p. The supplier of the coconuts - which come from Thailand - says the film helps to give them a longer shelf life of 40 days without using chemicals. But one customer asked: ""Was a coconut shell not good enough protection?"" Another Twitter user, Alex Morss, a blogger and ecologist, said: ""This coconut is not sold in its natural container, without processing, as nature intended... Plastic wrap/straws are not natural, sustainable or biodegradable."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Asked about the coconut controversy, Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coupe, told the BBC he'll ""certainly be asking some questions about why we wrap coconuts in plastic"". But he also said it is important to remember that packaging helps to protect some products. ""It does play a part in making sure we don't increase the food waste in our business as well, so there's always a trade-off to be made,"" Mr Coupe said. TheUK uses 3.7 million tonnes of plastic a year, according to trade organisation Plastics Europe, and recent changes in China have made it more difficult to process. Ministers are trying to tackle waste by making it simpler for people to recycle and byplanning to extend the 5p charge on plastic bagsto all retailers. Customers pull off a tab on the coconut and drink the water with a straw Some shops are already taking steps to reduce plastic waste. For example, Sainsbury's says it has reduced its packaging by 30% over the last five years. In the US, pre-peeled mandarins in plastic packaging wereremoved from sale by Whole Foods Marketafter a customer's photo and tweet went viral. But the Spanish company behind Genuine Coconut says the wrapping is specially designed and can be recycled. It is an ""anti-steam film"" that is recyclable and prevents the water inside the coconut from spoiling and evaporating. This replicates the coconut's original green coating, the company says, and so helps it to stay fresh for longer without preservatives and chemicals. Without the film, the coconuts could not be classed as organic, the company adds. A Sainsbury's spokeswoman said the supermarket had no plans to review the availability of a product that is ""organic and comes in packaging that is fully recyclable"".

Lidl reveals record-breaking December,"Lidl supermarket said it had record UK sales in December, with a rise of 16% on the same period in 2016. Customers bought about 600 tonnes of Brussels sprouts, 17 million mince pies and more than 800,000 litres of champagne and prosecco. The chain opened nine stores during the holiday period, bringing the total outlets to 693 - a rise of 43 on 2016. Researcher Kantar Worldpanel said the sales figures made Lidl the UK's fastest-growing grocer in December. The German company's UK chief executive Christian Hartnagel said: ""Lidl has had a fantastic 2017."" He added: ""Customers came into our stores to buy more of their Christmas items, knowing they could find high quality products at market-leading prices."" Festive food spending up by Â£1bn on 2016 Morrisons posts better-than-expected Christmas sales How wide is Aldi and Lidl's appeal among the better off? Lidl said it had its strongest trading week in UK history in the week before Christmas, with a record trading day on the Friday 22 December. The retailer plans to open its 700th UK store early this yearand has announced a new regional distribution centre for Greater London near Luton,which could potentially create up to 1,000 new jobs. Unlike British supermarkets, the German company does not publish like-for-like sales figures for the UK which strip out the impact of new store openings.

Pollution hotspots revealedEnter your postcode to see what the air quality is like where you are living in Britain.,"Cyclists wear masks against pollution in London Marylebone Road and Hyde Park Corner, both in central London, have the most polluted postcodes in Britain, says a new study on air quality. The data comes from a project to map concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) across the country. However, the results also show that large parts of Britain have relatively clean air. Diesel vehicles are a key source of NO2 gas, which has been linked to respiratory disease. While this study only concentrates on NO2 pollution, scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present. You can see what air quality is like in your area by entering your postcode in the search below. The data represents an average for 2016 and does not include Northern Ireland.

Although dirty air doesn't kill people directly, it's estimated to contribute to shortening the lives of 40,000 people a year in the UK. Pollution is thought to undermine the health of people with heart or lung problems. Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? Air pollution 'harms mental performance' Even low air pollution may damage heart All the BBC's news on air pollution A new analysis by the company EarthSense,externalshows NO2 concentrations in 100x100m squares across the UK. The company's technical director, Prof Roland Leigh, says it is the most detailed model yet for assessing air quality in Britain. ""By focussing it down we can really isolate the hotspots of poor air quality, and better target our solutions."" Air pollution levels in London could stay above legal limits for the next decade if action isn't taken Prof Leigh says it's important to be aware of bad pollution levels where you live, or near schools or your route to work, but that no areas in Britain are bad enough that people should avoid exercising outside. ""Air quality is actually getting better in Britain, and we are in a better state than a large number of countries -particularly across Asia. ""In Britain, it's always better to be outside exercising than inside avoiding pollution, even in the worst areas."" Keep away from the busiest roads - pollution concentrates around the heaviest traffic Use side roads - these are cleaner because there is so much less traffic Watch out for hotspots of dirty air - engines are often left running in stationary traffic. This can create ""urban canyons"" of pollution, particularly around traffic lights, so stand back after pushing the button before crossing the road When walking up a hill always stick to the side where traffic is flowing down the hill, away from the brunt of the fumes. This will always be the cleaner alternative Basic face-masks are not worth the hassle - these trap dust but little else, while heavy-duty versions are cumbersome. Scientists recommend avoiding busy roads instead In the study, each area is rated on a scale from 1, least polluted, to 6, most polluted. More than four in five postcodes in Great Britain fall into the least polluted category (1). The scale is worked out based on a probability that each area will break the annual legal limit for NO2. Areas fall foul if they average more than 40 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre. Fewer than 1% of postcodes are rated either 4 or 5, and no postcodes in Great Britain fall into the highest category - six - for areas that average over 100 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre. Three-quarters of the postcodes with theworst ratings are in London. Those outside the capital include other built-up areas as well as otherwise rural locations near motorways. Three-quarters of the postcodes which reach level five out of six are in London The company has largely based its analysis on traffic emissions, the dominant source of NO2 in the UK. In many big cities, such as London, safe limits on harmful particulates and nitrogen oxides, including NO2, are regularly breached. In the last few years, the campaign groupClientEarth has won a number of rulings against the UK governmentover air pollution. These legal challenges forced ministers to draw up plans to tackle the problem and meet EU targets on NO2. However, a recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience suggested that targets for reducing NO2 pollution could be achieved more quickly than the government expects. This was because government projections did not take into account that as cars age, they produce less of the harmful gas. Updated 8 February 2018: This article has been updated to clarify that the EarthSense study on air quality concentrates only on NO2 pollution. Scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present. Further work is being carried out to cover particulate matter.

Deneuve: Men have right to 'hit on' women,"Catherine Deneuve has been in more than 100 films in a career spanning decades French actress Catherine Deneuve has said that men should be ""free to hit on"" women. She is one of 100 French women who wrote an open letter, warning about a new ""puritanism"" sparked by recent sexual harassment scandals. It deplores a wave of ""denunciations"", following rape allegations made against US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. A group of French feminists condemned the letter, accusing the signatories of trivialising sexual violence. Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex, but has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"". Harvey Weinstein scandal: Who has accused him of what? The letter by French women writers, performers and academics was published in France's Le Monde newspaper on Tuesday. ""Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone's knee or try to steal a kiss,"" it said. ""Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack."" Harvey Weinstein has been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the body behind the Oscars The authors argued that there was a new ""puritanism"" afoot in the world. They said that while it was legitimate and necessary to speak out against the abuse of power by some men, the constant denunciations have spiralled out of control. According to the writers, this is creating a public mood in which women are seen as powerless, as perpetual victims. ""As women we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power, takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality."" Deneuve is by far the most prominent of them. The other 99 women who signed the document include some well-known figures, such as actress Christine Boisson; conservative journalist Ãlisabeth LÃ©vy; Brigitte Lahaie, a 1970s porn star who is now a talk-show host; Catherine Millet, a writer and magazine editor. There are also lesser-known names from the worlds of entertainment, the arts, the media, and academia. Most of the signatories, however, are professionals who are not known to the French public. The letter has stirred debate in France. On Wednesday a group of about 30 feminists issued a statement accusing Deneuve and her co-signatories of seeking to ""close the lid"" on the scandals uncovered by the Weinstein case, and of ""pouring scorn"" on victims of sexual violence. On social media, many expressed either anger or sadness at the open letter.One Twitter user (in French) regretted the inability of women to speak with one voice,external, saying they had ""failed to agree"". The backlash against the letter, however, has not been front-page news and is not trending on Twitter in France. The reason may be that controversy over exposing sex pests has been rumbling on for several months now in France. The debate has mostly pitted those belonging to the older generation, who view #Metoo and similar campaigns as a threat to the sexual liberation achieved in the 1960s, against younger, activist types who feel that the battle against harassment is the latest stage in the fight for women's rights. She is not known as an activist star.  However, last year the 74-year-old spoke out against social media campaigns shaming men accused of harassing women. Women and men from all over the globe who have been sexually harassed have been sharing their stories across social media using the hashtag #MeToo. In France, Twitter users are using #Balancetonporc  (""rat on your dirty old man"") to encourage women to name and shame their attackers. How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Ms Deneuve, an Oscar-nominated actress, has been in more than 100 films, making her debut in 1957.

Girl's bullying suicide shocks Australia,"""Dolly"" Everett had been the face of a well-known Akubra campaign when she was eight A 14-year-old girl who as a child was the face of iconic Australian outback hat firm Akubra has taken her own life over online bullying, say her family. In a Facebook post,the father of Amy ""Dolly"" Everett called for more awareness of bullying,externalso his daughter's life ""will not be wasted"". Akubra also expressed its condolences, issuing a call for all to ""stand up"" against any kind of bullying. One in five children in Australia say they were bullied in the past year. In his emotional Facebook post, written on Sunday, Dolly's father, Tick Everett, gave no details of the bullying, but said she had wanted to ""escape the evil in this world"". He said he hoped the attention on Dolly's death last week might ""help other precious lives from being lost"". He also invited the bullies to her funeral, saying: ""If by some chance the people who thought this was a joke and made themselves feel superior by the constant bullying and harassment see this post, please come to our service and witness the complete devastation you have created."" On Wednesday, the family released a statement to media outlets saying Dolly had been ""the kindest, caring, beautiful soul"". ""She was always caring for animals, small children, other children at boarding school who were less fortunate than herself."" The family shared a recent drawing by Dolly showing a skinny figure bent over backwards underneath the words: ""Speak even if your voice shakes."" ""This powerful message tells the dark, scary place our beautiful angel had travelled to,"" her family said. According to Australian broadcaster ABC, the family also said they wanted to establish a trust to raise awareness of bullying, anxiety, depression and youth suicide. The wide-brimmed rabbit-fur Akubra hat is one of Australia's most recognisable brands, closely associated with rural outback life. Dolly starred in a well-known ad campaign for the brand when she was eight. Akubra hats are a staple of Australian culture ""Bullying of any type is unacceptable,"",externalthe company wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. ""It is up to us to stand up when we see any kind of bullying behaviour. Dolly could be anyone's daughter, sister, friend."" It urged readers: ""Be a friend, check up on your mates."" Zero suicide - is it achievable? Woman kills self 'over WhatsApp bullying' According to Australia's National Centre Against Bullying (NCAB), while overall bullying rates have marginally declined over the past decade, cyberbullying has seen a sharp increase. ""What's different in the case of cyberbullying is that it can be constant, 24/7,"" Jeremy Blackman of the NCAB told the BBC. ""Another big factor is the anonymity on the internet,"" he said, explaining this can make it harder for people to feel any empathy for their victims. ""What it means it that more children can be bullies,"" he says. Despite services and help lines available, teenagers are very reluctant to report when they are victims of bullying, according to NCAB, and only reach out for help if their situation has become unbearable. There are no official statistics on suicides due to bullying. While national suicide rates in Australia are declining, the number of people between 15 and 24 taking their own life has seen a rise in recent years.

"UK manufacturing output best for 10 yearsManufacturing records its seventh consecutive month of growth, while industrial output also rises.26m26 minutes agoBusiness","UK manufacturing output is expanding at its fastest rate since early 2008 after recording a seventh consecutive month of growth in November. Renewable energy projects, boats, aeroplanes and cars for export helped make output 3.9% higher in the three months to November than in 2016. Official figures also show industrial output rose,externalby 0.4% in November. Construction output in the three months to November fell by 2%, compared with the previous three months. That was the industry's biggest quarterly fall since August 2012, with the only bright spot for the sector being a 1.2% increase in new housing. For the month of November, total production was estimated to have increased by 0.4% compared with the previous month, with the biggest contribution coming from energy supply. This increased by 3.2%, mainly because the temperature was warmer than average in October, but colder than average in November. Economic growth had slowed in the first nine months of 2017 with higher inflation caused by the fall in sterling after the Brexit referendum, although the UK economy did grow by 0.4% in the three months to September. While the manufacturing figures are good, it is important to note that the sector only makes up roughly 10% of the economy. British manufacturing is riding high on two big trends - a weaker currency and global growth. Sterling's fall in value following the Brexit referendum has made UK exports more competitive. And for the first time since the financial crisis,  the three main engines of global growth - the USA, China and Europe - are performing strongly at the same time. That has led to car exports, for example, rising rapidly - contributing to a narrowing of the trade deficit with the rest of the world. That's the difference in value between what we import and what we export. Domestically, the economic picture is more subdued, with growth still sluggish. The weak construction figures are testament to that. But, helped by that positive world outlook, Britain's manufacturing sector has not seen such quarterly buoyancy since April 2008. And it is enjoying its strongest run of growth since 1997. Read Kamal's blog here Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: ""UK manufacturers were, in the main, in good shape as 2017 came to a close, with the majority of sub-sectors enjoying growth. ""Manufacturers' expectations for the year ahead point to output and export growth being maintained through this year on the back of continuing support from a burgeoning global economy. ""This, together with an ongoing commitment from government to deliver on its industrial strategy, will be crucial in helping to propel the sector forward,"" she said. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The downturn in construction activity has been driven by new work in the private commercial sector, which was 5.4% lower in the three months to November than in the previous three months. ""Looking ahead, Brexit uncertainty is likely to continue to hit commercial projects, while the planned 4.5% decline in public sector investment in 2018/19 will additionally dampen the sector.""

"Unsigned singer third in Sound of 2018With a fearless attitude and sensual soul, Manchester vocalist IAMDDB is third on the BBC talent list.26m27 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played IAMDDB takes third place on the BBC Music Sound Of List 2018 IAMDDB, a Manchester vocalist whose music is full of fearless attitude and sensual soul, is at number three on the BBC's Sound of 2018 list. IAMDDB comes across as a fully-formed superstar who's waiting to step out of the shadows. Her sound, which melts together neo-soul, urban jazz, hip-hop and R&B, is by turns sharp and seductive. That, and her stylistic vision, are astonishingly assured for an artist who only started making waves six months ago. Her vocal and production talent are fuelled by a fierce independence and a single-minded determination that nothing is going to stand in her way. She dropped her first track in September 2016 - the same day she quit university, just an hour after enrolling. The singer was inspired to pursue her musical and artistic ambition after a trip to Angola, where her father is in one of the country's most popular bands. Before her African trip, she did make her inroads into music under her real name Diana DeBrito (such asthis song, with a great video,externalinspired byDennis Edwards' 1984 hit Don't Look Any Further,external). She was far from fully formed then. Now, she's ready to go. Why IAMDDB? DDB just stands for my initials - Diana DeBrito. I've been doing a lot of soul-searching for a while now and I thought the best way to connect with people is to show that it's cool being yourself, and I just thought I am DDB. Keep it simple. That's who I am. When did you start writing? I started writing at a very young age - about seven or eight. I recorded my first track at 11 at my dad's studio. I made Â£50. I was buzzing. An 11-year-old with Â£50! I thought I'd won the lottery. When did you start taking it seriously? Around high school time, and I did music at college. But when I went to Africa, that's when I started really understanding, OK, music is actually what I want to do. I started producing, engineering, learning the in-betweens of music, not just lyricism and the beat. Writing's always been second nature - I can write anywhere, under any circumstance. Anything can inspire me. It feels very natural to write. Why did you go to Angola? Every woman at one point in life experiences a bad relationship and I just needed different energies and different surroundings - almost a reset button to my whole existence. So I thought, I'll go to Africa, experience something completely new. We ended up going for six months and toured here and there. Did a whole heap of jazz. It was amazing. And it really inspired me. I thought, if I can do this in Africa, surely I can do something back home. Is your dad from Angola? He is. He's based in Angola and he's in a band out there - Afro soul, Afro jazz - and I thought what better way to overcome the personal issues I'm going through than to connect with music with different people? It was a very big culture shock but that whole trip taught me so much about myself, about us as humans, poverty, luxury - it was sick. I advise everybody: You must go to Africa at least once in your life. Was that a turning point for you? Definitely - that was the moment I realised, OK Dee, you want to make music? Cool, well, the world is your oyster, go out there and make music. I came back, tried to do education. I went to uni for one hour. I thought, nope, this isn't for me. The same day I started and quit uni was the same day I droppedLeaned Out,external. Sound of 2018: US star Khalid is fourth Pale Waves kick off BBC Sound of 2018 Ray BLK: Sound of 2017 winner looks back BBC Sound of 2018: Find out more Who inspires you? Bob Marley was my number one inspiration. I grew up listening to Bob Marley in the car, in the studio, in the house. Everywhere we went, Bob Marley was always playing. The way I write, the way I harmonise, everything is essentially inspired by Bob Marley. Apart from him, there's a lady called Gretchen Parlato - she's top notch. People like Jordan Rakei, Tom Misch, they've inspired me on this journey. A South African musician as well, Jimmy Dludlu - that's when I got into Afro soul and Afro jazz. Sick musician. Please check him out. How about your dad? My dad was the biggest inspiration. Watching him do it inspired me and made me think, yeah, I want to do that exact same thing. He's supported me through every decision I've made in life. Bless my mum as well - she's supported me through everything. Allow YouTube content?

I've heard you describe yourself as internally shy - are you still? Just accepting where I've come from and where I am in this state of mind and all these transitions that I'm going through, I feel like I've embraced that inner shyness and it's slowly going away and becoming this little woman that's got confidence. It's such a blessing to be able to evolve and grow, doing what I love to do. How important is being an independent artist? One thousand million per cent. So important. Top of the list. I made sure I signed myself to myself to ensure no BS was going to be involved. I made a promise to myself that if I was to do it, it would have to be 100% my way. We all know if you sign to labels, etc, you're going to have to compromise somewhere down the line, and DDB don't do compromising, I promise you, girl! Why do you want to remain unsigned? I believe in myself enough to not let anybody take control of what I do with my art. I'm always up for taking criticism that can improve it, but with regards to creative control, I feel like that's so essential for any artist to have. For me, music is my therapy. That's where I express myself. That's why I'm so honest with it. I speak about personal issues. I speak about other people's experiences. Anything I make, I own. It's so much fun because no matter what decision I make, whether it's right or wrong, it's made by me, and it's my career, so why not? It's my way or no way.

Rail franchise 'not giving value for money',"Govia Thameslink said the challenges it faced had ""sometimes been greater than expected"" Passengers on Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern services have suffered the worst rail disruption in the UK, according to a highly critical report. The National Audit Office (NAO) said the UK's largest rail franchise had not provided value for money. It found the services had been the ""worst on the network"" since Govia Thameslink (GTR) took over the routes. The Department for Transport (DfT) said industrial action had caused a shortage of train crews. It is being blamed for not ensuring adequate staffing before awarding the franchise. Government spending watchdog the NAO said GTR had too few drivers when it was awarded the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise. It added that since GTR started operating the full franchise in July 2015, 7.7% of services - about 146,000 services - had either been cancelled or delayed by more than 30 minutes, compared with 2.8% on the rest of the network. Of these, more than one third were caused by train crew shortages. The RMT union is calling for GTR to be stripped of the franchise, after the ""dynamite report blows wide open the whole scandal"" of the firm's operation. Govia Thameslink started operating the full franchise in July 2015 Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""Over the last three years long-suffering passengers on the Thameslink franchise have experienced the worst performance on the rail network. ""Some of the problems could have been avoided if the Department [for Transport] had taken more care to consider passengers in its design of the franchise."" A NAO spokesman said the DfT ""did not seek sufficient assurance that Govia Thameslink would have enough train drivers when it took on the franchise"". ""Govia Thameslink received fewer drivers than it expected from the previous operator of the Thameslink and Great Northern routes, and driver shortages have persisted on Great Northern services,"" he added. The DfT admitted disruption to passengers was ""unacceptable"", but said services had improved over the last 12 months. A spokesman said: ""The primary cause of delays and cancellations to passengers has been lack of available staff, which is a direct result of strike action."" Speaking on the Today programme Labour's Lilian Greenwood MP, chair of the Transport Committee, accused the DfT of ""passing the buck"", adding: ""Clearly the industrial action has created many of the problems that passengers have faced and it's important that the dispute is resolved. ""But I'm not hearing from the DfT that they are acknowledging their part in this and the things they need to do to improve the situation for passengers, who just a week ago saw their rail fares go up again, without seeing the improvements they were promised. ""Part of the reason they created this difficulty was by creating this mega franchise, by not looking at the implications of trying to introduce new services onto a very congested part of the railway where there was unreliable infrastructure."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling admitted his department had made mistakes Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The prime problem on this network... was the action of trade unions. ""There were mistakes made in my department, mistakes made in Network Rail, mistakes made in the operation of this railway line. I am extremely sorry."" GTR said Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern was one of the UK's largest rail franchises, carrying almost one million passengers a day. Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR, said: ""The report identifies numerous root causes for the challenges it has faced. ""These difficulties have sometimes been greater than expected and we regret the disruption caused to our passengers.""

Unsigned singer third in Sound of 2018,"This video can not be played IAMDDB takes third place on the BBC Music Sound Of List 2018 IAMDDB, a Manchester vocalist whose music is full of fearless attitude and sensual soul, is at number three on the BBC's Sound of 2018 list. IAMDDB comes across as a fully-formed superstar who's waiting to step out of the shadows. Her sound, which melts together neo-soul, urban jazz, hip-hop and R&B, is by turns sharp and seductive. That, and her stylistic vision, are astonishingly assured for an artist who only started making waves six months ago. Her vocal and production talent are fuelled by a fierce independence and a single-minded determination that nothing is going to stand in her way. She dropped her first track in September 2016 - the same day she quit university, just an hour after enrolling. The singer was inspired to pursue her musical and artistic ambition after a trip to Angola, where her father is in one of the country's most popular bands. Before her African trip, she did make her inroads into music under her real name Diana DeBrito (such asthis song, with a great video,externalinspired byDennis Edwards' 1984 hit Don't Look Any Further,external). She was far from fully formed then. Now, she's ready to go. Why IAMDDB? DDB just stands for my initials - Diana DeBrito. I've been doing a lot of soul-searching for a while now and I thought the best way to connect with people is to show that it's cool being yourself, and I just thought I am DDB. Keep it simple. That's who I am. When did you start writing? I started writing at a very young age - about seven or eight. I recorded my first track at 11 at my dad's studio. I made Â£50. I was buzzing. An 11-year-old with Â£50! I thought I'd won the lottery. When did you start taking it seriously? Around high school time, and I did music at college. But when I went to Africa, that's when I started really understanding, OK, music is actually what I want to do. I started producing, engineering, learning the in-betweens of music, not just lyricism and the beat. Writing's always been second nature - I can write anywhere, under any circumstance. Anything can inspire me. It feels very natural to write. Why did you go to Angola? Every woman at one point in life experiences a bad relationship and I just needed different energies and different surroundings - almost a reset button to my whole existence. So I thought, I'll go to Africa, experience something completely new. We ended up going for six months and toured here and there. Did a whole heap of jazz. It was amazing. And it really inspired me. I thought, if I can do this in Africa, surely I can do something back home. Is your dad from Angola? He is. He's based in Angola and he's in a band out there - Afro soul, Afro jazz - and I thought what better way to overcome the personal issues I'm going through than to connect with music with different people? It was a very big culture shock but that whole trip taught me so much about myself, about us as humans, poverty, luxury - it was sick. I advise everybody: You must go to Africa at least once in your life. Was that a turning point for you? Definitely - that was the moment I realised, OK Dee, you want to make music? Cool, well, the world is your oyster, go out there and make music. I came back, tried to do education. I went to uni for one hour. I thought, nope, this isn't for me. The same day I started and quit uni was the same day I droppedLeaned Out,external. Sound of 2018: US star Khalid is fourth Pale Waves kick off BBC Sound of 2018 Ray BLK: Sound of 2017 winner looks back BBC Sound of 2018: Find out more Who inspires you? Bob Marley was my number one inspiration. I grew up listening to Bob Marley in the car, in the studio, in the house. Everywhere we went, Bob Marley was always playing. The way I write, the way I harmonise, everything is essentially inspired by Bob Marley. Apart from him, there's a lady called Gretchen Parlato - she's top notch. People like Jordan Rakei, Tom Misch, they've inspired me on this journey. A South African musician as well, Jimmy Dludlu - that's when I got into Afro soul and Afro jazz. Sick musician. Please check him out. How about your dad? My dad was the biggest inspiration. Watching him do it inspired me and made me think, yeah, I want to do that exact same thing. He's supported me through every decision I've made in life. Bless my mum as well - she's supported me through everything. Allow YouTube content?

I've heard you describe yourself as internally shy - are you still? Just accepting where I've come from and where I am in this state of mind and all these transitions that I'm going through, I feel like I've embraced that inner shyness and it's slowly going away and becoming this little woman that's got confidence. It's such a blessing to be able to evolve and grow, doing what I love to do. How important is being an independent artist? One thousand million per cent. So important. Top of the list. I made sure I signed myself to myself to ensure no BS was going to be involved. I made a promise to myself that if I was to do it, it would have to be 100% my way. We all know if you sign to labels, etc, you're going to have to compromise somewhere down the line, and DDB don't do compromising, I promise you, girl! Why do you want to remain unsigned? I believe in myself enough to not let anybody take control of what I do with my art. I'm always up for taking criticism that can improve it, but with regards to creative control, I feel like that's so essential for any artist to have. For me, music is my therapy. That's where I express myself. That's why I'm so honest with it. I speak about personal issues. I speak about other people's experiences. Anything I make, I own. It's so much fun because no matter what decision I make, whether it's right or wrong, it's made by me, and it's my career, so why not? It's my way or no way.

Financial services 'pivotal to Brexit deal',"The EU's ""relative silence"" about the kind of post-Brexit relations it wants with the UK must end, Philip Hammond is to tell German business leaders. There is ""little, if any signal"" from the EU about its priorities for talks on future co-operation due to begin in March, the chancellor is claiming. ""They say it takes two to tango,"" he will say in in Berlin. ""Both sides need to be clear about what they want."" The EU has warned the UK cannot cherry-pick the kind of arrangement it wants. The second phase of Brexit negotiations, covering transitional arrangements after the UK leaves in March 2019 and future economic and security co-operation, are set to begin officially in March. UK's no-deal Brexit worries 'surprise' EU Barnier's hamper treat from Brexiteers Juncker: Don't believe Brexit won't happen However, internal discussions within the EU about the framework of future relations have already begun following December's first-phase agreement on so-called divorce issues, like money and citizens' rights. Mr Hammond and Brexit Secretary David Davis are aiming to lay down a marker for the talks ahead when they address the Die Welt Economic Summit. In his speech, the chancellor will say the EU must ""put behind"" it any talk of punishing the UK for voting to leave the 28-member bloc and concentrate on maximising the mutual benefits of close co-operation in areas such as defence, education, science, technology and culture. ""I know the repeated complaint from Brussels has been that the UK ""hasn't made up its mind what type of relationship it wants,"" he will say. ""But in London, many feel that we have little, if any, signal of what future relationship the EU27 would like to have with a post-Brexit Britain."" Earlier on Wednesday, in a joint-article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, the two men argued that financial services were pivotal to the ""bespoke"" Brexit trade deal wanted by the UK. They acknowledge that their stated objective of leaving the EU's internal market and customs union means the UK will not be able to enjoy all the benefits it currently does as a member of the EU after leaving. The EU has warned the UK it cannot hope to get a special deal for the City of London Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor He is taking his message to the heart of Europe. In a speech to business leaders in Berlin tonight, the chancellor will say it is time for the European Union to engage more positively in the Brexit negotiations. And stop talking about ""punishing"" the UK over Brexit. After months of grumpy noises from Brussels over a perceived lack of clarity from the UK, Philip Hammond will say that Britain needs to hear about the ambition the EU has for a deep trading relationship with the UK. My sources point out that with Australia, Canada and America all making positive overtures about free trade agreements with Britain, the lack of a similar offer from the EU could lead to unintended consequences. Logically, ""no deal"" could be one of those. And certainly the present tone of the debate from the EU is damaging the chances of a positive outcome of the Brexit negotiations, my sources say. Read Kamal's full blog But they insist the EU's desire to protect the integrity of the single market for its other 27 members is ""not inconsistent"" with the UK's desire for the most comprehensive agreement possible. ""It makes no sense to either Germany or Britain to put in place unnecessary barriers to trade in goods and services that would only damage businesses and economic growth on both sides of the Channel,"" they write. ""So as Brexit talks now turn to trade, the UK will look to negotiate a new economic partnership with the EU - the most ambitious in the world - that recognises the extraordinary levels of interconnectedness and co-operation that already exist between us. ""We should use the imagination and ingenuity that our two countries and the EU have shown in the past, to craft a bespoke solution."" The UK's preferred model for a post-Brexit deal is what Mr Davis has described as Canada plus, plus, plus - a reference to Canada's low-tariff free trade deal with the EU but with services included as well as goods. The two men make clear in the article that unrestricted trade in services - which makes up about 80% of the UK economy - will be pivotal to any successful deal, as will financial and regulatory co-operation within Europe. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned the UK it cannot hope to get a special deal for the City of London and that its options have narrowed as a result of it turning its back on the single market. UK-based banks and financial firms are worried they will lose the passporting rights that allow them to trade freely in the EU after Brexit - an outcome that is likely to see firms moving jobs to the continent. Separately, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has urged Conservative backbenchers to not view everything through the ""prism of Brexit"", says BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Dr Fox told the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs on Wednesday to focus on the ""bigger picture"", pointing toan increase in UK manufacturing ordersand expectations thatthe economy will growin the next quarter. He said there was a political danger in suggesting events were ""because of"" or ""despite"" Brexit because the government could lose credit for the economic recovery - that it would not ""own"" the recovery. He is also believed to have told his Conservative colleagues that Labour remained in a state of confusion on Brexit and that some of their voting record on the withdrawal bill could be used as a weapon against them in key constituencies.

GalleryMudslides cause chaos in California,"Rescue workers are still searching for survivors after a deadly mudslide destroyed homes in Montecito, southern California A wall of mud after torrential rain swept through the small town. Montecito is strewn with debris and conditions for rescue teams are said to be dangerous. Dozens of people have been rescued so far and more than 160 have been taken to hospital The first rain in months hit ground that had been scorched by December's wildfires. The fires had created a water repellent layer over the soil. In some places the mud was waist-deep, and police said the scene ""looked like a World War One battlefield"". More than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal road have been closed and many places are still inaccessible. Thousands had to flee their homes, many for the second time in two months after the wildfires. Some houses were knocked off their foundations. The mudslides follow the costliest year on record for climate-related disaster in the US with fires, floods and hurricanes costing $306bn (Â£226bn) in 2017.

"Rail franchise 'not giving value for money'Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern passengers suffer the worst disruption in the UK, a report says.2h2 hours agoEngland","Govia Thameslink said the challenges it faced had ""sometimes been greater than expected"" Passengers on Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern services have suffered the worst rail disruption in the UK, according to a highly critical report. The National Audit Office (NAO) said the UK's largest rail franchise had not provided value for money. It found the services had been the ""worst on the network"" since Govia Thameslink (GTR) took over the routes. The Department for Transport (DfT) said industrial action had caused a shortage of train crews. It is being blamed for not ensuring adequate staffing before awarding the franchise. Government spending watchdog the NAO said GTR had too few drivers when it was awarded the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise. It added that since GTR started operating the full franchise in July 2015, 7.7% of services - about 146,000 services - had either been cancelled or delayed by more than 30 minutes, compared with 2.8% on the rest of the network. Of these, more than one third were caused by train crew shortages. The RMT union is calling for GTR to be stripped of the franchise, after the ""dynamite report blows wide open the whole scandal"" of the firm's operation. Govia Thameslink started operating the full franchise in July 2015 Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""Over the last three years long-suffering passengers on the Thameslink franchise have experienced the worst performance on the rail network. ""Some of the problems could have been avoided if the Department [for Transport] had taken more care to consider passengers in its design of the franchise."" A NAO spokesman said the DfT ""did not seek sufficient assurance that Govia Thameslink would have enough train drivers when it took on the franchise"". ""Govia Thameslink received fewer drivers than it expected from the previous operator of the Thameslink and Great Northern routes, and driver shortages have persisted on Great Northern services,"" he added. The DfT admitted disruption to passengers was ""unacceptable"", but said services had improved over the last 12 months. A spokesman said: ""The primary cause of delays and cancellations to passengers has been lack of available staff, which is a direct result of strike action."" Speaking on the Today programme Labour's Lilian Greenwood MP, chair of the Transport Committee, accused the DfT of ""passing the buck"", adding: ""Clearly the industrial action has created many of the problems that passengers have faced and it's important that the dispute is resolved. ""But I'm not hearing from the DfT that they are acknowledging their part in this and the things they need to do to improve the situation for passengers, who just a week ago saw their rail fares go up again, without seeing the improvements they were promised. ""Part of the reason they created this difficulty was by creating this mega franchise, by not looking at the implications of trying to introduce new services onto a very congested part of the railway where there was unreliable infrastructure."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling admitted his department had made mistakes Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The prime problem on this network... was the action of trade unions. ""There were mistakes made in my department, mistakes made in Network Rail, mistakes made in the operation of this railway line. I am extremely sorry."" GTR said Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern was one of the UK's largest rail franchises, carrying almost one million passengers a day. Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR, said: ""The report identifies numerous root causes for the challenges it has faced. ""These difficulties have sometimes been greater than expected and we regret the disruption caused to our passengers.""

"Woman 'killed dad and buried him'The woman made a confession at Cheadle Heath police station on Sunday, say police.8m9 minutes agoManchester","This video can not be played Forensic teams at a property in Reddish after remains were found in a garden A man whose body was found buried in a garden was allegedly killed by his daughter several years ago, the BBC understands. Greater Manchester Police said a woman made a confession at Cheadle Heath police station on Sunday. On Tuesday, remains believed to be of Kenneth Coombes, were found in a garden in Matlock Road, Reddish, near Stockport. A 63-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder. It is thought the remains found in Reddish are that of Kenneth Coombes The woman was named locally as Barbara Coombes. A force spokesman said the man had not been formally identified but his family had been informed and was being supported. Forensic officers have been searching the address since the discovery Det Insp Dan Clegg said: ""The investigation is still in its early stages and many questions still need answers. ""We will continue our work at the scene and hope in the coming days we can piece together the exact circumstances surrounding the man's death. ""I would like to thank the community for their support and we will do all that we can to find out what happened."" The cordon on this quiet suburban street has now been extended a second time. After the grim discovery of human remains on Tuesday, the road was shut and the cordon now extends to 200ft as police continue to search the crime scene. Forensic teams have worked through the night with much of the work focusing on the rear end of the garden. Workmen at the property next door have been told they cannot work today as the search continues. Door-to-door inquiries have been made in Matlock Road, where residents have been asked if they knew Mr Coombes. The questionnaire suggests he would have been in his late 80s in 2005 and electoral records appear to confirm he lived at the address. One neighbour said the discovery was ""shocking and strange"" Yvonne Harrison, who lives a few doors away from the crime scene, spoke of her ""horror"" at the discovery. ""It's really shocking and very strange,"" she said. Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ""You never expect anything like this on your doorstep. ""All the neighbours are shocked and everyone is talking about it, but no-one seems to know much about that family."" Neighbour Stella Ashton added: ""We just saw the forensic teams and assumed there had been a break-in. ""Police came yesterday. Just asked if I had heard anything, any whispers. ""I didn't hear anything other than she lived with her parents, many years ago her mum died and shortly afterwards her dad wasn't seen again."" One neighbour said the discovery was ""shocking and strange"" She added: ""This morning I had to come out with my two children because they get the private school bus at the end of this road. ""It was a bit daunting this morning when it was dark and police would only escort them one by one through, they wouldn't let the children walk through on their own.""

Food price rise 'to ease this year',"This video can not be played Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe on rising food prices Shoppers should see the pace at which food prices are rising start to come down in the next six to nine months, the boss of Sainsbury's has predicted. Mike Coupe said supermarkets were ""over the hump"" of inflation driven by the fall in the value of the pound. He made the prediction as Sainsbury's reported rising food sales in the last three months, including over Christmas. The UK's second largest supermarket chain said grocery sales rose 2.3%, helped by higher food prices. Food prices have gone up, as the drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote made imports more expensive. ""We've done everything we can as a business to mitigate that but we can't get away from the fact that food prices are going up,"" Mr Coupe told the BBC. But with that effect wearing off, food price inflation should ""gradually reduce over the next six to nine months"", he said. Sainsbury's, which also owns Argos,sold 1.1% more,externalin the last three months, as higher grocery sales made up for a 1.4% fall in general merchandise and slower clothing sales. Argos's Fast Track delivery and collection grew strongly over the period, but that was not enough to stop a slide in Argos's sales. ""The general merchandise that Argos sells may be a millstone around the group's neck right now, but longer term the appeal of combining Christmas grocery and gift shopping in one location is clear to see,"" said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The supermarket said it had ""record"" sales over Christmas, as discounted turkeys and other trimmings brought in more shoppers. Sainsbury's now expects pre-tax profits to be slightly higher than the previous estimate of Â£559m, helped by higher cost savings from its takeover of Argos. The company also said it would save an extra Â£40m as part of a Â£500m cost-cutting drive that includesaxing 2,000 jobs.

Army ad promises 'emotional support',"This video can not be played The new adverts from the Army are voiced by serving soldiers Critics have said an Army recruitment campaign, which promotes the emotional support given to troops, will fail to target those most likely to sign-up. New radio, TV and online adverts seek to address concerns potential soldiers might have about religion or sexuality. Retired Colonel Richard Kemp said the new Â£1.6m campaign would not solve the Army's ""recruiting crisis"". But General Sir Nick Carter, head of the Army, said the campaign reflected the country's changing demography. The new adverts, which are all voiced by serving soldiers, are part of the Army's ""belonging campaign"". They ask: ""What if I get emotional?"", ""Can I be gay in the Army?"" and ""Do I have to be a superhero?"" In one, a Muslim soldier explains how the army has allowed him to practise his faith. Colonel Kemp - the former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, who served in the Army until 2006 - said while the adverts were aimed at a number of minority groups, they missed out the Army's core recruitment pool. ""I think what the Army needs to do in order to deal with its recruiting problem is not to specifically appeal to minorities - of course, the more people from all parts of society who join the better. ""But it's even more important than that to fill the Army up with people who want to fight and want to be soldiers. And this, I don't think, will do that."" Instead, he called for the Army to focus on retention problems and deal with its ""impenetrable"" application process and the ""horrific bureaucracy"" surrounding it. Major General Timothy Cross, who retired in 2007, said the Army was ""really struggling"" with recruitment and should not be trying to be ""jolly nice to people"". By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent These are not the kind of recruitment adverts most people would probably expect from the Army. The emphasis is on the emotional rather than the physical, a sense of excitement, and the usual images of military hardware. Some will see them as a sign the Army has gone soft by focussing on people's worries. They will question whether it's another sign of pandering to political correctness. But like most large organisations, the Army wants to be seen as modern and a reflection of the society it represents. That means an emphasis on being open to all - regardless of gender, race, religion or class. It fits in with the head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter's mantra of ""maximising people's talent"" regardless of background. But he also insists that combat ethos and fighting power remain the Army's priority. These adverts just might not give that impression.

Critics question Army recruitment drive,"This video can not be played The new adverts from the Army are voiced by serving soldiers Critics have said an Army recruitment campaign, which promotes the emotional support given to troops, will fail to target those most likely to sign-up. New radio, TV and online adverts seek to address concerns potential soldiers might have about religion or sexuality. Retired Colonel Richard Kemp said the new Â£1.6m campaign would not solve the Army's ""recruiting crisis"". But General Sir Nick Carter, head of the Army, said the campaign reflected the country's changing demography. The new adverts, which are all voiced by serving soldiers, are part of the Army's ""belonging campaign"". They ask: ""What if I get emotional?"", ""Can I be gay in the Army?"" and ""Do I have to be a superhero?"" In one, a Muslim soldier explains how the army has allowed him to practise his faith. Colonel Kemp - the former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, who served in the Army until 2006 - said while the adverts were aimed at a number of minority groups, they missed out the Army's core recruitment pool. ""I think what the Army needs to do in order to deal with its recruiting problem is not to specifically appeal to minorities - of course, the more people from all parts of society who join the better. ""But it's even more important than that to fill the Army up with people who want to fight and want to be soldiers. And this, I don't think, will do that."" Instead, he called for the Army to focus on retention problems and deal with its ""impenetrable"" application process and the ""horrific bureaucracy"" surrounding it.

Hospital's cancer care 'unsustainable'A memo from the head of chemotherapy said patients face treatment delays because of staff shortages.10m10 minutes agoOxford,"This video can not be played Theresa May was challenged over the leaked Oxford hospital memo at Prime Minister's Questions Cancer care at an NHS specialist hospital is becoming ""unsustainable"" because of staff shortages, its boss has warned. A memo to Oxford's Churchill Hospital staff,which was leaked to The Times,external, said chemotherapy cycles could be cut. The memo from head of chemotherapy Dr Andrew Weaver says patients face delays as nurse numbers were about 40% down. A hospital trust spokesman stressed no decisions had yet been made that may affect treatment. Theresa May was asked to apologise to cancer patients by Labour MP Luciana Berger, who challenged her over the memo at Prime Minister's Questions earlier. In response, she said the hospital had ""made clear there are absolutely no plans to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or reduce the number of cycles of treatment"". Dr Weaver wrote the hospital did not have enough nurses trained to deal with medication at its day treatment unit. ""As a consequence we are having to delay chemotherapy patients' starting times to four weeks,"" he wrote. A memo to staff at Oxford's Churchill Hospital has been leaked An Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman told the BBC starting times were usually within four weeks, but understood the memo to mean they may have to be pushed back to the ""furthest limits"" of this time frame. He said the hospital had met the national cancer waiting time standard of starting chemotherapy within 31 days of a clinical decision having been made, despite increases in cancer patient numbers. But the memo also suggested cutting back on treatment to alleviate symptoms from six cycles to four. ""I know that many of us will find it difficult to accept these changes but the bottom line is that the current situation with limited numbers of staff is unsustainable,"" Dr Weaver adds. The thought of cancer treatment being delayed or withheld is shocking. But this is really a simple case of supply and demand. Cancer cases are becoming more common - and the numbers of staff employed to care for these patients are not rising quickly enough to keep up. A recent Cancer Research UK report found that the non-surgical workforce had increased by 4% in the past three years. The problem is that cancer incidence has risen by 8% each year. Many staff who provided feedback cited staff shortages as a key problem with chemotherapy nurses saying some of the gaps have even had to be plugged by nurses not properly trained in providing the treatment. Cancer services, just like A&E, are undoubtedly struggling to keep up. The trust spokesman said: ""We have not made any decisions to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or to reduce the number of cycles of chemotherapy treatment which patients with cancer receive. ""The internal email from Dr Andrew Weaver sets out some of the challenges facing our chemotherapy service, with his ideas for how to tackle these issues, and invites constructive comments and alternative proposals from other cancer doctors and clinical staff. ""However, it does not represent a change to our formal policy for chemotherapy treatment. ""We would like to reassure our patients that no changes to chemotherapy treatment have been made or will be made before thorough consideration has been given to all possible options."" He said that, like the rest of the NHS, the trust faced an ""ongoing challenge to recruit nursing staff"" and as well as recruiting nurses from overseas it was looking at ""rapid access to chemotherapy education and training"" for new staff. Chemotherapy cycles could be reduced from six cycles to four, the memo suggested David Bailey, who is receiving treatment at the hospital, said: ""This is quite a surprise. My treatment has been exemplary and I can't complainâ¦ and as far as I'm aware I'm set for a six-cycle course. ""What would concern me though is if I'm a new patient, or a relative of a patient, who's diagnosed."" Mr Bailey, who is also a nurse and a Unison representative, added: ""Recruiting staff in Oxford is a problem. It's the most expensive city outside of London to live."" Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said it was ""totally unacceptable"" that shortages could lead to delays. ""Immediate action needs to be taken by the government to deal with this, otherwise problems like the one at Oxford will become more widespread and more severe,"" he said. Dr Karen Roberts, chief nursing officer at Macmillan Cancer Support said: ""Such a situation is deeply worrying and delays cause untold distress to patients. ""A decision like this highlights challenges facing those working in cancer care. ""Hardworking clinicians would do everything in their power to avoid such a scenario, but this indicates that extreme staffing pressures are beginning to affect the quality of treatment patients receive."" Roz Pearce at Healthwatch Oxfordshire said she had not previously been aware of a shortage in the department and called it ""very worrying for patients"". PM challenged over leaked memo.

Waist-deep California mudslides kill 13,"This video can not be played Californian mudslides: '""Like a World War One battlefield,""â said Santa Barbara's county sheriff At least 13 people are dead amid ""waist-deep"" mudslides in Southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding, say officials. Some 163 people have been taken to hospital. Twenty had ""storm-related injuries"" and four were critically hurt. A group of up to 300 people are reportedly trapped in Romero Canyon, east of Santa Barbara. Police said the scene ""looked like a World War One battlefield"". Boulders the size of cars rolled down hills and slammed into roadways The flooding and mudslides, affecting areas scorched by wildfires last month, have shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal road. Emergency services said a number of people were unaccounted for and they expected the number of deaths to rise. Thousands fled the deluge and more than 50 rescues have been performed. The hardest-hit homes were those that were not in the evacuation zone, officials say. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Heavy rain run-off caused a mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked off their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason. Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, reports BBC News Los Angeles correspondent James Cook. Among those taken to safety was a 14-year-old girl who had been trapped for hours in the ruins of her home. The fire department published a picture of the girl encased in mud as she was led to safety. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed, including the major Highway 101. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. A search dog looks for victims in damaged homes after a mudslide in Montecito The Federal Emergency Management Agency shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk. This comes after arecord-setting year of $306bn (Â£226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costsin the United States, the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The storm over California is expected to produce 4in to 7in (10 to 18 cm) in the foothills and 9in (23cm) in select areas.

Sainsbury's profits boosted by Christmas,"This video can not be played Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe on rising food prices Shoppers should see the pace at which food prices are rising start to come down in the next six to nine months, the boss of Sainsbury's has predicted. Mike Coupe said supermarkets were ""over the hump"" of inflation driven by the fall in the value of the pound. He made the prediction as Sainsbury's reported rising food sales in the last three months, including over Christmas. The UK's second largest supermarket chain said grocery sales rose 2.3%, helped by higher food prices. Food prices have gone up, as the drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote made imports more expensive. ""We've done everything we can as a business to mitigate that but we can't get away from the fact that food prices are going up,"" Mr Coupe told the BBC. But with that effect wearing off, food price inflation should ""gradually reduce over the next six to nine months"", he said. Sainsbury's, which also owns Argos,sold 1.1% more,externalin the last three months, as higher grocery sales made up for a 1.4% fall in general merchandise and slower clothing sales. Argos's Fast Track delivery and collection grew strongly over the period, but that was not enough to stop a slide in Argos's sales. ""The general merchandise that Argos sells may be a millstone around the group's neck right now, but longer term the appeal of combining Christmas grocery and gift shopping in one location is clear to see,"" said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The supermarket said it had ""record"" sales over Christmas, as discounted turkeys and other trimmings brought in more shoppers. Sainsbury's now expects pre-tax profits to be slightly higher than the previous estimate of Â£559m, helped by higher cost savings from its takeover of Argos. The company also said it would save an extra Â£40m as part of a Â£500m cost-cutting drive that includesaxing 2,000 jobs.

Steve Bannon leaves Breitbart News,"Bannon left his White House job amid reports of a power struggle Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's ex-chief strategist, has stepped down from the right-wing Breitbart News organisation where he built his reputation. The move comes amid a furore over remarks he reportedly made about President Donald Trump's son. He described a meeting Donald Trump Jr held in New York with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign as ""treasonous"". He was one of Mr Trump's most trusted - and controversial - aides. But he left his post last summer after reports of a power struggle among Mr Trump's White House staff. Bannon attempts to reverse treason remark Winners and losers from Trump-Bannon feud Who was Donald Trump's chief strategist? His subsequent attempt to take on the Republican establishment suffered a severe blow when Roy Moore, the Senate candidate he championed in a special election in Alabama, lost to a Democrat - the first time that party has won in the state in decades. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Steve Bannon's fall from power is now complete. He was first stripped of his top White House job. Now he has been cashiered from his position atop a media empire he helped create. As he surveys the rubble, he has no-one to blame but himself. In both instances, his decision to speak his mind publicly was his undoing. He criticised administration policies and, in an even greater transgression, took aim at Donald Trump's own family in sharply personal terms. When the White House made it clear last week it was time to pick sides between Mr Trump and Mr Bannon, the choice for most conservatives was clear. Now Mr Bannon's hopes of funding insurgent candidates against incumbent Republican senators in 2018, and boosting their candidacies through his media megaphone, have been dashed. What's more, he has to watch as the president he helped elect on an economic nationalist platform negotiates comprehensive immigration reform, touts a sweeping corporate tax cut recently signed into law and plans a visit to the globalist summit at Davos, Switzerland. This was not the revolution Mr Bannon, just a year ago, may have envisioned. Mr Trump has recently taken to referring to Mr Bannon as ""Sloppy Steve"", a derogatory reference to his former aide's famously dishevelled appearance. And Rebekah Mercer, a wealthy benefactor of Mr Bannon, said at the weekend she had ended her support for his political efforts. Last Sunday Mr Bannon insisted that his ""treason"" comments - quoted in an inside account of the Trump White House, Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury - were not directed at Mr Trump's son but at another former aide, Paul Manafort, who was also present at the meeting in Trump Tower. The Senate, House of Representatives and a special counsel are all investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election, allegations denied by both the Kremlin and Mr Trump. Mr Bannon had served as executive chairman of Breitbart since 2012. Breitbart published a statement,externalsaying it and Mr Bannon would ""work together on a smooth and orderly transition"". It quoted Mr Bannon as saying: ""I'm proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform."" Breitbart CEO Larry Solov was quoted as saying: ""Steve is a valued part of our legacy, and we will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish.""

Body found in garden after confession,"This video can not be played Forensic teams at a property in Reddish after remains were found in a garden A man whose body was found buried in a garden was allegedly killed by his daughter several years ago, the BBC understands. Greater Manchester Police said a woman made a confession at Cheadle Heath police station on Sunday. On Tuesday, remains believed to be of Kenneth Coombes, were found in a garden in Matlock Road, Reddish, near Stockport. A 63-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder. It is thought the remains found in Reddish are that of Kenneth Coombes The woman was named locally as Barbara Coombes. A force spokesman said the man had not been formally identified but his family had been informed and was being supported. Forensic officers have been searching the address since the discovery Det Insp Dan Clegg said: ""The investigation is still in its early stages and many questions still need answers. ""We will continue our work at the scene and hope in the coming days we can piece together the exact circumstances surrounding the man's death. ""I would like to thank the community for their support and we will do all that we can to find out what happened."" The cordon on this quiet suburban street has now been extended a second time. After the grim discovery of human remains on Tuesday, the road was shut and the cordon now extends to 200ft as police continue to search the crime scene. Forensic teams have worked through the night with much of the work focusing on the rear end of the garden. Workmen at the property next door have been told they cannot work today as the search continues. Door-to-door inquiries have been made in Matlock Road, where residents have been asked if they knew Mr Coombes. The questionnaire suggests he would have been in his late 80s in 2005 and electoral records appear to confirm he lived at the address. One neighbour said the discovery was ""shocking and strange"" Yvonne Harrison, who lives a few doors away from the crime scene, spoke of her ""horror"" at the discovery. ""It's really shocking and very strange,"" she said. Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ""You never expect anything like this on your doorstep. ""All the neighbours are shocked and everyone is talking about it, but no-one seems to know much about that family."" Neighbour Stella Ashton added: ""We just saw the forensic teams and assumed there had been a break-in. ""Police came yesterday. Just asked if I had heard anything, any whispers. ""I didn't hear anything other than she lived with her parents, many years ago her mum died and shortly afterwards her dad wasn't seen again."" One neighbour said the discovery was ""shocking and strange"" She added: ""This morning I had to come out with my two children because they get the private school bus at the end of this road. ""It was a bit daunting this morning when it was dark and police would only escort them one by one through, they wouldn't let the children walk through on their own.""

Jetpack pilot suffers fear of heights,"Mr Mayman is promoting a forthcoming jetpack at the CES tech show A former commercial pilot who has carried out about 500 jetpack test flights has admitted that he does not like heights. ""I can look out of the window of an aeroplane no problem,"" David Mayman, chief executive of Jetpack Aviation, told the BBC. ""But even being in the office when I look out of the window I feel the hairs stand up on the back of my neck."" He added that his secret to being able to fly was: ""I try not to look down."" Jetpack Aviation is at the CES tech show in Las Vegas to show off a prototype of its latest jetpack model, the JB-11. It can fly as high as 15,000ft (4,572m) for up to 12 minutes. Its top speed is 200mph (321 km/h) and the maximum distance it can travel in a single journey is about 20 miles. It can carry a person weighing up to 120kg (265lb). Mr Mayman jetted over Port of Long Beach, California for this photo in November 2016 The machine is powered by six turbo jet engines and carries 25 litres (5.4 gallons) of fuel. The controls are a mixture of manual and computer control, Mr Mayman said. Tilting the joystick-like handles down changes the vector of the thrust, pushing the device backwards. ""I think it's as close as you get to that dream of the magic carpet, just being able to float gently above the ground."" The prototype is capable of short trips but not long distance travel Mr Mayman said most of his firm's clients are military, including the US Special Forces, but that one day the jetpack could also be a useful tool for the emergency services.

Hands-on with HTC's untethered VR headset He added that he personally became involved with the business almost by accident. ""I became a jetpack pilot [because] I couldn't convince anyone to fly the thing when we first started developing it 10 years ago,"" he recalled. ""So, I ended up being chief executive and crash test dummy. ""When I'm in the jetpack I look at the horizon and I try not to look down past my feet. ""I get butterflies in my tummy and the blood rushes from my brain."" He added that his own experience suggested that jetpacks would not become a common mode of transport, at least in their current form. ""In the future what everybody will fly with is something you would sit on,"" he said. ""Something more comfortable than this.""

GalleryWildfires in pictures,"California is entering its sixth day battling dangerous wildfires. They have been driven by extreme weather conditions: low humidity, high winds and parched ground. Authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"". Fanned by high winds, six large fires, and other smaller blazes, swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, with many drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County is the largest, and has destroyed more than 430 buildings. Nearly 200,000 residents were evacuated from their homes, with many forced to flee in the middle of the night as the flames rapidly spread. Three firefighters have been injured and hundreds of buildings destroyed. One death was reported after a 70-year-old woman was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast. US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in response to the fires. There are fears the blaze will hurt California's vast agricultural industry. Much of the state's avocado crop has been destroyed. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California and the industry is worth millions to the economy. The fires have destroyed homes and scorched residential areas. In the wealthy Los Angeles enclave of Bel Air, firefighters were seen removing belongings from luxury homes as the flames spread. Several evacuation orders were lifted on Friday afternoon, leaving residents free to return home and assess the damage.

'Beloved' seaplane crash pilot remembered,"Pilot Gareth Morgan has been remembered at a funeral service in Sydney The pilot of a seaplane that crashed in Australia, killing himself and a UK family, has been remembered as a loving son and devout Christian. Canada-raised Gareth Morgan, 44, died when his seaplane plunged into a river north of Sydney on New Year's Eve. The crash also killed high-profile business leader Richard Cousins and four members of his family. At Mr Morgan's funeral on Wednesday, his mother spoke about the pilot's warm smile and the ""depth of his soul"". ""I believe that being in the air made him feel closer to God,"" Orlis Morgan told the service, reported the Australian Associated Press. ""After 20 years of flying float planes in the far corners of the earth, you have come home."" His parents travelled from Canada for the church service in Sydney, which was attended by more than 100 people. Dudley Morgan said his son was ""beloved"" and would be greatly missed. Tributes paid to seaplane crash family Seaplane retrieved after fatal Sydney crash Victims (clockwise from top left) Richard Cousins, Emma Bowden, Will Cousins, Gareth Morgan, Heather Bowden, Ed Cousins Last week, Australian authorities recovered the plane's wreckage from the bottom of the Hawkesbury River, about 50km (30 miles) from Sydney. Mr Cousins, 58, was chief executive of FTSE 100 catering company Compass Group. The other victims were his 48-year-old fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, her 11-year-old daughter Heather and his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25. The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, had been flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay, not far from the crash site. This video can not be played The aircraft was retrieved by investigators last week Mr Morgan, an experienced pilot, had worked for sightseeing company Sydney Seaplanes for several years. Australian investigators are expected to release a preliminary report into the crash later this month.

Disruption looms as rail strikes hit,"RMT general secretary Mick Cash (centre) visiting pickets in Colchester Train passengers face another day of disruption as union members at four rail firms stage the latest 24-hour strikes in disputes over safety. Services on Greater Anglia, Merseyrail, Northern and South Western Railway, including its Isle of Wight Island Line, are likely to be affected on Wednesday. RMT union members also walked out on Monday and plan to again on Friday. The Department for Transport denied the dispute was about safety. It said rail companies would ""keep passengers moving"". During Monday's strike, commuters packed on to a South Western Railway train on the Portsmouth to London Waterloo line The disputes the union has with rail firms include concerns over the role of guards, fears over safety and job losses surrounding plans to introduce new driver-only operated trains. RMT union members have been told not to book shifts between 00:01 and 23:59 GMT on strike days. Services during strike action: Greater Anglia,externalsaid it was ""very disappointed that the strike is going ahead"" and plans to run a full service Merseyrail,externalsaid ""unfortunately"" it would run a reduced service in and around Liverpool between 07:00 and 19:00, but with a break during the middle of the day. There will be no trains on Kirkby, Ellesmere Port or Hunts Cross lines Northern,external, which covers north-west and north-east England, said it was ""focusing on running as many trains as it can"" and will operate about 1,350 trains on strike days - roughly 60% of its normal services between 07:00 and 19:00 South Western Railway,external, which operates in areas including London Waterloo, Reading, Exeter and Southampton, said it had ""offered assurances around the need for more guards in the future"" and planned to run about 70% of its normal services, while there would be bus replacements on its Isle of Wight Island Line Commuters were able to travel on Greater Anglia's train at Shenfield in Essex on Monday as it ran a normal service RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Our members are standing firm this morning in the separate disputes across the country in defence of rail safety and the role of the guard. ""This week, in the midst of the Tory reshuffle shambles, we called on Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to organise summit talks to move these disputes forwards. We have had no response. ""Mr Grayling's silence speaks volumes and, with today's damning NAO report into the Southern Rail fiasco, it is becoming clearer by the minute that all the Tory government are interested in is protecting the fat profits of the greedy private rail companies regardless of the impact on services and safety. ""The strikes today are about putting public safety before private profit."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Cash said the agreements had been reached in Scotland and Wales to keep guards on new modern trains. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""This is a dispute between a private company and the RMT. However, the Transport Secretary recognises the disruption caused to passengers and has met with union leaders on several occasions, including as recently as December, to help bring an end to the strikes. ""He offered guarantees of employment to members who currently fulfil the role of the second person on the train beyond the length of the franchises - instead the RMT called strikes on five train companies to cause maximum disruption to passengers.

MPs' staff tell of bullying and abuse,"This video can not be played MP's assistant says bullying was 'unrelenting' ""I'd worked for years to get a full-time job in Westminster and the bullying began after half an hour."" The experience of one man working for an MP in Parliament is revealed in new research by BBC 5 live. It found 24 members of staff claimed to have been bullied by the MP they work for at Westminster. The claims were made in a response to a questionnaire sent by BBC 5 live to all staff publicly listed as working for MPs in Parliament. Some 1,500 questionnaires, guaranteeing anonymity to respondents, were sent out in November. In total, 166 people responded and their replies, although not representative, give an insight into life for some inside the Houses of Parliament. New code bans ministers from bullying MPs reveal scale of abuse they face One woman said friends had told her she looked like a ""battered wife"" after experiencing bullying while working for MPs. The woman,  in her twenties, told us the first MP she'd worked for had shouted at her, constantly threatened to fire her, made persistent comments about her love life and simulated hitting her. The second MP she worked for made a pass at her. In total, 39 people told us they have experienced bullying while working at Westminster: 24 said they had been bullied by the MP they worked for Seven had been bullied by another MP Eight had been bullied by someone else, a colleague or other person in the House of Commons A member of staff in his twenties, who said he was shouted and sworn at, said bullying by the MP he worked for led him to see a therapist. He told us he didn't report the bullying because he was afraid he would lose his job and didn't know who to report it to. This video can not be played Research by BBC 5 live has found 39 people have experienced bullying at Westminster One woman, also in her twenties, told us bullying by her MP had had ""a serious impact on my self-esteem"". She said she experienced sexual comments, threatening and intimidating behaviour and being shouted and sworn at. ""Items of stationery [were] thrown around the office,"" according to one male employee. ""I was later told that the MP asked my predecessor, 'what would you do if I threw something across the office?' as part of their interview for the role,"" he added. Many of those who contributed to the BBC research said bullying had seriously affected their wellbeing: ""Became very withdrawn and left the job within a week"" (female in her 20s) ""I was in a state of shock. It had a huge impact on my confidence."" (male in his 30s) ""Made me miserable, insecure and stressed."" (female in her 20s) One female employee who said she had been bullied by her boss had sympathy for the MP. ""The atmosphere can be hard but I know my MP is a good person under a lot of pressure. The office lacks capacity."" Many respondents made the point that the way they were treated depended on the individuals involved, and most MPs treated their staff well. One woman said: ""As an office worker I feel safe and respected. I have dealt with worse in other jobs. By comparison this place is excellent."" The research revealed a reluctance to report incidents of bullying. Only a third of people who said they had been bullied reported the behaviour. The most common reasons for not reporting it was belief that ""it wouldn't make any difference"" and ""fear of losing my job"". ""I can't report my boss for bullying meâ¦ if you report you would be sacked or replaced in an instant."" (male in his 20s) ""I felt it would look professionally incompetent and compromise the masculine environment across Westminster. I am a male."" The 5 live research also asked staff employed by members of Parliament whether they had experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment while working at Westminster. Three women in their twenties, and one woman in her fifties told us they had been victims of sexual assault. One claimed she had been assaulted by a former member of Parliament, one by a visitor to an MP and another by an employee of the House of Commons. All four said they had experienced unwanted touching and three had also experienced unwanted groping.  None of the women chose to report the alleged assaults. One woman said she had not reported it because she felt she wouldn't be believed and because she was afraid she would lose her job or it would have a negative effect on her career. The other three said they didn't think it was serious enough. Andrea Leadsom has vowed to improve the workplace culture Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has told The Emma Barnett Show on Radio 5 live that MPs could be sacked if they are found guilty of bullying their staff, under new grievance procedures. Mrs Leadsom, who is leading a cross-party working group into bullying and harassment in parliament, says she hopes the new regime will have ""serious teeth"". And she denied reports that the only new sanction against MPs judged to be guilty of misconduct would be to make an apology. ""If it's a Member of Parliament, then it would be a referral to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and ultimately to the Commons Committee for Standards, which has the ability to suspend Members of Parliament. ""And there is of course then the Recall of MPs Act 2015, that itself does enable a constituency to decide to get rid of their Member of Parliament.  So that would be the ultimate sanction."" In December 2017, Mrs Leadsom told MPs an existing helpline for staff would be expanded and new training and HR support had already been put in place. She says the new grievance procedure will be introduced by the end of January and she hoped it would ""change the culture"" in Parliament. Eighteen women and one man told 5 live they had suffered sexual harassment while working in Parliament. Most of those people reported experiencing sexual comments, jokes or gestures with some having their body stared and leered at. When asked to describe the culture in Parliament comments ranged from ""sexist, laddish, misogynistic"", ""bullying of staff by MPs is rife"" and ""toxic: alcohol and power do not mix well"" to ""terrible. Staff have no rights, they work often in solitude directly to their boss. One cannot overstate the power of MPs and how intimidating that is to young staff"". Others were more positive about the culture describing it as ""courteous"", ""respectful"" and ""fascinating"". One employee said it was ""friendly and amicable. It's not the den of sexual depravity the media want it to be"" and another commented ""all the MPs I've met have been delightful. I have the nicest boss I've ever had. This sexual harassment witch hunt is ridiculous. "" ""My experience has been entirely positive. It's about who you hang around with"" said one male employee. In the past year there have been several well publicised allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault and bullying in the Houses of Parliament. As a result, Prime Minister Theresa May has set up a cross-party committee, headed by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, to look at how the culture at Westminster can be improved. Theresa May has promised action to improve the complaints procedure The staff who responded to the questionnaire were unsure whether a new grievance system would help or not. ""I think it will be very difficult to ensure that all staff feel able to report harassment without fear of repercussions. It will take a long time to change attitudes."" A man in his twenties who had experienced bullying said: ""What punishment can be given to an MP?"" MPs directly employ their own staff, and those employees do not have a human resources department to go to for advice or to raise concerns about mistreatment. At the moment, employees can only complain to the MP they work for, their party or the Parliamentary authorities. Many who responded to our questionnaire were concerned that if they complained to the MP who employs them, they would risk being sacked, or given a bad reference if they left. The Unite union represents some MPs' staff but the union is not officially recognised by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA). The Conservative Party said it took all harassment allegations ""incredibly seriously"". ""If a serious allegation is raised we would immediately advise the individual to contact the police,"" a spokesman said. "" ""We have introduced a new code of conduct that ensures any allegations are investigated in confidence."" And Labour's Cat Smith said bullying of any nature was absolutely unacceptable in any workplace. ""Parliamentary authorities have a duty of care towards the employees on site, as do the political parties and MPs themselves,"" she said. ""Those duties must be carried out and any allegations of bullying investigated."" Clerk of the House of Commons, David Ntazler said he wanted to ensure staff knew where to go for help and advice, whether through the helpline, the face-to-face health and wellbeing service or via HR support,with a guide with contact details provided online.,external New code bans ministers from bullying At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Burger death woman 'checked with waiter'The student collapsed ""very suddenly"" after eating a burger marinated in buttermilk, a court hears.9h9 hours agoManchester","Shahida Shahid discussed the menu with a waiter, the inquest heard A student who died after eating a burger had checked its ingredients with a waiter, an inquest has heard. Shahida Shahid, 18, suffered an allergic reaction from the buttermilk-marinated chicken burger she ate at the Almost Famous restaurant in Manchester. She later collapsed ""very suddenly"", the city's coroners court was told. The jury heard when she was taken ill, she was given an anti-allergy injection by a friend, but it was ""just"" out of date and had no effect. Ms Shahid, from Worsley, Salford, went to the restaurant in the Great Northern Warehouse on Peter Street with four friends on 9 January 2015. The University of Manchester student - who was studying for a masters in maths - had a dairy allergy and discussed the menu with the waiter before her meal, the court heard. Her friend Lauren Davies said she ""went first, because she always asked about what she can have and what she's allergic to"". Miss Davies said the waiter ""went to talk to someone"" and returned with an offer of the dish without the coleslaw and sauce. After the meal, the five friends walked about a mile to the Printworks complex, where Shahida went from ""laughing and joking"" to sitting down outside a bar, feeling unwell, she said. ""I think she was scratching her arms and legs and, at one point, she said she was having an allergic reaction. ""I was trying to keep her calm and she told us to get her EpiPen out of her bag."" Ms Shahid ate at the Great Northern Warehouse branch of the burger chain Almost Famous The inquest heard another friend, who had been shown how to use the injector, jabbed her in the right upper thigh. Security guards Imran Farooqi and Avais Ali, who were working nearby, came to help. They put Ms Shahid into the recovery position and also attempted CPR.

"MPs' staff tell of bullying and abuseSome working for MPs are routinely subjected to bullying and harassment, a BBC 5 live survey reveals.3h3 hours agoUK Politics","This video can not be played MP's assistant says bullying was 'unrelenting' ""I'd worked for years to get a full-time job in Westminster and the bullying began after half an hour."" The experience of one man working for an MP in Parliament is revealed in new research by BBC 5 live. It found 24 members of staff claimed to have been bullied by the MP they work for at Westminster. The claims were made in a response to a questionnaire sent by BBC 5 live to all staff publicly listed as working for MPs in Parliament. Some 1,500 questionnaires, guaranteeing anonymity to respondents, were sent out in November. In total, 166 people responded and their replies, although not representative, give an insight into life for some inside the Houses of Parliament. New code bans ministers from bullying MPs reveal scale of abuse they face One woman said friends had told her she looked like a ""battered wife"" after experiencing bullying while working for MPs. The woman,  in her twenties, told us the first MP she'd worked for had shouted at her, constantly threatened to fire her, made persistent comments about her love life and simulated hitting her. The second MP she worked for made a pass at her. In total, 39 people told us they have experienced bullying while working at Westminster: 24 said they had been bullied by the MP they worked for Seven had been bullied by another MP Eight had been bullied by someone else, a colleague or other person in the House of Commons A member of staff in his twenties, who said he was shouted and sworn at, said bullying by the MP he worked for led him to see a therapist. He told us he didn't report the bullying because he was afraid he would lose his job and didn't know who to report it to. This video can not be played Research by BBC 5 live has found 39 people have experienced bullying at Westminster One woman, also in her twenties, told us bullying by her MP had had ""a serious impact on my self-esteem"". She said she experienced sexual comments, threatening and intimidating behaviour and being shouted and sworn at. ""Items of stationery [were] thrown around the office,"" according to one male employee. ""I was later told that the MP asked my predecessor, 'what would you do if I threw something across the office?' as part of their interview for the role,"" he added. Many of those who contributed to the BBC research said bullying had seriously affected their wellbeing: ""Became very withdrawn and left the job within a week"" (female in her 20s) ""I was in a state of shock. It had a huge impact on my confidence."" (male in his 30s) ""Made me miserable, insecure and stressed."" (female in her 20s) One female employee who said she had been bullied by her boss had sympathy for the MP. ""The atmosphere can be hard but I know my MP is a good person under a lot of pressure. The office lacks capacity."" Many respondents made the point that the way they were treated depended on the individuals involved, and most MPs treated their staff well. One woman said: ""As an office worker I feel safe and respected. I have dealt with worse in other jobs. By comparison this place is excellent."" The research revealed a reluctance to report incidents of bullying. Only a third of people who said they had been bullied reported the behaviour. The most common reasons for not reporting it was belief that ""it wouldn't make any difference"" and ""fear of losing my job"". ""I can't report my boss for bullying meâ¦ if you report you would be sacked or replaced in an instant."" (male in his 20s) ""I felt it would look professionally incompetent and compromise the masculine environment across Westminster. I am a male."" The 5 live research also asked staff employed by members of Parliament whether they had experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment while working at Westminster. Three women in their twenties, and one woman in her fifties told us they had been victims of sexual assault. One claimed she had been assaulted by a former member of Parliament, one by a visitor to an MP and another by an employee of the House of Commons. All four said they had experienced unwanted touching and three had also experienced unwanted groping.  None of the women chose to report the alleged assaults. One woman said she had not reported it because she felt she wouldn't be believed and because she was afraid she would lose her job or it would have a negative effect on her career. The other three said they didn't think it was serious enough. Andrea Leadsom has vowed to improve the workplace culture Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has told The Emma Barnett Show on Radio 5 live that MPs could be sacked if they are found guilty of bullying their staff, under new grievance procedures. Mrs Leadsom, who is leading a cross-party working group into bullying and harassment in parliament, says she hopes the new regime will have ""serious teeth"". And she denied reports that the only new sanction against MPs judged to be guilty of misconduct would be to make an apology. ""If it's a Member of Parliament, then it would be a referral to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and ultimately to the Commons Committee for Standards, which has the ability to suspend Members of Parliament. ""And there is of course then the Recall of MPs Act 2015, that itself does enable a constituency to decide to get rid of their Member of Parliament.  So that would be the ultimate sanction."" In December 2017, Mrs Leadsom told MPs an existing helpline for staff would be expanded and new training and HR support had already been put in place. She says the new grievance procedure will be introduced by the end of January and she hoped it would ""change the culture"" in Parliament. Eighteen women and one man told 5 live they had suffered sexual harassment while working in Parliament. Most of those people reported experiencing sexual comments, jokes or gestures with some having their body stared and leered at. When asked to describe the culture in Parliament comments ranged from ""sexist, laddish, misogynistic"", ""bullying of staff by MPs is rife"" and ""toxic: alcohol and power do not mix well"" to ""terrible. Staff have no rights, they work often in solitude directly to their boss. One cannot overstate the power of MPs and how intimidating that is to young staff"". Others were more positive about the culture describing it as ""courteous"", ""respectful"" and ""fascinating"". One employee said it was ""friendly and amicable. It's not the den of sexual depravity the media want it to be"" and another commented ""all the MPs I've met have been delightful. I have the nicest boss I've ever had. This sexual harassment witch hunt is ridiculous. "" ""My experience has been entirely positive. It's about who you hang around with"" said one male employee. In the past year there have been several well publicised allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault and bullying in the Houses of Parliament. As a result, Prime Minister Theresa May has set up a cross-party committee, headed by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, to look at how the culture at Westminster can be improved. Theresa May has promised action to improve the complaints procedure The staff who responded to the questionnaire were unsure whether a new grievance system would help or not. ""I think it will be very difficult to ensure that all staff feel able to report harassment without fear of repercussions. It will take a long time to change attitudes."" A man in his twenties who had experienced bullying said: ""What punishment can be given to an MP?"" MPs directly employ their own staff, and those employees do not have a human resources department to go to for advice or to raise concerns about mistreatment. At the moment, employees can only complain to the MP they work for, their party or the Parliamentary authorities. Many who responded to our questionnaire were concerned that if they complained to the MP who employs them, they would risk being sacked, or given a bad reference if they left. The Unite union represents some MPs' staff but the union is not officially recognised by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA). The Conservative Party said it took all harassment allegations ""incredibly seriously"". ""If a serious allegation is raised we would immediately advise the individual to contact the police,"" a spokesman said. "" ""We have introduced a new code of conduct that ensures any allegations are investigated in confidence."" And Labour's Cat Smith said bullying of any nature was absolutely unacceptable in any workplace. ""Parliamentary authorities have a duty of care towards the employees on site, as do the political parties and MPs themselves,"" she said. ""Those duties must be carried out and any allegations of bullying investigated."" Clerk of the House of Commons, David Ntazler said he wanted to ensure staff knew where to go for help and advice, whether through the helpline, the face-to-face health and wellbeing service or via HR support,with a guide with contact details provided online.,external New code bans ministers from bullying At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Rail franchise 'not provided value for money',"Govia Thameslink said the challenges it faced had ""sometimes been greater than expected"" Passengers on Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern services have suffered the worst rail disruption in the UK, according to a highly critical report. The National Audit Office (NAO) said the UK's largest rail franchise had not provided value for money. It found the services had been the ""worst on the network"" since Govia Thameslink (GTR) took over the routes. The Department for Transport (DfT) said industrial action had caused a shortage of train crews. It is being blamed for not ensuring adequate staffing before awarding the franchise. Government spending watchdog the NAO said GTR had too few drivers when it was awarded the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise. It added that since GTR started operating the full franchise in July 2015, 7.7% of services - about 146,000 services - had either been cancelled or delayed by more than 30 minutes, compared with 2.8% on the rest of the network. Of these, more than one third were caused by train crew shortages. The RMT union is calling for GTR to be stripped of the franchise, after the ""dynamite report blows wide open the whole scandal"" of the firm's operation. Govia Thameslink started operating the full franchise in July 2015 Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""Over the last three years long-suffering passengers on the Thameslink franchise have experienced the worst performance on the rail network. ""Some of the problems could have been avoided if the Department [for Transport] had taken more care to consider passengers in its design of the franchise."" A NAO spokesman said the DfT ""did not seek sufficient assurance that Govia Thameslink would have enough train drivers when it took on the franchise"". ""Govia Thameslink received fewer drivers than it expected from the previous operator of the Thameslink and Great Northern routes, and driver shortages have persisted on Great Northern services,"" he added. The DfT admitted disruption to passengers was ""unacceptable"", but said services had improved over the last 12 months. A spokesman said: ""The primary cause of delays and cancellations to passengers has been lack of available staff, which is a direct result of strike action."" Speaking on the Today programme Labour's Lilian Greenwood MP, chair of the Transport Committee, accused the DfT of ""passing the buck"", adding: ""Clearly the industrial action has created many of the problems that passengers have faced and it's important that the dispute is resolved. ""But I'm not hearing from the DfT that they are acknowledging their part in this and the things they need to do to improve the situation for passengers, who just a week ago saw their rail fares go up again, without seeing the improvements they were promised. ""Part of the reason they created this difficulty was by creating this mega franchise, by not looking at the implications of trying to introduce new services onto a very congested part of the railway where there was unreliable infrastructure."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling admitted his department had made mistakes Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The prime problem on this network... was the action of trade unions. ""There were mistakes made in my department, mistakes made in Network Rail, mistakes made in the operation of this railway line. I am extremely sorry."" GTR said Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern was one of the UK's largest rail franchises, carrying almost one million passengers a day. Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR, said: ""The report identifies numerous root causes for the challenges it has faced. ""These difficulties have sometimes been greater than expected and we regret the disruption caused to our passengers.""

Deneuve: Men have right to hit on women,"Catherine Deneuve has been in more than 100 films in a career spanning decades French actress Catherine Deneuve has said that men should be ""free to hit on"" women. She is one of 100 French women who wrote an open letter, warning about a new ""puritanism"" sparked by recent sexual harassment scandals. It deplores a wave of ""denunciations"", following rape allegations made against US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. A group of French feminists condemned the letter, accusing the signatories of trivialising sexual violence. Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex, but has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"". Harvey Weinstein scandal: Who has accused him of what? The letter by French women writers, performers and academics was published in France's Le Monde newspaper on Tuesday. ""Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone's knee or try to steal a kiss,"" it said. ""Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack."" Harvey Weinstein has been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the body behind the Oscars The authors argued that there was a new ""puritanism"" afoot in the world. They said that while it was legitimate and necessary to speak out against the abuse of power by some men, the constant denunciations have spiralled out of control. According to the writers, this is creating a public mood in which women are seen as powerless, as perpetual victims. ""As women we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power, takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality."" Deneuve is by far the most prominent of them. The other 99 women who signed the document include some well-known figures, such as actress Christine Boisson; conservative journalist Ãlisabeth LÃ©vy; Brigitte Lahaie, a 1970s porn star who is now a talk-show host; Catherine Millet, a writer and magazine editor. There are also lesser-known names from the worlds of entertainment, the arts, the media, and academia. Most of the signatories, however, are professionals who are not known to the French public. The letter has stirred debate in France. On Wednesday a group of about 30 feminists issued a statement accusing Deneuve and her co-signatories of seeking to ""close the lid"" on the scandals uncovered by the Weinstein case, and of ""pouring scorn"" on victims of sexual violence. On social media, many expressed either anger or sadness at the open letter.One Twitter user (in French) regretted the inability of women to speak with one voice,external, saying they had ""failed to agree"". The backlash against the letter, however, has not been front-page news and is not trending on Twitter in France. The reason may be that controversy over exposing sex pests has been rumbling on for several months now in France. The debate has mostly pitted those belonging to the older generation, who view #Metoo and similar campaigns as a threat to the sexual liberation achieved in the 1960s, against younger, activist types who feel that the battle against harassment is the latest stage in the fight for women's rights. She is not known as an activist star.  However, last year the 74-year-old spoke out against social media campaigns shaming men accused of harassing women. Women and men from all over the globe who have been sexually harassed have been sharing their stories across social media using the hashtag #MeToo. In France, Twitter users are using #Balancetonporc  (""rat on your dirty old man"") to encourage women to name and shame their attackers. How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Ms Deneuve, an Oscar-nominated actress, has been in more than 100 films, making her debut in 1957.

Burger death woman 'checked with waiter',"Shahida Shahid discussed the menu with a waiter, the inquest heard A student who died after eating a burger had checked its ingredients with a waiter, an inquest has heard. Shahida Shahid, 18, suffered an allergic reaction from the buttermilk-marinated chicken burger she ate at the Almost Famous restaurant in Manchester. She later collapsed ""very suddenly"", the city's coroners court was told. The jury heard when she was taken ill, she was given an anti-allergy injection by a friend, but it was ""just"" out of date and had no effect. Ms Shahid, from Worsley, Salford, went to the restaurant in the Great Northern Warehouse on Peter Street with four friends on 9 January 2015. The University of Manchester student - who was studying for a masters in maths - had a dairy allergy and discussed the menu with the waiter before her meal, the court heard. Her friend Lauren Davies said she ""went first, because she always asked about what she can have and what she's allergic to"". Miss Davies said the waiter ""went to talk to someone"" and returned with an offer of the dish without the coleslaw and sauce. After the meal, the five friends walked about a mile to the Printworks complex, where Shahida went from ""laughing and joking"" to sitting down outside a bar, feeling unwell, she said. ""I think she was scratching her arms and legs and, at one point, she said she was having an allergic reaction. ""I was trying to keep her calm and she told us to get her EpiPen out of her bag."" Ms Shahid ate at the Great Northern Warehouse branch of the burger chain Almost Famous The inquest heard another friend, who had been shown how to use the injector, jabbed her in the right upper thigh. Security guards Imran Farooqi and Avais Ali, who were working nearby, came to help. They put Ms Shahid into the recovery position and also attempted CPR. Mr Ali said the 18-year-old told him it could not be an allergic reaction ""because I clearly told the waiter"". He said she then passed out and started frothing from her mouth. The court was told she was not breathing and there was no heart activity when paramedics arrived a short time later. The hearing continues.

Winners and losers from Trump-Bannon feud,"In the world of US politics, 2018 has arrived with fire and fury. Donald Trump has split with former top adviser Steve Bannon. The president's detractors are touting the revelations in Michael Wolff's explosive new book as confirmation of every suspicion they had about the man and his fitness for office. Mr Trump is back on Twitter, lashing out at the media, Democrats and critics everywhere. The White House is in full bunker mode, enforcing a workplace ban on personal mobile phones of staff members with new vigour. The president's lawyer is rattling off cease-and-desist letters like he's being paid by the word. As Americans hunker down on a frigid weekend to read the juiciest parts of Fire and Fury, the dust is settling from this latest political storm. Who are the winners and losers? Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House is already topping online best seller charts During a television interview on Friday morning, the author - a man known in media circles but hardly a household name for most Americans - was basking in the glow of the national spotlight. He quipped that he should send the president a box of chocolates for giving him the kind of publicity money can't buy. Thanks to the frenetic response from the White House when excerpts of his book first started hitting the press earlier this week, Fire and Fury has shot to the top of the Amazon bestseller list. Some have groused that the author largely built his work upon prior reporting by major US media outlets like the Washington Post and the New York Times. Others have questioned the accuracy of details in the book. Trump supporter Sebastian Gorka, in an interview with BBC News, pointed to an author's note in which Wolff acknowledges that his work is based on occasionally conflicting accounts, some of which were ""baldly untrue"". Wolff says he sometimes allowed disagreements to remain in the text so reader could judge, while in other passages he ""settled on a version of events I believe to be true"". Wolff says he has tapes and notes to back up his assertions, although he has yet to indicate whether he will release them. It's clear, however, that the author is the currently the brightest star in the media firmament - and for a man who seems to adore being The Man, that's winning and winning big. Who is author of explosive Trump book? Steve Bannon is now ""Sloppy Steve"" to the president. The former White House chief strategist went from mastermind of Mr Trump's presidential victory and Time Magazine cover boy to ""Sloppy Steve"", as the president has now nicknamed him, in less than a year. It has been quite a reversal of fortune. In early 2017, Bannon boasted about how he was going to oversee nothing less than the""deconstruction of the administrative state""and usher in a new conservative populism, joining working-class Americans with evangelical conservatives to cement an enduring governing majority. After he was forced out of the White House in mid-August, he pledged to launch a movement that would try to unseat incumbent Republican senators he viewed as insufficiently loyal to Mr Trump and his nationalist policies. His first candidate was Roy Moore who, after being mired in allegations of sexual misconduct, became the first Republican senator to lose to a Democrat in deeply conservative Alabama in 25 years. That defeat may have been the beginning of the end for Bannon's influence. If there's one thing Mr Trump won't abide, it's a loser - and the president pointed to the Alabama defeat in his scathing letter repudiating Bannon after the Fire and Fury excerpts hit the press this week. Throw in that Bannon directed sharp, personal insults at Mr Trump and his family - calling daughter Ivanka ""dumb as a brick"" and saying Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner may have committed treason by meeting with Russians during the presidential campaign - and his fate was sealed. According to reports, the White House informed its supporters that they would have to choose between the president and Bannon - and, by and large, they have fallen in line behind Mr Trump. Rebekah Mercer, a deep-pocketed benefactor of Bannon's, issued a statement saying she had terminated her support for his political efforts.Reports are swirling,externalthat Bannon may be forced out from atop conservative media empire Breitbart News. While US politics is full of second and third acts, 64-year-old Bannon - with funding disappearing and influence waning - is approaching a career nadir. If this is a Trump-Bannon war, it has been a rout. A political knifefight with consequences Why is this man smiling? Shortly after the president released his scathing statement in which he asserted that Bannon had ""lost his mind"", Mitch McConnell's campaign Twitter account sent out ashort video clip,externalof the Senate majority leader sitting at his desk, smiling broadly. No words were included. None was needed. The Senate majority leader had very publicly feuded with Bannon since the ousted presidential adviser declared it his 2018 goal to see Mr McConnell stripped of his leadership position and his Senate allies ousted. Now that particularly unpleasant thorn is gone from Mr McConnell's side. Senate Republicans running for election in 2018, many of whom had been nervously eyeing their right flank for potential - or actual - challenges from Bannon-backed insurgents, are breathing a sigh of relief. For Republicans, the 2018 congressional mid-term elections are going to be hard enough to manage in a political environment that appears to be trending toward highly motivated Democratic voters. If Republicans have to spend time and effort fending off primary challenges - or if fringe candidates end up winning primaries then flaming out, like Mr Moore, under the general election pressure - a bad year for their party could become much, much worse. For Mr McConnell and his fellow party faithful, that possibility just got less likely. Smiles are more than warranted. This video can not be played President Trump faces questions about his relationship with former top aide Steve Bannon This could have been, perhaps even should have been, a very good week for Mr Trump. The New Year marks the start of his reformed tax system, passed after considerable effort last month. The Dow Jones stock market index broke 25,000 for the first time in history, and unemployment numbers - while not quite as impressive as originally predicted - are still at healthy lows. A string of big corporations have announced at least temporary boosts to employee salaries, crediting the tax reform law. Doom-and-gloom predictions of economic disaster during the Trump presidency have been proven unfounded. If Americans tend to vote on economic concerns, this should be encouraging news for the incumbent party. Instead, the president has been beset by internal divisions. One of his closest allies not only gave credence to a Russia investigation Mr Trump had labelled a ""witch hunt"", he directly implicated the president's closest family members. Fire and Fury paints a portrait of a president wholly unprepared for high office, a man treated by his senior staff as a child, unable to focus on anything but ""immediate gratification"". It makes claims that Mr Trump may be suffering from diminished mental capacity, prone to repeating himself and sometimes unable to recognise even close friends. Debate over the president's mental health It doesn't matter if the allegations are fully substantiated by on-the-ground reporting or not, they will ring true for Trump's critics and feed the perception that he is temperamentally ill-suited for his job. Politics isn't beanbag, as the saying goes, and it certainly isn't always fair. At the very least, this has been a terrible distraction for a White House and a Congress facing some tight legislative deadlines in the weeks ahead. Every day spent on damage control is a day where Republicans are unable to advance their policy priorities on budgeting, immigration, health insurance, infrastructure spending and a host of other issues. This video can not be played Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his 'worst enemies' If Mr Trump was the big winner in 2016, right on his heels was the formerly obscure right-wing website Breitbart News, which became the voice of the nationalist Trump movement. Bannon, their once and future publisher, had a prominent position in the White House and their influence was at an all-time high. Now, however, the media empire is caught in a particularly unpleasant pincer. Their leader is out of favour with the president, and reporters and editors covering the feud have had to walk a fine line between the two parties. It comes as a time when they have been challenged to explain some of the president's departures from economic populist orthodoxy (a tax cut for corporations isn't exactly a working-class rallying cry, after all). The website had gone all-in on Roy Moore in December, sending reporters to investigate and potentially debunk claims made by women alleging misdeeds by the Republican candidate. Like Bannon, they shared in Mr Moore's stinging defeat. Breitbart may recover, but its upward trajectory has been blunted, at least for now. Fox & Friends has become a staple of Donald Trump's morning television viewing If Breitbart is the upstart challenging to become the voice of conservative media, Fox News is the reigning king - and any expansion by the former came at the expense of the latter. And if Breitbart stumbles due to internal discord, Rupert Murdoch's news empire stands to benefit. Speaking of Mr Murdoch, he plays an interesting role in Fire and Fury. Before his latest project, Wolff penned an at-times contentious biography of the media mogul. In numerous passages of Fire and Fury, Mr Trump looks to Mr Murdoch with deference and respect despite run-ins over Fox's coverage of him during the primary campaign. The feeling, according to Wolff, is not always mutual, however, as Murdoch once reportedly remarked that the president is a ""f***ing idiot"". All this aside, Fox News has positioned itself as the president's closest media ally, and the president - a loyal viewer of numerous Fox shows - reciprocates the love, often citing the network's programmes and personalities in his daily tweets. Whether or not Bannon is forced out from Breitbart, he will likely be forever linked to the website in the president's mind. And, given recent events, that's not a good thing.

Ecuador seeks mediator in Assange standoff,"Mr Assange in May 2017, speaking after the original investigation against him was dropped Ecuador says it is considering inviting a third-party mediator to tackle its long-standing disagreement with Britain over the fate of Julian Assange. The foreign minister said the situation was ""unsustainable"". The Wikileaks founder has been confined to the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012, claiming political asylum. He was originally wanted on sexual assault allegations in Sweden, which have since been dropped, but says he now fears extradition to the US. ""We're considering and exploring the possibility of a mediation,"" Ecuador's foreign minister, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, said on Tuesday, adding that they could involve a ""third country or personality"". ""A person cannot live in those conditions for ever,"" she said. Mr Assange, an Australian citizen, made headlines in 2010 when his organisation leaked US military helicopter footage, which showed the killing of civilians in Iraq. London's Metropolitan Police says he will still be arrested if he leaves the embassy building, on the charge of failing to surrender to the court back in 2012 - and the UK refuses to guarantee he will not be extradited to the US. Ms Espinosa said: ""No solution will be achieved without international cooperation and the cooperation of the United Kingdom, which has also shown interest in seeking a way out."" Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange case In 2016, a United Nations panel ruled that Mr Assange was being ""arbitrarily detained"" and should be allowed to walk free. It said he should also be compensated for his ""deprivation of liberty"". The UK Foreign Office, however, rejected the ruling. Mr Assange's legal team have maintained his confinement to the embassy amounts to illegal detention. Responding to Ms Espinosa's comments, a UK Government spokesman said: ""The Government of Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice."" The sexual assault allegations against Mr Assange were dropped in May 2017. At the time, Ecuador said the UK should guarantee him ""safe passage"" to Ecuador if he leaves the embassy.

Meghan Markle closes social media accounts,"This video can not be played Meghan Markle watches as Prince Harry is taught how to fist bump Meghan Markle has closed down her Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts, Kensington Palace confirmed. Prince Harry's fiancee took the decision because the accounts ""haven't been used for some time"". Ms Markle also ran her own lifestyle website, The Tig, which sheclosed in April 2017. The palace said the former actress and UN ambassador was grateful to everyone who had followed her over the years. The move came after the couple made their first official visit in London. In December 2017, Ms Markle had 1.9 million people following her posts on Instagram, and more than 350,000 Twitter followers. Her Facebook page had almost 800,000 likes. Ms Markle explained the closure of her lifestyle website, The Tig, in a post in April 2017 Earlier on Tuesday, Harry and Meghan were greeted by crowds of well-wishers at community radio station Reprezent, in Brixton, which trains youngsters in media skills. Ms Markle went to the engagement in a Marks & Spencer sweatshirt, Burberry trousers and a Smythe coat. Meghan and Harry: 'A real representation of British society' Who is Meghan Markle? Royal engagement photos released A DJ at the station, Jeremiah Asiamah, described the pair as a ""power couple"", and added ""they became family in the space of five minutes"".

The founder of Reprezent FM, Shane Carey, welcomed the visit saying: ""We're having the spotlight shone on us from all the world's media."" During the visit Ms Markle picked out male presenter YV Shells, for his work in promoting women on the station.

Harry and Ms Markle also visited Pop Brixton, a community project housing local start-ups and restaurants. The couple met one of the station's presenters, Gloria Beyi, 17, and her producer Finn Whitehead, 27. Gloria said there was shock that such a high-profile couple had visited their radio station: ""I think a lot of people thought those two worlds would never collide.""

Japan astronaut sorry for 9cm growth error,"Astronaut Norishige Kanai (L) left Earth for the ISS last month on a six-month mission A Japanese astronaut has apologised for wrongly stating he has grown 9cm (3.5in) since arriving at the International Space Station (ISS) just over three weeks ago. Norishige Kanai said in fact he grew by 2cm, blaming ""a measurement mistake"". ""I'm very sorry for tweeting out such fake news,""he tweeted in Japanese.,external His original incorrect claim sparked global fascination among social media users. Astronauts grow an average of between 2-5cm in space. What happens to your body in space? This is because of the absence of gravity which allows the vertebrae in their spines to spread apart. Mr Kanai originally tweeted (in Japanese):,external""Good morning, everybody. I have a major announcement today. We had our bodies measured after reaching space, and wow, wow, wow, I had actually grown by as much as 9cm! ""I grew like some plant in just three weeks. Nothing like this since high school. I'm a bit worried whether I'll fit in the Soyuz seat when I go back."" But later on, he tweeted that his Russian commander on the ISS, Anton Shkaplerov, was sceptical, ""soI quickly measured myself and was roughly 182 cm.,external2 cm plus my height on earth"". ""So it was a measurement mistake (?), but it seems many people are talking about it. ""I have no back pains, and actually the pain around my neck and shoulders is gone, so I doubt I'm 9 cm taller. Flight Commander Shkaplerov would know these things, he's such a veteran."" What happens to your body in space? Mr Kanai said he was a ""bit relieved"", adding: ""I'll probably fit into the Soyuz when I go home."" The Soyuz spacecraft which takes the astronauts from and to Earth has a limit on seating height.

May hails 'fresh talent' after reshuffle,"Several new appointments were made to the government whips' office Theresa May has said her reshuffle makes the government look ""more like the country it serves"" with a ""new generation"" of ministers brought in. The PM has appointed several new faces to her ministerial team. The mostly junior ministerial appointments come after Monday's cabinet-level changes. These triggered the resignation of education secretary Justine Greening and were branded a ""lacklustre PR exercise"" by Labour. Of Tuesday's appointments, six men and eight women were new additions to government, including five from ethnic minorities and 11 who were elected in 2015. Six of the women - all elected in 2015 - have been appointed as junior whips, who will be involved with enforcing party discipline. A diverse team? Who's who guide to cabinet Sam Gyimah is new universities minister Top five questions for education new boy Damian Hinds Downing Street said that following the reshuffle there were more women attending cabinet, more female ministers and more members of the government from ethnic minorities. The number of women who are full cabinet members has remained the same as before at six. But the number of other senior female ministers also attending cabinet has risen from two to four, taking the total number of women around the table to 10. By the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Day two arguably went better for the prime minister than day one. She is able to claim, as planned, to have upped the numbers of women in government and new ministers from ethnic minorities. The talk in Downing Street is of a new ""talent pipeline"", the jargon for bringing on a new generation to be ready whenever big jobs available next time round. But there is a lot of muttering among MPs about the overall logic of the reshuffle. Some individual decisions seem puzzling - moving Rory Stewart from International Development, in which he is regarded as a proper expert - to the prisons brief for instance. Making the up-and-coming Brexiteer lawyer, Dominic Raab, the new Housing Minister, stirring controversy by promoting Esther McVey to secretary of state in a department she already controversially served in, DWP, where she was near the top of the Labour hit list. There is real anger too among some members of the government at how Justine Greening was treated on Monday night, compared to her male colleagues. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May said it would allow ""a new generation of gifted ministers to step up and make life better for people across the whole UK"". The latest changes include Jo Johnson being moved from his universities role to transport, and Suella Fernandes becoming a minister in the Department for Exiting the EU. Mr Johnson had been in the firing line over the appointment of columnist Toby Young to the board of the government's universities regulator. The brother of former London mayor Boris Johnson, he will also be the minister for London in his new role. Among the other ministerial moves announced on Tuesday: Mr Johnson was replaced by Sam Gyimah as universities minister Mark Garnier lost his job as trade minister - a source said his departure was not related to recent allegations of improper conduct John Hayes (transport), Philip Dunne (health) and Robert Goodwill (education) also left their posts Alok Sharma moved from housing to employment Dominic Raab replaced Mr Sharma as housing minister Rory Stewart replaced Mr Raab as justice minister Margot James, Harriet Baldwin and Caroline Dinenage become ministers of state at Culture, the Foreign Office and Health respectively John Glen and Robert Jenrick join the Treasury The most high-profile cabinet ministers all kept their jobs in the reshuffle, in which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is believed to have persuaded the PM to keep him in post with a beefed-up role rather than move him to another department. The reshuffled cabinet met for the first time on Tuesday Rory Stewart move to justice surprised some commentators Sam Gyimah is the new universities minister Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, new Conservative deputy chairman James Cleverly said he was not worried about the hostile newspaper headlines generated by the reshuffle. ""Today and yesterday were about reshuffles and that always causes lots of froth and drama in the media,"" he said. ""Today's headlines are what they are - tomorrow and onwards we will be getting the really important stuff which is about what we are doing, what we are delivering in government."" Esther McVey has been made work and pensions secretary In some of the key cabinet appointments on Monday: Ms Greening was replaced as education secretary by Damian Hinds Esther McVey was promoted to work and pensions secretary Justice Secretary David Lidington was moved to the Cabinet Office, and will deputise for Mrs May at Prime Minister's Questions David Gauke replaced Mr Lidington as justice secretary Matt Hancock is culture secretary and Karen Bradley is the new Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis was made the Conservative Party chairman Two departments were renamed - housing was added to the title of the communities department while the title of Mr Hunt's health brief now includes social care. Justine Greening resigned after being offered the job of work and pensions secretary Alan Milburn, the former Labour minister who was until recently the government's social mobility tsar, said Ms Greening's departure was ""a loss as far as social mobility is concerned"", saying she had been ""actually getting on and doing something"".

Jetpack pilot admits fear of heights,"Mr Mayman is promoting a forthcoming jetpack at the CES tech show A former commercial pilot who has carried out about 500 jetpack test flights has admitted that he does not like heights. ""I can look out of the window of an aeroplane no problem,"" David Mayman, chief executive of Jetpack Aviation, told the BBC. ""But even being in the office when I look out of the window I feel the hairs stand up on the back of my neck."" He added that his secret to being able to fly was: ""I try not to look down."" Jetpack Aviation is at the CES tech show in Las Vegas to show off a prototype of its latest jetpack model, the JB-11. It can fly as high as 15,000ft (4,572m) for up to 12 minutes. Its top speed is 200mph (321 km/h) and the maximum distance it can travel in a single journey is about 20 miles. It can carry a person weighing up to 120kg (265lb). Mr Mayman jetted over Port of Long Beach, California for this photo in November 2016 The machine is powered by six turbo jet engines and carries 25 litres (5.4 gallons) of fuel. The controls are a mixture of manual and computer control, Mr Mayman said. Tilting the joystick-like handles down changes the vector of the thrust, pushing the device backwards. ""I think it's as close as you get to that dream of the magic carpet, just being able to float gently above the ground."" The prototype is capable of short trips but not long distance travel Mr Mayman said most of his firm's clients are military, including the US Special Forces, but that one day the jetpack could also be a useful tool for the emergency services. More from CES:,external Kodak soars on KodakCoin and Bitcoin plans Hybrid watch hides screen behind hands When will AI deliver for humans? Hands-on with HTC's untethered VR headset He added that he personally became involved with the business almost by accident. ""I became a jetpack pilot [because] I couldn't convince anyone to fly the thing when we first started developing it 10 years ago,"" he recalled. ""So, I ended up being chief executive and crash test dummy. ""When I'm in the jetpack I look at the horizon and I try not to look down past my feet. ""I get butterflies in my tummy and the blood rushes from my brain."" He added that his own experience suggested that jetpacks would not become a common mode of transport, at least in their current form. ""In the future what everybody will fly with is something you would sit on,"" he said. ""Something more comfortable than this.""

"Trump on 2020: 'Yeah, I'll beat Oprah'","This video can not be played Trump: 'I can beat Oprah' President Donald Trump says it would be ""fun"" to run against former chat show doyenne Oprah Winfrey, amid calls for her to launch a White House bid. ""Yeah, I'll beat Oprah,"" Mr Trump told reporters during a meeting to discuss immigration reform with US senators. His daughter Ivanka Trump joined a wave of praise for the media mogul's speech at Sunday's Golden Globe awards. A Winfrey confidante says the actress is ""intrigued"" by the possibility of declaring a 2020 presidential campaign. Her impassioned speechabout the importance of tackling inequality drew plaudits from coast to coast. Mr Trump said during his meeting on Tuesday that campaigning against Ms Winfrey would be ""a lot of fun"". He added: ""I did one of her last shows. Her last week. She had Donald Trump and my family."" 10 moments that made Oprah Winfrey Does Oprah speech provide clues about presidential run? ""I like Oprah but I don't think she's going to run. I don't think she's going to run. I knew her very well,"" he added. Two decades ago on CNN, Mr Trump said that if he was to ever run for president, he would choose Ms Winfrey as his running mate. ""Oprah. I love Oprah. Oprah would always be my first choice,"" he told interviewer Larry King in 1999. ""If she'd do it, she'd be fantastic. I mean, she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman."" In 2015 - less than one week after announcing his candidacy - Mr Trump again suggested that Ms Winfrey would be his top pick for vice-president. ""I think Oprah would be great. I'd love to have Oprah,"" he said, adding ""I think we'd win easily, actually."" Winfrey confidante Gayle King said earlier on Tuesday that the media mogul was not currently running for president. ""I do think she's intrigued by the idea, I do think that,"" Ms King told the CBS This Morning programme. ""I also know that after years of watching The Oprah (Winfrey) Show you always have the right to change your mind. I don't think at this point she's actually considering it."" The US first daughter, meanwhile, drew online brickbats on Monday after she tweeted her support for Ms Winfrey. Critics said Ms Trump's support for the president was incompatible with her endorsement of Ms Winfrey's Time's Up campaign. Mr Trump has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and assault, all of which he has denied. Ivanka Trump, who describes herself as an adviser to the president on ""job creation, economic empowerment, workforce development & entrepreneurship"", has made women's issues one of her key policy areas since joining the White House. Ivanka Trump: Who is America's first daughter? In November, she told a Tokyo summit that sexual harassment of women should ""never be tolerated"". Like Oprah Winfrey, Ms Trump has been subject of rumours about her potential presidential ambitions. A book about the Trump administration - Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House - alleges Ms Trump and her husband Jared Kushner struck a deal that she might run for president in the future. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington She's a staffer in a conservative White House who sometimes embraces more moderate policies. She's married to a man with an administrative portfolio of remarkable breadth. She embraces feminist principles but works for a president who once boasted of making unwanted sexual advances. She's also the boss' daughter. Ivanka Trump has to walk a fine line in everything she does, as the national spotlight falls squarely on her for the foregoing reasons and more. Needless to say, her tweet about an Oprah Winfrey speech -  viewed not just as an emphatic condemnation of a sexual harassment culture and a presidential trial balloon, but also as a thinly veiled rebuke of Mr Trump's presidency - turned heads. Ms Trump gave a well-received address at the Republican National Convention that sounded moderate - even a bit Democratic - but her agenda has fallen flat since inauguration. Recommendations on climate change and immigration have been disregarded, and her childcare proposal has languished. Maybe that's why, if Fire and Fury's Michael Wolff is correct, Ms Trump harbours her own presidential ambitions. While she roams the halls of power now, she has left no mark on the nation. When she does draw attention, it's for the wrong reasons. Trump: 'I'll beat Oprah' Video, 00:00:23Trump: 'I'll beat Oprah' Is Oprah Winfrey running for president?

"Boy, 16, charged with shop worker murder","Police want to identify and speak to the two boys captured on CCTV over the death of Vijay Patel CCTV images have been issued by police of two youths sought over the killing of a shop worker in north London. Vijay Patel, 49, died on Monday from injuries he suffered in an attack outside a convenience store in Mill Hill two days earlier. Det Insp Ian Lott said it was ""vitally important"" the two youths were traced. A 16-year-old boy from Brent appeared at Willesden Magistrates' Court on Wednesday charged with Mr Patel's murder. Detectives said Mr Patel was ""attacked"" outside the shop on Saturday after three teenagers were refused items including cigarette papers. Victim Vijay Patel with his wife Vibha Three boys were seen ""running along The Broadway in the direction of Mill Hill Broadway Tube Station"" shortly after the alleged attack, the Metropolitan Police said.

"Virgin Trains halts Daily Mail salesVirgin says the move comes after employee feedback, but a Daily Mail spokesman called it ""disgraceful"".8h8 hours agoBusiness","Sir Richard Branson is the founder of Virgin Virgin Trains has announced that it has stopped selling the Daily Mail newspaper on its West Coast trains. A spokesperson for Virgin said it regularly reviewed products sold on its trains, adding that ""after listening to feedback from our people"" it decided to stop stocking copies of the paper. A Daily Mail spokesman called the decision ""disgraceful"". Last year, stationery chainPaperchase apologised for a promotional giveaway in the Mailfollowing criticism. The Virgin spokesperson added that when it stocked the paper, which it stopped carrying in November, it only sold one copy for every four trains. The spokesperson told the BBC that the paper had never been stocked on its East Coast trains under the management of Virgin/Stagecoach. And Drew McMillan, head of colleague communication and engagement at Virgin, told staff in an internal memo: ""Thousands of people choose to read the Daily Mail every day. But they will no longer be reading it courtesy of VT. ""There's been considerable concern raised by colleagues about the Mail's editorial position on issues such as immigration, LGBT rights and unemployment. ""We've decided that this paper is not compatible with the VT brand and our beliefs. ""We will continue to offer The Times to customers, but we won't be stocking the Daily Mail for sale or as a giveaway. ""This won't suit all of our customers or all of our people - it's certain to draw some criticism. But we've listened to many colleagues over the last few months, and we feel that this is the right move to take."" Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""We are heading in a worrying direction.""

Kuenssberg: Who really gained?,"Day two arguably went better for the prime minister than day one. She is able to claim, as planned, to have upped the numbers of women in government and new ministers from ethnic minorities. The talk in Downing Street is of a new ""talent pipeline"", the jargon for bringing on a new generation to be ready whenever big jobs available next time round. There has been inevitable concern in some quarters that white, male ministers were moved out to make space irrespective of their performance. For Number 10 that is a temporary hit worth taking to achieve what the prime minister wants, over time, to develop the next generation in the Tory party and to make the government look more representative of the country. But there is a lot of muttering among MPs about the overall logic of the reshuffle. Some individual decisions seem puzzling - moving Rory Stewart from International Development, in which he is regarded as a proper expert - to the prisons brief for instance. May hails 'fresh talent' after reshuffle Greening quits cabinet in PM's reshuffle Making the up-and-coming Brexiteer lawyer, Dominic Raab, the new Housing Minister, stirring controversy by promoting Esther McVey to secretary of state in a department she already controversially served in, DWP,  where she was near the top of the Labour hit list. There is real anger too among some members of the government at how Justine Greening was treated on Monday night, compared to her male colleagues. One frustrated minister told me, ""Odd that the only minister to have stood their ground who was in the end sacrificed rather than permitted to stay was Greening, funny that"". Yes reshuffles do often go wrong. But what is most notable about this one, and beyond the above, what is causing dismay on the Tory benches is Theresa May's inability to make all the cabinet moves that she wanted to. One MP joked that the government now looked like ""Fawlty Towers - the building is still there but it's chaos and barely functioning"". A senior MP told me the reshuffle ""it is a not so funny joke"". And while a reshuffle that didn't move the biggest names in government may well not have much impact on the public, the bungled moves have certainly been noticed in Westminster, and with Brexit negotiations getting back up and running, will of course be noticed in Brussels too. One former minister, not one of Theresa May's usual detractors, was brutal in their verdict tonight saying: ""If she cannot competently reshuffle her Cabinet, how can she competently renegotiate with the EU?â¦The Cabinet is as divided tonight on the EU as it was before the reshuffle. Who is the biggest winner? Monsieur Barnier, who sees a divided government led by a weak PM. What more could he ask for?"" A strongly negative lens on what's happened in the last couple of days, perhaps, but the misfires of the last couple of days cannot be said to have enhanced the PM's authority. Reshuffles are always a risk, and the fallout this time appears a hindrance to the government rather than a help.

Bannon backtracks on treason remark,"Steve Bannon created a rift with his former boss, the president, with remarks to author Michael Wolff Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former chief strategist, has tried to reverse remarks in which he called the president's son Donald Jr ""treasonous"". The accusation appears in Michael Wolff's new book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. He was referring to a meeting in June 2016 between Mr Trump's son and a group of Russians. But on Sunday Mr Bannon said the barb was directed at former aide Paul Manafort, who was also present. The Senate, House of Representatives and a special counsel are all investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election, allegations denied by both the Kremlin and Donald Trump. In a statement first reported by news site Axios, Steve Bannon called Donald Jr ""both a patriot and a good man"". ""My comments were aimed at Paul Manafort, a seasoned campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the Russians operate,"" he said. ""He should have known they are duplicitous, cunning and not our friends. To reiterate, those comments were not aimed at Don Jr."" The debate over Trump's mental health Trump's fear of poisoning and other extraordinary claims Winners and losers from Bannon feud The original remark, published in Mr Wolff's book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, and not disputed by Mr Bannon, appeared to take aim at all three Trump campaign officials in the room, including Donald Jr. It read: ""The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers. ""Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s***, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately."" This video can not be played President Trump: ""I consider it [the book] a work of fiction"" Mr Bannon's attempt to clarify follows repeated denunciations by Mr Trump, who dubbed him ""Sloppy Steve"" and said his former aide ""cried when he got fired"". It also follows the loss of the main financial backer of his conservative Breitbart website, heiress Rebekah Mercer, who said in a rare public statement that she had cut off Mr Bannon from funding following his remarks to Mr Wolff. Mr Bannon went on in his statement to say he regretted waiting five days to say something, and called Mr Wolff's reporting ""inaccurate"". Fire and Fury rocketed to the top of the Amazon bestseller list upon publication last week and became the talk of Washington DC and beyond. Based on first-hand reporting at the White House and, according to the author, more than 200 interviews with top administration figures and others, it portrays the president as impatient, unable to focus and with no interest in reading or attempting to understand policy. It also raised doubts over his mental fitness for office, quoting senior officials who allegedly called the president ""mentally unfit"", and ""idiot"", and ""like a child"". Mr Trump responded by tweeting that he was a ""very stable genius"" who was ""like, very smart"". Who is author Michael Wolff? More revelations from the book Senior Trump administration officials rallied around the president over the weekend, attempting to mitigate the fallout from the book. CIA chief Mike Pompeo told Fox News Sunday the portrayal was ""pure fantasy"". He said: ""The president is engaged, he understands the complexity, he asks really difficult questions of our team at the CIA."" Policy adviser Stephen Miller told CNN Mr Trump was a ""political genius"" and branded Mr Wolff ""a garbage author of a garbage book"". The controversy has sent the book to the top of bestseller lists Defending himself on NBC, the author said he had no anti-Trump agenda when he began the project. ""I would have been delighted to have written a contrarian account here,"" he said. ""'Donald Trump, this unexpected president, is actually going to succeed.' Okay, that's not the story. He is not going to succeed. This is worse than everybody thought.""

Donald Trump's ex-chief strategist,"Donald Trump appointed Mr Bannon as his campaign CEO in August 2016 and, following his victory, handed him a key White House role Steve Bannon was the driving force behind the right-wing Breitbart News website, and later became a key Donald Trump adviser before launching a podcast devoted to obliterating Democrats and Republicans who fail to fall in with the Maga - Make America Great Again - agenda. He was one of Mr Trump's closest confidants during the 2016 presidential campaign and in the White House the following year, His influence was so great that a Time magazine headline asked: ""Is Steve Bannon the Second Most Powerful Man in the World?"" But although he lasted just months in his Trump administration job and has been beset by legal problems, he remains a very influential figure on the hard right of the Republican party. His refusal to testify in front of a Congressional committee investigating the Capitol riot resulted in a conviction on two charges of contempt of Congress in 2022. Having failed in his appeals, he now faces a potential four-month jail sentence, just as his former boss heads into another presidential election campaign. Born in Virginia in 1953, Bannon spent four years in the US Navy before completing an MBA at Harvard. He went into investment banking and after a spell with Goldman Sachs moved into media financing, helping to get the comedy show Seinfeld, among others, off the ground. He shifted into film production, working in Hollywood before branching out into independent political documentary-making, paying homage to former president Ronald Reagan, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and the Tea Party movement. Through this work he met Andrew Breitbart, a staunchly conservative media entrepreneur who wanted to create a site that challenged what he saw as liberal-dominated mainstream media. When Breitbart died of a heart attack in 2012, Bannon took over as head of Breitbart News and drove it forward. One of Breitbart's many controversial headlines The site positioned itself as a bellicose, conspiracy-tinged outlet for right-wing Americans disillusioned with mainstream politicians. During the 2016 election campaign, the site was ardent in its support of Donald Trump. At the same time, Democrats and civil rights groups were accusing Bannon and his media outlet of allying themselves with white nationalists. Breitbart writers, while growing in influence in mainstream Republican circles, also at times maintained links to fringe far-right figures and spread conspiracy theories. Bannon himself hopped directly into the political fray in August 2016 when Mr Trump appointed him as his campaign CEO. Following his victory, Mr Trump handed Mr Bannon a key role as chief White House strategist. But Bannon left his post in August 2017 after months of reported power struggles with Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, as well as other high-level Trump advisers. Mr Trump had also reportedly grown weary of press leaks and of Bannon taking credit for his election victory. Bannon headed back to Breitbart, vowing to wage war on the president's opponents. Although they remained ideologically aligned, the two men occasionally clashed. Bannon criticised some of Mr Trump's decisions, including calling the firing of FBI director James Comey the worst mistake in ""modern political history"". And Bannon was quoted in a book as describing a meeting between Mr Trump's son and a group of Russians - an encounter that featured prominently in Mr Trump's impeachment trial - as ""treasonous"". The former president hit back. ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,"" he said at the time. Bannon swiftly recanted, but the damage was done. One of Breitbart News's major financial backers, Rebekah Mercer, cut him loose and days later he stepped down. In January 2018, Mr Trump took to Twitter to cheer the decision with a new moniker for his old ally. ""The Mercer Family recently dumped the leaker known as Sloppy Steve Bannon. Smart!"" he wrote. But both men remained committed to the Maga cause - and couldn't quite quit each other. But by August 2019 Mr Trump was describing Bannon as ""one of my best pupils"" and ""still a giant Trump fan"". Mr Bannon, pictured at President Trump's inauguration in 2017 While spending time trying to build links with other right-wing nationalist movements in Europe and around the world, Bannon, now 70, also found himself increasingly facing legal trouble. In 2020, he was indicted on charges of money laundering, fraud and conspiracy, accused of cheating donors to a private fundraiser designed to help build a wall on the US-Mexico border - one of Mr Trump's key policy goals. Prosecutors in New York alleged that he had lied to donors to the ""We Build the Wall"" project and diverted some of the money to two of his associates. He was spared federal charges by a Trump pardon, but still faces an indictment in New York state over the case. Bannon's podcast - started in 2019 and titled War Room - became a key Maga media outlet, and one that spread Mr Trump's false theories of voter fraud prior to the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. He was said to have been an unofficial adviser to Mr Trump at the time, which earned him the Congressional subpoena which he resisted. In July 2022 he was found guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress and was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $6,500 (Â£5,200). He was allowed to remain free pending appeal, which was rejected by a federal court Friday. And while he could end up in jail at a crucial political period, he has continued to pump out War Room episodes - several each day - boosting the pro-Trump Maga hard right.

"Coach abused boy 'more than 100 times'Boys dreaming of a life in professional football were abused by coach Barry Bennell, a jury is told.3h3 hours agoUK","Former football coach Barry Bennell was a ""predatory and determined paedophile"" who abused one boy on more than 100 occasions, a court has heard. The ex-Crewe Alexandra coach ""had pretty much unfettered access"" to boys dreaming of a life in the professional game, prosecutors alleged. Mr Bennell, 63, now known as Richard Jones, denies 48 sex offence charges involving 11 boys. Liverpool Crown Court was told offences took place between 1979 and 1991. Prosecutors told the jury the evidence they would hear concerned allegations made against Mr Bennell by boys from England and Wales, and the United States, and that Mr Bennell had served prison sentences in both jurisdictions. Nicholas Johnson QC, prosecuting, told the jury Mr Bennell had worked as a youth football coach in Cheshire, Manchester and Derbyshire. He said some of the abuse took place at the ground of Crewe Alexandra and during tours by the football club, but many incidents occurred at the defendant's home addresses. Mr Johnson said one alleged victim, who says he was abused more than 100 times, met Mr Bennell when he was a scout for Manchester City. The complainant would stay at Mr Bennell's house with other youngsters. ""Not only was there the promise of high quality football, but they were given lots of sports kit and allowed to eat takeaway food,"" Mr Johnson told the jury. The court also heard how Mr Bennell would ""play fight"" with the boys and play a game with them called Follow Me, where they would copy his actions while he would increase degrees of intimacy to gauge how compliant the boys would be to abuse. The complainant said Mr Bennell would turn the lights off and play music to mask the sounds of the abuse, the jury heard. Mr Bennell denied sexual contact with the boy when questioned by police. Barry Bennell worked as a coach for Crewe Alexandra, and a scout for Manchester City Mr Johnson said another complainant said he had been ""desensitised"" by Mr Bennell, who committed ""relentless"" serious sexual assaults against him. That complainant had described the last time he was abused - after he met Mr Bennell to discuss signing forms for Manchester City - as the ""worst day of his life"" . A further complainant described Mr Bennell's home as a ""paradise"" for young boys as he had a pool table, fruit machine and big TVs. Mr Johnson told the court that several of the alleged victims had said they were impressed with the pets he kept it his home - at various times he had a wild cat and a monkey. The prosecutor said that while Mr Bennell ""was a skilled and relatively successful coach, we allege that he had a much darker side"". ""He was also, we say, a predatory and determined paedophile. His particular predilection was pre-pubescent boys."" Mr Johnson told the jury they would need to decide whether they were listening to a group of men, who as Mr Bennell argues, had jumped on the bandwagon and made up stories, or to a series of serious sexual offences by a ""devious paedophile"" against ""very vulnerable lads"". Mr Bennell is on trial for 35 counts of indecent assault, 11 serious sexual assaults and two counts of attempted sexual assault, on boys aged between eight and 14. He appeared via video-link on Tuesday. The jury was told this was due to an illness that required him to be fed through a tube. The court was told how during questioning, Mr Bennell told police he was suffering with cancer which in turn had caused memory problems. Mr Bennell had said one complainant had financial motivations for accusing him, the jury heard. Before the trial, Mr Bennell admitted seven charges of indecent assault committed between 1981 and 1991, relating to three boys aged between 11 and 14. The trial continues.

Global growth back at pre-crisis levels,"The World Bank says global economic growth is likely to speed up this year, after a stronger than expected 2017. The bank's new forecast is that the world economy will expand by 3.1% this year before slowing slightly. It will be the first time since the financial crisis that growth is operating at its full potential. However, the report warns the upswing will be short term, with gains in improving living standards and reducing poverty levels at risk long term. For the immediate future, the bank sees a reasonably upbeat prospect. The bank's president Jim Yong Kim said: ""The broad-based recovery in global growth is encouraging"". The forecast is better than what the bank was expecting in its previous assessment last June. Among the large economies, the up-rating is especially marked for the eurozone, though the bank still thinks it will slow somewhat this year, but by less than its previous forecast. Emerging and developing economies will grow slightly faster than last year in this forecast. However, the bank is worried about the longer term. The issue is whether the world economy will have the capacity to maintain decent growth beyond the current upturn. Its potential is growing more slowly than it used to, the bank says. That's the result of years of lacklustre improvements in productivity - the amount each worker can produce - weak investment and an ageing workforce. This slowdown in longer term prospects is widespread, the bank says. It affects countries that account for about two thirds of global economic activity. The fact that in the bank's view the economy is close to operating at full capacity means that there's little scope to stimulate further growth with the standard policy tools that work by boosting demand for goods and services - interest rate or tax cuts or increased government spending. China's economy is expected to continue slowing It says government should promote reforms to improve education and health services and infrastructure - such as roads ports, electricity supplies and telecommunications networks. A healthier and better educated workforce is likely to be more productive, and better infrastructure makes it easier for business to be more productive too. The weaker growth of the capacity of the economy is an increasingly persistent theme in the analysis of official economic agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund There are some marked variations in the forecasts between different regions.  Africa and India are seen as likely to pick up a bit of speed this year. China's slowdown, which began at the start of the decade, is predicted to continue, though with expected growth of 6.4% it's still strong.

A force spokesman said the man had not been formally identified but his family had been informed and was being supported. Forensic officers have been searching the address since the discovery Det Insp Dan Clegg said: ""The investigation is still in its early stages and many questions still need answers. ""We will continue our work at the scene and hope in the coming days we can piece together the exact circumstances surrounding the man's death. ""I would like to thank the community for their support and we will do all that we can to find out what happened."" The cordon on this quiet suburban street has now been extended a second time. After the grim discovery of human remains on Tuesday, the road was shut and the cordon now extends to 200ft as police continue to search the crime scene. Forensic teams have worked through the night with much of the work focusing on the rear end of the garden. Workmen at the property next door have been told they cannot work today as the search continues. Door-to-door inquiries have been made in Matlock Road, where residents have been asked if they knew Mr Coombes. The questionnaire suggests he would have been in his late 80s in 2005 and electoral records appear to confirm he lived at the address. One neighbour said the discovery was ""shocking and strange"" Yvonne Harrison, who lives a few doors away from the crime scene, spoke of her ""horror"" at the discovery. ""It's really shocking and very strange,"" she said. Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ""You never expect anything like this on your doorstep. ""All the neighbours are shocked and everyone is talking about it, but no-one seems to know much about that family."" Neighbour Stella Ashton added: ""We just saw the forensic teams and assumed there had been a break-in. ""Police came yesterday. Just asked if I had heard anything, any whispers. ""I didn't hear anything other than she lived with her parents, many years ago her mum died and shortly afterwards her dad wasn't seen again."" One neighbour said the discovery was ""shocking and strange"" She added: ""This morning I had to come out with my two children because they get the private school bus at the end of this road. ""It was a bit daunting this morning when it was dark and police would only escort them one by one through, they wouldn't let the children walk through on their own.""

Greening successor's challenges,"The review of tuition fees will be waiting in the in-tray Damian Hinds has become the new Education Secretary, replacing Justine Greening. What are the questions waiting at the top of his in-tray? And what should he do differently to avoid the sudden exit of his predecessor? 1) How to get back the political initiative? Damian Hinds will have to re-energise the Conservatives' vision for education, finding something positive that will connect with the public. From the perspective of 10 Downing Street, it must have seemed as though Labour was making much of the weather over schools and universities. Parents were worried about being asked to bail out cash-starved schools. And Jeremy Corbyn's promise to scrap tuition fees had seen Labour's student vote reaching record levels. Justine Greening seemed unenthusiastic about the prime minister's Tory heartlands view of education, characterised by the push for more grammar schools. Damian Hinds will have to tackle questions of funding for schools But, it is suggested, there was impatience in Downing Street about the lack of any clear alternative vision or policy offer for parents. There is a catch for Mr Hinds. His revival has to cost nothing and not take up legislative time consumed by Brexit. 2) Can anyone end the pain of tuition fees? Theresa May has promised a major review of university funding and how much students should be expected to pay - as evidence that she was ""listening"" after the election. Jo Johnson, the outgoing Universities Minister, had made no secret of his reluctance for any significant changes. But his departure opens the way for a much more far-reaching review. The issue of funding universities has caused pain to successive governments The rising levels of fees, interest charges and student debt, have been like a recurrent political toothache, and Mr Hinds will be looking for an affordable way to neutralise the electoral pain. It's been the mouse-trap hidden in the in-tray for ministers of successive governments. And he will have to see whether university bosses can really be more restrained over pay, after the chastening battles over ""fat cat"" salaries. 3) What will head teachers be demanding? School funding gaps and teacher shortages are among the issues that heads see as most urgent. They are exasperated that they have to keep juggling and struggling on with what they claim are inadequate budgets. Heads will tell ministers to focus on the basics of funding and staffing In the election it became a significant doorstep issue, not least because head teachers discovered the power of sending a letter home to millions of parents. When it comes to plausibility, head teachers' warnings of cuts to children's lessons will always win out over politicians protesting that funding is at record levels. It's a challenge that the new education secretary will have to resolve. Otherwise he risks cold water being poured over any other initiatives, as heads tell ministers to get back to the basics of funding and staffing. 4) What does social mobility actually mean? Damian Hinds and Justine Greening have something in common. They both say social mobility is a priority, as has the prime minister. But what does it really mean? The government's own social mobility commissioners walked out claiming so far it had been all talk and no progress. Mr Hinds has previously highlighted the importance of investing in the early years, before the social divide begins to widen. Jo Johnson's departure as Universities Minister could open the way for a bigger review of tuition fees He has also pointed to the central importance of high-quality teachers to making sure that the disadvantaged get the best chances in school. It might seem an age ago, but before the election the focus of social mobility was on the need to help ""ordinary working families"", working hard on low incomes and without access to good schools. Mr Hinds will have to decide how to make social mobility something more than rhetoric and good intentions. 5) How to balance tradition with reform? As a former grammar school boy from the north-west of England, with a Hampshire constituency, Mr Hinds will be seen as representing a less metropolitan view of education. Justine Greening left Downing Street and the government on Monday night He will be seen as closer to the views of Tory backbenchers, uncertain about the wholesale ditching of grammar schools. Mr Hinds will also be expected to push through a change to free school regulations, promised in the Conservative manifesto, which would make it easier for faith groups to set up new schools. This would allow religious free schools to give priority in admissions in the same way as existing local authority and academy faith schools. Such a change, likely to increase the number of faith schools, will be opposed by humanists and secular campaigners. But that could be the kind of opposition and clear blue water that would be relished by an education secretary wanting to assert his traditionalist credentials. Ministers have always been advised to pick their enemies as carefully as their friends - and Mr Hinds will also have noted that Ms Greening's bridge-building with the teachers' unions did her no political favours. And someone somewhere is going to write a headline about the benefit of ""Hinds-sight"".

Kodak soars on crypto-currency plans,"Kodak is to rent out Bitcoin mining rigs to the public Shares in photo firm Eastman Kodak soared nearly 120% after it revealed plans to mint its own crypto-currency, the KodakCoin. The US firm said it was teaming up with London-based Wenn Media Group to carry out the initial coin offering (ICO). It is partof a blockchain-based initiative,externalto help photographers control their image rights. Kodak also detailed plans to install rows of Bitcoin mining rigs at its headquarters in Rochester, New York. Details of this second scheme - which is being branded the Kodak KashMiner - were outlined at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Customers will pay up-front to rent mining capacity. Kodak is the latest in a series of companies to see its value jump after revealing plans for blockchain-related activity. ""This is a phenomenon we saw back during the dot com days in the late 1990s where traditional companies would mention some kind of internet strategy and their stock price would jump up,"" commented Garrick Hileman from the University of Cambridge. ""When you see stock prices moving like this it does appear to be troubling - it's hard to say if there's a bubble but it certainly is indicative of a frothy investment market."" Kodak developed a digital camera in 1975, but decided not to commercialise the technology at the time, and its hesitation to leave behind its film heritage is thought by some to have contributed to it filing for bankruptcy protection years later in 2012. Kodak now embraces digital photography but was initially wary of the format Since that collapse, Kodak has licensed its brand to a variety of manufacturers, with the mark appearing on batteries, printers, drones, tablet computers and digital cameras. The KashMiner operation will be run by Spotlite, a licensee that had previously teamed up with Kodak to use its brand to market LED lights. More from CES:,external Samsung launches giant modular TV Disobedient robot derails LG's event Hands-on with HTC's untethered VR headset Short story dispenser spits out tales Mining involves carrying out processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions. Any Bitcoins generated by Kodak KashMiner will be shared between the customer and the business. Each of the mining rig boxes - which include computer processors and fans to keep them cool - will use about the same amount of electricity as running a hairdryer around the clock. But the scheme will be able to take advantage of Kodak's on-site power generating plant, which has had spare capacity since Kodak's heyday. Kodak's Bitcoin mining operation will be based at its Rochester headquarters The company says it can power each rig for four cents per kilowatt hour, which is significantly cheaper than running a rig at home. At Bitcoin's current value, an up-front investment of $4,000 (Â£2,954) for 24 months of mining could earn a profit of $500 a month, Spotlite's Halston Mikail told the BBC. But anybody hoping to join the gamble would have to wait, as capacity is already sold out, Mr Mikail added. ""At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand,"" he said. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and some analysts fear its value could crash, resulting in a loss for those who had paid up-front for mining capacity. But Mr Mikail said the rigs could be put to work on other tasks if Bitcoin faltered. ""Bitcoin could be a bubble. But the blockchain industry is not a bubble,"" he said. ""It's a solid platform built on mathematics and it will survive."" Kodak's other initiative, the KodakCoin, is being created as part of an effort to build a global ledger of picture rights ownership that photographers can add their work to. Associated KodakOne software will be used to crawl the web and find pictures that have been used without permission. The company said it would then ""manage the licensing process,"" so the photographer can be paid, in KodakCoin. ""Kodak has always sought to democratise photography and make licensing fair to artists,"" said Kodak chief executive Jeff Clarke. ""These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that."" The company's shares traded more than 130% above their opening price after the announcement before closing the day 119.4% higher. But one expert had doubts. ""Storing the information in a blockchain doesn't protect your copyright any more than copyright law already does,"" commented David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain. ""Notice how they're marketing it: they state a problem, then say the blockchain can solve it. But there's no mechanism by which the blockchain could do that. ""This doesn't do anything that signing up for Shutterstock or Getty Images wouldn't."" Even so, some think Kodak will not be the last household name to associate itself with an ICO. ""I expect we are going to see more major brands releasing their own tokens and currencies to support various products and services,"" commented Mr Hileman.

Waist-deep California mudslides kill five,"This video can not be played Californian mudslides: '""Like a World War One battlefield,""â said Santa Barbara's county sheriff At least 13 people are dead amid ""waist-deep"" mudslides in Southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding, say officials. Some 163 people have been taken to hospital. Twenty had ""storm-related injuries"" and four were critically hurt. A group of up to 300 people are reportedly trapped in Romero Canyon, east of Santa Barbara. Police said the scene ""looked like a World War One battlefield"". Boulders the size of cars rolled down hills and slammed into roadways The flooding and mudslides, affecting areas scorched by wildfires last month, have shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal road. Emergency services said a number of people were unaccounted for and they expected the number of deaths to rise. Thousands fled the deluge and more than 50 rescues have been performed. The hardest-hit homes were those that were not in the evacuation zone, officials say. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Heavy rain run-off caused a mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked off their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason. Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, reports BBC News Los Angeles correspondent James Cook. Among those taken to safety was a 14-year-old girl who had been trapped for hours in the ruins of her home.

Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed, including the major Highway 101. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. A search dog looks for victims in damaged homes after a mudslide in Montecito The Federal Emergency Management Agency shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk.

"Coach abused boy 'more than 100 times'Boys dreaming of a life in professional football were abused by coach Barry Bennell, a jury is told.1h41 minutes agoUK","Former football coach Barry Bennell was a ""predatory and determined paedophile"" who abused one boy on more than 100 occasions, a court has heard. The ex-Crewe Alexandra coach ""had pretty much unfettered access"" to boys dreaming of a life in the professional game, prosecutors alleged. Mr Bennell, 63, now known as Richard Jones, denies 48 sex offence charges involving 11 boys. Liverpool Crown Court was told offences took place between 1979 and 1991. Prosecutors told the jury the evidence they would hear concerned allegations made against Mr Bennell by boys from England and Wales, and the United States, and that Mr Bennell had served prison sentences in both jurisdictions. Nicholas Johnson QC, prosecuting, told the jury Mr Bennell had worked as a youth football coach in Cheshire, Manchester and Derbyshire. He said some of the abuse took place at the ground of Crewe Alexandra and during tours by the football club, but many incidents occurred at the defendant's home addresses. Mr Johnson said one alleged victim, who says he was abused more than 100 times, met Mr Bennell when he was a scout for Manchester City. The complainant would stay at Mr Bennell's house with other youngsters. ""Not only was there the promise of high quality football, but they were given lots of sports kit and allowed to eat takeaway food,"" Mr Johnson told the jury. The court also heard how Mr Bennell would ""play fight"" with the boys and play a game with them called Follow Me, where they would copy his actions while he would increase degrees of intimacy to gauge how compliant the boys would be to abuse. The complainant said Mr Bennell would turn the lights off and play music to mask the sounds of the abuse, the jury heard. Mr Bennell denied sexual contact with the boy when questioned by police. Barry Bennell worked as a coach for Crewe Alexandra, and a scout for Manchester City Mr Johnson said another complainant said he had been ""desensitised"" by Mr Bennell, who committed ""relentless"" serious sexual assaults against him. That complainant had described the last time he was abused - after he met Mr Bennell to discuss signing forms for Manchester City - as the ""worst day of his life"" . A further complainant described Mr Bennell's home as a ""paradise"" for young boys as he had a pool table, fruit machine and big TVs. Mr Johnson told the court that several of the alleged victims had said they were impressed with the pets he kept it his home - at various times he had a wild cat and a monkey. The prosecutor said that while Mr Bennell ""was a skilled and relatively successful coach, we allege that he had a much darker side"". ""He was also, we say, a predatory and determined paedophile. His particular predilection was pre-pubescent boys."" Mr Johnson told the jury they would need to decide whether they were listening to a group of men, who as Mr Bennell argues, had jumped on the bandwagon and made up stories, or to a series of serious sexual offences by a ""devious paedophile"" against ""very vulnerable lads"". Mr Bennell is on trial for 35 counts of indecent assault, 11 serious sexual assaults and two counts of attempted sexual assault, on boys aged between eight and 14. He appeared via video-link on Tuesday. The jury was told this was due to an illness that required him to be fed through a tube. The court was told how during questioning, Mr Bennell told police he was suffering with cancer which in turn had caused memory problems. Mr Bennell had said one complainant had financial motivations for accusing him, the jury heard. Before the trial, Mr Bennell admitted seven charges of indecent assault committed between 1981 and 1991, relating to three boys aged between 11 and 14. The trial continues.

"Thousands stranded in Swiss ski resortsHeavy snow across the Alps cut off towns and villages in France, Italy and Switzerland.1han hour agoEurope","This video can not be played Heavy snow and high winds caused headaches for ski resorts Thousands of tourists have been left stranded after heavy snow in the Alps cut off towns and villages across Switzerland, France and Italy. In the Swiss resort of Zermatt, more than 13,000 tourists are trapped and some visitors who wanted to leave were airlifted by helicopter. Skiing is not possible as slopes are closed because of the risk of avalanches. More than a metre (39in) of snow fell in parts on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a metre more is forecast. The avalanche risk is set at the rarely used maximum on a five-point scale. This is the highest it has been for almost 10 years. British skier missing in French Alps After extremely heavy snow, Zermatt can only be reached by air Community workers are clearing paths through snowdrifts several feet thick An avalanche lies across the train track out of Zermatt - one of the main reasons why road and rail are closed An avalanche hit a five-storey building in Sestrieres, in the Italian Alps, late on Monday, but the 29 people staying in the building escaped without injury, fleeing through the garage. French forecasters have described the snowfall as the kind that are only seen ""once in every 30 years"", with up to 1.8m (6ft) of snow falling in 36 hours in parts of the Savoie area. A British skier - John Bromell, 39, from Willingham by Stow near Lincoln - went missing on Sunday at the Tignes ski resort in France Alps. Bad weather prevented a search on Monday, however French police have told the BBC that a helicopter search for Mr Bromell will begin this afternoon. Despite the fact that they are stranded, the tourists in Zermatt are reported to be in good spirits and the tourist office describes the atmosphere as ""relaxed and comfortable"". Some have described it as ""romantic"", BBC correspondent Imogen Foulkes reports. Although there were some helicopter airlifts, these have now stopped, Zermatt authorities tweeted. In the Simplon region of Valais, where Zermatt is located, two metres (6.6ft) of snow fell in a 24-hour period, the Swiss ATS news agency said. The first downhill training run for the men's World Cup in Wengen in the Bern canton was cancelled on Tuesday. Organisers said snow and high winds had caused significant damage to infrastructure on the course. Fresh snow cuts off Alpine ski resorts How hot is it where you are?

Breaking|Breaking newsSteve Bannon quits Breitbart NewsEx-Trump strategist Steve Bannon stepping down from Breitbart News amid furore over remarks about president's son.5m5 minutes agoUS & Canada,"Bannon left his White House job amid reports of a power struggle Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's ex-chief strategist, has stepped down from the right-wing Breitbart News organisation where he built his reputation. The move comes amid a furore over remarks he reportedly made about President Donald Trump's son. He described a meeting Donald Trump Jr held in New York with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign as ""treasonous"". He was one of Mr Trump's most trusted - and controversial - aides. But he left his post last summer after reports of a power struggle among Mr Trump's White House staff. Bannon attempts to reverse treason remark Winners and losers from Trump-Bannon feud Who was Donald Trump's chief strategist? His subsequent attempt to take on the Republican establishment suffered a severe blow when Roy Moore, the Senate candidate he championed in a special election in Alabama, lost to a Democrat - the first time that party has won in the state in decades. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Steve Bannon's fall from power is now complete. He was first stripped of his top White House job. Now he has been cashiered from his position atop a media empire he helped create. As he surveys the rubble, he has no-one to blame but himself. In both instances, his decision to speak his mind publicly was his undoing. He criticised administration policies and, in an even greater transgression, took aim at Donald Trump's own family in sharply personal terms. When the White House made it clear last week it was time to pick sides between Mr Trump and Mr Bannon, the choice for most conservatives was clear. Now Mr Bannon's hopes of funding insurgent candidates against incumbent Republican senators in 2018, and boosting their candidacies through his media megaphone, have been dashed. What's more, he has to watch as the president he helped elect on an economic nationalist platform negotiates comprehensive immigration reform, touts a sweeping corporate tax cut recently signed into law and plans a visit to the globalist summit at Davos, Switzerland. This was not the revolution Mr Bannon, just a year ago, may have envisioned. Mr Trump has recently taken to referring to Mr Bannon as ""Sloppy Steve"", a derogatory reference to his former aide's famously dishevelled appearance. And Rebekah Mercer, a wealthy benefactor of Mr Bannon, said at the weekend she had ended her support for his political efforts. Last Sunday Mr Bannon insisted that his ""treason"" comments - quoted in an inside account of the Trump White House, Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury - were not directed at Mr Trump's son but at another former aide, Paul Manafort, who was also present at the meeting in Trump Tower. The Senate, House of Representatives and a special counsel are all investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election, allegations denied by both the Kremlin and Mr Trump. Mr Bannon had served as executive chairman of Breitbart since 2012. Breitbart published a statement,externalsaying it and Mr Bannon would ""work together on a smooth and orderly transition"". It quoted Mr Bannon as saying: ""I'm proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform."" Breitbart CEO Larry Solov was quoted as saying: ""Steve is a valued part of our legacy, and we will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish.""

Boulders the size of cars rolled down hills and slammed into roadways The flooding and mudslides, affecting areas scorched by wildfires last month, have shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal road. Emergency services said a number of people were unaccounted for and they expected the number of deaths to rise. Thousands fled the deluge and more than 50 rescues have been performed. The hardest-hit homes were those that were not in the evacuation zone, officials say. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed, including the major Highway 101. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement.
