Senior Tory 'could accept Brexit delay',"Senior Conservative backbencher Sir Graham Brady has told the BBC that he could accept a delay to Brexit - as long as a deal was already agreed. He said a short delay to the 29 March exit date would be acceptable if needed to get legislation through Parliament. The government says its position has not changed on the date but Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has suggested ""extra time"" may be needed. MPs rejected a bid to postpone Brexit if no deal was reached by 26 February. That amendment, from the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, would have delayed the 29 March departure date by several months, but it was voted down by 321 to 298 on Tuesday. Laura Kuenssberg: Time for transactional politics? EU rejects calls to reopen Brexit deal Brexit: What could happen next? How ready is UK government for a no-deal Brexit? Brexit: All you need to know But Sir Graham, chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, toldNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, the Cooper amendment ""would have been deeply counter-productive because it moves off the decision point"". Putting off the decision would only lead to more uncertainty, he said. ""I would only countenance a delay if we already had a deal agreed, it's just a matter of doing the necessary work to implement it,"" said Sir Graham. ""Once we've reached an agreement and we know the terms on which we're leaving, if we decide that we need another two weeks in order to finish the necessary legislation through Parliament, I don't think anybody's going to be too worked up about that, because we will have made a decision."" Please upgrade your browser The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 on 29 March, however MPs have overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal deal that the government had negotiated with the EU. On Tuesday they voted for the prime minister to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the controversial Irish ""backstop"" proposal, which is opposed by many Conservative MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party. The backstop is an ""insurance"" policy to stop the return of checks on goods and people along the Northern Ireland border, if no deal is reached in time. It would effectively keep the UK inside the EU's customs union, but with Northern Ireland also conforming to some rules of the single market. Its critics say a different status for Northern Ireland could threaten the existence of the UK and fear that the backstop could become permanent. But the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday the backstop was ""part and parcel"" of the withdrawal deal and would not be renegotiated. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Hunt said ""extra time"" may be needed to finalise legislation for Brexit and a possible delay in the UK's departure from the EU depended on the progress made in the coming weeks. And BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there had been ""growing chatter"" about a potential delay and a potential extension to Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU. But the prime minister's official spokesman said the government remained committed to leaving the EU on 29 March. A guide to Labour's Brexit tribes Brexit: A really simple guide Parliament had been due to rise for recess on Thursday, 14 February and return on Monday, 25 February but that has now been cancelled. ""The fact that recess won't be taking place shows you that we are taking all available steps to make sure that 29 March is our exit date,"" the spokesman said. ""The prime minister's position of this is unchanged - we will be leaving on the 29th."" Downing Street was also discussing the possibility of Parliament sitting for extra hours in the run up to Brexit, the spokesman said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of running down the clock on Brexit. He said: ""It is possible that there will have to be an extension in order to get an agreement because we cannot leave the EU on March 29 without an agreement. ""Crashing out would mean problems of transport, problems of medicine supply, problems of supply to the food processing industry that does just in time deliveries - and that simply is not acceptable. ""This government has had two-and-a-half years to negotiate and has failed to do so."" Meanwhile, Labour MP John Mann has said a group of 10 MPs from his party met the prime minister two weeks ago to ask for ""a significant amount of money"" for poorer areas, ""so that we can actually move forward as we leave the EU"". When asked abouta Times article that said Mrs May was preparing to entice Labour MPs,externalto vote for her deal with money for constituencies, Mr Mann told the BBC he had voted for the deal already, ""so I can't be bribed"". ""There's no expectation, this isn't transactional politics. We're asking for money for areas that have not had their fair share in the past,"" he said. Labour MP John Mann was among those meeting the prime minister Several Conservative MPs have been spotted going to meetings in Downing Street, including former Brexit minister Steve Baker, Iain Duncan Smith, Mrs May's close ally Damian Green and Nicky Morgan. Ms Morgan, a former education secretary, said she was there to discuss a plan known as the ""Malthouse Compromise"". Engineered by both Leavers and Remainers, the proposal includes extending the transition period for a year and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. Union officials have also been meeting with government officials in the Cabinet Office to discuss Mrs May's Brexit plan. But a Trades Union Congress spokesman said the prime minister's deal came ""nowhere close"" to offering the safeguards desired for working people.

CCTV footage shows acid attack on boy,"This video can not be played The attack was caught on CCTV inside the Home Bargains store CCTV footage of the moment a three-year-old boy had acid thrown over him in a shop has been shown to a jury. The boy suffered serious burns when he was splashed with acid at the Home Bargains store in Worcester on 21 July 2018, a court has heard. Jurors were told the attack happened in a matter of seconds while the boy was looking at toy footballs.

Ibuprofen scientist 'cured own hangover',"Dr Stewart Adams was honoured for his research which led to the discovery of ibuprofen in the 1960s The man who discovered painkiller ibuprofen worked when he cured his own hangover has died aged 95. Dr Stewart Adams was involved in 10 years of trials of the drug and endured a seven-year wait for it to be approved as a prescription. He had joined the research department at Boots after studying pharmacy at the University of Nottingham. In 2015,Dr Adams told the BBC taking the drug for the first time gave him a clear head to deliver a speech. His son Chris, who lives in Nottingham, confirmed his father had died on Wednesday. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Dr Stewart Adams, Dr John Nicholson and Mr R Cobb studying degrees of inflammation using a colour intensity measuring device at Boots Professor Kevin Shakesheff, from the University of Nottingham, said Dr Adams's career and contribution to patients was ""inspiring"". ""He is remembered for his successes in creating one of the most important painkillers in world but, as with many inspirational people, he had to bounce back from failures in earlier clinical trials before he and his team created ibuprofen,"" he said. ""His life is a reminder to everyone in Nottingham that we can change the world through the work we do in our local companies, hospitals and universities."" Dr Adams, who was born in 1923 in Byfield, Northamptonshire, left school aged 16 and started an apprenticeship in a retail pharmacy run by Boots. This led to a degree in pharmacy at the University of Nottingham followed by a PhD in pharmacology at Leeds University, before he returned to the research department at Boots Pure Drug Company Ltd in 1952.

Amazon sparks fears with sales forecast,"Amazon has forecast lower-than-expected sales for the first three months of the year sparking investor fears over slowing growth. Shares in the online giant fell almost 5% in after-hours trading despite it reporting record sales and profit for the Christmas holiday period. Amazon expects sales to grow between 10% and 18% in the first quarter, slightly below analyst forecasts. A hit from currency exchange rates was partly to blame, the firm said. How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Amazon's market value tops $1tn In the three months to the end of the year, which included the crucial Christmas period, profit rose 63% to $3bn (Â£2.2bn) while revenue was up 20% to $72.4bn. While this was better than analysts had expected, it was still the slowest sales growth for the firm since the start of 2015. The deceleration comes as the firm encounters challenges abroad, withchanging regulations in markets such as India. It also faces increased competition at home, as rival retailers such as Target and Walmart invest heavily in online operations. Neil Saunders, analyst at research firm GlobalData, said competitors' gains had hurt the growth of Amazon's retail division. ""In our view, the gap between Amazon and the rest is now narrowing,"" he said. ""Amazon will now need to work doubly hard to achieve any future sales gains."" Nonetheless, he said that compared to many other retailers, the firm's retail sales figures were still strong. In North America, sales increased 18% year-on-year, while its international sales climbed 15%. Mr Saunders said the firm's profits were also ""impressive"". Amazon's widening profits are largely driven by the growth of its high-margin businesses, including its cloud, advertising and third-party seller services. Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services provided two thirds of the firm's profit last quarter. It is one of the services the firm is relying on to help offset slowing revenue growth in its retail arm. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos, who is also the world's richest man, singled out its smart speaker Alexa, saying it was the company's best-selling device. Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the online retailer was ""tightening its grip"" on its customers with add-on services such as Amazon Prime which offer free delivery and other benefits. ""With so many opportunities, the biggest problem facing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is where to focus the attention,"" he added. Mr Hyett said that while he would have preferred sales guidance to be in line with expectations, ""given the rate of growth Amazon's delivering it could be more than made up by a slight outperformance in future quarters"". ""There's no evidence of a systemic slowdown as yet.""

One woman in the statewas caught speeding at 115mph (185km/h),externalon a snowy road with a 35mph (56km/h) speed limit. At least two people were critically injured in a 27-car pile-up on icy roads in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. Twenty-one vehicles, including a lorry, were involved in a pile-up in Buffalo, New York, during a snowstorm on Wednesday. Officials have not released details on any injuries,WKBW News reported,external. It is reported that the lorry should not have been on the road at the time, due to a weather-related ban. A sole individual walks down State Street in Madison, Wisconsin In Minnesota, prison visits were cancelled over the cold,according to the New York Times,external. The Illinois city became a frozen ghost town after temperatures fell to -30C (-22F), colder than parts of Antarctica. A Good Samaritan paid for 70 homeless Chicagoans to stay in a hotel as temperatures dropped. Salvation Army spokeswoman Jacqueline Rachevtold the Washington Post,external: ""It's a deadly situation for anyone. We're thrilled that someone was in a position to be able to do this."" Most of the thousands of cancelled flights this week were coming out of Chicago's airports - O'Hare International is ranked as one of the top 10 busiest airports in the world. Amtrak also cancelled all trains into Chicago on Wednesday, affecting 55 trains, and said most would be cancelled on Thursday as well. As the Midwestern city is one of the company's hubs, train services nationwide could be impacted. The chill was even too much for Chicago's Disney on Ice show, which cancelled its Wednesday performance. More than 600 local schools have shut, keeping 360,000 students at home. Most of Canada was under some sort of weather warning - from extreme cold in the Prairies, Quebec and Ontario to heavy snows in Alberta and Nova Scotia. In Toronto, where winters tend to be milder compared to cities such as Montreal and Ottawa, temperatures had plummeted to -18C (0F). Icy roads and several transit delays made for a hellish commute for the city's residents. Environment Canada issued extreme cold warnings for most parts of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba, urging residents to limit their exposure to cold and keep pets indoors. Advocates expressed concern for homeless people living in cities hit by the extreme temperatures. In Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, temperatures were -40C (-40F), with wind chill factors making it feel like -50C (-58F). ""If you don't get it in December, you will get it in January or February or March. What do you expect? It's 'Winterpeg',"" Caroline Rodriguez told CBC. In Calgary, Alberta, temperatures were a relatively balmy -3C (27F), but were expected to plummet overnight and through the weekend. In parts of rural northern Alberta, 15in of snow were expected to fall. Big freeze frenzy. Video, 00:01:32Big freeze frenzy Fire melts ice on Chicago train tracks.

'Unfair' dentist fines investigated,"The public spending watchdog is to investigate whether hundreds of thousands of people going to the dentist have been unfairly fined. The National Audit Office is holding an inquiry into NHS penalty charges in England - applied to people alleged to be wrongly claiming free treatment. The BBC had revealed manyvulnerable people were being fined Â£100. The British Dental Association (BDA) has warned that this is scaring poor families from going to the dentist. The dentists' organisation says almost 430,000 penalty fines were issued last year - which they say is often ""simply for ticking the wrong box on claim forms"". Many of the people facing fines, the dentists say, are ""on very low incomes, the elderly, and those with learning difficulties"". The BDA says that when these fines for wrongfully claiming free treatment are challenged, about nine in 10 are overturned. Dentists say fines deterring poor patients Go to the dentists and get fined Â£100 Your stories: 10 fines at the dentists... that weren't fine But dentists are worried that many people are so worried about the risk of being fined that they do not get dental treatment. Dentist Charlotte Waite says too many vulnerable people are being unfairly fined The BBC highlighted the concerns of manyfamilies who found that elderly relatives, or people with dementia or learning difficulties, were getting fined,even though they were entitled to free treatment. The growing scale of the problem has emerged - and also the impact on poorer patients. According to the BDA, the number of dental visits from those entitled to free treatment has fallen by almost a quarter in the past four years. Compared with five years ago, there has been a tenfold increase in the number of fines. The National Audit Office is to examine how the NHS penalty charge system is being operated - how many are issued, entitlement to exemptions and the revenue generated from fines. The watchdog, expected to report during the spring, will examine what the NHS Business Services Authority, the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England, are doing ""to improve the efficiency of the system"". Charlotte Waite, the BDA's chair of the community dental services committee, welcomed the investigation - and said a simple error in an application form should not mean a Â£100 fine. ""The government's approach to penalty charges has hit hundreds of thousands of vulnerable patients, and encouraged millions more to miss out on care. ""Yes, we need a system to protect taxpayers' money, but that does not mean constructing a hostile environment for patients, many of whom have complex needs,"" said Ms Waite. The Department of Health and Social Care has argued that everyone should have free NHS dental treatment if they are eligible. But it has said that it is right for it to seek to recover money from anyone who wrongly claims free services.

Rape chat students have bans reduced,"This video can not be played A woman discussed in a group chat by Warwick university students says she's terrified two of them will be back Two students banned from the University of Warwick for 10 years for their involvement in a group chat that threatened rape will be allowed to return later this year, it has emerged. One woman who was targeted said she felt ""terrified at the prospect of having these boys in my seminars"". Several of those in the chat encouraged others to rape specific students. The university said it had reduced the length of their bans to one year after they appealed. In a letter, seen by the BBC, a university official apologised to the women for not informing them of the appeal's outcome sooner - citing ""my delayed summer break"". 'My disgust at Uni rape chat decision' One of the two women who received the letter, in October last year, said she was talking about it now because she wanted to highlight what she describes as ""horrendous"" treatment by the university. The Facebook group chat was first reported last summer by Warwick student newspaperThe Boar,external. One of the messages said: ""Sometimes it's fun to just go wild and rape 100 girls."" While another said: ""Rape the whole flat to teach them all [a] lesson."" Another post included a racially offensive term and anti-Semitic language. At one point, a user wrote: ""Rape her in the street while everybody watches,"" with another responding it ""wouldn't even be unfair"". Student newspapers obtained the screenshots after complaints were made to the university After a disciplinary investigation by the university, five students were suspended. Two were banned for 10 years - and have now had that reduced to one year, two were excluded for one year, and one was given a lifetime campus ban. This means four out of the five of the men initially suspended will rejoin classes in September 2019. In an open letter to the university, one of the female students targeted in the chat said: ""We were discussed so violently. ""We were humiliated, as if for sport. These boys were my friends - like my brothers. And they destroyed me. ""You expect us to return from semesters abroad and study alongside these men? ""It is a source of shame for past, present and future Warwick alumni that you lack the courage to stand by us."" Prof Christine Ennew, a member of the executive team at Warwick University,said in a statement,externalthat the university was clear the behaviour was ""abhorrent and unacceptable"" and it was sorry the decision had ""upset so many members of our own community and beyond"". Privacy issues meant they were unable to comment on specific details, she said, but the appeals panel had decided ""the punishments imposed should be comparable across all of those individuals sanctioned"". She added the penalties were intended to allow the complainants time to complete their studies before the disciplined students were given the opportunity to return. The sanctions also came with ""future behavioural restrictions"" and conditions designed to ""enable them to learn from their past unacceptable behaviours"". Liam Jackson, the president of Warwick Students' Union, said the union would continue to push for a review of the university disciplinary procedure. Students from the university have taken to Twitter to voice their anger at the university's decision using the hashtag #ShameOnYouWarwick.

Syria found liable for US reporter's death,"Marie Colvin lost the sight in her left eye when covering the civil war in Sri Lanka in 2001 A US court has found Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government liable for the death of American war correspondent Marie Colvin in February 2012. Colvin, 56, died in the besieged city of Homs, Syria, alongside French photographer Remi Ochlik, 28, when the building they were in was shelled. US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said it was an ""extrajudicial killing"". She also ordered Damascus to pay $302.5m (Â£231m) in damages for an ""unconscionable crime"". It is the first time Mr Assad's government is held to account for a war crime and sets a legal precedent, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington reports. The civil lawsuit was filed by Colvin's family in 2016. The Syrian government was not involved in defending the case. Marie Colvin: Reporter's last days retold for cinema Colvin worked for the Sunday Times, covering the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. The US District Court for the District of Columbia found that the Syrian military and intelligence tracked the broadcasts of the journalists covering the siege of Homs, and then targeted the media centre in a barrage of artillery fire. Judge Jackson said this was part of the regime's long standing policy of violence against the media. French photographer Remi Ochlik also died in the shelling Colvin ""was specifically targeted because of her profession, for the purpose of silencing those reporting on the growing opposition movement in the country,"" the judge ruled. ""[The] murder of journalists acting in their professional capacity could have a chilling effect on reporting such events worldwide."" In addition, the Syrian government was ordered to pay $2.5m in compensation to Colvin's sister, Cathleen, and $11,836 in funeral expenses. Damascus is yet to publicly comment on the ruling. In a 2016 interview with NBC News, President Assad said: ""It's a war and she [Colvin] came illegally to Syria. ""She worked with the terrorists, and because she came illegally, she's been responsible of everything that befall on her."" Experts predict that Colvin's family is likely to face a lengthy battle to recover any of the damages awarded.

'Big six' energy firm to cut 900 jobs,"Energy giant Npower, one of  the big six energy providers in the UK, plans to cut 900 jobs to save costs. The energy firm said the number of redundancies would be ""considerably lower"" because of natural turnover. The firm blamed ""an incredibly tough"" retail energy market for the decision and the government's new price cap which began at the start of January. Npower employs 6,300 people. It said it was too early to say in which departments the cuts would fall. However, a spokesman for the firm said it was aiming to preserve its customer service support team. ""Even with these reductions, we still forecast significant losses this year, but we're doing everything we can to minimise them whilst continuing to focus on service and value for our customers,"" said Npower chief executive Paul Coffey. The government's new price cap will keep energy bills below Â£1,137 a year for ""typical usage"". It was introduced to stop people who did not switch energy provider being stuck on expensive default deals. Energy regulator Ofgem has saidthe cap will save 11 million customers an average of Â£76 a year on their gas and electricity bills. However, many providers have said the cap has made the market unviable, with several smaller energy firms collapsing since it was announced. Npower had planned to merge with larger rival SSE last year Matt Lay, the national energy officer at union Unison, said Npower's announcement was ""the tip of the iceberg"". ""Npower isn't the only firm struggling. The UK's entire retail energy market is broken and in need of an urgent fix. ""Households across the country are now better off because of the price cap. But as more energy suppliers shed staff, or go under completely, it's businesses and consumers who'll end up picking up the tab,"" he said. Npower was due to merge its retail business with larger rival SSE last year, butthe firms scrapped the planafter the cap was announced. The merger would have seen SSE's household energy division, SSE Energy Services, combined with the retail operations of Npower, which is owned by Germany's Innogy. SSE blamed the performance of the two businesses, the energy price cap and changing energy market conditions for the decision.

Venezuela's GuaidÃ³ says family threatened,"This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Venezuela's self-declared interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ has said his family has been threatened, amid the country's continuing political crisis. In a speech at Venezuela's Central University, he said police had visited his family home looking for his wife. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself president this month and was immediately recognised by the US and several Latin American countries. Russia and China back President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. Military support is seen as crucial to Mr Maduro's hold on power. But Mr GuaidÃ³ says he has held secret meetings with the military to win support for ousting Mr Maduro. Who is backing who in Venezuela Why the military is sticking with Maduro What's behind the political crisis? Protests have been held across the country since Mr Maduro began his second term on 10 January. He was elected last year during a controversial vote in which many opposition candidates were barred from running, or jailed. About three million people have fled Venezuela amid acute economic problems. ""Right now, special forces were at my home asking for Fabiana,"" said the opposition leader during a speech at the university. ""The dictatorship thinks they will frighten us. I received this information before I came here. But I didn't start with that. I started with a plan for all Venezuelans."" Addressing security forces directly, he said: ""I will hold you responsible for any intimidation of my baby, who is just 20 months old."" This video can not be played Juan GuaidÃ³: ""Maduro's regime is killing young, poor people on the streets"" The self-proclaimed president had been speaking as part of an event outlining his broad vision for the future direction of the country. Mr GuaidÃ³ called for the ""re-establishment of public services"", measures to tackle the worsening humanitarian crisis, and support for the ""most vulnerable sectors"" of the economy. His ""Plan Venezuela"" also focused on restoring oil production. ""We want a child who is born in any Venezuelan state to aspire to as much as, or more, than any child who lives in Madrid, Barcelona or Bogota or in any other part of the world,"" he said. He called on Venezuelans to gather together on Saturday as part of fresh protests to demand ""humanitarian assistance"", before asking for foreign diplomats to accompany him home to help protect his family. Later on Thursday he told the Reuters news agency that a change in the country's government would be advantageous to Russia and China, who support Mr Maduro. ""What most suits Russia and China is the country's stability and a change of government,"" he said, adding that Venezuela would be ""responsible"" to its creditors and bondholders. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? The crisis in seven charts Mr GuaidÃ³ earlier said he had held ""clandestine meetings with members of the armed forces and the security forces"". He did not say who he had been speaking to. Venezuela's top military representative to the US Col JosÃ© Luis Silva has defected- but senior military figures in Venezuela have supported Mr Maduro. As head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. Venezuela's Supreme Court has banned the opposition leader from leaving the country, however, and frozen his bank accounts. Mr Maduro told Russian news agency RIA he was prepared to hold talks with the opposition ""for the good of Venezuela"" but would not accept ultimatums or blackmail. The military has so far supported Mr Maduro (C) He insisted he had the backing of the military, accusing deserters of conspiring to plot a coup. Many officers hold posts as ministers or other influential positions. On Thursday, the European Parliament voted, in a non-binding resolution, to recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president until fresh elections can be called. The parliament has no foreign policy powers but urged the European Union and its member states to follow suit. The EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said it had agreed to create a contact group with Latin American nations aimed at resolving the crisis, but had set a 90-day deadline to find a political solution. The United Nations has told Mr GuaidÃ³ that it is willing to increase humanitarian aid to the country but required the consent of Mr Maduro's government, a spokesman said. The US government warned Mr Maduro there would be consequences for ""egregious"" acts of intimidation against Mr GuaidÃ³, a senior US official told the Reuters news agency. US National Security Adviser John Bolton also tweeted advice to Mr Maduro: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two admit posting 'Bulger killer photos'Richard McKeag and Natalie Barker posted images online that they claimed identified Jon Venables.Liverpool,"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger Two people posted photos on social media they said identified James Bulger killer Jon Venables, a court heard. At the High Court, Richard McKeag, 28, and Natalie Barker, 36, admitted eight contempt of court offences. Venables and Robert Thompson were convicted of murdering James in 1993, but there is aglobal banon publishing anything revealing their identities. McKeag and Barker were given suspended prison sentences. Lord Chief Justice Burnett said that, were it not for their personal circumstances, they would have been sent to prison immediately for ""serious"" breaches of the injunction protecting Venables' identity. The judge told the court there was a risk of someone being ""killed or seriously injured"", including anyone who was wrongly identified as one of James Bulger's killers. He said the ""haunting images"" of the two year old being led to his death by Venables and Thompson, would ""remain forever in the minds of anyone who saw them"". The pair also admitted seeking information about Thompson. The court heard McKeag admitted three breaches after posting an article on his website entitled ""Jon Venables Pictured - Killer's Identity Revealed"", in November 2017. The article contained photographs, said to be of Venables, and purported to reveal his new identity and place of work. Mr Justice Warby said McKeag's offences were ""planned and deliberate"". He wanted to ""defeat the legal system by mass publication and was well aware of the risks he faced,"" he said. McKeag, who was given a 12-month suspended sentence, could not attend court after being admitted to hospital on Wednesday. Through his counsel Keir Monteith, he said: ""I hold my hands up for having a total disregard for the law. It is not up to me to serve justice that must be left to the courts."" James Bulger's body was found on a railway line, two days after he was abducted by Thompson and Venables In February and March 2018, Barker posted a picture on her Twitter account, which had 649 followers, purporting to be of Venables and his fiancÃ©. The image was retweeted 24 times and received a number of likes, and she persisted even after receiving warnings from Twitter and the police. Barker's conduct was ""impulsive and stupid"", Lord Burnett said as she was given an eight-month suspended sentence. Her lawyers said she now understood the seriousness of her actions, had expressed remorse and has closed her Twitter account. The court heard one man mistaken for Venables said he and his family had ""endured five years of danger"". Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC, who instigated the contempt proceedings said after the hearing: ""The injunction protects the identities of the offenders, but also innocent individuals who may be wrongly identified as being one of the two men and placed in danger as a result. ""Posting this material online is a crime."" Actress faces Bulger killer contempt case Bulger killer 'had better life in prison' Bulger killer jailed for indecent images Actress Tina Malone is facing contempt of court proceedings over a post she made on social media which purports to show images of Venables. The Attorney General's Office confirmed last week it had sent a summons to Ms Malone, who appeared in Shameless on Channel 4. Venables and Thompson were 10 when they tortured and killed James after abducting the two-year-old from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993. In November that year, they became theyoungest children ever to be convictedof murder in England. McKeag and Barker also admitted seeking information about Robert Thompson, who was also convicted for James Bulger's murder Venables and Thompson have been living under new identities since they were released in 2001 under licence. This means they can be recalled at any time. Venables was jailed in 2010 for having child abuse images on his computer. He was alsoimprisoned in 2018 for the same offence.

"Rape chat students have bans reducedOne of the targeted students said she felt ""terrified"" at the prospect of seeing the men on campus again.UK","This video can not be played A woman discussed in a group chat by Warwick university students says she's terrified two of them will be back Two students banned from the University of Warwick for 10 years for their involvement in a group chat that threatened rape will be allowed to return later this year, it has emerged. One woman who was targeted said she felt ""terrified at the prospect of having these boys in my seminars"". Several of those in the chat encouraged others to rape specific students. The university said it had reduced the length of their bans to one year after they appealed. In a letter, seen by the BBC, a university official apologised to the women for not informing them of the appeal's outcome sooner - citing ""my delayed summer break"". 'My disgust at Uni rape chat decision' One of the two women who received the letter, in October last year, said she was talking about it now because she wanted to highlight what she describes as ""horrendous"" treatment by the university. The Facebook group chat was first reported last summer by Warwick student newspaperThe Boar,external. One of the messages said: ""Sometimes it's fun to just go wild and rape 100 girls."" While another said: ""Rape the whole flat to teach them all [a] lesson."" Another post included a racially offensive term and anti-Semitic language. At one point, a user wrote: ""Rape her in the street while everybody watches,"" with another responding it ""wouldn't even be unfair"". Student newspapers obtained the screenshots after complaints were made to the university After a disciplinary investigation by the university, five students were suspended. Two were banned for 10 years - and have now had that reduced to one year, two were excluded for one year, and one was given a lifetime campus ban. This means four out of the five of the men initially suspended will rejoin classes in September 2019. In an open letter to the university, one of the female students targeted in the chat said: ""We were discussed so violently. ""We were humiliated, as if for sport. These boys were my friends - like my brothers. And they destroyed me. ""You expect us to return from semesters abroad and study alongside these men? ""It is a source of shame for past, present and future Warwick alumni that you lack the courage to stand by us."" Prof Christine Ennew, a member of the executive team at Warwick University,said in a statement,externalthat the university was clear the behaviour was ""abhorrent and unacceptable"" and it was sorry the decision had ""upset so many members of our own community and beyond"". Privacy issues meant they were unable to comment on specific details, she said, but the appeals panel had decided ""the punishments imposed should be comparable across all of those individuals sanctioned"". She added the penalties were intended to allow the complainants time to complete their studies before the disciplined students were given the opportunity to return. The sanctions also came with ""future behavioural restrictions"" and conditions designed to ""enable them to learn from their past unacceptable behaviours"". Liam Jackson, the president of Warwick Students' Union, said the union would continue to push for a review of the university disciplinary procedure. Students from the university have taken to Twitter to voice their anger at the university's decision using the hashtag #ShameOnYouWarwick.

What preparations are being made for a no-deal?Brexit jargon explainedTomatoes 'could cost 10% more' after BrexitHow has business been affected by Brexit?VideoVideo,"Police, the government, the Border Force and ferry companies are among those preparing for a no-deal Brexit It could become the UK's biggest peacetime emergency in almost a century. Unless a withdrawal agreement is approved (or Article 50 is delayed), at 23:00 GMT on 29 March the UK will leave the European Union with no negotiated exit - and in a second everything will change. Suddenly, British goods going to the EU will be subject to duty (a payment, for example on imports and exports), and will need to be checked for compliance with things like sanitary regulations. Goods arriving in the UK from the EU could face checks too, though the government has said it will not do that straight away, partly because it doesn't have the infrastructure. Brexit: A really simple guide What is it all about? Brexit explained in videos The jargon explained The rules around things like fishing rights, air traffic and nuclear regulation will all change in the blink of an eye too. The effect is likely to be a severe slowdown on the critical Dover-Calais ferry and Channel Tunnel routes, as well as unpredictable delays at airports. An army of civil servants has been working on the problem since the EU referendum. At the time of writing, about 4,000 have been moved into positions where they are preparing for the no deal scenario. As we get closer, another 5,000 will be transferred across to help. On the night of Brexit, the government is expected to declare a ""critical incident"" and to start operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week in a ""command and control"" mode. The Cobra emergency committee will meet at the Cabinet Office as ministers sit down to tackle the unpredictable effects of leaving the EU without a deal. The Ministry of Defence has promised to make 3,500 service personnel available to help. About 10% of these will be reservists. An order laid before Parliament under the Reserve Forces Act says they can be called upon from 10 February. There are 14 military planners already working in other Whitehall departments. But despite all that, the chief executive of the civil service, John Manzoni, still concedes that a no-deal Brexit could be a ""bit bumpy"". The biggest concern is that lorry traffic across the English Channel through Dover and the Channel Tunnel terminal near Folkestone will grind to a standstill. To manage that, Highways England, Kent County Council and Kent Police have come up with Operation Brock - a plan for parking up to 13,000 trucks who could be left waiting to get through. The first 2,000 will park on the southbound carriageway of the M20 between junctions eight and nine, 6,000 more will be moved to Manston Airport, and if that's not enough then the M26 will be used to hold another 5,000. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise The government has given Kent County Council Â£28.8m to improve Manston, to strengthen the roads around it (such as the A249, A256 and the A299), and for new signs and traffic signals, This way it is hoped that the county of Kent will not itself stop functioning, as happened during a strike at Calais in 2015. The government expects there will be ""significantly reduced access across the short straits"" for up to six months. The government has also announced temporary measuresallowing lorries arriving in the UK to drive straight off ferries and Channel Tunnel trains without making customs declarations in the event of no-deal. The guidance for importers and hauliers says companies would be able to file a simplified form online in advance and pay duty later. Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Simplified customs plan for ports If Dover and Folkestone suddenly become slow and unpredictable ways of getting goods - some of them critical, like medical supplies - in and out, the government is hoping other routes will take more of the traffic. Saying ""a situation of extreme urgency exists"", the Department for Transportis paying a total of Â£107.7m to three ferry companiesto run extra ships. Ramsgate harbour needs to be dredged to clear access for larger ships Brittany Ferries will increase sailings for six weeks on the Portsmouth-Le Havre, Poole-Cherbourg and Plymouth-Roscoff routes. DFDS will increase the number of crossings on some of its routes. A new company -Seaborne Freight- had been asked by the government to run ships between Ramsgate and Ostend, butthe contract was later scrapped.The government said it had become clear that Seaborne was not going to be able to fulfil its side of the contract, and it is looking for another company to run additional freight ferries. Port companies such as Associated British Ports (ABP) have been improving the infrastructure at ports away from Dover in anticipation of increased traffic. The Department of Health (DoH) has developed extensive contingency plans, and has started to stockpile six weeks' worth of prescription-only and pharmacy medicines. It has signed Â£1m of contracts for refrigerated storage for approximately 5,000 pallets of medicine and another Â£9m for what is called ""ambient storage"", that is storage at room temperature. It has also been agreed in Whitehall that medicines and medical products would be given priority on freight routes, though it's not clear how that would work. The DoH has also made plans to air freight items like medical radioactive isotopes (used in radiotherapy and diagnostic tests) that have a very short shelf-life. Is NHS finding it hard to get medicines? Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit And it has recognised that some devices with short lead times - like stents and implants that come in many different shapes and sizes - cannot be easily stockpiled. So, the department is setting up a logistics hub in Belgium to help out companies who may face disruption. Suppliers are being asked to try to make their own arrangements - and to buy tickets for the extra ferry capacity that the government has secured. But if these efforts fail, they will be able to use what is being called the ""Dedicated Shipping Channel,"" which would aim to get the devices from the hub into the UK within three days. The same problem arises when it comes to food. Food manufacturers have been stockpiling ingredients, but there is starting to be a shortage of warehouse space - both ambient and chilled. Reality Check: What would 'no deal' Brexit mean for food and medicine? My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Not many people predict a severe food crisis (the UK is about 60% self-sufficient on food), but it is likely that some fresh foods that come in on short timetables from the European Union will become scarcer. Once again, the effects are likely to be unpredictable. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is recruiting for an EU Exit Emergencies Centre (EUXE) which will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to manage ""any situations that arise if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal"". There are concerns too about what to do with excess fresh food and live animals produced in the UK if it cannot be exported in time. There have been concerns that some people - angry at a no-deal exit from the EU, or at the effects of that - will protest. In a briefing to staff, the National Crime Agency wrote: ""A no-deal exit is likely to result in significant short-term disruption across the country, which may manifest simultaneously across multiple areas and geographic locations."" Protesters outside Parliament in January when MPs voted on the government's Brexit deal The NCA said ""wider potential impacts such as transport blockages, fuel and food shortages and protests/public disorder, could impact on officers both personally and professionally"". Some police forces have stopped officers taking leave for the first weeks after Brexit, though senior officers think the risk of disorder is low. One of the effects of leaving the EU without a deal will be that British police officers will lose access to EU criminal justice tools such as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the European Investigation Order (EIO). To handle the loss of these modern tools, the NCA - which communicates with overseas forces and Europol - has recruited 87 officers to use the much less effective Interpol system and to use other arrangements that are less automated and more labour-intensive. An International Crime Co-ordination Centre is being set up by the National Police Chiefs Council as part of what is being called Operation Safety Net to help forces with things like international manhunts and missing people inquiries. To prepare for changes in immigration and customs at all points of entry into the UK, a Border Delivery Group has been established, chaired by Karen Wheeler, a senior official at HMRC. The government has admitted that the UK's borders are likely to operate in a ""sub-optimal"" way if there is a no-deal Brexit. The Border Force has recruited about 300 officers to make up a ""Readiness Task Force"" to provide ""operational resilience"" and allow other staff to do EU-related training. It is also recruiting a further 600 officers to make sure there are enough staff at the borders. In the event of no-deal, the UK will need to patrol its fishing waters much more extensively than it has for many years. The Royal Navy has already reprieved three Fishery Protection Patrol ships that were due to be taken out of service. It is preparing to provide 600 days a year of fishery protection, three times what it currently provides. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO), which regulates the seas around Britain, is also to pay up to Â£40m to charter civilian ships to help them patrol fisheries over the next four years The proposed contract - for up to four years - is due to start on 1 April. Brexit and fish: Skippers, kippers and the creel thing Will the UK and EU reach a Brexit fishing deal? It is to provide ships to help the MMO's Marine Enforcement Officers with a means of getting around the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the seas around the UK. The contract says the ships must have a way of boarding other vessels. 12 key Brexit words you need to know Brexit: A really simple guide What happens now that a deal's been done?

Brexit jargon explainedTomatoes 'could cost 10% more' after BrexitHow has business been affected by Brexit?VideoVideo,"The UK and the European Union are in talks about how they could live and work together after Brexit. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - here is what some of the key ones mean. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Britain's exit from the European Union. A period lasting from 31 January to 31 December 2020, when the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but still follows all its rules. It was agreed by the UK and the EU to allow both sides time to reach a deal on their future relationship. Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers such as: Taxes that must be paid when trading Limits on how much of certain goods can be imported Rules on things such as hygiene or labelling of food How the agreement between the EU and the UK would be enforced if there is a dispute. One controversial issue has been about what role, if any, the European Court of Justice should play. A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Rules on who can fish where, and how much of each species can be caught. A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements often include level playing field measures. EU laws which prevent a government in one country from supporting companies there - over competitors in another country. This support could be financial - for instance, allowing companies to borrow more cheaply, or charging them less in tax. The 2019 agreement which set out how the UK would leave the EU. It covered: Money the UK still has to pay the EU The rights of EU citizens who already live in the UK and UK citizens in the EU The Northern Ireland protocol is part of this agreement. It set out special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid the need for checks along the Irish border. This will be the situation if the UK and the EU don't reach a trade agreement by the end of 2020. It means that both sides would have to charge tariffs - or taxes - on goods crossing borders. If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under what's called WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, where each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering, and applies them equally to all its trading partners. The government currently refers to this as an ""Australian-style deal"".

Tomatoes 'could cost 10% more' after BrexitHow has business been affected by Brexit?VideoVideo,"This video can not be played Tomato prices may go up in the event of a no-deal Brexit The cost of cherry tomatoes could increase by more than 10% if there is a no deal Brexit, say growers in southern Spain. Earlier this week, I visited a vast site near Alicante, where 60 million kilograms of cherry tomatoes are grown, picked and shipped every year and a third of them are bound for the UK. But growers are worried that a no deal Brexit is going to push up the price we pay for them in the shops. Jorge Brotons is the commercial director for Bonnysa and deals with all the big UK supermarkets. The business has been growing tomatoes for the UK since 1956. Why Dutch fear no deal will leave onions to rot No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' ""We're trying to understand what the different scenarios can be. If there is no deal, we'll have to trade in a different way as tariffs will be applied, new inspections and this means we add new processes to current situations,"" he says. Ultimately it means more work, more time, more people to make checks and all that means more costs. ""The cost in agriculture and margins are very very tight, and the history of prices shows tomatoes haven't increased in 15 years,"" he says. ""With all costs increasing our margins are so tight - we can't absorb any more cost and any more costs in that chain means losses and having to decide to do something else."" A worker processes cherry tomatoes at the Bonnysa plant We start the day at Bonnysa's vast greenhouse complex which spans a huge valley in northern Alicante. The sun shines brightly and the temperature is around 15 degrees, a reminder of why salad growing here is much easier than in the UK in January. In the greenhouse we visit, we meet two pickers undertaking the fortnightly harvest. Within 15 minutes they've gathered trays of their bright red bounty and it is on to the factory for processing. The pickers have no idea how many cherry tomatoes pass across the factory floor per year - they laugh when I ask. And it's not hard to understand why. They're everywhere. One sorting line spreads them, then photographs them and another separates them. We see all of the big UK supermarkets' labels on the boxes bound for the UK, but I can't tell you who they are as the firms requested confidentiality. For them, it is too sensitive to be heard talking about Brexit - even when it's just tomatoes. Trota transports 200 lorries of tomatoes to the UK every week Angel Jiminez is director of exports at Trota, a logistics firms that sends 200 lorries of tomatoes to the UK every week. So how would a no deal Brexit affect their business? ""Right now there is no paperwork involved to cross the border and we can cross easily, but more paperwork means delays. Time is money, more days is more time - and it is the final buyer who pays for everything."" He also says the haulier industry is no where near prepared enough: ""Brexit is not going to be easy at the beginning."" Uri is one of the many Trota drivers that transport Bonnysa's cherry tomatoes to the UK. It's Monday and he's just about to begin the 2,000km journey from the Alicante plant, across Spain and France, and on to Britain through the Channel Tunnel. Eurotunnel is the preferred crossing for most perishable food items, and by volume the tunnel carries more food than car parts because of its speed and access to market. For Bonnysa it is vital that it continues to function smoothly after Brexit, whatever deal is achieved. At least according to the company that operates the tunnel, firms need not worry. ""Here at Eurotunnel we're ready, soft Brexit, hard Brexit we've been preparing for two and a half years. We've taken the worst case scenario as our goal all the way through,"" says John Keefe, director of public affairs at Eurotunnel. ""We will be able to deliver our transport system from day one from both sides."" I join Uri in the truck from Calais and we head through the tunnel and into Folkestone for the final leg of his journey - on to the supermarket distribution centre. All in all, it takes just over two and a half days to transport a tomato from Bonyssa's vines to sub-zero temperatures in Dartford. They'll be on the supermarkets on Friday in time for your weekend salad. There is zero friction on our journey (apart from some snow), but the concern from Spain is that the introduction of new checks and customs at any point in the trip will add new costs if there's a no deal Brexit - and that means higher prices for UK shoppers, a thought shared by Justin King, former boss of Sainsbury's. ""The nature of our very efficient food supply chain is there is little surplus cost or margin along the way,"" he says. ""The more inefficient it becomes, the ability of suppliers and retailers to absorb that is very limited. They will be passed on to consumers and really quite quickly.""

How has business been affected by Brexit?VideoVideo,"Banks have been moving workers out of London With two months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU, how are firms and the UK economy faring? The economy's ""resilience through the turbulence of the Brexit process has been particularly noteworthy"", according to Chancellor Philip Hammond. But some businesses claim to have been put under unprecedented pressure. What is going on? It's impossible to put absolute numbers on how jobs, output and investment have been affected so far. No one knows how these will have fared had the outcome to the referendum in 2016 been different. Other factors have influenced the business environment - not least slower growth in the likes of China and Europe But there is a range of evidence that can give us an idea of how UK companies are faring. On the face of it: no. The number of people employed is at an all-time high. But there's a lot going on under the surface. Banks' contingency plans mean setting up alternative bases in the likes of Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin. Individual banks are coy about revealing too much. But reports about banks such as Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Bank of America moving, or creating, hundreds rather than thousands of jobs at those sites suggest the total affected in the City is much smaller thanthe 65,000 or so predicted by some immediately after the referendum. London's Lord Mayor has said thatthe total by 29 March is likely to be below 13,000. What we don't know is if jobs created in European cities such as Paris and Frankfurt are at the expense of potential ones here - or the final implications of the future trading relationship with the EU, whenever that is agreed. While some - including JLR and Ford - have cited Brexit when cutting jobs, it has been a contributing rather than a deciding factor. Car companies are facing a seismic shock in the face of slowing global demand, oversupply and the shift away from diesel. Barclays in billions of pounds Brexit move Firms 'may speed up no-deal Brexit plans' Brexit: What could happen next? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' In advance of departure, it is rare for firms to blame Brexit alone for job cuts. Chef and restaurant owner Jamie Oliver faced derision for doing so within a few months of the referendum, with critics instead blaming his business model. As the uncertainty continues, companies may be putting hiring plans on hold - not least as they ramp up spending on no-deal contingency plans. How that impacts overall employment won't be known for a while. There has probably never been a better time to be a trade negotiator - or a business adviser. Overall employment has continued to rise to record levels since the referendum in June 2016. In total, Â£95m worth of contracts were awarded last year to consultancy firms to advise the public sector on Brexit. And 20,000 more civil servants have been employed since the referendum, in a reversal to earlier trends. They are concentrated in the departments  most affected by Brexit. And that's just the public sector. Some companies continue to hire apace for other reasons. Telecoms giant Openreach, for example, has said that it will hire a further 3,000 engineers to support its rollout of full fibre broadband. Business investment is stagnant and more than 10% lower than official forecasts had predicted prior to the referendum. A lifting of the uncertainty could persuade firms to start spending again - a ""deal dividend"". But investment  has been relatively sluggish since the financial crisis. Firms instead opted to hang on to workers, as they are relatively cheap. They may be continuing this strategy, which could help explain why job creation has remained so resilient. And as businesses enact contingency plans, money earmarked for investment may have been diverted. Drugmaker AstraZeneca has spent Â£40m building extra testing facilities as it increases its drugs stockpile. Some are forging ahead with plans for a variety of reasons. Sony ismoving its electronics HQ to the Netherlands, to pre-empt any customs problems. James Dysonclaims he's moving his company's base to Singaporeto be closer to its fastest growing markets. Butluxury brand Chanel cited the same reasonfor moving its global business functions to London. Majestic Wine has said it will stockpile more than one million extra bottles of wine from France, Spain and Italy Drugmakers aren't the only ones stockpiling. Associated British Foods, the company behind Twinings tea and Ryvita, has bought up extra machinery and packaging to prevent disruption to supply chains. Mondelez, the makers of Cadburys, is stocking up on ingredients and the finished article. More from theBBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Could women solve the global pilot shortage? Why are the Chinese buying fewer cars? How is Qatar coping with its economic embargo? Clouds gathering over global economy With Majestic Wine buying an extra Â£8m in drinks, and Nestle investing in more coffee, there is a reduced risk of us having to forego some of life's luxuries. Of course, these extra stocks may not be needed - and so the effort and money that's gone into organising and storing them will have been wasted. But at this point, many companies feel they have no choice. Fashion buyers are concerned about possible disruption The UK's exit from the EU may be two months away but for some Brexit has in effect already happened. Orders are often put in months in advance. Those for British malting barley from the EU have dried up. Barley, which is the UK's second largest arable export, could attract tariffs of around 50% of the current market price. And it's not just food. At September's London Fashion Week, buyers were voicing concerns about placing orders for the spring that might face disruption. Many of the impacts of the run-up to Brexit, as far as business is concerned, are likely to be temporary, reflecting contingencies or uncertainty. The overall impact on the economy will become a bit clearer when GDP figures are released in about a week. And what follows next will depend on Westminster's actions. The impact of those, in whatever direction, may dwarf what we've seen so far. Barclays in billions of pounds Brexit move Firms 'may speed up no-deal Brexit plans' What happens after Brexit?

Do I have to go to work in snow?,"It may not be a return of the Beast from the East, but snow and ice is now causing considerable disruption in the UK. Hundreds of schools have shut, transport has been disrupted, and people have been told to prepare to change any travel plans. People whose journey to work is difficult should be aware of their rights if they want to take the day off. In most cases you are not automatically entitled to pay if you are unable to get to work because of travel disruption or bad weather. If your employer normally provides your travel to work and this has been cancelled because of the bad weather you should still be paid,according to the employment advice and conciliation service Acas.,external It is a good idea for employees to remind themselves of their contract. Some jobs may also have a specific clause written in, or have a collective agreement in place, which means an employer will pay staff who cannot get to work owing to circumstances beyond their control. Some employers might also make discretionary, informal arrangements. For example, they may let employees work from home, or agree that the time can be made up at a later date. No, all employees have the right to take unpaid time off to deal with emergency situations for their children or other dependants. Lawyers suggest that a school being shut at short notice is likely to be considered an emergency. Strictly, the day would be unpaid but some employers are more forgiving. How to drive in snow and icy weather How to prepare for the snow Acas advises,externalyou talk to your employer as soon as you can to explain that you need to take time off and the likely length of the absence. It says one option is that you jointly agree to take the day as annual leave so you do not miss out on pay. Only with sufficient warning. The law states that you must be given a warning period of ""at least"" double the length of annual leave you are being asked to take. So, if your employer wants you to take one day's annual leave, for example, they would need to give you two days' notice. There is an exception - when the workplace has been closed owing to the weather. In those circumstances an employer cannot demand staff take the time as annual leave. Workers are also entitled to be paid. The employer can still ask you to work from home, or ask you to go to another workplace that is open if the business has one, according togovernment advice website Gov.uk.,external No. The Health and Safety Executive recommends,externala minimum temperature of 16C for offices where the work is deskbound and fairly sedentary. If the work requires physical effort, the minimum recommended temperature is 13C. These temperatures are not a legal requirement but your employer has a duty to provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. If low temperatures make it unsafe for workers, then Acas says you should be allowed to wear warmer clothing, take extra breaks to make hot drinks and also be allowed to bring in extra heating options such as portable heaters. However, if you are vulnerable in any way, such as being pregnant, then you may be sent home to protect your health, and this would usually be on full pay.

Your most-asked snow questions,"Wintry weather has grounded flights, closed hundreds of schools, and caused travel chaos across the UK. But while commuters frantically clawed at the ice on their windscreens, many took to  the web to ask all manner of snow-related questions. Here are the answers to some of the most-searched. See how cold it is where you are When it comes to de-icing your car, patience is a virtue. For starters,don't do what this driver didand leave only a tiny gap in their snow-covered windscreen before driving off. Police Scotland has released images of the car stopped on the A9 at Thurso When you use the car's heater to defrost the windows, increase the heat gradually or it'll create extra mist. Brush off the snow from the car's exterior, including the front grille. Don't use boiling water to de-ice windscreens - hot water can crack the glass, and the water will only freeze again on the screen or on the ground where you are standing. Instead, spray the windscreen with plenty of de-icer and use a scraper to remove the frost from the entire screen. A squirt of WD-40 can also prevent door locks freezing up. If they do, heat your key with a lighter to melt the ice. But if you fancy a more extreme solution, you could takethe approach Russians used to de-ice their airplanes: find leftover jet fighter engines and use them to blast hot air at the affected areas. (Results not guaranteed.) Sadly, rounding off your lunch of crisps and chocolate with a fizzy vitamin C tablet isn't a surefire way to stave off the office cold. It mainly comes down to - no surprises here - eating well, sleeping properly, and exercising enough. TheNHS recommends,externaleating plenty of fruit and veg, as well as a hearty breakfast to set you up for the day. Milk and dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt and fromage fraisare also great sources,externalof protein, vitamins and calcium. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't have to be below zero to snow. You can start wishing for a snow day as soon as the temperature drops below 2Â°C. According to the Met Office,external, most of the UK's heaviest snowfalls tend to be when the temperature sits between 0Â°C and 2Â°C. Any hotter than that and the snowflakes will melt and fall as sleet or rain. Gritters may have been out in force - but the ""grit"" they've been laying is actually rock salt. Salt lowers the freezing point of water, so it stops ice forming and causes existing ice or snow to melt. Gritter overturns during icy weather In a word, carefully. Stopping distances are greater in snow and ice. Allow extra time, plan your journey, wear warm clothes, and make sure your phone is properly charged. Stock up on chocolate, biscuits and hot drinks, in case you get stuck. This video can not be played Five handy winter driving tips After de-icing your car, use second gear to pull away, lifting the clutch gently to avoid wheel spin. Stay in a higher gear for better control as you pick up speed. Maintain the right speed for the conditions- not too fast so that you risk losing control, but not so slow that you risk losing momentum when you need it. If your school has declared a snow day, you've got your head teacher to thank. They are usually the ones who decide whether to close the school. Do I have to go to work in the snow? The decisionis based onthe welfare of children, taking into account whether: children can get to and from school safely the site is safe there are enough staff to supervise the students. If the weather is fine in the morning, but scheduled to get worse later in the day, the school may decide to close for the whole day. Most people know it's white and cold and falls from the sky. But what actually is it? Asthe Met Office explains,external, snow forms when tiny ice crystals in clouds stick together, becoming snowflakes. If enough of these crystals stick together, they'll become heavy enough to fall to the ground. As the snowflakes drift down from the sky, those falling through moist air that is slightly warmer than 0Â°C will melt at the edges and stick together, producing big flakes. This type of snow is ""wet"" and makes for good snowmen. ""Dry snow"", which is ideal for snow sports, comes from snowflakes that fall through cold, dry air, producing small, powdery flakes.

How to prepare for the snow,"Brace yourself, we're in for another few days of snow - if the forecasts are right there'll probably be the usual mix of travel disruption and missing work or school. Social media will become clogged up with endless, monotonous, snow photos. Plus, if you do get a few days off school or college - you'll need to know the best way to look after your cat or dog. Here's an essential guide to prepare for the weather. Colour, light and composition - those are the main things you have to remember when taking this year's snow snaps. That's according to Gideon Knight, who was named Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year in 2016. ""You need something in the foreground that stands out against the snow, something with good colours,"" he says. ""If I saw a gull sitting a field it would be difficult, but if there's something with more colour - a robin for example - the red in its breast will stand out really well."" This one was taken by Andy in Buckinghamshire Or, he says, you can also achieve this by changing your background. ""If it's still snowing and you want to get a shot of some snowdrops, a good trick is to use something dark in the background like a holly bush. ""This way the white snow shows up really well against it."" Gideon's The Moon and the Crow photo saw him named Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year in 2016 Snow pics can often appear duller because your phone camera tries to over-compensate for so much whiteness. Gideon suggests using your phone to turn up the brightness or over-expose the photo, ""which will give a crisp, white colour - like the one you see with your eyes"". When it comes to composition, Gideon says: ""One of the best rules for photography is the rule of thirds, which means you section your image up into a three-by-three grid and compose your image along the lines. ""If you have something in the foreground on the right, it's often good to have something balancing it on the left of the image in the background."" This video can not be played We got some tips on driving on ice last year If you have to drive in icy conditions, there's always a risk of skidding. And while we're all taught what to do if we skid in our driving lessons, it's easy to panic and forget the essentials. Luckily, there are only three main things to remember, says Lorne Mitchener from Thruxton Motorsport Centre. Firstly, take your foot off the gas as soon as soon as you feel your car start to slide. The second thing is not to hit the brakes. ""You don't want to get the car locked up and put it into a bigger slide,"" says Lorne. ""Thirdly, work the steering,"" he says. ""Follow the car. If the car wants to go left, turn the wheel to the left. ""Pause, and the turn it back. If it doesn't work the first time, do it again. ""As soon as the car's going back in the direction, you want, that's your cue - you can get back on the throttle, but gently."" Maggie sent this photo in to us from Nottinghamshire This video can not be played Advice from the RSPCA on how to look after pets while it's snowing Obviously, you need to make sure your pet has somewhere warm and dry to go after they've been playing outside in the snow. But you should also check their paws for snow - as it can harden into balls of ice between the pads. You should also remember that grit and salt on the roads can be irritable or poisonous to your pet's skin, and the RSPCA suggests washing your dog after being in the snow. But when it comes to putting a coat on your dog, the RSPCA's recommendation is that only older or ill dogs need coats. They add that you shouldn't force it on if your dog doesn't want to wear one. And your pet will use more energy to keep warm - so it's a good idea to give them a bit of extra food.

How has business been affected by Brexit?,"Banks have been moving workers out of London With two months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU, how are firms and the UK economy faring? The economy's ""resilience through the turbulence of the Brexit process has been particularly noteworthy"", according to Chancellor Philip Hammond. But some businesses claim to have been put under unprecedented pressure. What is going on? It's impossible to put absolute numbers on how jobs, output and investment have been affected so far. No one knows how these will have fared had the outcome to the referendum in 2016 been different. Other factors have influenced the business environment - not least slower growth in the likes of China and Europe But there is a range of evidence that can give us an idea of how UK companies are faring. On the face of it: no. The number of people employed is at an all-time high. But there's a lot going on under the surface. Banks' contingency plans mean setting up alternative bases in the likes of Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin. Individual banks are coy about revealing too much. But reports about banks such as Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Bank of America moving, or creating, hundreds rather than thousands of jobs at those sites suggest the total affected in the City is much smaller thanthe 65,000 or so predicted by some immediately after the referendum. London's Lord Mayor has said thatthe total by 29 March is likely to be below 13,000. What we don't know is if jobs created in European cities such as Paris and Frankfurt are at the expense of potential ones here - or the final implications of the future trading relationship with the EU, whenever that is agreed. While some - including JLR and Ford - have cited Brexit when cutting jobs, it has been a contributing rather than a deciding factor. Car companies are facing a seismic shock in the face of slowing global demand, oversupply and the shift away from diesel. Barclays in billions of pounds Brexit move Firms 'may speed up no-deal Brexit plans' Brexit: What could happen next? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' In advance of departure, it is rare for firms to blame Brexit alone for job cuts. Chef and restaurant owner Jamie Oliver faced derision for doing so within a few months of the referendum, with critics instead blaming his business model. As the uncertainty continues, companies may be putting hiring plans on hold - not least as they ramp up spending on no-deal contingency plans. How that impacts overall employment won't be known for a while. There has probably never been a better time to be a trade negotiator - or a business adviser. Overall employment has continued to rise to record levels since the referendum in June 2016. In total, Â£95m worth of contracts were awarded last year to consultancy firms to advise the public sector on Brexit. And 20,000 more civil servants have been employed since the referendum, in a reversal to earlier trends. They are concentrated in the departments  most affected by Brexit. And that's just the public sector. Some companies continue to hire apace for other reasons. Telecoms giant Openreach, for example, has said that it will hire a further 3,000 engineers to support its rollout of full fibre broadband. Business investment is stagnant and more than 10% lower than official forecasts had predicted prior to the referendum. A lifting of the uncertainty could persuade firms to start spending again - a ""deal dividend"". But investment  has been relatively sluggish since the financial crisis. Firms instead opted to hang on to workers, as they are relatively cheap. They may be continuing this strategy, which could help explain why job creation has remained so resilient. And as businesses enact contingency plans, money earmarked for investment may have been diverted. Drugmaker AstraZeneca has spent Â£40m building extra testing facilities as it increases its drugs stockpile. Some are forging ahead with plans for a variety of reasons. Sony ismoving its electronics HQ to the Netherlands, to pre-empt any customs problems. James Dysonclaims he's moving his company's base to Singaporeto be closer to its fastest growing markets. Butluxury brand Chanel cited the same reasonfor moving its global business functions to London. Majestic Wine has said it will stockpile more than one million extra bottles of wine from France, Spain and Italy Drugmakers aren't the only ones stockpiling. Associated British Foods, the company behind Twinings tea and Ryvita, has bought up extra machinery and packaging to prevent disruption to supply chains. Mondelez, the makers of Cadburys, is stocking up on ingredients and the finished article.

Of course, these extra stocks may not be needed - and so the effort and money that's gone into organising and storing them will have been wasted. But at this point, many companies feel they have no choice. Fashion buyers are concerned about possible disruption The UK's exit from the EU may be two months away but for some Brexit has in effect already happened. Orders are often put in months in advance.

Tomatoes 'could cost 10% more' after Brexit,"This video can not be played Tomato prices may go up in the event of a no-deal Brexit The cost of cherry tomatoes could increase by more than 10% if there is a no deal Brexit, say growers in southern Spain. Earlier this week, I visited a vast site near Alicante, where 60 million kilograms of cherry tomatoes are grown, picked and shipped every year and a third of them are bound for the UK. But growers are worried that a no deal Brexit is going to push up the price we pay for them in the shops. Jorge Brotons is the commercial director for Bonnysa and deals with all the big UK supermarkets. The business has been growing tomatoes for the UK since 1956. Why Dutch fear no deal will leave onions to rot No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' ""We're trying to understand what the different scenarios can be. If there is no deal, we'll have to trade in a different way as tariffs will be applied, new inspections and this means we add new processes to current situations,"" he says. Ultimately it means more work, more time, more people to make checks and all that means more costs. ""The cost in agriculture and margins are very very tight, and the history of prices shows tomatoes haven't increased in 15 years,"" he says. ""With all costs increasing our margins are so tight - we can't absorb any more cost and any more costs in that chain means losses and having to decide to do something else."" A worker processes cherry tomatoes at the Bonnysa plant We start the day at Bonnysa's vast greenhouse complex which spans a huge valley in northern Alicante. The sun shines brightly and the temperature is around 15 degrees, a reminder of why salad growing here is much easier than in the UK in January. In the greenhouse we visit, we meet two pickers undertaking the fortnightly harvest. Within 15 minutes they've gathered trays of their bright red bounty and it is on to the factory for processing. The pickers have no idea how many cherry tomatoes pass across the factory floor per year - they laugh when I ask. And it's not hard to understand why. They're everywhere. One sorting line spreads them, then photographs them and another separates them. We see all of the big UK supermarkets' labels on the boxes bound for the UK, but I can't tell you who they are as the firms requested confidentiality. For them, it is too sensitive to be heard talking about Brexit - even when it's just tomatoes. Trota transports 200 lorries of tomatoes to the UK every week Angel Jiminez is director of exports at Trota, a logistics firms that sends 200 lorries of tomatoes to the UK every week. So how would a no deal Brexit affect their business? ""Right now there is no paperwork involved to cross the border and we can cross easily, but more paperwork means delays. Time is money, more days is more time - and it is the final buyer who pays for everything."" He also says the haulier industry is no where near prepared enough: ""Brexit is not going to be easy at the beginning."" Uri is one of the many Trota drivers that transport Bonnysa's cherry tomatoes to the UK. It's Monday and he's just about to begin the 2,000km journey from the Alicante plant, across Spain and France, and on to Britain through the Channel Tunnel. Eurotunnel is the preferred crossing for most perishable food items, and by volume the tunnel carries more food than car parts because of its speed and access to market. For Bonnysa it is vital that it continues to function smoothly after Brexit, whatever deal is achieved. At least according to the company that operates the tunnel, firms need not worry. ""Here at Eurotunnel we're ready, soft Brexit, hard Brexit we've been preparing for two and a half years. We've taken the worst case scenario as our goal all the way through,"" says John Keefe, director of public affairs at Eurotunnel. ""We will be able to deliver our transport system from day one from both sides."" I join Uri in the truck from Calais and we head through the tunnel and into Folkestone for the final leg of his journey - on to the supermarket distribution centre. All in all, it takes just over two and a half days to transport a tomato from Bonyssa's vines to sub-zero temperatures in Dartford. They'll be on the supermarkets on Friday in time for your weekend salad. There is zero friction on our journey (apart from some snow), but the concern from Spain is that the introduction of new checks and customs at any point in the trip will add new costs if there's a no deal Brexit - and that means higher prices for UK shoppers, a thought shared by Justin King, former boss of Sainsbury's. ""The nature of our very efficient food supply chain is there is little surplus cost or margin along the way,"" he says. ""The more inefficient it becomes, the ability of suppliers and retailers to absorb that is very limited. They will be passed on to consumers and really quite quickly.""

Chayenne Wiskerke, head of Wiskerke Onions, is keen to keep UK shelves stocked The current border-free frictionless trade zone means British supermarkets can order crates of onions from the Netherlands in the morning and sell them within 24 hours. Approximately â¬1.2bn (Â£1bn; $1.4bn) worth of Dutch fruit and vegetables are exported to the UK annually â that's 50,000 trucks crossing the channel every year. An Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study found that Dutch exports to the UK could drop by 17% in the event of a no-deal Brexit. While the UK's customs authority HMRC says it has ""well-developed plans"" for a functioning system from day one, fruit and vegetables are the Dutch exports most vulnerable to disruption. Dutch exporters can get their fruit and vegetables on UK shelves within 24 hours of an order Exporters operate on a ""just-in-time"" principle to ensure customers receive the freshest possible produce. Additional checks for plant health, food safety and marketing standards could create tailbacks at customs. Some officials predict a 30% increase in import inspections and a 100% increase in export inspections. Deliveries currently made within a day could take two to three days. German cars can afford to wait. Dutch tomatoes cannot, and delays reduce shelf-life. Could a no-deal Brexit cause traffic jams? Will EU blink first in Brexit standoff? Brexit border checks 'may triple queues' France fears Brexit blow to farms ""The nightmare is our tomatoes and cucumbers rotting at the border,"" says Gert Mulder, director of GroentenFruit Huis, the national fruit and vegetable growers' body. ""British supermarkets have stock for around three days. They don't have any storage capacity,"" he points out. ""So it would have to be built. But there isn't time. The orders have already been placed. The plants are already growing. ""Of course we read about the British who are stockpiling food. If the supply chain fails the shelves will be empty. It is our job as producers to find a solution."" The Dutch have come with an idea designed to fast-track perishable products - and they call it ""green lanes"": A digital pre-clearance system would allow customs checks to be conducted before the trucks arrive at the ports All information - from pedigree certificates to origins of the products - would be uploaded on a database UK customs officials could check lorry cargoes remotely before they even disembarked from the ferries Vehicles approved in advance would be given a special ""green lane"" to avoid any customs queues For Mart Valstar, a typical Dutch exporter who sends vegetables to the UK, the innovation makes sense. Mr Valstar explains how the green lane idea would work ""We'll prepare the documents for export and for our clients to import in the UK and then our trucks will get a certificate on a green lane that they roll on the boat, roll off the boat, direct to our customers,"" he says. The alternative, he fears, is three or four days' delay at UK harbours, with knock-on congestion on the Dutch side too. The technology is ready to roll out. But there is a catch â it must be agreed by the UK. ""The British cabinet members I've spoken to push it away,"" Gert Mulder explains in frustration. ""Within days after Article 50 was triggered, we were already talking to (the UK ministry) Defra. The problem is we need the British to make decisions and we can't have bilateral talks until after the Brexit negotiations."" Brexit prompts Sony's Europe HQ move to Netherlands The UK's customs authority told the BBC that keeping goods flowing across the border was of vital importance, but it would not compromise on UK border security. A no-deal Brexit will cost the Netherlands an estimated â¬2.3bn by 2023, according to the Dutch Court of Audit. Some 35,000 Dutch companies only export to the current customs union. When the UK leaves, they'll have to deal with customs for the first time. Current rules allow fresh deliveries in as long as it takes a ferry to reach British shores In an effort to smooth the transition, the Dutch government is hiring more than 900 customs, agricultural and veterinary inspectors. Many of the new recruits have come from Eastern Europe, due to an absence of qualified vets at home. But they are still struggling to fill all the positions. No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' Hundreds buy 'Brexit Box' amid food fears Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit ""We only have about 350 trained officials,"" said Pieter Omtzigt, the Dutch parliament's Brexit rapporteur. ""The day you need them most is Brexit day, because you'll have lots of businesses that are unprepared. If we need hundreds of new inspectors, the British are going to need thousands."" And then there's Rotterdam â the biggest harbour in the EU. If the British export system gets clogged up it will have an impact on global trade. The United States, China, Russia, and Brazil could all feel the ripple-effect. Dutch producers fear the dominant trade routes will become congested and traffic will be diverted from French ports to depart from Belgium and the Netherlands. ""We are looking at alternative markets inside the EU: Bulgaria, Romania,"" Gert Mulder says. ""The market in eastern Europe is not as lucrative as the UK, but we're looking at options.""

Magnum ice creams stockpiled ahead of Brexit,"Unilever has said it is stockpiling Ben and Jerry's ice cream and Magnum bars ahead of the UK's departure from the European Union. Chief executive Alan Jope said the consumer goods giant was holding a few weeks' worth of extra stock in case of disruption to supply chains. It follows admissions of Brexit stockpiling from other firms. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but concern is mounting it will exit without a deal. No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' How has business been affected by Brexit? Mr Jope said Unilever was also stockpiling deodorant in mainland Europe in case of Brexit-related delays. The firm's Leeds factory, which makes Sure, Lynx and Dove, supplies the whole of Europe, while its ice creams are produced on the continent. Mr Jope added that the firm was building up stocks of the materials used to package goods. ""We have built inventory on either side of the Channel,"" Mr Jope said. ""It's weeks of inventory - not months or days. ""If I was in the designer handbag business then I might have built further [inventory] cover but we're not, we are in fast-moving consumer goods and one of the things we have learned is, when you build inventory, it can end up being the wrong mix of product."" A number of companies have been stockpiling goods ahead of Brexit, including car-parts maker Robert Bosch, luxury goods firm LVMH and French drugmaker Novartis. Earlier this week, Sainsbury's, Asda and McDonald's warned that stockpiling fresh food was impossible - and that a no-deal Brexit would leave them short of stock. But the government said it has ""well established"" ways of working with industry to prevent disruption. Mr Jope, who succeeded Paul Polman as Unilever's chief executive in November, said the company was preparing for various Brexit scenarios but that a no-deal outcome would be the hardest to manage. ""We desperately hope that we don't end up in a tariff-laden environment,"" he said. How has business been affected by Brexit?

Man jailed for killing Olympian's mother,"This video can not be played Chris Boardman: 'I have nothing to say to mum's killer' A driver who admitted killing Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman's mother by running over her has been sentenced to 30 weeks in prison. Liam Rosney, 33, of Connah's Quay, had previously admitted causing death by careless driving at Mold Crown Court. Carol Boardman, 75, was hit in July 2016 after she fell off her bike in Deeside, Flintshire. The court heard Rosney was distracted as he made or received three phone calls before the incident. He faced a charge of causing death by dangerous driving but later admitted the lesser charge. As well as the prison sentence, Rosney was banned from driving for 18 and a half months. ""This was an accident which could have easily been prevented and your contribution to that accident is significant in as much as you were distracted,"" said Judge Rhys Rowlands. ""The distraction being as a result of you using your mobile phone before the actual collision."" The incident happened after Carol Boardman fell off her bike Mrs Boardman, 75, whose cyclist son Chris won gold at the 1992 Olympics, suffered multiple injuries when she was hit by Mr Rosney's Mitsubishi pick-up truck after falling from her bike on a mini-roundabout in Connah's Quay on 16 July 2016. Judge Rowlands said: ""Any accident which results in someone losing their life is the most appalling tragedy, the more so when the deceased, as here, was well-loved and, as I have indicated already, a pretty remarkable woman."" The court heard that in the minutes before Rosney hit Mrs Boardman, who had fallen from her bike on the junction of Mold Road and Ffordd Llanarth, he made or received three phone calls while driving his vehicle, which did not have a hands-free facility. Matthew Curtis, prosecuting, said: ""It's clear he was speaking to his wife on the telephone four seconds before the fatal collision and he was, we submit, still distracted by the telephone call and mobile telephone handset."" Oliver Jarvis, defending, said Rosney did not ""want to make any excuses for his behaviour"" and realised he had ""destroyed the lives"" of Mrs Boardman's family. Cyclist Chris Boardman's mother dies after bike collision Chris Boardman said: ""My dad has lost his partner of 50 years which has just been absolutely gutting."" Looking at the devastating impact the incident has had on his family, he questioned the nature of the charge. ""We don't treat crime committed in cars as serious crime, so somebody can be careless and crush somebody else to death and it's classed as careless,"" he said. While he said he did not want to see lots of people go to prison, he wanted to see the ability to do harm taken away. Boardman called for a review of the law, saying people do ""the easiest thing"" when driving [such as using their phones] and ""react to the consequences"", adding: ""If the consequence is minimal then where is the reason to change behaviour?"" Liam and Victoria Rosney were cleared of attempting to pervert the course of justice Rosney and his wife Victoria were cleared of attempting to pervert the course of justice in July. Mrs Boardman had been a competitive cyclist in her youth and had remained active in cycling until her death.

Obscene porn rules relaxed in England,"Guidelines about what constitutes ""obscene"" pornography have been relaxed in England and Wales. The Crown Prosecution Service had previously listed torture and bondage, among other acts, as obscene. Distributing that type of pornography either on or offline could therefore have led to a prosecution. But the CPS has now removed the list and replaced it with series of ""tests"" that determine whether an image or video is classed as obscene. Owning or distributing an ""obscene"" video is an offence under the Obscene Publications Act. Some of the acts previously listed by the CPS were legal to perform with a consenting adult, but were illegal to depict in photos or videos. ""Distributing"" obscene material can simply mean sending a video via private message and it can be punished with time in prison. While the definition of obscene is likely to mean more than just ""shocking"" or ""disgusting"", it is open to interpretation. For that reason, the CPS previously offered guidance that described the sort of content that could lead to a prosecution. The list included clearly illegal acts, such as having sex with an animal (bestiality). However, it also listed practices that others argued were not harmful among consenting adults, such as: sadomasochism torture with instruments bondage activities involving ""perversion"", such as urinating or defecating on to the body Now, the CPS has removed all the specific examples from its guidance. ""It is not for the CPS to decide what is considered good taste or objectionable,"" it said in a statement. Instead of a list of forbidden acts, thenew guidance,externalsays owning or producing pornographic material is unlikely to be prosecuted if: it features consenting adults, where the provision of consent is made clear where consent may not be easily determined from the material itself no serious harm is caused, whether physical or otherwise it is not otherwise linked with other criminality the likely audience is not under 18 The CPS said it would ""continue to robustly apply the law to anything which crosses the line into criminal conduct and serious harm"". Lawyer Myles Jackman, who fought for the change, told BBC News: ""I have campaigned for this important change to the English criminal law, which has a profound impact for free speech and privacy... for over 10 years."" Since 2014 and the introduction of the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations, professional pornography sold online and in licensed adult stores falls under the R18 rating given by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). The BBFC's guidelines forbid ""material judged to be obscene under the current interpretation of the Obscene Publications Act"". A spokeswoman told the BBC: ""Because the Obscene Publications Act does not define what types of material are likely to be considered obscene, we rely upon guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as to what classes of material they consider likely to be suitable for prosecution. ""We are aware that the CPS have updated their guidance on Obscene Publications today and we have now adjusted our own internal policies to reflect that revised guidance.""

"Girl, 12, was 'hooked' on self-harm imagesLibby says she was sucked into an online community sharing disturbing pictures of cuts and burns.UK","This video can not be played Libby used to post images of her self-harm injuries on Instagram At the age of 12, Libby, became ""hooked"" on posting and viewing self-harm images on Instagram - including pictures of cutting, burning and overdosing. Her father, Ian, says his family reported such images to Instagram, but the social media company did nothing. Speaking to the BBC, Libby, now 16, recalls sharing pictures of her fresh cuts with 8,000 followers. She described how she was drawn in to an online community centred around self-harm photos. ""You start becoming a part of it - you get almost stuck to it,"" she says. ""I was very hooked on it. ""It was almost like you had to keep up with it otherwise people would turn away and stop caring."" She says the three main images were cutting, burning and overdosing. She says while Instagram didn't make her self-harm, the images she saw on the site ""accelerated the severity"" of the cuts. ""I'd see people and then my brain would go: 'That's OK.  It doesn't matter how bad it gets because they're not dead, it hasn't killed them yet,'"" she says. ""It made it safe to do it worse."" UK 'could ban' social media over suicide images Facebook 'sorry' for distressing suicide posts Regulate social media, MPs urge Libby's dad Ian was shocked by some of the images he saw: ""It ranged from scratching, right through to Stanley knives and scalpels. ""I'm an ex-military man. I didn't see stuff like that when I was in the army."" If youâve been affected byself-harm,eating disordersoremotional distress, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line. It wasn't just the pictures that were shocking but also the comments underneath giving advice on how to self-harm. Ian remembers posters saying: ""You shouldn't have done it this way, you should have done it like that. Don't do it here, do it there because there's more blood."" ""That is not someone trying to help you - that is someone getting off on it,"" he says. For Ian and his family, the pressure of trying to keep his daughter safe was unimaginable. ""I honestly don't know how we did get through it,"" he says. ""You will never understand the stress. ""We were living in a dazed world while all this was happening. ""You couldn't leave her on her own. So we were just working round each other: 'You've got to go to work. I've got to go to work. Who's going to look after Libby?'"" The family say they attempted to report the images to Instagram but received a response that the pictures did not breach their community standards. ""They don't like to be contacted. They make it very difficult, or they did back then,"" Ian says. ""If you've got an issue and you want to speak to someone, there's nothing. ""Parents can do everything they want to try to prevent kids going on Instagram but where there's a will there's a way. ""Until one of their close family members fall down that rabbit hole they won't do anything about it. ""Until it affects them or their wallet, they are not interested. ""Instagram needs to put its hand up and say we've created a monster we cannot control."" Libby has now stopped harming and is getting good professional help. She is hoping to become a paramedic or mental health nurse. However, her father says that unless Instagram acts ""there are going to be more Libbys and more Mollys out there"". This video can not be played After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account Molly Russell was 14 when she took her own life in 2017 after viewing disturbing content about suicide on social media. Molly's father, Ian, told the BBChe believed Instagram helped kill his daughter. In the days after the BBC reported on Molly's death, youth suicide prevention charity Papyrus say it saw a ""spike"" in calls to its UK helpline from families reporting similar stories. Instagram said its thoughts were with Molly's family and those affected by suicide or self-harm. They said they have deployed engineers to start making changes to make it harder for people to search for and find self-harm content. The company, which is owned by Facebook, acknowledged it had a ""deep responsibility"" to ensuring the safety of young people on the platform and had started a review of its policies around suicide and self-injury content. The company also said it would Start to make it harder for people to search for and find self-harm content Restrict the ability of users to find the content through hashtags Introduce sensitivity screens over self-harm content Stop recommending accounts that post self-harm content It says anybody can report content or accounts that they believe to be against the community guidelines. Families can ask the company to remove accounts if the user is physically or mentally incapacitated. They can also report accounts belonging to a child under the age of 13. The company says it does not usually close accounts because a parent has requested it, arguing that parents are in the best position to monitor and advise teenagers on responsible social media use. It says Instagram has a responsibility to users and believes young people should be able to express themselves and find communities of support such as LGBT groups. This video can not be played Facebook, which owns Instagram, says it is ""deeply upset"" by the death of Molly Russell New Facebook vice-president Sir Nick Clegg saidthe company would do ""whatever it takes"" to make the platform safer for young people. He also added that experts had said not all related content should be banned as it provided a way for people to get help. ""I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but they do say that in some instances it's better to keep some of the distressing images up if that helps people make a cry for help and then get the support they need,"" he said. By BBC correspondent Angus Crawford At the heart of problem is an algorithm. Or really a series of algorithms. Complex instructions written into code. They underpin the mechanics of social media. Analysing everything you do on a platform - pinging you more of the content you like and adverts for things you never knew you wanted. Interest transforms into clicks, which translates into engagement and finally ""sales"" - with data being scraped all the time - that's the business model. But therein lies the problem. If you like pictures of puppies, you'll get more of them. If you seek out material on self-harm and suicide - the algorithm may push you further and further down that pathway. Add to that the scale of the operation - Instagram says it has one billion users. How do you effectively police that without driving your users away - consumers, especially teenagers, are picky, impatient and averse to anything that puts ""friction"" into their enjoyment.  Annoy your users and they'll leave for good. Finally there's verification - anyone who has a phone and an email can sign up for a social media account. And you can be totally anonymous - bad behaviour loves dark places. To be fair to Instagram it has started making changes - restricting hashtags, no more ""recommending"" of self-harm accounts. Soon they'll be blurring images of self-harm. But here's the dilemma for the tech companies - how do you tinker with an algorithm at the heart of your platform to make people safer, if those changes could undermine the very business model you are trying to protect? Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""horrified"" by Molly's death and feels ""desperately concerned to ensure young people are protected"". Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Hancock called on social media sites to ""purge"" material promoting self-harm and suicide. When asked if social media could be banned, Mr Hancock said: ""Ultimately parliament does have that sanction, yes"" but added ""it's not where I'd like to end up."" ""If we think they need to do things they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate,"" he said. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told MPs the government is ""considering very carefully"" calls to impose a legal duty of care on social media companies. He said there had been some activity by social media companies but not enough, adding that it would be ""wrong to assume that this House or this Government can sit back and allow the social media companies to do this voluntarily"". Labour's deputy leader and culture spokesman Tom Watson accused Facebook of being more focused on ""profiting from children"" rather than protecting them.

'Extra time' may be needed for Brexit,"This video can not be played The foreign secretary says Brexit may be delayed if a deal is reached near 29 March Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says ""extra time"" may be needed to finalise legislation for Brexit.

The PM is seeking ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop, but the EU says it will not renegotiate. Parliament's February break has been cancelled, which No 10 said showed all steps were being taken to avoid delay. The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 on 29 March. The backstop is an ""insurance"" policy to stop the return of checks on goods and people along the Northern Ireland border. Senior Tory 'could accept Brexit delay' EU rejects calls to reopen Brexit deal Brexit: What could happen next? How ready is UK government for a no-deal Brexit? Brexit: All you need to know Earlier this month, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said that the EU may be prepared to grant the UK a ""couple of extra weeks"" beyond the 29 March deadline to finalise preparations for Brexit. And BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there had been ""growing chatter"" about a potential delay and a potential extension to Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government ""has had two-and-a-half years to negotiate and has failed to do so"". But the prime minister's official spokesman said the government remained committed to leaving the EU on 29 March. ""The fact that recess won't be taking place shows you that we are taking all available steps to make sure that 29 March is our exit date,"" the spokesman said. Downing Street was also discussing the possibility of Parliament sitting for extra hours in the run up to Brexit, the spokesman said. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government was ""not talking about extensions"" to Brexit at the moment, saying the focus should be ""getting on with the job of completing the deal"". Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is true that if we ended up approving the deal in the days before the 29 March, then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation. ""But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary. We can't know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen."" Please upgrade your browser Theresa May has been talking to a variety of MPs and EU leaders, including President of the European Council Donald Tusk and the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, after MPs voted on Tuesday for her to make changes to the backstop. Mr Hunt said it was a ""challenging situation"" and the government was ""not ruling out"" any  potential solutions to the Irish border issue. He said the commitment to the Good Friday Agreement - which protects against the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - would need to be demonstrated. The EU's concerns that the UK could ""access the single market by the back door"" would also need to be alleviated, he said. ""If we can overcome those two issues, which I think we can, then we will be able to have substantive discussions,"" he said. May scores 'unconventional win' Firms 'speeding up no-deal Brexit plans' Brexit: A really simple guide The backstop was one of the main reasons Mrs May's Brexit deal was voted down in Parliament by a record margin earlier in January because critics say a different status for Northern Ireland could threaten the existence of the UK and fear that the backstop could become permanent. Alternatives to the backstop that the prime minister has said she wants to discuss with EU leaders include: a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU ""technological"" solutions She also wants to discuss a time limit on the backstop and a ""unilateral exit"" mechanism - both options ruled out by the EU in the past. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said on Wednesday that the Irish backstop was ""part and parcel"" of the UK's Brexit deal and would not be renegotiated. Several Conservative MPs have been spotted going to meetings in Downing Street, including former Brexit minister Steve Baker, Iain Duncan Smith, Mrs May's close ally Damian Green and Nicky Morgan. Ms Morgan, a former education secretary, said she was there to discuss a plan known as the ""Malthouse Compromise"". Engineered by both Leavers and Remainers, the proposal includes extending the transition period for a year and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. Union officials have also been meeting with government officials in the Cabinet Office to discuss Mrs May's Brexit plan. A Trades Union Congress spokesman said the prime minister's deal came ""nowhere close"" to offering the safeguards desired for working people. ""The strongest possible protection for workers' rights would come from sticking by single market and customs union rules,"" he said. Labour MP John Mann was among those meeting the prime minister When asked abouta Times article that said Mrs May was preparing to entice Labour MPs,externalto vote for her deal with money for constituencies, Labour MP John Mann said a group of 10 met the prime minister two weeks ago. Mr Mann, who was also spotted in Downing Street on Thursday, told the BBC the group asked for ""a significant amount of money"" for poorer areas, ""so that we can actually move forward as we leave the EU"". But he said he had voted for the deal already, ""so I can't be bribed"". ""There's no expectation, this isn't transactional politics. We're asking for money for areas that have not had their fair share in the past,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mrs Leadsom told MPs that ""in light of the significant decisions taken by the House this week"" she was giving the House notice that ""there are currently no plans to bring forward a motion to agree dates for the February recess"". Parliament had been due to rise for recess on Thursday, 14 February and return on Monday, 25 February. Mrs Leadsom said she realised it was short notice, but said their constituents ""would expect that the House is able to continue to make progress at this important time"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of running down the clock on Brexit. He said: ""We delayed the parliamentary vote from 11 December until January - and then lost by the biggest majority ever against a government. ""Now we're going back to Brussels but we are very unclear about what we're going back to Brussels to do and when I asked the prime minister about this yesterday, she was incredibly vague. ""It is possible that there will have to be an extension in order to get an agreement because we cannot leave the EU on March 29 without an agreement. Crashing out would mean problems of transport, problems of medicine supply, problems of supply to the food processing industry that does just in time deliveries - and that simply is not acceptable.

Threatened shark served to UK diners,"Spiny dogfish shark landed in Indonesia Meat from endangered sharks is finding its way on to the British menu, according to a study. DNA tests show that shark products destined for restaurants include two species vulnerable to extinction. Consumers may be unaware what shark they are eating - and whether it is from a sustainable population, British scientists say. The UK is playing a continuing role in the ""damaging trade in endangered shark species"", they say. One of the two threatened sharks identified - the scalloped hammerhead - is subject to international restrictions. University of Exeter researchers say, despite the small number of samples studied, they have demonstrated the sale of threatened sharks, highlighting the global nature of the damaging trade in endangered species. ""The discovery of scalloped hammerheads in shark fins that were destined to be sold in the UK highlights how widespread the sale of these endangered species really is,"" Dr Andrew Griffiths told BBC News. Shark fins: The species is indistinguishable The research, reported in the journalScientific Reports,external, examined both shark fins destined for restaurants and shark steaks sold in fishmongers and chip shops. It found thatSqualus acanthias (spiny dogfish),external, a small shark classed vulnerable to extinction, globally - and, for one population in the north-east Atlantic, endangered, was the main shark being sold at chip shops, under the generic name huss, rock, rock salmon or rock eel. The shark was probably imported from areas where stocks are sustainable, and generic names are permitted - but the scientists say it is difficult for customers to tell exactly what type of shark they are eating and where it comes from. ""It's almost impossible for consumers to know what they are buying,"" said Catherine Hobbs, also of the University of Exeter. ""People might think they're getting a sustainably sourced product when they're actually buying a threatened species."" The scalloped hammerhead shark was identified among 10 shark fins imported for the UK restaurant trade. The fins are often used to make soup, a celebratory dish in some Asian cuisines. Once shark meat is processed, it is difficult to tell which species it comes from. Therefore, the scientists carried out DNA tests to see what was entering the human food chain. They gathered more than 100 samples from chip shops and supermarkets in southern England. They also looked at dried shark fins imported into the UK. A type of DNA analysis, known as DNA bar-coding, gave an insight into the shark species on sale. A fragment of DNA can be matched with an online database known as the bar-code of life to identify the animal. Of the 78 samples on sale at chips shops in 2016 and 2017, about 90% came from the spiny dogfish. Landing this shark is generally not permitted under EU rules, although that on sale was probably sourced from more sustainable stocks elsewhere, then imported and frozen, the scientists say. The spiny dogfish is at threat due to overfishing Of the 39 fresh and frozen samples obtained from fishmongers, about half were assigned toMustelus asterias (starry smooth hound),external, a type of hound-shark. This shark is judged of least concern in terms of extinction risk. TheSphyrna lewini (scalloped hammerhead),externalwas found in three of 10 dried shark fins on sale in the UK. These may have been imported and stored before international restrictions came into force in 2014. This shark, which is not found in UK waters, is targeted for its fins and is in decline. Commenting on the study, Simon Walmsley, Chief Marine Adviser at WWF said: ""Endangered shark species shouldn't be ending up on people's plates as their weekend takeaway, particularly the spiny dogfish which is vulnerable and threatened with extinction."" Shark meat is eaten across the world and has been part of the human diet for centuries. But between 2000 and 2011, global imports of sharks, skates, rays and other cartilaginous fishes rose by 42%, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The international trade in 12 species is regulated because of concern over extinction risks. But there is debate among scientists over which - if any - sharks can be regarded as sustainable and harvested for food. ""Sharks are inherently more vulnerable to overfishing because they don't produce many eggs and they take a long time to reach maturity - to be able to produce offspring,"" said Dr Griffiths.

Prison assaults at record level,"Justice Secretary David Gauke said violence and self-harm in prisons is ""unacceptably high."" The number of assaults in prisons in England and Wales has reached a record high. There were 33,803 attacks by prisoners in the year to the end of September 2018 - 20% up on the previous year. The figures include a record 10,085 assaults on prison staff - up 29%. There were 92 self-inflicted deaths in 2018, up from 72 in 2017. The charity Prison Reform Trust described the figures as ""disturbing"". Prisoner sexual assaults treble since 2010 I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister Of the total number of assaults 3,949 (12%) were serious, up 6% from the previous year. The figures, published by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), also revealed there were: 325 deaths in prison custody in the 12 months to December 2018 - up 10% 24,138 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in the 12 months to September 2018 - up 18% Four killings in jail last year Many prisons in England and Wales have seen surging levels of violence, drug use and self-harm in recent years. The government says it is spending an extra Â£70m, including recruiting 4,000 extra staff, to help boost security in prisons. Ministers plan to roll out synthetic pepper spray, known as Pava, to staff in publicly run prisons for men this year, following trials. The MoJ has also announcedtraditional prison window bars are to be replacedwith toughened glass and air vents in new prisons to help prevent drugs being smuggled in. Justice Secretary David Gauke said he was ""optimistic"" the new measures could reduce violence. He said: ""Clearly there is huge amount yet to be done but I am determined to cut the violence so prisons can focus on rehabilitating the offenders who will be back out at some point."" Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons? Call to halt prison pepper spray plan Mark Day, head of policy at the Prison Reform Trust, said government plans were not working and warned Pava sprays could make ""a volatile situation even worse"". ""The measures the government have put in place to improve prison safety, including increasing staff numbers and the roll out of a new key worker model, have not yet succeeded in reversing this rising trend."" Prison staff union the Prison Officers' Association said the figures were shocking and showed no progress had yet been made. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Prisons minister Rory Stewart has put his job on the line Prisons ministerRory Stewart has promised to resignif there isn't a reduction in violence in 10 of the worst-affected jails by this summer. Mr Stewart made his pledge in August last year when a programme of investment began in those jails to provide them with extra staff, scanning equipment and training. A BBC analysis of the assaults data shows the huge scale of Mr Stewart's mission - and some early, tentative signs that it may be working. In the 12 months to the end of September 2017, there were 3,444 assaults in the 10 prisons. In the following 12 months, there were 4,366 assaults - an increase of 27%, which was above the average rise across all prisons of 20%. The largest increases were at: HMP Lindholme, South Yorkshire - assaults more than doubled from 244 to 577 Isis Prison, south-east London - they went up by more than two thirds HMP Humber - recorded a 60% rise Assaults fell in only one of the 10 prisons - Wormwood Scrubs in west London. However, comparing the first two months of the 10 Prisons Project - August and September 2018 - with the previous two months, there are some more positive signs. There were 800 assaults in the 10 prisons in June and July 2018. That number fell to 768 in August and September, a 4% reduction. Seven of the 10 prisons recorded a drop in assaults. It is far too early to draw firm conclusions from the data, but it does give Mr Stewart some grounds for optimism that his job may be safe - though there's a long way to go. The 10 prisons are: Hull, Humber, Isis, Leeds, Lindholme, Moorland, Nottingham, Ranby, Wealstun, Wormwood Scrubs Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons?

Legal blow for Asda in equal pay caseA court ruling means lower paid shop staff can compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers.Business,"Supermarket giant Asda has lost an appeal in the latest development in a long-running legal dispute with staff over equal pay. The decision means that lower paid shop staff, who are mostly women, can compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers, who are mostly men. Asda said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision and added it remained confident in its case. A ruling over whether the work is of equal value is likely to be in May. Leigh Day, which represented the staff, said the judgement was a ""major step forward in the fair pay battle"". Asda said: ""We are obviously disappointed with the decision, which relates to a preliminary issue of whether jobs in different parts of the business can be compared."" It said it had brought the appeal ""because it involved complex legal issues which have never been fully tested in the private sector and we will continue to ensure this case is given the legal scrutiny it deserves"". What is the gender pay gap? What is the gender pay gap at your firm? The Employment Tribunal first ruled against Asda in October 2016. It said shop workers, who mainly work at check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves with staff who work at warehouses. Asda then appealed against this decision on 10 different grounds. In August 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled all points of their appeal unsuccessful. Asda then took its case to the Court of Appeal. Following Thursday's ruling, the Court of Appeal denied Asda the right to appeal. However, the BBC understands the supermarket chain intends to apply to the Supreme Court to appeal against the ruling there. There are three key stages in an equal pay case Are the jobs comparable? If the jobs are comparable, are they of equal value? If they are of equal value, is there a reason why the roles should not be paid equally? Leigh Day represents more 30,000 shop floor staff from the big four supermarkets - Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons - in similar cases. The legal firm said if the four supermarkets lost their cases and were ordered to pay all eligible staff, the cost could be more than Â£8bn. However, that would only be if all 500,000 store workers made a claim. The GMB union, which represents some Asda workers, welcomed what it described as Thursday's ""landmark"" judgment.

Italy in recession amid sluggish eurozone,"The economy is a problem for Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Italy's economy tipped into recession at the end of last year, according to latest figures. In the final three months of 2018, the economy shrank by 0.2%, following a 0.1% decline in the third quarter, the Istat statistics office said. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the contraction was likely to continue into 2019. Meanwhile, figures from the EU showed economic growth in the 19-country eurozone still languishing. Growth in the euro area remained at 0.2% in the final quarter of 2018, the same as the previous quarter and in line with analysts' expectations. The figures,issued by the Eurostat agency,external, showed that in the 28-nation EU as a whole, fourth-quarter growth was 0.3%. In contrast to Italy, some other eurozone economies expanded more than expected, with France and Spain posting growth rates of 0.3% and 0.7% quarter-on-quarter respectively. Italy's statistics office said agriculture, forestry, fishing and industry had all contributed to the economic downturn, while a rise in net exports failed to offset those declines. Italy's coalition government was forced to reviseits expansionary 2019 budgetlast month after the European Commission raised concerns about the impact on the country's debt levels. The renewed recession in Italy aggravates the problem the government has with its finances. The ruling parties' desire to increase spending to meet election campaign commitments led to a stand-off with the European Commission which argued Italy was going to be borrowing too much.  Rome pared back its plans and the dispute was resolved. But the fact that the economy has turned out to be even weaker is bad news for the government finances. Tax revenue will be hit and that will tend to lead to a bigger financial hole to be filled by borrowing. Italy's problem is its accumulated debt, which is on one measure the largest in the eurozone. It would be a huge problem for the rest of the eurozone if Italy were to suffer the kind of debt crisis that Greece and others experienced a few years ago. That is not a near-term prospect, but Italy's persistently weak economic performance makes it very hard to banish that risk conclusively. Italy has the biggest government debt in the EU at more than â¬2.3 trillion ($2.6tn; Â£2tn). It is also the fourth-largest government debt in the world. The country's debt burden as a percentage of annual economic activity is second only to Greece in the EU at 132%. Last week, European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi saideurozone economic data had been weaker than expectedand the risks to growth had increased. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the overall eurozone figures ""don't look pretty, but have been well telegraphed by the hard data and the financial market horror show in Q4"". ""Indeed, it seems to us that markets will be inclined to look at these headline [figures] as good news. They indicate that things probably won't get much worse in the near term - this is a bold assumption, given poor January survey data - and that the ECB will keep rates low for a long time.""

How ready is UK government for a no-deal Brexit?,"The government isn't ready for the prospect of the UK leaving the EU with no deal in two months' time, according to areport from the Institute for Government,external. There is a very significant risk that laws needed to replace those governing key aspects of the UK's relationship with the EU will not get passed within the next two months, the IFG said. The report concluded that the government would be unable to avoid serious disruption in most policy areas. The government has pointed out that, by the end of the 2019-20 tax year, it will have spent more than Â£4bn preparing for Brexit (although not all of that is on preparations for a no-deal scenario). It has also said it has about 10,000 civil servants working on Brexit, with another 5,000 to come. ""We will ensure our statute books are ready for exit day and are making good progress on passing primary legislation,"" a spokesperson from the Department for Exiting the European Union said. But IFG director Bronwen Maddox said: ""The UK is not ready for no deal. ""The disruption from no deal - simply from the lack of preparation - would be extremely damaging. ""It cannot be dismissed as a mere blip."" Brexit: Are we running out of parliamentary time? Brexit: What could happen next? MPs back May's bid to change Brexit deal Leaving the EU with no deal is the default position on 29 March unless a withdrawal agreement can be approved in Parliament in the next few weeks. The only other options are to extend the Article 50 negotiating process to buy more time, or to withdraw the Article 50 notification altogether, which would mean Brexit wouldn't happen. So - with two months to go - what does the government still need to do to prepare for a no-deal scenario? Well, first of all, it needs to replace laws that will disappear overnight if there is no withdrawal agreement with the EU and no transition period after Brexit. But the IFG says five big bills in Parliament - on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration and financial services - face major challenges. Some of them have yet to start their passage through the House of Lords, where the government does not control parliamentary time. And the government's fragile majority in the House of Commons makes things worse. The prospects for passing another law that will be needed in the event of no deal - on international health care arrangements - are described as uncertain. The government is also behind schedule on passing secondary legislation - important technical changes known as statutory instruments (SIs). Only about 100 of 600 SIs required for a no-deal Brexit have been approved and nearly half of that total haven't yet been tabled in Parliament. An even bigger risk, the IFG says, is that new processes, systems and staff would have to be in place by the end of March to avoid disruption - and, in many cases, they won't be. Time is running out. In eight out of 11 broad policy areas - including borders, health, and law and justice, the IFG report says the government would be unable to avoid some ""major negative impacts"". Part of the problem is that businesses and citizens also need to be ready. They would normally be given years to prepare for these kind of sweeping changes but the government only started releasing technical notices about a no-deal scenario in August 2018. Businesses also haven't been told yet what kind of tariff regime (the taxes on goods coming into the country) will operate after Brexit, while surveys suggest small businesses simply haven't had the time or the resources to prepare properly for a no-deal scenario. There could be long delays at Dover Many of the problems, the IFG says, are down to the ""sheer scale and complexity"" of the task. But the government is also criticised in this report for excessive secrecy in the way it has made preparations. It has been ""unwilling to talk publicly about its plans"", the IFG says, and has developed an ""adversarial relationship with Parliament"". The Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) says, ""The government has conducted extensive planning and preparation for the past two years to ensure the country is ready for a range of scenarios. ""In addition to extensive guidance online and a publicity campaign, this includes the publication of 106 technical notices, which help businesses and citizens prepare for the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal."" Prime Minister Theresa May still hopes, of course, that a deal can be done in the next few weeks and that Brexit on 29 March will be followed by a transition period of at least 21 months, when all the rules and regulations would stay the same. And if a withdrawal agreement is ratified, and a transition period begins, the only legislation that would need to be passed before Brexit day would be a bill turning that agreement into UK law. Even time to do that, though, is running short. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

MP's speeding driver lie jail term reviewed,"The Old Bailey was told Fiona Onasanya had been texting on her phone when she was spotted speeding, in July 2017 An MP's jail term for lying to police over a speeding ticket is being reviewed after a complaint it was unduly lenient. Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya had denied being behind the wheel when her car was spotted being driven at 41mph in a 30mph zone, in July 2017. She was convicted at the Old Bailey of perverting the course of justice and jailed for three months on Tuesday. The Attorney General's Office confirmed it was reviewing the case. Onasanya - who has said she intends to appeal against her conviction - is the first sitting MP to be jailed since Terry Fields was sentenced to 60 days for failing to pay his Â£373 poll tax bill in 1991. She was thrown out of the Labour Party when she was convicted in December. The MP's Nissan Micra was caught by a speed camera in Thorney A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said: ""We have received a request for the case of Fiona Onasanya to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence scheme."" ""The Law Officers have 28 days from sentencing to consider the case."" If deemed unduly lenient, the case will be referred to the Court of Appeal which will decide whether or not to increase the sentence. Anyone can make a request to the Attorney General's Office, and only one request is required for a sentence to be reviewed. MP jailed over speeding driver lie Fiona Onasanya 'was passenger' in speeding car MP speeding case 'became about lying' Onasanya was elected as Labour MP for Peterborough in June 2017, six weeks before committing the offence, in Thorney, Cambridgeshire. Her brother Festus was jailed for 10 months for his involvement, after pleading guilty to the same charge. After Festus falsely filled out her Notice of Intended Prosecution, Onasanya made the ""disastrous decision"" to keep up the lie from November 2017, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said when sentencing her. The prosecution told the court she went on to collude with her brother to avoid being subject to the speeding ticket. Festus Onasanya was jailed for 10 months after admitting perverting the course of justice When Onasanya was elected, she ousted Conservative Stewart Jackson who had held the seat for 12 years. Under parliamentary rules, a sentence of 12 months or more would have seen the MP automatically lose her seat. A Recall Petition - which can force a by-election if signed by more than 10 per cent of the Peterborough electorate - cannot be opened until the appeal process is complete.

Legal blow for Asda in equal pay case,"Supermarket giant Asda has lost an appeal in the latest development in a long-running legal dispute with staff over equal pay. The decision means that lower paid shop staff, who are mostly women, can compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers, who are mostly men. Asda said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision and added it remained confident in its case. A ruling over whether the work is of equal value is likely to be in May. Leigh Day, which represented the staff, said the judgement was a ""major step forward in the fair pay battle"". Asda said: ""We are obviously disappointed with the decision, which relates to a preliminary issue of whether jobs in different parts of the business can be compared."" It said it had brought the appeal ""because it involved complex legal issues which have never been fully tested in the private sector and we will continue to ensure this case is given the legal scrutiny it deserves"". What is the gender pay gap? What is the gender pay gap at your firm? The Employment Tribunal first ruled against Asda in October 2016. It said shop workers, who mainly work at check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves with staff who work at warehouses. Asda then appealed against this decision on 10 different grounds. In August 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled all points of their appeal unsuccessful. Asda then took its case to the Court of Appeal. Following Thursday's ruling, the Court of Appeal denied Asda the right to appeal. However, the BBC understands the supermarket chain intends to apply to the Supreme Court to appeal against the ruling there. There are three key stages in an equal pay case Are the jobs comparable? If the jobs are comparable, are they of equal value? If they are of equal value, is there a reason why the roles should not be paid equally? Leigh Day represents more 30,000 shop floor staff from the big four supermarkets - Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons - in similar cases. The legal firm said if the four supermarkets lost their cases and were ordered to pay all eligible staff, the cost could be more than Â£8bn. However, that would only be if all 500,000 store workers made a claim. The GMB union, which represents some Asda workers, welcomed what it described as Thursday's ""landmark"" judgment. General secretary Tim Roache, said: ""We know we're not all the way there, there are more hurdles to jump in this process and as always we remain ready to negotiate should Asda want to get round the table."" Asda said: ""Our hourly rates of pay in stores are the same for female and male colleagues and this is equally true in our depots.

Two admit posting 'Bulger killer photos',"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger Two people posted photos on social media they said identified James Bulger killer Jon Venables, a court heard. At the High Court, Richard McKeag, 28, and Natalie Barker, 36, admitted eight contempt of court offences. Venables and Robert Thompson were convicted of murdering James in 1993, but there is aglobal banon publishing anything revealing their identities. McKeag and Barker were given suspended prison sentences. Lord Chief Justice Burnett said that, were it not for their personal circumstances, they would have been sent to prison immediately for ""serious"" breaches of the injunction protecting Venables' identity. The judge told the court there was a risk of someone being ""killed or seriously injured"", including anyone who was wrongly identified as one of James Bulger's killers. He said the ""haunting images"" of the two year old being led to his death by Venables and Thompson, would ""remain forever in the minds of anyone who saw them"". The pair also admitted seeking information about Thompson. The court heard McKeag admitted three breaches after posting an article on his website entitled ""Jon Venables Pictured - Killer's Identity Revealed"", in November 2017. The article contained photographs, said to be of Venables, and purported to reveal his new identity and place of work. Mr Justice Warby said McKeag's offences were ""planned and deliberate"". He wanted to ""defeat the legal system by mass publication and was well aware of the risks he faced,"" he said. McKeag, who was given a 12-month suspended sentence, could not attend court after being admitted to hospital on Wednesday. Through his counsel Keir Monteith, he said: ""I hold my hands up for having a total disregard for the law. It is not up to me to serve justice that must be left to the courts."" James Bulger's body was found on a railway line, two days after he was abducted by Thompson and Venables In February and March 2018, Barker posted a picture on her Twitter account, which had 649 followers, purporting to be of Venables and his fiancÃ©. The image was retweeted 24 times and received a number of likes, and she persisted even after receiving warnings from Twitter and the police. Barker's conduct was ""impulsive and stupid"", Lord Burnett said as she was given an eight-month suspended sentence. Her lawyers said she now understood the seriousness of her actions, had expressed remorse and has closed her Twitter account. The court heard one man mistaken for Venables said he and his family had ""endured five years of danger"". Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC, who instigated the contempt proceedings said after the hearing: ""The injunction protects the identities of the offenders, but also innocent individuals who may be wrongly identified as being one of the two men and placed in danger as a result. ""Posting this material online is a crime."" Actress faces Bulger killer contempt case Bulger killer 'had better life in prison' Bulger killer jailed for indecent images Actress Tina Malone is facing contempt of court proceedings over a post she made on social media which purports to show images of Venables. The Attorney General's Office confirmed last week it had sent a summons to Ms Malone, who appeared in Shameless on Channel 4. Venables and Thompson were 10 when they tortured and killed James after abducting the two-year-old from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993. In November that year, they became theyoungest children ever to be convictedof murder in England. McKeag and Barker also admitted seeking information about Robert Thompson, who was also convicted for James Bulger's murder Venables and Thompson have been living under new identities since they were released in 2001 under licence. This means they can be recalled at any time. Venables was jailed in 2010 for having child abuse images on his computer. He was alsoimprisoned in 2018 for the same offence.

Prison assaults hit record levels,"Justice Secretary David Gauke said violence and self-harm in prisons is ""unacceptably high."" The number of assaults in prisons in England and Wales has reached a record high. There were 33,803 attacks by prisoners in the year to the end of September 2018 - 20% up on the previous year. The figures include a record 10,085 assaults on prison staff - up 29%. There were 92 self-inflicted deaths in 2018, up from 72 in 2017. The charity Prison Reform Trust described the figures as ""disturbing"". Prisoner sexual assaults treble since 2010 I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister Of the total number of assaults 3,949 (12%) were serious, up 6% from the previous year. The figures, published by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), also revealed there were: 325 deaths in prison custody in the 12 months to December 2018 - up 10% 24,138 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in the 12 months to September 2018 - up 18% Four killings in jail last year Many prisons in England and Wales have seen surging levels of violence, drug use and self-harm in recent years. The government says it is spending an extra Â£70m, including recruiting 4,000 extra staff, to help boost security in prisons. Ministers plan to roll out synthetic pepper spray, known as Pava, to staff in publicly run prisons for men this year, following trials. The MoJ has also announcedtraditional prison window bars are to be replacedwith toughened glass and air vents in new prisons to help prevent drugs being smuggled in. Justice Secretary David Gauke said he was ""optimistic"" the new measures could reduce violence. He said: ""Clearly there is huge amount yet to be done but I am determined to cut the violence so prisons can focus on rehabilitating the offenders who will be back out at some point."" Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons? Call to halt prison pepper spray plan Mark Day, head of policy at the Prison Reform Trust, said government plans were not working and warned Pava sprays could make ""a volatile situation even worse"". ""The measures the government have put in place to improve prison safety, including increasing staff numbers and the roll out of a new key worker model, have not yet succeeded in reversing this rising trend."" Prison staff union the Prison Officers' Association said the figures were shocking and showed no progress had yet been made. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Prisons minister Rory Stewart has put his job on the line Prisons ministerRory Stewart has promised to resignif there isn't a reduction in violence in 10 of the worst-affected jails by this summer. Mr Stewart made his pledge in August last year when a programme of investment began in those jails to provide them with extra staff, scanning equipment and training. A BBC analysis of the assaults data shows the huge scale of Mr Stewart's mission - and some early, tentative signs that it may be working. In the 12 months to the end of September 2017, there were 3,444 assaults in the 10 prisons. In the following 12 months, there were 4,366 assaults - an increase of 27%, which was above the average rise across all prisons of 20%. The largest increases were at: HMP Lindholme, South Yorkshire - assaults more than doubled from 244 to 577 Isis Prison, south-east London - they went up by more than two thirds HMP Humber - recorded a 60% rise Assaults fell in only one of the 10 prisons - Wormwood Scrubs in west London. However, comparing the first two months of the 10 Prisons Project - August and September 2018 - with the previous two months, there are some more positive signs. There were 800 assaults in the 10 prisons in June and July 2018. That number fell to 768 in August and September, a 4% reduction. Seven of the 10 prisons recorded a drop in assaults.

The dark story of Hooligan X," It was called the Second Summer of Love. It’s 1989. A new genre of music is sweeping through nightclubs across Britain. It’s reached the gritty, northern English town of Middlesbrough. The Havana nightclub is packed and bouncing. The synthesised beat produced by the Roland TB-303 Bass Line machine is vibrating through the walls. Clubbers are dazzled and blinded by strobe lights, disco balls and smoke machines. The Havana is like a furnace. Condensation is dripping from the ceiling; sweat is pouring down the clubbers’ faces. But they’re completely entranced by the music. The scene is inspired by house music, a genre of electronic dance music pioneered in the US city of Chicago in the early 1980s. But it’s also being fuelled by the appearance of a little white pill: ecstasy. It’s illegal. Over the years it’s been blamed for many deaths. Its use sparks a moral panic across Britain. Headlines appear in the newspapers warning about the evils of ecstasy. But many of the clubbers at the Havana don’t care. It’s their drug of choice, creating a feeling of euphoria that lasts for hours. Dancing beside the DJ box is MC Hooligan X.  Lee Harrison is a devilishly good-looking guy. It’s his job to whip up the crowd. He revels in it. He’s like a prince who has found his people. “You chill, I chill, on a pill. We all chill chill on a pill pill,” he raps into the microphone.

It’s his job to whip up the crowd. He revels in it. He’s like a prince who has found his people. “You chill, I chill, on a pill. We all chill chill on a pill pill,” he raps into the microphone. The crowd lap it up like a collective communion. They respond with shrill blasts from their whistles. Their ears are ringing, but they can’t get enough of it. Even when the police or fire brigade raid the club. “Old Bill, Old Bill,” raps Hooligan X. It’s a coded warning. The drug dealers peddling ecstasy scurry into the shadows and stash their supplies. The fire exit pops open. There has always been a dark, sinister side to nightlife. “Everybody misses that time,” says one former regular at the club. “It was a feeling of being all loved up. But it became a very intimidating scene.” This was the dangerous world Lee Harrison moved in all his life. But it would catch up with him more than 25 years later. Lee Harrison was a face everyone knew around Middlesbrough. He was often seen bombing around town in his open-top convertible with the music blaring. “Lee would get where the wind doesn’t get but in a lovely cheeky way,” says his childhood friend, Alan Appleton. “He was a good-looking lad and could get any woman he wanted. You would see photographs of him with Mike Tyson and you would just snigger, ‘Yup, that’s the Lee we know’.” But for all Lee’s charm, there was a violent side to him. Someone who knew him said he pulled a gun on him during an argument. A friend recalls Lee spiking his drink with hallucinogenic drugs for a laugh. Lee Harrison and friend Lee Duffy, a former boxer, bouncer and gangster who was known as one of the most feared men on Teesside in the 80s Lee Harrison was born on 8 March 1966. He was of mixed race. His mother was of Burmese-Portuguese origin. His father, Tom Harrison, is by his own admission an “old villain” who has spent much of his life cycling in and out of jail – including, he says, a 30-month sentence for conspiracy to supply drugs from Pakistan in the early 80s. But more about drugs later. Lee grew up in the North Ormesby area of the town, which now has the enviable record of being one of the cheapest places to buy a house in the UK. During Lee’s childhood, it was a solid working-class neighbourhood where everybody knew everyone; where doors were left unlocked and children would play football or ride their bikes in the streets. Lee was an excellent junior boxer. He was known for his looks and didn’t like getting hit in the face. Being handy with his fists came in useful a few years later when he got involved in football hooliganism. The Middlesbrough Frontline followed their beloved team around the country, fighting pitched battles against rival fans. “We would get guys from all the nearby estates,” says Paul Slater, who was a member of the Frontline. “It wasn’t about the violence, it was about gaining respect for our hometown. Lee loved it. He loved the attention.” It was those bloody Saturday afternoons that inspired his MC name: Hooligan X. Lee left school with no qualifications and immediately started helping his dad out in the “copying game”. At one stage it was mainly counterfeit clothing. “We used to get bundles of gear, tracksuits and trainers - that was the fashion then - and sell it all over the north-east,” says Tom.  But they also had a sideline in fake Rolex watches and perfumes. “We’d get the bottles in Romania, the essence from France, and the boxes were made in Birmingham. It was all done professionally. It would cost you about two quid to make a bottle of Coco Chanel.” It was a life of crime that paid for flash clothes, fast cars and fancy foreign trips. But music was always Lee’s passion. “As a six-year-old when we were invited to weddings, he’d be on the dance floor,” says Tom. “He was unbelievable.” Lee’s love of music was inherited from his dad. Tom ran the doors at the Speakeasy, a nightclub that later became the Havana, and had a huge record collection. The pair listened to reggae, particularly Bob Marley. Lee spent summers working in Spanish resorts. He started by handing out flyers for nightclubs but graduated to working as a DJ. “People just wanted to dance their tits off all night,” says Alan, who accompanied Lee on one trip and was later to become a DJ at the Havana. “They were just lost in the music.” It was in places like Ibiza and Tenerife that many British clubbers first experimented with ecstasy – and later started taking it back to the UK. During his time in Spain, Lee mixed with DJs who were later to become some of the biggest names in the British club scene. In Middlesbrough, a local club owner put him in charge of entertainment at the Havana and later the Arena nightclub in the town. The 1990s proved to be boom times. The money was rolling in. But it all came to a shocking end for Lee in 2001. It’s been described as one of Middlesbrough’s most notorious murders. A 41-year-old market trader,Kalvant Singh, was found dead after falling from the window of a house in the town. But it soon became clear that it was no accident and he had been pushed out of the window. A local news website said that Mr Singh had “found himself in the middle of a so-called turf war concerning the supply, distribution and sale of drugs to prostitutes in Teesside and Middlesbrough”. Kalvant Singh Four men were wanted in connection with the murder. One of them was Lee. He went on the run to Scotland, South Africa, Amsterdam, and finally to Jamaica. His family used to take holidays on the island and had friends there. After a year, Lee was arrested and extradited back to the UK. In 2004, he received a nine-year jail sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and wounding. His father was also imprisoned for several years for trying to silence witnesses. Lee was freed from jail in 2009 and settled in Portsmouth. He was married to Tamara, whom he had met while on the run in Jamaica. He told friends that he was going to turn over a new leaf. He wanted to go straight. He found work as an electrical cable fitter. But things didn’t work out as he planned. In 2015, Lee’s marriage was falling apart. A few days before Christmas, he boarded a flight to Lebanon. He said he was going to spend the holiday with a Lebanese friend in the Bekaa Valley. It was a journey that ultimately cost him his life. Some 2,300 miles (3,700km) from Middlesbrough lies Lebanon’s magnificent Bekaa Valley. Running for 75 miles (121km), it’s flanked by snow-capped mountains on one side and war-torn Syria in the east. The Bekaa has long been known as the country’s breadbasket, famed for its Roman ruins and world-class wineries. But it’s also a wild frontier, a place where the police often fear to tread – there are thousands of outstanding arrest warrants. The Lebanese call them the Farreen - the fugitives. If you know the right people in the Bekaa you can get away with almost anything. Crime flourishes in this impoverished region. Smuggling over treacherous mountain paths is a rite of passage for many.  One of the valley’s towns is infamous for being a hub for stolen cars. But it’s what you find at the feet of Mount Lebanon’s slopes that brings us here – hectares and hectares of lush, green, cannabis plants, producing some of the finest resin in the world. Lee came to the Bekaa to stay at the home of a man called Adonis Al Masri, an inquest held in the UK after Lee’s death heard. Adonis has a brown, gingery beard. But if you looked closely you’d see it was covering scars. As a teenager in the 1980s, he was caught up in one of the bloody feuds that frequently erupt among the Bekaa’s sprawling families, which control the valley. Adonis was shot in the face. He’s had dozens of skin-graft operations to try to repair the damage done to his jaw. A relative says that the traumatic event warped his life – ever since he’s relied on drink and drugs to numb the pain and combat depression. They say he’s a volatile character prone to mood swings. Adonis and Lee knew each other from the UK. On one occasion, Adonis was introduced by Lee to his father - at a birthday party held at an Italian restaurant in London’s West End. Tom’s first impression was that Adonis “seemed all right”. It was a view shared by others.  But during the UK inquest, Lee’s half-brother, Gerald Copeman, was quoted as saying that Adonis claimed to have killed the man who had shot him in his face. Several friends also recall Adonis bragging of ties to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia organisation whose military wing is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK. Perhaps, most bizarrely of all, he boasted of having helped free the British hostage, Terry Waite, who was held in Lebanon during the civil war in the 1980s. One of Adonis’s relatives described this claim as complete fantasy. Whatever the truth, Adonis is from one of the most prominent and powerful families in the Bekaa Valley. His great grandfather, Mulhim Qasim Al Masri, was hailed as a courageous freedom fighter against Lebanon’s former Ottoman and French occupiers. Adonis’s grandfather, Nayef Al Masri, was a member of the Lebanese parliament from 1960 to 1972. Remember that name – we’ll be returning to him later. Adonis, himself, has political ties. He organised gatherings at his home for one of the main Lebanese political parties during the recent election. He posted pictures of himself on social media with top politicians. Anybody seeing those pictures would be left with the impression that Adonis is a man with powerful friends. Like almost everyone else in the Bekaa, Adonis had access to guns. It’s a way of life up in the valley.  During the UK inquest, Lee’s half-brother Andrew Harrison recalled a FaceTime call during which Lee showed him around what appeared to be the Al Masri family armoury. There were sub-machine guns and rocket launchers, according to Andrew. But as Lee walked out on to a balcony, Andrew was to get an even bigger surprise from what he saw earlier on the video call. “On the right-hand side there was a pile – I would estimate to be about five high and six feet wide – of brown-coloured powder that I recognised to be cannabis,” he was quoted as saying at the inquest. The court would hear that Lee was not in the Bekaa to celebrate Christmas after all. According to his family, he was in fact in Lebanon to do a drug deal. Four months later it would all go tragically wrong. Of all the illicit activity for which the Bekaa is renowned, nothing surpasses its drug production. The UN ranks Lebanon as the world’s third-largest producer of hashish - a psychoactive substance smoked or ingested, made from cannabis resin - after Morocco and Afghanistan. Lebanon is also a significant producer of fenethylline - an amphetamine-like pill better known as captagon - and a transit hub for cocaine and heroin. It’s hashish above all that’s made Lebanon’s name in the international drug world. In July 2018, the consulting firm McKinsey proposed legalising its cultivation and sale for medicinal use in order to invigorate Lebanon’s stagnant economy. The economy minister said it would amount to a billion-dollar industry, praising the quality of local produce as “one of the best in the world”. In the freewheeling late 60s, at the time of Woodstock, the Summer of Love, and radical counterculture, Lebanese hash was in vogue. “Pilgrims” would travel the “hippie trail” by minibus from Europe to Lebanon seeking enlightenment at the source, before journeying on to Afghanistan, India, and beyond. The Brotherhood of Eternal Love - a zany Californian group of surfers, stoners, and drug dealers dubbed the Hippie Mafia - was said by the US Drug Enforcement Administration to have imported almost two tonnes (or more than 4,000 lbs) of Lebanese hash to the US by the early 70s. Christina von Opel Other notable buyers included the car heiress Christina von Opel, arrested in St Tropez in 1977 with 1.6 tonnes of Lebanese hash, and the former Welsh smuggler and spy turned author Howard Marks, who arranged the transportation of hundreds of kilos of the drug using Lebanese diplomats, according to Jonathan Marshall in his book The Lebanese Connection: Corruption, Civil War, and the International Drug Traffic. Howard Marks The Lebanese civil war (1975-90) was a great boon to the industry, with the collapse of state authority and rise of rapacious militias with few scruples about making money by any means. The area of farmland used for hash cultivation grew to four times its pre-war size; estimated at 10,000 hectares (roughly 10,000 rugby pitches). Not just hash but heroin, too, began to be produced in large quantities, and the warlords who controlled the supply lines and seaports amassed vast fortunes. After the war, the heroin was mostly stamped out, and the hash farmland much reduced, though far from eradicated. The Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, a prominent force in the Bekaa, has been accused of involvement in the drugs trade in Lebanon and overseas. But the organisation has dismissed allegations that it’s involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. Recent years have seen the introduction of captagon, a stimulant reportedly consumed by fighters in the Syrian conflict, as well as recreational users in Gulf Arab states. Captagon was originally the name of a pharmaceutical drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. But it was banned in most countries during the 1980s because of its addictive properties. Now captagon is reportedly the most popular drug consumed in the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia.  While these deeply conservative Islamic states take a strict zero-tolerance approach towards all intoxicants, users appear to be drawn to captagon in the belief they're taking “medication”. A decade ago, captagon was produced in Bulgaria and other countries in south-east  Europe, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. But in recent years, production appears to have shifted to Lebanon and Syria. Experts believe the illegal trade to be worth hundreds of million dollars a year. In Lebanon itself, seizures of the drug have soared. In 2012, the authorities seized 79kg of captagon but by 2016 it had rocketed to 2,175kg. Amphetamine and captagon trafficking flows 2014-2015 (Source: UNODC) Throughout these decades, the illegality of the drug trade has been circumvented by official corruption, at times implicating figures in Lebanon’s highest offices. And members of the Al Masri clan have played their own part. Remember Adonis’s grandfather, Nayef Al Masri, the Lebanese MP? Well, in 1970, a plane was seized in Crete carrying more than half a tonne of hashish worth more than $1m at the time. According to the book The Secret War Against Dope by Andrew Tully, the plane had taken off from a freshly-constructed airstrip on Nayef’s estate in the Bekaa. It appears, then, that Adonis was no stranger to the world of drugs. A relative was quoted at Lee’s inquest as saying that the family owns a cannabis farm. As for Lee he was approaching 50 years old and felt he was running out of time to make his mark. He told Gerald that this deal was going to be the “big one”. In his own words, according to the inquest, it was “do or die”. Lee’s plan for Lebanon was straightforward enough. He would fly out there in late 2015 to oversee a drug deal with the help of his host, Adonis Al Masri, the inquest heard. But upon reaching the Bekaa Valley, Lee’s plan began to quickly unravel. The court heard details from friends and family about the strange things that began happening to him. In January 2016, he said he was abducted at gunpoint and interrogated for several hours by people with American accents. He believed they were working for the CIA. The following month, while applying for a routine extension to his tourist visa, he claimed his passport was taken by the Lebanese authorities on the grounds that he was wanted by Interpol. British police later ascertained he was never, in fact, wanted by the organisation. These bizarre developments, coupled with an imploding marriage back home, started taking their psychological toll. At the inquest, a friend who had been in regular contact with Lee, said that he “went downhill massively”. He lost weight, and would appear unkempt on video calls, at odds with his reputation for sharp dressing. A family member was quoted at the inquest as saying that Lee had told him that he’d had “a smoke on a few occasions”, and that he had taken that to be a reference to cannabis. The coroner speculated that if this were the case, it could have further fuelled Lee’s mood swings. “We cannot know,” she said. A member of the Al Masri family claimed that about a month before his death, Lee “had to be dragged down from a ladder after attempting to hang himself”, according to comments read out at the inquest. At other times, friends remember him rambling incoherently about being held by Isis and the Taliban. “He didn't sound like the same Lee I knew,” said one. Towards the end, the court was told, Lee grew convinced his hosts had turned on him, thinking that he was an undercover agent. “They're all whispering and talking about taking me away and having something done,” Andrew recalls him saying. In his final days, things escalated dramatically. Lee told another half-brother by text message on 15 April that his host “has had me done in over here”. “You need to get out ASAP,” his brother replied. The next day, Lee fled the house, stabbing a gardener in the process, only to be knocked down seconds later by a car in the street. Lee told his family that he had briefly gone to hospital. The court heard that after that reported incident, Lee was moved to the home of Shehade Habshi in the nearby village of Deir Al Ahmar. Habshi describes himself as a friend of the Al Masri family. Those back home who spoke to Lee at this time say he grew fixated with death, asking one friend to “look after his kids”, and telling his father Tom to have his body and blood checked in the event of his demise. In contrast, Shehade Habshi told the BBC that Lee was “happy” in his household, eating healthily and bonding with his hosts over food, even teaching them how to make fish soup. On 20 April 2016, Shehade says he went out to buy some honey at Lee’s request. When he came back, he found Lee hanging from his front door. The Lebanese authorities later declared it a suicide, though Lee’s father and half-brother, Gerald, insist to this day that he was murdered. Hundreds of mourners gathered at St John’s church in the heart of Middlesbrough to give Lee Harrison his final send-off on 20 May 2016. Pallbearers carried his coffin into the church to the sound of Natural Mystic by Bob Marley. The mourners heard about Lee’s devotion to his three children. Delivering the eulogy, a friend said Lee lived an “action-packed 50 years”. He added: “He was streetwise and had a special bond with his dad wheeling and dealing – that was the family trade.” Back in Lebanon, the authorities were investigating. A news report in the local Daily Star newspaper on the day Lee died said it was initially believed he had taken his own life. But it quoted doctors as saying that they didn’t believe he had killed himself. The BBC has seen the Lebanese police report into Lee’s death. The first medical examiner was inconclusive – he could not determine whether Lee had taken his own life or had been murdered. He told the BBC that he “was not happy” about the process but would not comment further. Two other medical examiners later concluded that Lee killed himself. A UK pathologist who examined Lee’s body agreed that it was likely he died from hanging. Adonis Al Masri was questioned by Lebanese police and denied having any business ties with Lee. The BBC repeatedly contacted the Lebanese businessman - who has no criminal record - for comment, but he didn't respond to the requests. In the UK, the inquest into Lee’s death returned an open verdict in December 2017. The coroner said: “There is no evidence Lee was unlawfully killed, but I can’t be certain he intended to take his own life.” She also said that it was the opinion of the British police that it was highly likely that Lee was involved in some “organised criminality” while in Lebanon. During the inquest, Gerald said in a statement: “Lee is a like a 10% man. He would introduce people to people, he told me this. I think Adonis did the introduction to the main supplier or cultivator, the main source.” So why did things end so badly? Well, the inquest heard that a relative of Adonis Al Masri had told British police that Adonis had in fact stolen £150,000 from Lee, causing the drug deal to collapse. The inquest also heard that Gerald believed that Lee was the “surety, the living surety, and because it never happened, they made an example of him”. The reality is we will probably never know exactly what happened in these final days. But Lee’s father is in little doubt. “I know my son and there’s no way he would take his own life,” says Tom. “He had too much to live for. He loved his children.” We still do not know for sure whether the drugs deal was for cannabis or captagon, or indeed something else. But in one of our last telephone calls, Tom told the BBC he believed the drug deal was for MDMA, or ecstasy. Lebanon is not known for producing that specific drug – although seizures of ecstasy are on the increase in the country. The shadowy world of illicit drugs is constantly evolving and throwing up surprises. Lee Harrison had travelled a long way from those early, euphoric nights at the Havana club. But in the end, it may have been ecstasy that killed Hooligan X. Built with Shorthand"
Pub bombings inquest to resume 45 years on,"Five people died in the blast at the Horse & Groom on 5 October 1974 The inquest into the deaths of five people killed in the 1974 Guildford pub bombings will be resumed. Four soldiers and a plasterer were killed and 65 others were injured when the IRA blew up two pubs in the Surrey town. The Guildford Four were wrongly convicted and jailed for 15 years, before being released in 1989. Coroner Richard Travers said: ""This case is not of such antiquity that it should be considered ancient history."" Handing down his decision at Woking Coroner's Court, Mr Travers said some witnesses had died which presented ""serious challenges"". But he said the clientele in the pubs were young at the time and would be now in their 60s and 70s. No date has yet been set for the inquest to resume and a pre-inquest review will be held at a later date. There is a memorial plaque to the five people killed in Guildford Soldiers Ann Hamilton, 19, Caroline Slater, 18, William Forsyth, 18, and John Hunter, 17, as well as plasterer Paul Craig, 21, died following the first blast at the Horse and Groom on 5 October 1974. Another bomb at a second pub also exploded but no-one died. Paul Hill, Gerry Conlon, Patrick Armstrong and Carole Richardson - known as the Guildford Four - were wrongly convicted of the attacks in what is considered one of Britain's biggest miscarriages of justice. In a statement following the coroner's ruling, Surrey Police said they had already begun cataloguing all material held in relation to the bombings, but that it would take up to a further 18 months to complete. Paddy Armstrong was wrongly convicted in 1975 The original inquest proceedings were suspended when the Guildford Four were convicted in 1975. Mr Travers said the attacks ""still matter"" to the people who died and the people of Guildford and added that ""the deceased, the families and the public are entitled to hear matters formally in open court"". What we know about the Guildford pub bombings Reporter 'threatened' over IRA bombings Guildford Four plea to pub bomb coroner The coroner said the hearing would seek to examine details such as the location and precise time of the blast, who was with the victims at the time, whether the victims died immediately and the response of the emergency services. But he said the resumed inquest would not have the scope to explore who was responsible for the bomb, the composition of the explosive device or any claims police lied during the trial of the Guildford Four. Gerry Conlon with his sisters after being released at the Old Bailey in 1989 KRW Law, who represent the family of Ms Hamilton and survivor Yvonne Tagg, made an application to resume the inquests afterthe BBC obtained papers about the case, and coroner's archives showed the original proceedings never concluded. Spokesman Christopher Stanley said he believed his clients would be ""happy"" at the outcome. ""This is the first and last opportunity for our clients to have a full investigation,"" he said. Richard O'Rawe, a childhood friend of Gerry Conlon, said he would have been delighted. He said Mr Conlon, who died in 2014, struggled to get justice all his life and now ""we will get to the truth"". Inquest proceedings opened in 1974 but never concluded A four-man IRA unit known as the ""Balcombe Street gang"" claimed responsibility for the attacks in 1976 but were not charged. Over the years it has been disputed how many members were in the unit - a court transcript suggested up to 20. Seven people, known as the Maguire Seven, were jailed on explosive charges over the attacks but they also had their convictions quashed.

America colonisation Ã¢ÂÂcooled climateÃ¢ÂÂ,"This video can not be played Mark Maslin and Chris Brierley: ""A genocide-generated drop in carbon dioxide"" Colonisation of the Americas at the end of the 15th Century killed so many people, it disturbed Earth's climate. That's the conclusion of scientists from University College London, UK. The team says the disruption that followed European settlement led to a huge swathe of abandoned agricultural land being reclaimed by fast-growing trees and other vegetation. This pulled down enough carbon dioxide (COâ) from the atmosphere to eventually chill the planet. It's a cooling period often referred to in the history books as the ""Little Ice Age"" - a time when winters in Europe would see the Thames in London regularly freeze over. ""The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas led to the abandonment of enough cleared land that the resulting terrestrial carbon uptake had a detectable impact on both atmospheric COâ and global surface air temperatures,"" Alexander Koch and colleagues write in their paper published inQuaternary Science Reviews,external. Welcome to the Meghalayan Age New temperature 'starting point' sought Cool times: A depiction of a 17th Century Frost Fair at Temple Stairs on London's Thames River The team reviewed all the population data it could find on how many people were living in the Americas prior to first contact with Europeans in 1492. It then assessed how the numbers changed in following decades as the continents were ravaged by introduced disease (smallpox, measles, etc), warfare, slavery and societal collapse. It's the UCL group's estimate that 60 million people were living across the Americas at the end of the 15th Century (about 10% of the world's total population), and that this was reduced to just five or six million within a hundred years. The scientists calculated how much land previously cultivated by indigenous civilisations would have fallen into disuse, and what the impact would be if this ground was then repossessed by forest and savannah. The area is in the order of 56 million hectares, close in size to a country like modern France. This scale of regrowth is figured to have drawn down sufficient COâ that the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere eventually fell by 7-10ppm (that is 7-10 molecules of COâ in every one million molecules in the air). ""To put that in the modern context - we basically burn (fossil fuels) and produce about 3ppm per year. So, we're talking a large amount of carbon that's being sucked out of the atmosphere,"" explained co-author Prof Mark Maslin. ""There is a marked cooling around that time (1500s/1600s) which is called the Little Ice Age, and what's interesting is that we can see natural processes giving a little bit of cooling, but actually to get the full cooling - double the natural processes - you have to have this genocide-generated drop in COâ."" The fall in global carbon dioxide levels is recorded in the air bubbles trapped in ice cores The drop in COâ at the time of the Great Dying is evident in the ice core records from Antarctica. Air bubbles trapped in these frozen samples show a fall in their concentration of carbon dioxide. The atomic composition of the gas also suggests strongly that the decline is being driven by land processes somewhere on Earth. In addition, the UCL team says the story fits with the records of charcoal and pollen deposits in the Americas. These show the sort of perturbation expected from a decline in the use of fire to manage land, and a big grow-back of natural vegetation. Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at Reading University, was not involved in the study. He commented: ""Scientists understand that the so-called Little Ice Age was caused by several factors - a drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, a series of large volcanic eruptions, changes in land use and a temporary decline in solar activity. ""This new study demonstrates that the drop in COâ is itself partly due the settlement of the Americas and resulting collapse of the indigenous population, allowing regrowth of natural vegetation. It demonstrates that human activities affected the climatewell before the industrial revolution began."" Co-author Dr Chris Brierley believes there is. He said the fall-out from the terrible population crash and re-wilding of the Americas illustrated the challenge faced by some global warming solutions. ""There is a lot of talk around 'negative emissions' approaches and using tree-planting to take COâ out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change,"" he told BBC News. ""And what we see from this study is the scale of what's required, because the Great Dying resulted in an area the size of France being reforested and that gave us only a few ppm. This is useful; it shows us what reforestation can do. But at the same, that kind of reduction is worth perhaps just two years of fossil fuel emissions at the present rate."" The study also has a bearing on discussions about the creation of a new label to describe humanity's time - and impacts - on Earth. This epoch would be called the Anthropocene, and there is currently a lively debate over how it should be recognised in the geological record. Some researchers say it would be most obvious in deposits that record the great acceleration in industrial activity from the 1950s onwards. But the UCL team argues that the Great Dying in the Americas shows there are significant human interactions that left a deep and indelible mark on the planet long before the mid-20th Century.

Dangerous wind chills across the Upper Midwest and into the Ohio Valley were expected to last through Thursday, with heavy snow downwind of the Great Lakes, the NWS said. Heavy rain and mountain snow were expected in the west of the country by the weekend, it added. Temperatures have already reached brutal lows in Chicago thanks to wind chill The NWS is warning frostbite is possible within just 10 minutes of being outside in such extreme temperatures. Grand Forks, North Dakota, has seen the lowest wind chill so far at -54C on Wednesday morning.

The actress is accused of knocking down 72-year-old Terry Sanderson leaving him with a brain injury, short term memory loss and four broken ribs. Sanderson's lawyers say he has also experienced a personality change. The Goop founder has denied the allegations. Her publicist Heather Wilson said the ""lawsuit is without merit and we expect to be vindicated."" The case seeks $3.1m [Â£2.36m] in damages. It claims she was skiing ""out of control"" when she hit the retired optometrist on a beginner's slope on 26 February 2016. In a press conference he said he remembers being thrown forward after hearing a woman scream but suffers memory issues over exactly what happened because he said he was knocked unconscious. Craig Ramon, who was skiing with Mr Sanderson, said he witnessed Paltrow hitting him in the back, knocking him over and falling on top of him.

America colonisation âcooled climateâ,"This video can not be played Mark Maslin and Chris Brierley: ""A genocide-generated drop in carbon dioxide"" Colonisation of the Americas at the end of the 15th Century killed so many people, it disturbed Earth's climate. That's the conclusion of scientists from University College London, UK. The team says the disruption that followed European settlement led to a huge swathe of abandoned agricultural land being reclaimed by fast-growing trees and other vegetation. This pulled down enough carbon dioxide (COâ) from the atmosphere to eventually chill the planet. It's a cooling period often referred to in the history books as the ""Little Ice Age"" - a time when winters in Europe would see the Thames in London regularly freeze over. ""The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas led to the abandonment of enough cleared land that the resulting terrestrial carbon uptake had a detectable impact on both atmospheric COâ and global surface air temperatures,"" Alexander Koch and colleagues write in their paper published inQuaternary Science Reviews,external. Welcome to the Meghalayan Age New temperature 'starting point' sought Cool times: A depiction of a 17th Century Frost Fair at Temple Stairs on London's Thames River The team reviewed all the population data it could find on how many people were living in the Americas prior to first contact with Europeans in 1492. It then assessed how the numbers changed in following decades as the continents were ravaged by introduced disease (smallpox, measles, etc), warfare, slavery and societal collapse. It's the UCL group's estimate that 60 million people were living across the Americas at the end of the 15th Century (about 10% of the world's total population), and that this was reduced to just five or six million within a hundred years. The scientists calculated how much land previously cultivated by indigenous civilisations would have fallen into disuse, and what the impact would be if this ground was then repossessed by forest and savannah. The area is in the order of 56 million hectares, close in size to a country like modern France. This scale of regrowth is figured to have drawn down sufficient COâ that the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere eventually fell by 7-10ppm (that is 7-10 molecules of COâ in every one million molecules in the air). ""To put that in the modern context - we basically burn (fossil fuels) and produce about 3ppm per year. So, we're talking a large amount of carbon that's being sucked out of the atmosphere,"" explained co-author Prof Mark Maslin. ""There is a marked cooling around that time (1500s/1600s) which is called the Little Ice Age, and what's interesting is that we can see natural processes giving a little bit of cooling, but actually to get the full cooling - double the natural processes - you have to have this genocide-generated drop in COâ."" The fall in global carbon dioxide levels is recorded in the air bubbles trapped in ice cores The drop in COâ at the time of the Great Dying is evident in the ice core records from Antarctica. Air bubbles trapped in these frozen samples show a fall in their concentration of carbon dioxide. The atomic composition of the gas also suggests strongly that the decline is being driven by land processes somewhere on Earth. In addition, the UCL team says the story fits with the records of charcoal and pollen deposits in the Americas. These show the sort of perturbation expected from a decline in the use of fire to manage land, and a big grow-back of natural vegetation. Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at Reading University, was not involved in the study. He commented: ""Scientists understand that the so-called Little Ice Age was caused by several factors - a drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, a series of large volcanic eruptions, changes in land use and a temporary decline in solar activity. ""This new study demonstrates that the drop in COâ is itself partly due the settlement of the Americas and resulting collapse of the indigenous population, allowing regrowth of natural vegetation. It demonstrates that human activities affected the climatewell before the industrial revolution began."" Co-author Dr Chris Brierley believes there is. He said the fall-out from the terrible population crash and re-wilding of the Americas illustrated the challenge faced by some global warming solutions. ""There is a lot of talk around 'negative emissions' approaches and using tree-planting to take COâ out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change,"" he told BBC News. ""And what we see from this study is the scale of what's required, because the Great Dying resulted in an area the size of France being reforested and that gave us only a few ppm. This is useful; it shows us what reforestation can do. But at the same, that kind of reduction is worth perhaps just two years of fossil fuel emissions at the present rate."" The study also has a bearing on discussions about the creation of a new label to describe humanity's time - and impacts - on Earth. This epoch would be called the Anthropocene, and there is currently a lively debate over how it should be recognised in the geological record. Some researchers say it would be most obvious in deposits that record the great acceleration in industrial activity from the 1950s onwards.

Social media ban for knife crime suspects,"This video can not be played Sajid Javid says the Asbo-style orders would give police more powers to prevent knife crime New powers to control suspects thought to be carrying knives are being introduced by the government in a bid to cut rising violence. Knife Crime Prevention Orders would impose sanctions, including bans on using social media to stir up trouble. Orders would target anyone in England and Wales aged 12 or over suspected of knife crime involvement, even if they are not caught with a blade. Critics said the orders risked criminalising young people. The possession of knives has increased by almost a third in five years, figures released earlier this month showed. It is already a crime to carry a blade in public without good reason - and there is a separate offence of taking a knife into a school. Is another year of rising knife crime ahead? Violent crime in England and Wales up 19% Knife crime: What happened to Michael? The House of Lords is being asked to approve the proposed prevention orders as part of the government's Offensive Weapons Bills. If a court is convinced the police's intelligence is probably right, it can impose sanctions including: Curfews to keep the suspect off the streets and out of specific areas where gangs clash Requirements to attend special knife awareness courses to change their thinking Barring the suspect from using social media to encourage feuds Banning them for up to two years from meeting other members of their gang The prevention orders can also be imposed on someone convicted of carrying a knife, in an attempt to prevent them returning to their old ways. Breaching an order would be a criminal offence punishable with up to two years in prison. This video can not be played Investigation reveals knives sold illegally to children Labour MP Sarah Jones, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Knife Crime, said the plan was ""flawed"". ""Imprisoning a young person - as young as 12 years old - for two years for breaching this order is completely disproportionate,"" she said. The new powers come as it emerged a fifth of offences for possession or threatening with a knife in the year to June involved 10 to 17-year-olds. Hospital figures reveal that 813 people under 18 were treated for a sharp injury wound in the year to April 2018 - up 80% since March 2015. The Crime Survey for England and Wales - a national rolling study of people's experiences - found that almost 6% of children knew someone who has carried a knife. The return of stop and search? Are more teenagers carrying knives? Glasgow: From murder capital to role model This video can not be played Knife crime: What happened to Michael? Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the proposed power filled a gap in the law and would help police target knife-carriers more effectively. ""I will do everything in my power to tackle the senseless violence that is traumatising communities and claiming too many young lives,"" Mr Javid said. ""The police already have a range of measures they are using to keep our streets safe, but there is more we can do to help them in this battle."" But Enver Solomon, CEO of Just for Kids Law, said the government was ""resorting to harsh headline-grabbing initiatives that won't work"". ""This will do very little to address the underlying causes of knife crime and will push more young people into the criminal justice system,"" he said.

The GP substitute will see you now,"An army of more than 20,000 physios, pharmacists and paramedics are to be recruited in England to work alongside under-pressure GPs, NHS bosses say. The new staff will work with GPs, taking responsibility for some of the 300 million bookings made with practices each year. They will also provide continuing care to patients in the community. NHS England said this should allow GPs to spend more time with the sickest patients. The average appointment lasts about eight minutes, which GPs say is not enough time to deal with the complex issues an ageing population presents with. Where not to live if you need a GP Have waits for GP appointments got longer? NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""It represents the biggest boost to general practice in more than 15 years, giving patients more convenient services at their local GP surgery while breaking down the divide between family doctors and community health services."" GP leaders have warmly welcomed the move but warned extra doctors were also needed. There are currently just over 34,000 GPs working in England, alongside 11,000 practice nurses. Despite promises to recruit more GPs, the number of full-time equivalents working has actually fallen by 400 in the past three years. The Royal College of GPs estimates the nation is 6,000 GPs short of what it needs. The changes have been announced as part of a five-year contract brokered with the British Medical Association. It is being funded by the extra Â£4.5bn that will be invested in community services by 2023 under the terms of the 10-year NHS Plan published earlier this month. GP practices are being funded to recruit some of the staff directly. In the future, each practice should have its own pharmacist, to carry out medicines reviews, and a social-prescribing link worker, who will be able to link patients with everything from exercise classes to lose weight to arts and dance groups to help with mental health problems. But community services are also being reorganised as part of the 10-year plan, with the creation of primary care networks spanning several GP practices. Many of the extra staff will work in these teams, providing an extra layer of services to patients. By 2023-24, there should be 22,000 extra physios, pharmacists, paramedics and link workers in place. But Nigel Edwards, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the NHS may find that hard to achieve. ""We need to hear more about where these staff are coming from - after all, many parts of the NHS have their own serious shortages,"" he said. As the changes have been introduced as part of a new contract, the profession is fully behind the plans. BMA GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey said he was ""confident"" the new deal would benefit both patients and doctors. ""Recent years have seen hard-working family doctors deal with an overstretched workforce doing their best to meet rising demand from patients suffering more and more complex conditions,"" he said. Prof Helen Stokes Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said these new staff would become ""high-skilled members of the GP team"". But she added: ""Our prime objective must remain the recruitment and retention of thousands more GPs.""

'American Dying' cooled Earth's climate,"This video can not be played Mark Maslin and Chris Brierley: ""A genocide-generated drop in carbon dioxide"" Colonisation of the Americas at the end of the 15th Century killed so many people, it disturbed Earth's climate. That's the conclusion of scientists from University College London, UK. The team says the disruption that followed European settlement led to a huge swathe of abandoned agricultural land being reclaimed by fast-growing trees and other vegetation. This pulled down enough carbon dioxide (COâ) from the atmosphere to eventually chill the planet. It's a cooling period often referred to in the history books as the ""Little Ice Age"" - a time when winters in Europe would see the Thames in London regularly freeze over. ""The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas led to the abandonment of enough cleared land that the resulting terrestrial carbon uptake had a detectable impact on both atmospheric COâ and global surface air temperatures,"" Alexander Koch and colleagues write in their paper published inQuaternary Science Reviews,external. Welcome to the Meghalayan Age New temperature 'starting point' sought Cool times: A depiction of a 17th Century Frost Fair at Temple Stairs on London's Thames River The team reviewed all the population data it could find on how many people were living in the Americas prior to first contact with Europeans in 1492. It then assessed how the numbers changed in following decades as the continents were ravaged by introduced disease (smallpox, measles, etc), warfare, slavery and societal collapse. It's the UCL group's estimate that 60 million people were living across the Americas at the end of the 15th Century (about 10% of the world's total population), and that this was reduced to just five or six million within a hundred years. The scientists calculated how much land previously cultivated by indigenous civilisations would have fallen into disuse, and what the impact would be if this ground was then repossessed by forest and savannah. The area is in the order of 56 million hectares, close in size to a country like modern France. This scale of regrowth is figured to have drawn down sufficient COâ that the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere eventually fell by 7-10ppm (that is 7-10 molecules of COâ in every one million molecules in the air). ""To put that in the modern context - we basically burn (fossil fuels) and produce about 3ppm per year. So, we're talking a large amount of carbon that's being sucked out of the atmosphere,"" explained co-author Prof Mark Maslin. ""There is a marked cooling around that time (1500s/1600s) which is called the Little Ice Age, and what's interesting is that we can see natural processes giving a little bit of cooling, but actually to get the full cooling - double the natural processes - you have to have this genocide-generated drop in COâ."" The fall in global carbon dioxide levels is recorded in the air bubbles trapped in ice cores The drop in COâ at the time of the Great Dying is evident in the ice core records from Antarctica. Air bubbles trapped in these frozen samples show a fall in their concentration of carbon dioxide. The atomic composition of the gas also suggests strongly that the decline is being driven by land processes somewhere on Earth. In addition, the UCL team says the story fits with the records of charcoal and pollen deposits in the Americas. These show the sort of perturbation expected from a decline in the use of fire to manage land, and a big grow-back of natural vegetation. Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at Reading University, was not involved in the study. He commented: ""Scientists understand that the so-called Little Ice Age was caused by several factors - a drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, a series of large volcanic eruptions, changes in land use and a temporary decline in solar activity. ""This new study demonstrates that the drop in COâ is itself partly due the settlement of the Americas and resulting collapse of the indigenous population, allowing regrowth of natural vegetation. It demonstrates that human activities affected the climatewell before the industrial revolution began."" Co-author Dr Chris Brierley believes there is. He said the fall-out from the terrible population crash and re-wilding of the Americas illustrated the challenge faced by some global warming solutions. ""There is a lot of talk around 'negative emissions' approaches and using tree-planting to take COâ out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change,"" he told BBC News. ""And what we see from this study is the scale of what's required, because the Great Dying resulted in an area the size of France being reforested and that gave us only a few ppm. This is useful; it shows us what reforestation can do. But at the same, that kind of reduction is worth perhaps just two years of fossil fuel emissions at the present rate."" The study also has a bearing on discussions about the creation of a new label to describe humanity's time - and impacts - on Earth. This epoch would be called the Anthropocene, and there is currently a lively debate over how it should be recognised in the geological record. Some researchers say it would be most obvious in deposits that record the great acceleration in industrial activity from the 1950s onwards. But the UCL team argues that the Great Dying in the Americas shows there are significant human interactions that left a deep and indelible mark on the planet long before the mid-20th Century.

Asda loses appeal over equal pay,"Supermarket giant Asda has lost an appeal in the latest development in a long-running legal dispute with staff over equal pay. The decision means that lower paid shop staff, who are mostly women, can compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers, who are mostly men. Asda said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision and added it remained confident in its case. A ruling over whether the work is of equal value is likely to be in May. Leigh Day, which represented the staff, said the judgement was a ""major step forward in the fair pay battle"". Asda said: ""We are obviously disappointed with the decision, which relates to a preliminary issue of whether jobs in different parts of the business can be compared."" It said it had brought the appeal ""because it involved complex legal issues which have never been fully tested in the private sector and we will continue to ensure this case is given the legal scrutiny it deserves"". What is the gender pay gap? What is the gender pay gap at your firm? The Employment Tribunal first ruled against Asda in October 2016. It said shop workers, who mainly work at check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves with staff who work at warehouses. Asda then appealed against this decision on 10 different grounds. In August 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled all points of their appeal unsuccessful. Asda then took its case to the Court of Appeal. Following Thursday's ruling, the Court of Appeal denied Asda the right to appeal. However, the BBC understands the supermarket chain intends to apply to the Supreme Court to appeal against the ruling there. There are three key stages in an equal pay case Are the jobs comparable? If the jobs are comparable, are they of equal value? If they are of equal value, is there a reason why the roles should not be paid equally? Leigh Day represents more 30,000 shop floor staff from the big four supermarkets - Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons - in similar cases. The legal firm said if the four supermarkets lost their cases and were ordered to pay all eligible staff, the cost could be more than Â£8bn. However, that would only be if all 500,000 store workers made a claim. The GMB union, which represents some Asda workers, welcomed what it described as Thursday's ""landmark"" judgment. General secretary Tim Roache, said: ""We know we're not all the way there, there are more hurdles to jump in this process and as always we remain ready to negotiate should Asda want to get round the table."" Asda said: ""Our hourly rates of pay in stores are the same for female and male colleagues and this is equally true in our depots. ""Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres because the demands of the jobs in stores and the jobs in distribution centres are very different; they operate in different market sectors and we pay the market rate in those sectors regardless of gender.""

Fast fashion firms 'shocking' on ethics,"Fashion retailers JD Sports, Sports Direct and Boohoo, are ""failing to commit"" to reducing their environmental and social impact, MPs say. Amazon, TK Maxx and Missguided were also described by the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) as being among the ""least engaged"" in sustainable fashion and labour market initiatives. The EAC said it was ""shocking"" the firms were ""failing to take action"". Boohoo said the report did not reflect its commitment to sustainability. The findings are part of the EAC'sinquiry into the sustainability of the fashion industry,external. The inquiry was prompted by the popularity of ""fast fashion... cheap clothing, with quick turnover that encourages repurchasing"". Disposable fashion has come under fire, not only for the amount that ends up in landfill, but also because it can release toxic chemicals in production and plastic fibres when it is washed. MPs to investigate 'fast fashion' impact 'How do you justify selling a Â£2 T-shirt?' Exploitation 'rife' in UK textile industry Last summer the committee wrote to 16 fashion retailers asking what they were doing to cut the environmental and social impact of the clothes and shoes they sell. Specific questions included what the brands were doing about using organic or sustainable cotton; limiting the discharge of hazardous chemicals and the re-use or recycling of unsold stock. The interim report ranks brands according to how ""engaged"" they are in their commitment to sustainable fashion and labour market initiatives. The ""most engaged"" were named as Asos, Marks & Spencer Tesco, Primark and Burberry. All of them use organic or sustainable cotton and old materials and encourage customers to return old clothing. The ""moderately engaged"" retailers were Next, Debenhams, Arcadia Group and Asda. The EAC said each of them had taken ""some steps"" to address environmental sustainability issues. All of them except Next run a return scheme for discarded clothes and all of them except Asda use organic cotton in some clothes. Kurt Geiger was also approached but did not respond to requests for written evidence, the EAC said. The retailers were also asked if they were members of the ACT (Action, Collaboration, Transformation) labour rights and living wage agreement and the SCAP (Sustainable Clothing Action Plan) to reduce their carbon, water and waste footprint. With the exception of Burberry all the other ""moderately engaged"" and ""most engaged"" retailers participated in one or other or both of these schemes. Of the six ""least engaged"" retailers none was a member of either of these initiatives, In a statement, Boohoo said it wanted to ""re-iterate its commitment to being involved in the ongoing discussion on the sustainability of fashion. ""This initial report does not fully reflect the policies and procedures and independent initiatives that we have in place, or the extent of our ongoing commitment in the area of sustainability."" JD Sports said ""As a business, we participate in a number of ethical initiatives which fall outside the narrow list referred to in the Committee's report."" It added that most of the group's sales came from third party brands, including ""two [Nike and Adidas] internationally recognised as industry leaders with regards to driving sustainability"". ""Private label sales make up the rest of the Group's sales and there is an ongoing project to review options on improving the sustainability of our manufactured garments,"" it added. Amazon declined to comment. EAC chair Mary Creagh said: ""It's shocking to see that a group of major retailers are failing to take action to promote environmental sustainability and protect their workers. ""By publishing this information, customers can choose whether they want to spend money with a company that is doing little to protect the environment or promote proper wages for garment workers. ""We hope this motivates underperforming retailers to start taking responsibility for their workers and their environmental impact."" The committee concluded that the UK fashion industry's current business model was ""clearly unsustainable, especially with a growing middle-class population and rising levels of consumption across the globe"". ""Least engaged"": JD Sports, Sports Direct, Boohoo, Amazon, TK Maxx, Missguided ""Moderately engaged"": Next, Debenhams, Arcadia Group, Asda. ""Most engaged"": Asos, Marks & Spencer Tesco, Primark and Burberry. Kurt Geiger did not respond to the EAC's requests The committee said it intended to publish its final report in the coming weeks in which it will outline recommendations for government policies to ""encourage a more transparent, fair and sustainable fashion system"". Francois Souchet of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation said the committee was right that the ""fashion industry's current business model cannot work in the long term"". He said worldwide one truckload of clothing was landfilled or incinerated every second, while less than 1% of old clothing goes on to be used to make new clothes.

'Fundamental action' call on rough sleeping,"This video can not be played Newcastle rough sleepers tell their stories There were 4,677 people sleeping rough in England in autumn 2018, according to official estimates. The figure represents a slight fall of 74 on 2017, however rises were recorded in London, the Midlands, north-east and Yorkshire and the Humber. Numbers are still up 2,909 since the start of the decade, with charities calling for ""fundamental action to tackle the root causes"". The government has pledged Â£100m over two years to tackle rough sleeping. It will trial schemes in Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the West Midlands where people are given housing without first being required to give up drugs or alcohol, a model whichhas been hailed a success in Finland. The figures are only a single night snapshot,with councils either counting or estimating the number of rough sleepers. London saw an increase from 1,137 to 1,283. Birmingham went from 57 rough sleepers in 2017 to 91. Manchester's figure increased from 94 to 123. However Brighton and Hove, which had one of the highest rates of rough sleeping in previous years, dropped from 178 to 64. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Can't see the interactive map?Tap or click here,external Charities said that despite the slight overall drop, rough sleeping had ""rocketed"" by 165% since 2010. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""The combination of spiralling rents, a faulty benefits system and lack of social housing means the number of people forced to sleep rough has risen dramatically since 2010. ""We welcome many of the things which the government has been doing to seek to improve services for rough sleepers, and numbers do now seem to be stabilising which is a rare piece of good news, but without fundamental action to tackle the root causes of homelessness these measures will only achieve so much."" Homeless people's deaths up 24% over five years Homeless man found dead in Birmingham Â£100m plan to tackle homelessness unveiled Chief executive of Crisis, Jon Sparkes said: ""It's a damning reflection of our society that night after night, so many people are forced to sleep rough on our streets, with numbers soaring in the capital."" James Turner from Sheldon has described life on the street as ""desperate"" While the overall number of rough sleepers in England has fallen slightly, in Birmingham it increased 60% in the past year. A homeless man,Kane Walker, died on the street at the weekend. James Turner, 41, from Sheldon has been on the streets since June 2018. He became homeless after he was released from prison, where he had served nine months for assault, and found he was Â£5,000 in arrears on his house. The day after he returned home from prison, bailiffs came round. He was evicted a short time later. ""They took two grand's worth of leather sofas, my TV, everything. ""I tried to get into a hostel yesterday but they had no space, it was completely packed. They said I could sleep on the floor by the door, I said 'no thanks, I'd rather be on the street'. ""So that's why I'm out here. ""I was found a place in Erdington but when me and my girlfriend got there, there were men there who thought we were someone else and beat us both up, so we left. ""My girlfriend is worried about me every day. She's staying with friends but there's only a single bed and no room for me. ""I don't want to go into hostels. They're full of drug addicts. I'm not on drugs anymore, I don't want to be around all that."" Lewis has seen a rise in the number of people on the streets like him Lewis, aged 29, said he was kicked out of his family home six years ago due to crime and a drug-related lifestyle. ""I just messed up"", he said. ""People in Birmingham are really helpful,"" he said. ""I get a lot of hot drinks and that. At the end of the day, Greggs give all of their stuff they haven't sold to outreach workers who give it to us. ""For the life I want to live, I just need money, I need a nine to five, I'm looking for work. ""The number of people on the streets has definitely increased. This time of year it goes up."" This video can not be played When you can't see inside a tent, it makes counting homeless numbers that bit harder, Michael Buchanan explains The official number of rough sleepers published each year by the government does not tell the whole story. It comes from information collected once a year by local councils. In England councils choose one night in October or November to carry out a street count - they will physically go out and count the people they see sleeping rough on streets in tents or doorways. Some councils choose instead to make an estimate based on how many people are known to local services like homelessness charities - for example, in rural areas where it may be more difficult to physically count people. That means anyone who they don't spot - and many homeless people choose to hide themselves for their own safety - or anyone who spends that night walking around, on a night bus or sofa surfing won't be counted. It also doesn't include anyone staying that night in a hostel or shelter. There are many more people who are homeless but don't sleep rough, staying instead in temporary accommodation like bed and breakfasts. Despite the slight drop in the official estimate, Local Government Association housing spokesman councillor Martin Tett, said it was becoming ""increasingly difficult"" for councils to prevent homelessness and rough sleeping from happening as they faced a ""funding gap"" of more than Â£100m in 2019-20. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said the figures were ""a step in the right direction"" but the government was aiming to eliminate rough sleeping by 2027.

Of the Â£100m promised by the government to tackle rough sleeping, about Â£30m will go on mental health help and treatment for substance misuse. The government is putting Â£50m towards homes outside London for people ready to move on from hostels or refuges.

Italy in recession amid stagnant eurozone,"The economy is a problem for Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Italy's economy tipped into recession at the end of last year, according to latest figures. In the final three months of 2018, the economy shrank by 0.2%, following a 0.1% decline in the third quarter, the Istat statistics office said. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the contraction was likely to continue into 2019. Meanwhile, figures from the EU showed economic growth in the 19-country eurozone still languishing. Growth in the euro area remained at 0.2% in the final quarter of 2018, the same as the previous quarter and in line with analysts' expectations. The figures,issued by the Eurostat agency,external, showed that in the 28-nation EU as a whole, fourth-quarter growth was 0.3%. In contrast to Italy, some other eurozone economies expanded more than expected, with France and Spain posting growth rates of 0.3% and 0.7% quarter-on-quarter respectively. Italy's statistics office said agriculture, forestry, fishing and industry had all contributed to the economic downturn, while a rise in net exports failed to offset those declines. Italy's coalition government was forced to reviseits expansionary 2019 budgetlast month after the European Commission raised concerns about the impact on the country's debt levels. The renewed recession in Italy aggravates the problem the government has with its finances. The ruling parties' desire to increase spending to meet election campaign commitments led to a stand-off with the European Commission which argued Italy was going to be borrowing too much.  Rome pared back its plans and the dispute was resolved. But the fact that the economy has turned out to be even weaker is bad news for the government finances. Tax revenue will be hit and that will tend to lead to a bigger financial hole to be filled by borrowing. Italy's problem is its accumulated debt, which is on one measure the largest in the eurozone. It would be a huge problem for the rest of the eurozone if Italy were to suffer the kind of debt crisis that Greece and others experienced a few years ago. That is not a near-term prospect, but Italy's persistently weak economic performance makes it very hard to banish that risk conclusively. Italy has the biggest government debt in the EU at more than â¬2.3 trillion ($2.6tn; Â£2tn). It is also the fourth-largest government debt in the world. The country's debt burden as a percentage of annual economic activity is second only to Greece in the EU at 132%. Last week, European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi saideurozone economic data had been weaker than expectedand the risks to growth had increased. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the overall eurozone figures ""don't look pretty, but have been well telegraphed by the hard data and the financial market horror show in Q4"". ""Indeed, it seems to us that markets will be inclined to look at these headline [figures] as good news. They indicate that things probably won't get much worse in the near term - this is a bold assumption, given poor January survey data - and that the ECB will keep rates low for a long time.""

Rough sleeper numbers down slightly,"This video can not be played Newcastle rough sleepers tell their stories There were 4,677 people sleeping rough in England in autumn 2018, according to official estimates. The figure represents a slight fall of 74 on 2017, however rises were recorded in London, the Midlands, north-east and Yorkshire and the Humber. Numbers are still up 2,909 since the start of the decade, with charities calling for ""fundamental action to tackle the root causes"". The government has pledged Â£100m over two years to tackle rough sleeping. It will trial schemes in Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the West Midlands where people are given housing without first being required to give up drugs or alcohol, a model whichhas been hailed a success in Finland. The figures are only a single night snapshot,with councils either counting or estimating the number of rough sleepers. London saw an increase from 1,137 to 1,283. Birmingham went from 57 rough sleepers in 2017 to 91. Manchester's figure increased from 94 to 123. However Brighton and Hove, which had one of the highest rates of rough sleeping in previous years, dropped from 178 to 64. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Can't see the interactive map?Tap or click here,external Charities said that despite the slight overall drop, rough sleeping had ""rocketed"" by 165% since 2010. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""The combination of spiralling rents, a faulty benefits system and lack of social housing means the number of people forced to sleep rough has risen dramatically since 2010. ""We welcome many of the things which the government has been doing to seek to improve services for rough sleepers, and numbers do now seem to be stabilising which is a rare piece of good news, but without fundamental action to tackle the root causes of homelessness these measures will only achieve so much."" Homeless people's deaths up 24% over five years Homeless man found dead in Birmingham Â£100m plan to tackle homelessness unveiled Chief executive of Crisis, Jon Sparkes said: ""It's a damning reflection of our society that night after night, so many people are forced to sleep rough on our streets, with numbers soaring in the capital."" James Turner from Sheldon has described life on the street as ""desperate"" While the overall number of rough sleepers in England has fallen slightly, in Birmingham it increased 60% in the past year. A homeless man,Kane Walker, died on the street at the weekend. James Turner, 41, from Sheldon has been on the streets since June 2018. He became homeless after he was released from prison, where he had served nine months for assault, and found he was Â£5,000 in arrears on his house. The day after he returned home from prison, bailiffs came round. He was evicted a short time later. ""They took two grand's worth of leather sofas, my TV, everything. ""I tried to get into a hostel yesterday but they had no space, it was completely packed. They said I could sleep on the floor by the door, I said 'no thanks, I'd rather be on the street'. ""So that's why I'm out here. ""I was found a place in Erdington but when me and my girlfriend got there, there were men there who thought we were someone else and beat us both up, so we left. ""My girlfriend is worried about me every day. She's staying with friends but there's only a single bed and no room for me. ""I don't want to go into hostels. They're full of drug addicts. I'm not on drugs anymore, I don't want to be around all that."" Lewis has seen a rise in the number of people on the streets like him Lewis, aged 29, said he was kicked out of his family home six years ago due to crime and a drug-related lifestyle. ""I just messed up"", he said. ""People in Birmingham are really helpful,"" he said. ""I get a lot of hot drinks and that. At the end of the day, Greggs give all of their stuff they haven't sold to outreach workers who give it to us. ""For the life I want to live, I just need money, I need a nine to five, I'm looking for work. ""The number of people on the streets has definitely increased. This time of year it goes up."" This video can not be played When you can't see inside a tent, it makes counting homeless numbers that bit harder, Michael Buchanan explains The official number of rough sleepers published each year by the government does not tell the whole story. It comes from information collected once a year by local councils. In England councils choose one night in October or November to carry out a street count - they will physically go out and count the people they see sleeping rough on streets in tents or doorways. Some councils choose instead to make an estimate based on how many people are known to local services like homelessness charities - for example, in rural areas where it may be more difficult to physically count people. That means anyone who they don't spot - and many homeless people choose to hide themselves for their own safety - or anyone who spends that night walking around, on a night bus or sofa surfing won't be counted. It also doesn't include anyone staying that night in a hostel or shelter. There are many more people who are homeless but don't sleep rough, staying instead in temporary accommodation like bed and breakfasts. Despite the slight drop in the official estimate, Local Government Association housing spokesman councillor Martin Tett, said it was becoming ""increasingly difficult"" for councils to prevent homelessness and rough sleeping from happening as they faced a ""funding gap"" of more than Â£100m in 2019-20. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said the figures were ""a step in the right direction"" but the government was aiming to eliminate rough sleeping by 2027. ""I am clear we need to go further than ever before to build upon today's results and sustain momentum as we move towards ending rough sleeping,"" he said. Of the Â£100m promised by the government to tackle rough sleeping, about Â£30m will go on mental health help and treatment for substance misuse. The government is putting Â£50m towards homes outside London for people ready to move on from hostels or refuges. Councils have so far used new funding to create an additional 1,750 shelter beds and provide 500 rough sleeping support staff, Mr Brokenshire said.

'God wanted Trump as president',"Sarah Sanders also said it was ""very hard"" to take morality lessons from the Democratic Party White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has told a religious television network that God ""wanted Donald Trump to become president"". Ms Sanders made the claim in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), saying it was the reason Mr Trump was in office. The press secretary also said it was ""very hard"" to take morality lessons from the Democratic Party. Democrats have attacked Mr Trump's proposed border wall as immoral. US evangelicals strongly support the president. The Washington Post reports Mr Trump won 80% of the white evangelical vote,externalin 2016, a higher share than Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain in previous elections. Trump's unlikely Christian covenant The evangelical women who reject Trump CBN broadcast the interview with Ms Sanders on Wednesday,external, conducted by David Brody and Jennifer Wishon. Responding to Mr Brady's question about Mr Trump's position, Ms Sanders said: ""I think God calls all of us to fill different roles at different times and I think that He wanted Donald Trump to become president.""

Mr Trump has hosted faith leaders in the Oval Office When asked about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi position on the proposed border wall - a divisive issue at the heart ofthe longest US government shutdown in history- the press secretary attacked Ms Pelosi's suggestion such a barrier was immoral. ""Honestly, it's very hard at this point to even take a lecture from Democrats on what is moral and what isn't,"" she said, calling it a ""ridiculous charge"" and saying Ms Pelosi ""may even regret making that comment"". ""Protecting the people of your country... is the fundamental duty of being president of the United States,"" Ms Sanders said.

A staring match of one against 27,"There will be a hunt for a new idea. Some magic new solution that might - maybe, possibly - provide a sudden surprise solution to Brexit's conundrums, in the way exhausted pilgrims might fall jubilantly on the Holy grail proclaiming, at last, that its jewels are beyond compare and a world changing treasure is now in their heroic clutches. And yes, it is absolutely the case that different technical solutions will be explored again - whether they be ways of carving out potential technological solutions to managing the Irish border or additional paragraphs of legal language that could be constructed to suit all sides. EU rejects calls to reopen Brexit deal Drop no deal, Corbyn tells May at meeting Brexit deal bid 'running out of road' And, of course, in the next fortnight the government - and everyone in Westminster and in Brussels - will spend a lot of energy trying to work out which other possible ways of fixing the acute problem with the backstop could be done. Fundamentally though, our politicians have been staring at the same problem for more than two years. I'm reminded of how many months ago, during one of the other frenzies over how to ""solve"" the border issue, one official told me that, essentially, all that could really be done was to put the same words in a different order. The next fortnight's efforts will be a bit more complex than that, but they may prove the old adage: ""There is no such thing as an original idea."" Different ways of moving different promises or verbiage around, but a bold brand new solution no one's already thought of? Don't hold your breath. But the facts of the situation in their most simple way are the same. The UK is on course to leave the EU. That means the border on the island of Ireland becomes a border between a separate country and an enormous free trade area. Everyone promises they don't want to have anything like a traditional border - but no one can agree on how to avoid that. There is only one thing now that is certain to change, and that is the power of time. The hope may be misplaced, but the hope nonetheless on the UK side is that as the clock ticks down with no solution, eventually, the fear of the consequences of the UK leaving without a deal will concentrate minds. And the pressure of the approach of a deadline could in turn shift the politics. Because it is the desire of EU leaders to avoid the worst that will either salvage Theresa May's deal, or not. Her political drive to get this over the line will determine how radical or tough she is prepared to be. And for different EU leaders, their own calculations - which are, of course, driven by politics in their home countries, as well as the role of the EU - will shape whether they are willing to flex at all. Technical and legal rules and agreements are, of course, vitally important in all of this. But if there was an easy solution in policy and precedent, it perhaps would have been found by now. It feels like we are now entering into a final staring match, where politics - not policy - will decide who has to look away. The problem, as ever, for Theresa May is that she is one against 27 others.

Car investment slumps on Brexit 'red alert',"Investment in the UK car sector almost halved last year and output tumbled as Brexit fears put firms on ""red alert"", the industry's trade body said. Inward investment fell 46.5% to Â£588.6m last year from Â£1.1bn in 2017, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says. Production fell 9.1% to 1.52m vehicles, with output for the UK and for export falling 16.3% and 7.3% respectively. Brexit uncertainty has ""done enormous damage"", said SMMT chief Mike Hawes. But the impact so far on output, investment and jobs ""is nothing compared with the permanent devastation caused by severing our frictionless trade links overnight, not just with the EU but with the many other global markets with which we currently trade freely,"" he added. ""With fewer than 60 days before we leave the EU and the risk of crashing out without a deal looking increasingly real, UK Automotive is on red alert,"" he said. Politicians must do whatever it takes to avoid a no-deal, he said. His gloomy prognosis followsstrong warnings from other business groups on Wednesday. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said Tuesday's vote to renegotiate the UK's withdrawal deal ""feels like a real throw of the dice"". Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, told the BBC that firms there were ""in despair and really confused"" about what was going on. Mr Hawes said that, despite the Commons vote on Tuesday evening, ""nothing has changed"". Firms 'may speed up no-deal Brexit plans' Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts Ford to cut thousands of jobs in shake-up A government spokesman said: ""As we leave the European Union we will seek the broadest and deepest possible agreement that delivers the maximum possible benefits for both the UK and EU economies and maintains the strength of our world-leading automotive sector."" Investment in the car industry comes in uneven lumps as old models are retired and new ones introduced over time. But even allowing for that, the plunge in new investment revealed this morning is stark. In 2015, car manufacturers invested Â£2.5bn in the UK. Since then it has fallen ever year and in 2018 was just Â£589m. Brexit uncertainty was not the only issue facing the sector - confusion over diesel policy, falling sales in China and production hold-ups due to new regulations also played a part. But the SMMT was clear that Brexit presented what it calls ""the most significant threat to the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector in a generation"". Manufacturing firms that rely on finely tuned pan-European supply chains have sounded the shrillest warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. These figures will do nothing to change that. The 16.3% fall in production of cars destined for sale in the UK was driven by uncertainty over the future of diesels, regulatory changes, and falls in consumer and business sentiment, according to the SMMT. However, exports to the EU fell by 9.6%, less steep than the fall in domestic production. Overall, the EU still accounts for the vast majority of UK exports, 52.6% or 650,628 cars. Although exports to the US rose 5.3%, largely due to demand for premium models, Mr Hawes warned that this improvement could reverse if tariffs are imposed in post-Brexit tax changes. Other key markets outside the EU would also be hurt, he said.  Exports last year to Japan increased by 26% and by 23% to South Korea, but he pointed out that both countries were subject to preferential EU trade agreements. Exports to China slumped 24.5%. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), Britain's biggest carmaker, has already underlined the pain being felt from a sales slowdown in China. Earlier this month JLR confirmed it was cutting 4,500 jobs, blaming Brexit uncertainty, a slump in diesel sales, and China's economic slowdown. The carmaker also said it would extend its annual April shutdown by an extra week because of worries that just-in-time deliveries could be disrupted if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Mr Hawes pointed out that the fall in production last year followed a fall in 2017, which came after seven years of unprecedented growth as the sector emerged from recession. ""As a highly-integrated sector that has maximised the benefits of the European single market and customs union, a 'no-deal' Brexit is the most significant threat to the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector in a generation,"" he said.

A murder detective's week,"The number of people killed in London during 2018 was the highest figure for a decade. But what is life like for a senior detective investigating these crimes? The Metropolitan Police's Homicide and Serious Crime Command launched more than 130 inquiries in 2018, as well as continuing to investigate dozens of unsolved cases from previous years. The unit is split into 18 teams, which each take their turn to be ""on call"" - meaning that if a suspicious death is reported, they have to respond. Murder Investigation Team 8 (MIT 8) was on 24-hour call for seven days from Tuesday 4 December. Based in Putney, south-west London, the team consists of 21 detectives, two police constables and four police staff and is led by Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh, one of the Met's most experienced investigators. He has 13 ""live"" murder and manslaughter inquiries that he's responsible for, each of them at different stages. Some cases are being prepared for court, some are already in the trial process, others are long-running investigations with police searching for a breakthrough, and a smaller number are recent homicide inquiries that need intensive work. From 07:00 GMT, the team is officially ""on call"" and is assigned one of the Met's specialist HAT (homicide assessment team) cars, specialist police vehicles deployed by homicide teams if there's a report of a suspicious death. HAT cars are available 24 hours a day, with dedicated officers ready to take them to the scene as quickly as possible. The principal job of the HAT car detective is to secure the scene and assess what's happened. The vehicle is equipped with kit such as police tape, exhibit bags and log books. The team assembles in the Putney office to review the trial of Rahim Mohammadi, which finished the previous week at the Old Bailey. Mohammadi had been found guilty of strangling Lea Adri-Soejoko at an allotment in north-west London in February 2017 andsentenced to life with a minimum 19-year term,external. He throttled the 80-year-old  with a mower cable and left her body inside a locked shed. Rahim Mohammadi was sentenced to a minimum of 19 years in prison for throttling an 80-year-old woman with a mower cable in February 2017 Detectives, led by Det Ch Insp McHugh, found inconsistencies in Mohammadi's accounts of his movements when they interviewed him as a witness. He was a plot-holder at the allotment and known by others there for his threatening, aggressive and violent behaviour. Det Ch Insp McHugh describes him as ""manipulative, volatile and evil"" - but it took a retrial for him to be convicted. Several detectives from MIT 8 spent five weeks in court. ""People think once someone has been charged, then it's done,"" Det Ch Insp McHugh says. ""But they do so much work, case building, and then at court things come out."" At 09:00, Det Ch Insp McHugh takes part in a ""capacity meeting"", to discuss resourcing issues in the Met, before helping one of his ""brilliant"" detectives prepare for a job interview at another force. She gets it, which is good news for her, but not so good for Det Ch Insp McHugh, who'll have to find a replacement, at a time when detectives are in short supply. London killings: All the victims of 2018 Is another year of rising knife crime ahead? Most London homicides for a decade Later, he has discussions about Operation Torksey - the inquiry he's leading into themurder of Marvin Couson, who was shot outside a club at Shoreditch,externalin 2002. Mr Couson was taken to hospital with serious injuries to his heart and other organs. He was left unable to communicate or leave his bed and died from a brain injury in August 2015, aged 39. According to Det Ch Insp McHugh, Mr Couson was the ""entirely innocent victim"" of a dispute between organised criminal gangs from London and Birmingham, which he had nothing to do with. There've been several developments in the inquiry over the years, most recently in September 2017, when detectives questioned a prisoner about the murder. Today, Det Ch Insp McHugh is considering what further action may be needed but remains guarded about what it might be. ""I was wrestling with a dilemma on a significant line of investigation,"" he says. Later in the afternoon, he manages to make it to a physiotherapy appointment before doing more work from home. One of the other unsolved cases from 2018 that Det Ch Insp McHugh is responsible for is Operation Plana, the murder of Bulent Kabala, in Cockfosters, north London, in February. In a ""targeted hit"", the 41-year-old was shot in the head and chest as he got out of the silver Mercedes he was driving. The suspects were in a stolen blue van with Polish number plates. Bulent Kabala was shot dead in north London in February 2018, in what police believe was a ""targeted hit"" Det Ch Insp McHugh compiles a report for the Met's director of intelligence because he wants to offer a reward for information that could help solve the case. The director of intelligence will decide whether to allow it. There's also another submission to complete - to renew the crime reward in Operation Lessingham, the inquiry into the 2015 murder of Josh Hanson, who was stabbed in the neck in a bar at Eastcote, north-west London.  He was 21. Theprime suspect, Shane O'Brien, is still at large. Police believe he was flown out of the UK on a privately chartered plane after Mr Hanson died and is being helped by criminal associates, who are providing him with money, false identities and the means to move across borders. Since the 30-year-old fled, he has had a large tattoo of an owl on his back, to cover up a previous smaller design. Police in the Czech Republic managed to photograph it when he was arrested for criminal damage there in 2017. He gave a false name and was released, with police only discovering his true identity later.  He's now onInterpol's ""most wanted"" list,external. Det Ch Insp McHugh, who's in charge of the inquiry into Mr Hanson's murder, has said O'Brien has an ""air about him, a presence he will struggle to conceal"" even though he uses aliases and may try to disguise his appearance. Police are searching for Shane O'Brien in connection with the 2015 murder of Josh Hanson Police have appealed previously for information from aeroplane and helicopter pilots, boat owners and those working in ports, as it's thought O'Brien will have been travelling around. They're also looking for people in nightclubs and boxing gyms as well as expats and any women he may have become involved with to come forward. At 23:30 Det Ch Insp McHugh gets a text that will end up shaping the work of his team for the next seven days. It's about a burglary in Barnet. The elderly homeowner is critically ill in hospital. He makes some initial inquiries about the case and ensures the crime scene is being preserved, before snatching a few hours' sleep. At 06:00 Det Ch Insp McHugh is told that the health of the burglary victim, Maureen Whale, has deteriorated. Ms Whale had been in the house at the time of the break-inand collapsed while phoning 999. She dies in hospital. By 08:30 Det Ch Insp McHugh is in the office, where there's ""some debate"" about whether the case should be handled by MIT 8 and the possible implications for other murder teams in London.  If MIT 8 takes the case, colleagues from elsewhere will have to investigate any other suspicious deaths during the week. Maureen Whale died following a burglary at her home in December 2018 A decision is made at 10:00 that MIT 8 should take the case, which requires passing the HAT car to another team. With four of his detectives involved in a trial and one on a course he has to find officers from elsewhere. ""That was quite a few phone calls to try to borrow people from other teams,"" he says. A major incident room for the burglary death is set up in Putney but most of the unit make the 14-mile journey to Colindale Police Station for a handover with local officers who initially handled the case. At the meeting, his team is briefed on local intelligence about burglaries in the area and what CCTV has been seized. A police family liaison officer (FLO) is despatched to meet the victim's family, a job Det Ch Insp McHugh would normally do but couldn't because of how far away they live. FLOs fulfil a vital role in cases where someone has died in suspicious circumstances. As well as providing support to relatives as the case progresses, updating them on progress and explaining the investigative and legal processes, they gather information from them about the victim to help the police inquiry. FLOs provide a crucial link to the senior investigative officer and in some instances details about the victim's personal life, friends and family set-up have provided clues that have helped solve the case. Det Ch Insp McHugh leads a team of 21 detectives, two police constables and four police staff At 16:00 there's a Gold Group meeting with the borough commander, Simon Rose, before the team heads to the crime scene, which is near Barnet Hospital. ""It was really helpful for me to understand the geography of the scene,"" Det Ch Insp McHugh says. He deploys sniffer dogs, works out which routes the burglars might have taken, consults the police crime scene manager about a plan for recovering items for forensic examination, arranges for photographs of the scene, liaises with the exhibits officer and ensures a post-mortem examination is organised. At the same time, members of the public come up with ""bits and bobs"" of information about other break-ins. ""We've got to be really focused and say, 'What is the link?' Some of the links we've got might disappear away,"" Det Ch Insp McHugh says. He finally gets home at 21:30. By 08:00 Det Ch Insp McHugh is on his way to offices at the Met's Hendon site, where there's an hour-long conference call with everyone involved in the inquiry. There are now 20 detectives working on the case, plus support staff and forensics experts, each involved with different strands, making it vital that everyone is kept up to speed. ""We got a good grip on where we were,"" he says. As well as ensuring that leads are followed up and the inquiry is going in the right direction, his role, as senior investigating officer, is to ensure the team's resources and personnel are utilised in the most effective way. One of the more mundane issues is transport, given the distances between the incident room in Putney, the borough police headquarters in Colindale and the crime scene in Barnet. Sixteen staff have only three cars between them: ""It's a bit of a challenge,"" Det Ch Insp McHugh says. He co-ordinates further work, including house-to-house inquiries, and finds out whether CCTV images of the suspects can be enhanced. It's thought a group of ""opportunist thieves"" targeted Ms Whale's property, after breaking into three other addresses in the area on the same afternoon. Together with colleagues from Scotland Yard's Press Bureau, Det Ch Insp McHugh prepares statements for the media and arranges a briefing for broadcasters for the next day. He's home by 20:30 but spends a couple more hours on calls. Up at 06:00, Det Ch Insp McHugh decides to change the venue of the press briefing. It was to be held outside Ms Whale's house in Barnet but it's switched to New Scotland Yard, in Westminster - because it's pouring with rain. ""Even the dog didn't want to go out this morning it was raining so heavy,"" he says. He arrives at the Yard by 10:30 to be given some terrible news about a former colleague on the murder team, who's been told he has terminal cancer. Det Ch Insp McHugh is clearly shaken as he does interviews with reporters in which he appeals for information about jewellery stolen by the burglary gang. The media briefing contains some details he doesn't want publicised. His focus is on getting information into the public domain that will trigger a memory or even prick someone's conscience. The appeal ""gets a conversation going"" and generates a ""positive response"", he says. As a result, several witnesses are traced and various names put forward as possible suspects. Mohamed Aadam Mohamed was stabbed to death in Camden in September 2017 At 13:00, Det Ch Insp McHugh leaves for the Old Bailey to meet the family of Mohamed Aadam Mohamed, a 20-year-old stabbed to death in the back with a 12in carving knife after a confrontation in the street in Camden, north London, in September 2017. The attack was witnessed by Sgt Matthew Ebbs, who was working in plain clothes targeting drug dealers. He confronted the knifeman, who ran at the officer before fleeing, throwing his weapon away on to railway tracks. Sgt Ebbs arrested the suspect after he tripped and fell and managed to detain him with the help of a cyclist. Det Ch Insp McHugh's team are investigating the murder and the trial is at a delicate stage, so Mr Mohamed's family need as much support as they can get. He says Mr Mohamed was a much loved son whose death had left his ""dignified and supportive"" relatives ""devastated"". His brother had been fatally stabbed earlier that year, though the details of what happened can't be reported for legal reasons. ""They are a remarkable family who have lost two sons to knife crime in six months and a cousin five years ago,"" Det Ch Insp McHugh says. He'd had to cancel the meeting with Mr Mohamed's relatives two days earlier because of the Barnet case. ""I felt awful,"" he says. Ten days later, the trial is over. Erick Ekam, 19, is found guilty of Mr Mohamed's murder and sentenced to life, with a minimum of 17 years. Det Ch Insp McHugh describes Ekam as a ""wicked, dangerous"" man but praises Sgt Ebbs and the cyclist (who receive commendations for bravery). Erick Ekam, 19, was found guilty of Mohamed Aadam Mohamed's murder ""Some knife carriers rely on a street culture of 'no snitching', trying to dissuade witnesses from speaking out,"" he says. ""Here, we have amazing members of the public whose commendable actions have been critical to obtaining this conviction. ""For witnesses in other investigations who are wavering on whether to speak to the police, just look at the difference you could make to a family and our community. It is truly life changing. Do not listen to the rhetoric of the gangs."" Det Ch Insp McHugh works from home - he has to make sure his team are dealing with the growing amount of CCTV material that's been collected in the Maureen Whale case and that items seized from the scene have been sent for analysis. The results of the post-mortem examination, on Friday, are studied closely. It gives the cause of Ms Whale's death as coronary heart disease - she had not been assaulted. Police later say her death was brought on by the stress of the break-in. More than a hundred people were killed in London during 2018 Det Ch Insp McHugh continues to make calls throughout the day, as detectives carry out more house-to-house inquiries. The weekend is a ""brilliant opportunity"" to do that, he says, as people who aren't at home during weekdays are back. He writes up a decision log of the investigation. It's a vital record of the key decisions made by the senior investigative officer in a major and complex inquiry - as well as the reasons for the action taken. The log provides an audit trail that can be followed if the case is reviewed or if new material comes to light. Senior investigating officers are arguably the most accountable officers in the police service. The inquiry pivots around them and every decision they take - from setting the investigative strategy to managing the crime scene, from liaising with their managers to dealing with the press - is ""their call"" and open to scrutiny. Det Ch Insp McHugh travels to the police incident room at his office in Putney to co-ordinate work on the Barnet inquiry. He asks colleagues for more detail and analysis of burglaries in the borough as detectives try to find possible links to the break-in at Ms Whale's house. Work is intensifying to find two people who were spotted locally and who looked similar to the suspects. A lot of officers are involved in tracking the pair down and it becomes ""a mini-inquiry"" within the investigation. It takes a further 48 hours before detectives are satisfied they're not linked to the case. Police are also focusing their efforts on the local Iceland store where Ms Whale used to do her shopping. They're scouring CCTV for an image of her handbag, which was stolen in the break-in and is still missing. They eventually find a photo of it - and match it to a black, leather-like handbag, which is discovered the following Thursday, stuffed in a hedge half a mile from Ms Whale's home. Could this be the breakthrough detectives are waiting for? The bag is sent for forensic analysis. Det Ch Insp McHugh chairs an office meeting. It's a ""great opportunity to piece the jigsaw together"" in the inquiry, he says. His main focus is preparing for another public appeal about the Barnet burglary. The suspects have yet to be identified or arrested. Detectives have urged pawnbrokers to look out for these items of jewellery stolen from Maureen Whale's house Sometimes, when there's a lot competing news, one of the difficulties for detectives is maintaining media coverage of a case. Fresh snippets about the crime, photographs and quotes from relatives can help to keep it in the public eye and boost the chance of getting information. At the same time, some details may be held back, either because they're too sensitive or to give detectives an advantage when they come to question a suspect. Det Ch Insp McHugh finalises the text of a press release about Ms Whale's death, which declares police are officially treating it as a case of ""manslaughter"". He puts together a statement from Ms Whale's nephew, Lawrence, and her niece, Gina. ""It is heartbreaking that our Aunt Maureen is no longer with us - this last week has felt like a nightmare,"" they say. ""This must have been a truly terrifying ordeal for her. All we think about now is of how vulnerable and scared she must have felt. ""She was a private, independent woman who was extremely proud and didn't deserve to die in this way. We urge people to come forward. The police need the names of those responsible."" Det Ch Insp McHugh and his team are officially off-call at 07:00. It's meant to be their rest day but it's cancelled because they're out in the Barnet area publicising their appeal. ""We've never had that Tuesday off in all the time that's been there - because we keep getting investigations,"" he says. He says during the inquiry into the murder of Mohamed Aadam Mohamed some of his team didn't have a day off for 20 days. They apparently slept on the floor of the office, he says - along with the mice. All in a week's work for a murder detective. Police are continuing to investigate the death of Maureen Whale.

Answers to your most-asked snow questions,"Wintry weather has grounded flights, closed hundreds of schools, and caused travel chaos across the UK. But while commuters frantically clawed at the ice on their windscreens, many took to  the web to ask all manner of snow-related questions. Here are the answers to some of the most-searched. See how cold it is where you are When it comes to de-icing your car, patience is a virtue. For starters,don't do what this driver didand leave only a tiny gap in their snow-covered windscreen before driving off. Police Scotland has released images of the car stopped on the A9 at Thurso When you use the car's heater to defrost the windows, increase the heat gradually or it'll create extra mist. Brush off the snow from the car's exterior, including the front grille. Don't use boiling water to de-ice windscreens - hot water can crack the glass, and the water will only freeze again on the screen or on the ground where you are standing. Instead, spray the windscreen with plenty of de-icer and use a scraper to remove the frost from the entire screen. A squirt of WD-40 can also prevent door locks freezing up. If they do, heat your key with a lighter to melt the ice. But if you fancy a more extreme solution, you could takethe approach Russians used to de-ice their airplanes: find leftover jet fighter engines and use them to blast hot air at the affected areas. (Results not guaranteed.) Sadly, rounding off your lunch of crisps and chocolate with a fizzy vitamin C tablet isn't a surefire way to stave off the office cold. It mainly comes down to - no surprises here - eating well, sleeping properly, and exercising enough. TheNHS recommends,externaleating plenty of fruit and veg, as well as a hearty breakfast to set you up for the day. Milk and dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt and fromage fraisare also great sources,externalof protein, vitamins and calcium. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't have to be below zero to snow. You can start wishing for a snow day as soon as the temperature drops below 2Â°C. According to the Met Office,external, most of the UK's heaviest snowfalls tend to be when the temperature sits between 0Â°C and 2Â°C. Any hotter than that and the snowflakes will melt and fall as sleet or rain. Gritters may have been out in force - but the ""grit"" they've been laying is actually rock salt. Salt lowers the freezing point of water, so it stops ice forming and causes existing ice or snow to melt. Gritter overturns during icy weather In a word, carefully. Stopping distances are greater in snow and ice. Allow extra time, plan your journey, wear warm clothes, and make sure your phone is properly charged. Stock up on chocolate, biscuits and hot drinks, in case you get stuck. This video can not be played Five handy winter driving tips After de-icing your car, use second gear to pull away, lifting the clutch gently to avoid wheel spin. Stay in a higher gear for better control as you pick up speed. Maintain the right speed for the conditions- not too fast so that you risk losing control, but not so slow that you risk losing momentum when you need it. If your school has declared a snow day, you've got your head teacher to thank. They are usually the ones who decide whether to close the school. Do I have to go to work in the snow? The decisionis based onthe welfare of children, taking into account whether: children can get to and from school safely the site is safe there are enough staff to supervise the students. If the weather is fine in the morning, but scheduled to get worse later in the day, the school may decide to close for the whole day. Most people know it's white and cold and falls from the sky. But what actually is it? Asthe Met Office explains,external, snow forms when tiny ice crystals in clouds stick together, becoming snowflakes. If enough of these crystals stick together, they'll become heavy enough to fall to the ground. As the snowflakes drift down from the sky, those falling through moist air that is slightly warmer than 0Â°C will melt at the edges and stick together, producing big flakes. This type of snow is ""wet"" and makes for good snowmen. ""Dry snow"", which is ideal for snow sports, comes from snowflakes that fall through cold, dry air, producing small, powdery flakes.

Taking a knife to Westfield,"J Hus was jailed for eight months on Friday, after being found guilty of carrying a knife For many people living in east London, the Westfield that opened in Stratford in 2011 was a blessing. J Hus probably only has bad memories of it. The shopping centre has been the setting for numerous arrests and altercations the rapper's been involved in over the last seven years. He wassentenced on Fridayto eight months in prison, after admitting to carrying a knife when a car he was in was stopped outside the shopping centre. It wasn't the first time he'd been in trouble there. Stratford Westfield is the largest shopping centre in Europe When J Hus - real name Momodou Jallow, of Baldwin Drive, Peterborough - was 16, in 2011, he was arrested outside Westfield following a ""mass attack"" on four people, which ended in one of them being stabbed. He'd already received a referral order that year after being caught with a knife in public. Four years later, he was released on bail after chasing a man down the road outside Westfield with three or four other people, ""brandishing a large combat knife or a machete"". While still on bail, the following year, he was chased down by police and found in possession of a ""large silver combat style knife"" in Hackney, which he said he intended to hand in. The court heard that J Hus ""failed"" to leave his past behind him after finding success with music In 2015, J Hus was stabbed twice, something judge Sandy Canavan said had resulted in mild PTSD - post-traumatic stress disorder. When asked why he was carrying a six-inch blade following the most recent arrest, J Hus said: ""You know, it's Westfield."" Just six days earlier, a friend of J Hus was sitting in a car owned by the rapper, when he was stabbed and left paralysed. ""What was your response?"" the judge asked on Friday. ""It was to go to Westfield in Stratford with a lock knife in your possession. There was absolutely no good reason for you to go shopping there, you could have gone somewhere where you would not be so easily recognisable, would not be under threat, where you would not need to carry a knife. ""Instead you chose to go somewhere, understanding the risks, where you would be very likely to be recognised, both by those who liked and admired you and those who did not and who might wish you harm."" J Hus was unable to perform at Wireless following his arrest but performed at Parklife earlier in the summer After previous arrests J Hus said the reason he carried a knife was fear. He'd had problems with gangs in Newham, the area he grew up in. The 23-year-old moved his family from there to Peterborough, but was still drawn back to Westfield like a ""moth to a flame"", according to the judge. Out of 44 police services in England and Wales,38 have recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. The increase is the result of cuts to youth funding, according to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who says it's a problem that could take 10 years to solve. This video can not be played Knife crime could take a ""generation"" to solve, according to Sadiq Khan Some people though have blamed violent music such as UK drill, which often features darker lyrics. Grime artist Novelist has described it as ""murder music"". J Hus has been credited for helping lead a chart-friendly genre referred to as afro swing or afrobashment, which fuses elements of music from the Caribbean and Africa with the UK. His debut album Common Sense was nominated for a BRIT award as well as the Mercury Prize. But his lyrics still referenced the violence he'd grown up living around. The track Dark Vader, which was released this year, was taken off the Radio 1 and 1Xtra playlist following his arrest in June. Common Sense reached number six in the UK chart, and got J Hus Mercury Prize and Brit Award nominations It featured lyrics about a ""skeng"" - a patois term for a knife or gun. ""If I can't have you, nobody can / Bare face so they all know who I am / If you saw what the skeng done to the man / You wouldn't look at me, you'd go look your friend."" Dianne Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said in parliament this week that ""much of the drill music and videos are horrifying and appalling"". ""But at the end of the day, the music is a reflection of those young people's lives and realities. ""It is not a cause of violent crime.""

Do I have to go to work in the snow?,"It may not be a return of the Beast from the East, but snow and ice is now causing considerable disruption in the UK. Hundreds of schools have shut, transport has been disrupted, and people have been told to prepare to change any travel plans. People whose journey to work is difficult should be aware of their rights if they want to take the day off. In most cases you are not automatically entitled to pay if you are unable to get to work because of travel disruption or bad weather. If your employer normally provides your travel to work and this has been cancelled because of the bad weather you should still be paid,according to the employment advice and conciliation service Acas.,external It is a good idea for employees to remind themselves of their contract. Some jobs may also have a specific clause written in, or have a collective agreement in place, which means an employer will pay staff who cannot get to work owing to circumstances beyond their control. Some employers might also make discretionary, informal arrangements. For example, they may let employees work from home, or agree that the time can be made up at a later date. No, all employees have the right to take unpaid time off to deal with emergency situations for their children or other dependants. Lawyers suggest that a school being shut at short notice is likely to be considered an emergency. Strictly, the day would be unpaid but some employers are more forgiving. How to drive in snow and icy weather How to prepare for the snow Acas advises,externalyou talk to your employer as soon as you can to explain that you need to take time off and the likely length of the absence. It says one option is that you jointly agree to take the day as annual leave so you do not miss out on pay. Only with sufficient warning. The law states that you must be given a warning period of ""at least"" double the length of annual leave you are being asked to take. So, if your employer wants you to take one day's annual leave, for example, they would need to give you two days' notice. There is an exception - when the workplace has been closed owing to the weather. In those circumstances an employer cannot demand staff take the time as annual leave. Workers are also entitled to be paid. The employer can still ask you to work from home, or ask you to go to another workplace that is open if the business has one, according togovernment advice website Gov.uk.,external No. The Health and Safety Executive recommends,externala minimum temperature of 16C for offices where the work is deskbound and fairly sedentary. If the work requires physical effort, the minimum recommended temperature is 13C. These temperatures are not a legal requirement but your employer has a duty to provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. If low temperatures make it unsafe for workers, then Acas says you should be allowed to wear warmer clothing, take extra breaks to make hot drinks and also be allowed to bring in extra heating options such as portable heaters. However, if you are vulnerable in any way, such as being pregnant, then you may be sent home to protect your health, and this would usually be on full pay.

Venezuela opposition 'speaking to army',"This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Venezuela's self-declared interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ has said his family has been threatened, amid the country's continuing political crisis. In a speech at Venezuela's Central University, he said police had visited his family home looking for his wife. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself president this month and was immediately recognised by the US and several Latin American countries. Russia and China back President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. Military support is seen as crucial to Mr Maduro's hold on power. But Mr GuaidÃ³ says he has held secret meetings with the military to win support for ousting Mr Maduro. Who is backing who in Venezuela Why the military is sticking with Maduro What's behind the political crisis? Protests have been held across the country since Mr Maduro began his second term on 10 January. He was elected last year during a controversial vote in which many opposition candidates were barred from running, or jailed. About three million people have fled Venezuela amid acute economic problems. ""Right now, special forces were at my home asking for Fabiana,"" said the opposition leader during a speech at the university. ""The dictatorship thinks they will frighten us. I received this information before I came here. But I didn't start with that. I started with a plan for all Venezuelans."" Addressing security forces directly, he said: ""I will hold you responsible for any intimidation of my baby, who is just 20 months old."" This video can not be played Juan GuaidÃ³: ""Maduro's regime is killing young, poor people on the streets"" The self-proclaimed president had been speaking as part of an event outlining his broad vision for the future direction of the country. Mr GuaidÃ³ called for the ""re-establishment of public services"", measures to tackle the worsening humanitarian crisis, and support for the ""most vulnerable sectors"" of the economy. His ""Plan Venezuela"" also focused on restoring oil production. ""We want a child who is born in any Venezuelan state to aspire to as much as, or more, than any child who lives in Madrid, Barcelona or Bogota or in any other part of the world,"" he said. He called on Venezuelans to gather together on Saturday as part of fresh protests to demand ""humanitarian assistance"", before asking for foreign diplomats to accompany him home to help protect his family. Later on Thursday he told the Reuters news agency that a change in the country's government would be advantageous to Russia and China, who support Mr Maduro. ""What most suits Russia and China is the country's stability and a change of government,"" he said, adding that Venezuela would be ""responsible"" to its creditors and bondholders. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? The crisis in seven charts Mr GuaidÃ³ earlier said he had held ""clandestine meetings with members of the armed forces and the security forces"". He did not say who he had been speaking to. Venezuela's top military representative to the US Col JosÃ© Luis Silva has defected- but senior military figures in Venezuela have supported Mr Maduro. As head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. Venezuela's Supreme Court has banned the opposition leader from leaving the country, however, and frozen his bank accounts. Mr Maduro told Russian news agency RIA he was prepared to hold talks with the opposition ""for the good of Venezuela"" but would not accept ultimatums or blackmail. The military has so far supported Mr Maduro (C) He insisted he had the backing of the military, accusing deserters of conspiring to plot a coup. Many officers hold posts as ministers or other influential positions. On Thursday, the European Parliament voted, in a non-binding resolution, to recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president until fresh elections can be called. The parliament has no foreign policy powers but urged the European Union and its member states to follow suit. The EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said it had agreed to create a contact group with Latin American nations aimed at resolving the crisis, but had set a 90-day deadline to find a political solution. The United Nations has told Mr GuaidÃ³ that it is willing to increase humanitarian aid to the country but required the consent of Mr Maduro's government, a spokesman said. The US government warned Mr Maduro there would be consequences for ""egregious"" acts of intimidation against Mr GuaidÃ³, a senior US official told the Reuters news agency.

Sanders: 'God wanted Trump as president',"Sarah Sanders also said it was ""very hard"" to take morality lessons from the Democratic Party White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has told a religious television network that God ""wanted Donald Trump to become president"". Ms Sanders made the claim in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), saying it was the reason Mr Trump was in office. The press secretary also said it was ""very hard"" to take morality lessons from the Democratic Party. Democrats have attacked Mr Trump's proposed border wall as immoral. US evangelicals strongly support the president. The Washington Post reports Mr Trump won 80% of the white evangelical vote,externalin 2016, a higher share than Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain in previous elections. Trump's unlikely Christian covenant The evangelical women who reject Trump CBN broadcast the interview with Ms Sanders on Wednesday,external, conducted by David Brody and Jennifer Wishon. Responding to Mr Brady's question about Mr Trump's position, Ms Sanders said: ""I think God calls all of us to fill different roles at different times and I think that He wanted Donald Trump to become president."" ""That's why he's there and I think he has done a tremendous job in supporting a lot of the things that people of faith really care about."" What has Trump achieved at half-way mark? Mr Trump has hosted faith leaders in the Oval Office When asked about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi position on the proposed border wall - a divisive issue at the heart ofthe longest US government shutdown in history- the press secretary attacked Ms Pelosi's suggestion such a barrier was immoral. ""Honestly, it's very hard at this point to even take a lecture from Democrats on what is moral and what isn't,"" she said, calling it a ""ridiculous charge"" and saying Ms Pelosi ""may even regret making that comment"". ""Protecting the people of your country... is the fundamental duty of being president of the United States,"" Ms Sanders said. The interview comes days after Mr Trump tweeted his support for Bible study. Several states have legislation pending that would make Bible literacy courses part of public school education.

Senator wins damages after garden attack,"Mr Paul was attacked over a gardening faux pas Senator Rand Paul has been awarded more than $580,000 (Â£441,000) after his neighbour attacked him and broke six of his ribs in a gardening dispute. Rene Boucher, 60, pleaded guilty to attacking the senator in November 2017. The argument arose over the Republican's habit of leaving garden waste on the border of their properties in Bowling Green, Kentucky. A court awarded the senator $375,000 in punitive damages, $200,000 for pain and nearly $8,000 for medical costs. Mr Boucher's lawyer said his client would appeal against the decision. He had already received a $10,000 fine and a 30-day prison term last June. US senator Rand Paul assaulted at home In a tweet, Mr Paul said the lawsuit was ""about all of us and what we find acceptable as a society"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Paul, the junior senator for Kentucky, is a Tea Party supporter and ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 . The attack however was not politically motivated. Mr Boucher said he had become irritated by the way the conservative senator left garden waste near the grounds of his home. When he saw Mr Paul blowing leaves onto his lawn, Mr Boucher ran over and tackled him to the ground. The senator reportedly told the court that after the attack ""the thought crossed my mind that I may never get up from this lawn again"". Mr Paul had reportedly sought up to $1 million in punitive damages and $500,000 in compensation.

What preparations are being made for a no-deal?Brexit jargon explainedBrexit: What could happen next?Why Dutch fear no deal will leave onions to rotHow has business been affected by Brexit?,"Police, the government, the Border Force and ferry companies are among those preparing for a no-deal Brexit It could become the UK's biggest peacetime emergency in almost a century. Unless a withdrawal agreement is approved (or Article 50 is delayed), at 23:00 GMT on 29 March the UK will leave the European Union with no negotiated exit - and in a second everything will change. Suddenly, British goods going to the EU will be subject to duty (a payment, for example on imports and exports), and will need to be checked for compliance with things like sanitary regulations. Goods arriving in the UK from the EU could face checks too, though the government has said it will not do that straight away, partly because it doesn't have the infrastructure. Brexit: A really simple guide What is it all about? Brexit explained in videos The jargon explained The rules around things like fishing rights, air traffic and nuclear regulation will all change in the blink of an eye too. The effect is likely to be a severe slowdown on the critical Dover-Calais ferry and Channel Tunnel routes, as well as unpredictable delays at airports. An army of civil servants has been working on the problem since the EU referendum. At the time of writing, about 4,000 have been moved into positions where they are preparing for the no deal scenario. As we get closer, another 5,000 will be transferred across to help. On the night of Brexit, the government is expected to declare a ""critical incident"" and to start operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week in a ""command and control"" mode. The Cobra emergency committee will meet at the Cabinet Office as ministers sit down to tackle the unpredictable effects of leaving the EU without a deal. The Ministry of Defence has promised to make 3,500 service personnel available to help. About 10% of these will be reservists. An order laid before Parliament under the Reserve Forces Act says they can be called upon from 10 February. There are 14 military planners already working in other Whitehall departments. But despite all that, the chief executive of the civil service, John Manzoni, still concedes that a no-deal Brexit could be a ""bit bumpy"". The biggest concern is that lorry traffic across the English Channel through Dover and the Channel Tunnel terminal near Folkestone will grind to a standstill. To manage that, Highways England, Kent County Council and Kent Police have come up with Operation Brock - a plan for parking up to 13,000 trucks who could be left waiting to get through. The first 2,000 will park on the southbound carriageway of the M20 between junctions eight and nine, 6,000 more will be moved to Manston Airport, and if that's not enough then the M26 will be used to hold another 5,000. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise The government has given Kent County Council Â£28.8m to improve Manston, to strengthen the roads around it (such as the A249, A256 and the A299), and for new signs and traffic signals, This way it is hoped that the county of Kent will not itself stop functioning, as happened during a strike at Calais in 2015. The government expects there will be ""significantly reduced access across the short straits"" for up to six months. The government has also announced temporary measuresallowing lorries arriving in the UK to drive straight off ferries and Channel Tunnel trains without making customs declarations in the event of no-deal. The guidance for importers and hauliers says companies would be able to file a simplified form online in advance and pay duty later. Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Simplified customs plan for ports If Dover and Folkestone suddenly become slow and unpredictable ways of getting goods - some of them critical, like medical supplies - in and out, the government is hoping other routes will take more of the traffic. Saying ""a situation of extreme urgency exists"", the Department for Transportis paying a total of Â£107.7m to three ferry companiesto run extra ships. Ramsgate harbour needs to be dredged to clear access for larger ships Brittany Ferries will increase sailings for six weeks on the Portsmouth-Le Havre, Poole-Cherbourg and Plymouth-Roscoff routes. DFDS will increase the number of crossings on some of its routes. A new company -Seaborne Freight- had been asked by the government to run ships between Ramsgate and Ostend, butthe contract was later scrapped.The government said it had become clear that Seaborne was not going to be able to fulfil its side of the contract, and it is looking for another company to run additional freight ferries. Port companies such as Associated British Ports (ABP) have been improving the infrastructure at ports away from Dover in anticipation of increased traffic. The Department of Health (DoH) has developed extensive contingency plans, and has started to stockpile six weeks' worth of prescription-only and pharmacy medicines. It has signed Â£1m of contracts for refrigerated storage for approximately 5,000 pallets of medicine and another Â£9m for what is called ""ambient storage"", that is storage at room temperature. It has also been agreed in Whitehall that medicines and medical products would be given priority on freight routes, though it's not clear how that would work. The DoH has also made plans to air freight items like medical radioactive isotopes (used in radiotherapy and diagnostic tests) that have a very short shelf-life. Is NHS finding it hard to get medicines? Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit And it has recognised that some devices with short lead times - like stents and implants that come in many different shapes and sizes - cannot be easily stockpiled. So, the department is setting up a logistics hub in Belgium to help out companies who may face disruption. Suppliers are being asked to try to make their own arrangements - and to buy tickets for the extra ferry capacity that the government has secured. But if these efforts fail, they will be able to use what is being called the ""Dedicated Shipping Channel,"" which would aim to get the devices from the hub into the UK within three days. The same problem arises when it comes to food. Food manufacturers have been stockpiling ingredients, but there is starting to be a shortage of warehouse space - both ambient and chilled. Reality Check: What would 'no deal' Brexit mean for food and medicine? My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Not many people predict a severe food crisis (the UK is about 60% self-sufficient on food), but it is likely that some fresh foods that come in on short timetables from the European Union will become scarcer. Once again, the effects are likely to be unpredictable. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is recruiting for an EU Exit Emergencies Centre (EUXE) which will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to manage ""any situations that arise if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal"". There are concerns too about what to do with excess fresh food and live animals produced in the UK if it cannot be exported in time. There have been concerns that some people - angry at a no-deal exit from the EU, or at the effects of that - will protest. In a briefing to staff, the National Crime Agency wrote: ""A no-deal exit is likely to result in significant short-term disruption across the country, which may manifest simultaneously across multiple areas and geographic locations."" Protesters outside Parliament in January when MPs voted on the government's Brexit deal The NCA said ""wider potential impacts such as transport blockages, fuel and food shortages and protests/public disorder, could impact on officers both personally and professionally"". Some police forces have stopped officers taking leave for the first weeks after Brexit, though senior officers think the risk of disorder is low. One of the effects of leaving the EU without a deal will be that British police officers will lose access to EU criminal justice tools such as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the European Investigation Order (EIO). To handle the loss of these modern tools, the NCA - which communicates with overseas forces and Europol - has recruited 87 officers to use the much less effective Interpol system and to use other arrangements that are less automated and more labour-intensive. An International Crime Co-ordination Centre is being set up by the National Police Chiefs Council as part of what is being called Operation Safety Net to help forces with things like international manhunts and missing people inquiries. To prepare for changes in immigration and customs at all points of entry into the UK, a Border Delivery Group has been established, chaired by Karen Wheeler, a senior official at HMRC. The government has admitted that the UK's borders are likely to operate in a ""sub-optimal"" way if there is a no-deal Brexit. The Border Force has recruited about 300 officers to make up a ""Readiness Task Force"" to provide ""operational resilience"" and allow other staff to do EU-related training. It is also recruiting a further 600 officers to make sure there are enough staff at the borders. In the event of no-deal, the UK will need to patrol its fishing waters much more extensively than it has for many years. The Royal Navy has already reprieved three Fishery Protection Patrol ships that were due to be taken out of service. It is preparing to provide 600 days a year of fishery protection, three times what it currently provides. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO), which regulates the seas around Britain, is also to pay up to Â£40m to charter civilian ships to help them patrol fisheries over the next four years The proposed contract - for up to four years - is due to start on 1 April. Brexit and fish: Skippers, kippers and the creel thing Will the UK and EU reach a Brexit fishing deal? It is to provide ships to help the MMO's Marine Enforcement Officers with a means of getting around the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the seas around the UK. The contract says the ships must have a way of boarding other vessels. 12 key Brexit words you need to know Brexit: A really simple guide What happens now that a deal's been done?

Brexit jargon explainedBrexit: What could happen next?Why Dutch fear no deal will leave onions to rotHow has business been affected by Brexit?,"The UK and the European Union are in talks about how they could live and work together after Brexit. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - here is what some of the key ones mean. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Britain's exit from the European Union. A period lasting from 31 January to 31 December 2020, when the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but still follows all its rules. It was agreed by the UK and the EU to allow both sides time to reach a deal on their future relationship. Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers such as: Taxes that must be paid when trading Limits on how much of certain goods can be imported Rules on things such as hygiene or labelling of food How the agreement between the EU and the UK would be enforced if there is a dispute. One controversial issue has been about what role, if any, the European Court of Justice should play. A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Rules on who can fish where, and how much of each species can be caught. A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements often include level playing field measures. EU laws which prevent a government in one country from supporting companies there - over competitors in another country. This support could be financial - for instance, allowing companies to borrow more cheaply, or charging them less in tax. The 2019 agreement which set out how the UK would leave the EU. It covered: Money the UK still has to pay the EU The rights of EU citizens who already live in the UK and UK citizens in the EU The Northern Ireland protocol is part of this agreement. It set out special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid the need for checks along the Irish border. This will be the situation if the UK and the EU don't reach a trade agreement by the end of 2020. It means that both sides would have to charge tariffs - or taxes - on goods crossing borders. If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under what's called WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, where each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering, and applies them equally to all its trading partners. The government currently refers to this as an ""Australian-style deal"".

Brexit: What could happen next?Why Dutch fear no deal will leave onions to rotHow has business been affected by Brexit?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Why Dutch fear no deal will leave onions to rotHow has business been affected by Brexit?,"This video can not be played The BBC's Anna Holligan spoke to the Netherlands' largest onion producer about her transport plans for after Brexit ""From the Netherlands with love"" is how Chayenne Wiskerke promotes her onions. The fourth-generation farmer has grown the family company into the Netherlands' largest onion producer. But still, Brexit makes her feel helpless. ""There isn't much we can do,"" she says. ""We have to wait for the UK."" ""If things stay as they are now we would all be stuck in transit and that's not good for business or customers."" Chayenne Wiskerke, head of Wiskerke Onions, is keen to keep UK shelves stocked The current border-free frictionless trade zone means British supermarkets can order crates of onions from the Netherlands in the morning and sell them within 24 hours. Approximately â¬1.2bn (Â£1bn; $1.4bn) worth of Dutch fruit and vegetables are exported to the UK annually â that's 50,000 trucks crossing the channel every year. An Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study found that Dutch exports to the UK could drop by 17% in the event of a no-deal Brexit. While the UK's customs authority HMRC says it has ""well-developed plans"" for a functioning system from day one, fruit and vegetables are the Dutch exports most vulnerable to disruption. Dutch exporters can get their fruit and vegetables on UK shelves within 24 hours of an order Exporters operate on a ""just-in-time"" principle to ensure customers receive the freshest possible produce. Additional checks for plant health, food safety and marketing standards could create tailbacks at customs. Some officials predict a 30% increase in import inspections and a 100% increase in export inspections. Deliveries currently made within a day could take two to three days. German cars can afford to wait. Dutch tomatoes cannot, and delays reduce shelf-life. Could a no-deal Brexit cause traffic jams? Will EU blink first in Brexit standoff? Brexit border checks 'may triple queues' France fears Brexit blow to farms ""The nightmare is our tomatoes and cucumbers rotting at the border,"" says Gert Mulder, director of GroentenFruit Huis, the national fruit and vegetable growers' body. ""British supermarkets have stock for around three days. They don't have any storage capacity,"" he points out. ""So it would have to be built. But there isn't time. The orders have already been placed. The plants are already growing. ""Of course we read about the British who are stockpiling food. If the supply chain fails the shelves will be empty. It is our job as producers to find a solution."" The Dutch have come with an idea designed to fast-track perishable products - and they call it ""green lanes"": A digital pre-clearance system would allow customs checks to be conducted before the trucks arrive at the ports All information - from pedigree certificates to origins of the products - would be uploaded on a database UK customs officials could check lorry cargoes remotely before they even disembarked from the ferries Vehicles approved in advance would be given a special ""green lane"" to avoid any customs queues For Mart Valstar, a typical Dutch exporter who sends vegetables to the UK, the innovation makes sense. Mr Valstar explains how the green lane idea would work ""We'll prepare the documents for export and for our clients to import in the UK and then our trucks will get a certificate on a green lane that they roll on the boat, roll off the boat, direct to our customers,"" he says. The alternative, he fears, is three or four days' delay at UK harbours, with knock-on congestion on the Dutch side too. The technology is ready to roll out. But there is a catch â it must be agreed by the UK. ""The British cabinet members I've spoken to push it away,"" Gert Mulder explains in frustration. ""Within days after Article 50 was triggered, we were already talking to (the UK ministry) Defra. The problem is we need the British to make decisions and we can't have bilateral talks until after the Brexit negotiations."" Brexit prompts Sony's Europe HQ move to Netherlands The UK's customs authority told the BBC that keeping goods flowing across the border was of vital importance, but it would not compromise on UK border security. A no-deal Brexit will cost the Netherlands an estimated â¬2.3bn by 2023, according to the Dutch Court of Audit. Some 35,000 Dutch companies only export to the current customs union. When the UK leaves, they'll have to deal with customs for the first time. Current rules allow fresh deliveries in as long as it takes a ferry to reach British shores In an effort to smooth the transition, the Dutch government is hiring more than 900 customs, agricultural and veterinary inspectors. Many of the new recruits have come from Eastern Europe, due to an absence of qualified vets at home. But they are still struggling to fill all the positions. No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' Hundreds buy 'Brexit Box' amid food fears Farmers seek food standards law after Brexit ""We only have about 350 trained officials,"" said Pieter Omtzigt, the Dutch parliament's Brexit rapporteur. ""The day you need them most is Brexit day, because you'll have lots of businesses that are unprepared. If we need hundreds of new inspectors, the British are going to need thousands."" And then there's Rotterdam â the biggest harbour in the EU. If the British export system gets clogged up it will have an impact on global trade. The United States, China, Russia, and Brazil could all feel the ripple-effect. Dutch producers fear the dominant trade routes will become congested and traffic will be diverted from French ports to depart from Belgium and the Netherlands. ""We are looking at alternative markets inside the EU: Bulgaria, Romania,"" Gert Mulder says. ""The market in eastern Europe is not as lucrative as the UK, but we're looking at options.""

"Sanders: 'God wanted Trump as president'In an interview, the White House press secretary says Donald Trump had divine support.US & Canada","Sarah Sanders also said it was ""very hard"" to take morality lessons from the Democratic Party White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has told a religious television network that God ""wanted Donald Trump to become president"".

The press secretary also said it was ""very hard"" to take morality lessons from the Democratic Party. Democrats have attacked Mr Trump's proposed border wall as immoral. US evangelicals strongly support the president. The Washington Post reports Mr Trump won 80% of the white evangelical vote,externalin 2016, a higher share than Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain in previous elections. Trump's unlikely Christian covenant The evangelical women who reject Trump CBN broadcast the interview with Ms Sanders on Wednesday,external, conducted by David Brody and Jennifer Wishon. Responding to Mr Brady's question about Mr Trump's position, Ms Sanders said: ""I think God calls all of us to fill different roles at different times and I think that He wanted Donald Trump to become president."" ""That's why he's there and I think he has done a tremendous job in supporting a lot of the things that people of faith really care about."" What has Trump achieved at half-way mark? Mr Trump has hosted faith leaders in the Oval Office When asked about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi position on the proposed border wall - a divisive issue at the heart ofthe longest US government shutdown in history- the press secretary attacked Ms Pelosi's suggestion such a barrier was immoral. ""Honestly, it's very hard at this point to even take a lecture from Democrats on what is moral and what isn't,"" she said, calling it a ""ridiculous charge"" and saying Ms Pelosi ""may even regret making that comment"".

"Regulate social media, MPs urgeA cross-party committee says social media companies should have a legal ""duty of care"" to children.Technology","Social media companies should have a legal ""duty of care"" to children, the UK Parliament's Science and Technology Committee has recommended. The group's report said social media had helped facilitate bullying and online grooming of children. It called for a regulator to be established to take ""enforcement action"" if apps broke the law. A number of privacy and data scandals have led to calls for social media companies to be regulated. Facebook's new vice-president Sir Nick Clegg has already pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to make the company's platforms safer for young people. Sir Nick was responding to the case of14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after viewing distressing self-harm images on Instagram in 2017. Molly Russell's father says Instagram is partly responsible for her death Her father said he believed Facebook-owned Instagram was partly responsible for his daughter's death. The committee has been looking at the effect of social media and so-called screen time on the health of children. During its inquiry, it surveyed more than 3,000 young people. It said social media had positive attributes, but also led to: damaged sleep patterns body image issues bullying online grooming sexting It said these risks had existed before social media, but the popularity of apps had helped ""facilitate"" problems, especially child abuse. The report, titled Impact of Social Media and Screen-Use on Young People's Health, was released on Thursday. It was produced by a cross-party group of MPs including Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb, Conservative Damien Moore, Labour's Liz Kendall and the SNP's Carol Monaghan. The report said social media companies should have a formal legal duty of care to their users. It suggested: establishing a regulator to minimise the harms of social media and take enforcement action making sure rules and policies are consistent across video-sharing sites, social networks and search engines a new partnership between the government, tech companies and law enforcement to tackle child exploitation online Despite the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, in which a university researcher gave the Facebook data of millions of people to a political consultancy, the report also said social networks should share more data with researchers. Facebook's popularity dips with UK children, says Ofcom Screen time 'may harm toddlers' Worry less about children's screen use, parents told Internet regulator considered for UK It argued that this could help websites identify those at risk and improve safety measures. The government is expected to publish a White Paper about online harms in the coming months, and the committee urged it to use this as an opportunity to act. The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) said it ""welcomed"" the report. Its director of external affairs, Duncan Stephenson, gave evidence to the committee. He said in a statement: ""We fully support the select committee calls to help researchers and others to better understand the long-term effects.... to our wellbeing."" On Wednesday,England's Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, published her own open lettercalling on social media firms to take more responsibility for protecting children from disturbing content. She urged them to back a legal duty of care obligation, and finance a digital ombudsman to act as an independent party between young people and the tech giants. Andy Burrows, from the children's charity NSPCC, said in a statement: ""For far too long social networks have been allowed to operate in a Wild West environment and put children at unacceptable risk. ""The government now has a crucial opportunity to set out a comprehensive plan to protect children online. ""This must include an independent statutory regulator with enforcement powers, that can impose strong sanctions on platforms that fail to keep children safe.""

Will EU blink first in Brexit standoff?How did my MP vote?Europe papers lose patience with UK,"EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier chats with commissioner and former Irish minister Phil Hogan After a public shout-out of ""no way!"" to renegotiating the Brexit backstop plan or draft withdrawal agreement, the EU now waits for the British prime minister to come to Brussels. Parliament appeared to lob the ball back in the EU's court last night, with the majority of MPs uniting around a request for alternatives to the backstop. But the EU is preparing to swing it back to the UK pronto, with a direct question to Theresa May: ""What concrete alternative do you have worked out?"" Remember that EU and UK negotiators spent 18 difficult months trying to come up with a bilaterally acceptable fallback mechanism to keep the Irish border open, in case their (still to be negotiated) post-Brexit trade deal wasn't up and running in time, or didn't fully resolve the issue. The UK-wide customs aspect of the backstop plan - where the whole of the UK would stay in a customs agreement with the EU to avoid Northern Ireland being ""isolated"" from Great Britain by remaining under EU regulations to avoid border checks - came at the prime minister's insistence, not the EU's. UK PM scores ""unconventional win"" European press lose patience with UK Brexit: All you need to know Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? No other workable alternative was found and the document was signed off by the cabinet and 27 EU leaders in late November. Touching the backstop text risks the EU seeming disloyal to member state Ireland, while caving in to departing member UK. That's a message of ""weakness"" Brussels does not want to send to international trade partners, or to the not-exactly-EU-enthusiastic governments of Poland and Italy, for example. It also risks contravening the Good Friday Agreement and the integrity of the single market. But... when push comes to shove, EU leaders want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. If it comes about, they will be answerable to their voters whose lives and businesses could well be affected. So, while taking a hard line in public, those leaders are also doing some hard thinking behind closed doors. This does not mean Brussels will do anything to get a deal. This video can not be played Numbers and nods: MPs back May's bid to change deal When it comes to the backstop, EU leaders will resist compromising on core principles. Theresa May has spoken again of seeking a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit mechanism for the UK. EU diplomats tell me she has to be more realistic. Brussels intends to stonewall her until ""the message is driven home"", they say. Expect the EU to stand very firm for now and for some tense days ahead. Brussels' deadline is 29 March, whereas the prime minister, who has promised to hold another vote on the Brexit deal, has a self-imposed deadline of mid-February. The EU will not rush to help her with that one. Brussels takes heart from the fact that the Brady amendment on the backstop, passed last night by a majority of MPs, is actually pretty ambiguous. ""If Theresa May seeks changes to the backstop,"" according to one diplomat I spoke to, ""then that might be fine if she widens her thinking as to what constitutes a 'change'."" The amendment talks about finding ""alternatives"" to the backstop. And this is something the Withdrawal Agreement already says both the EU and UK would be open to if alternatives became viable. One thought doing the EU rounds is to attach a list of possible alternatives to the backstop text. This could include technological solutions the more hard-line conservative MPs are so keen on. The EU has said time and again that technology alone is not adequate to totally do away with physical checks on the border but the option could be placed on a list of potential alternatives to be judged - as to whether they are actually workable or not - at a later stage were the backstop ever to be needed. Another idea is to take the UK-wide customs aspect out of the backstop, seeing that it provoked so much opposition in the UK, adding it instead to the above-mentioned list of ""alternatives"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. There is at the moment a huge amount of resentment in EU circles that so much about Brexit seems to them to be ""all about appeasing the Conservative Party"": the referendum itself, Theresa May's ""red lines"" on leaving the customs union and single market, and now the push for more on the divorce deal which UK civil servants negotiated and which the Prime Minister herself signed off on. EU leaders are in no hurry to convene another Brussels summit - which they would need to do if the withdrawal agreement text were to be changed. The last thing they want is to be holding one every two weeks for Theresa May until Brexit day, should she be pushed by MPs to keep coming back for more. They hope EU unity - so palpable until now - will hold while the pressure mounts. At some point in the near future, Europe's leaders will decide the right time has come to engage. To their mind, that's clearly not now. For the prime minister it will be an uncomfortable wait. Europe papers lose patience with UK Brexit amendments: How did my MP vote?

"'Day of reckoning' for special needsEnglish councils have overspent their special needs budget by ÃÂ£324m and are near ""breaking point"".Family & Education","This video can not be played The colourful 'pods' helping special needs children go to school English councils have overspent by at least Â£324m on their budgets for young adults and children with special needs this financial year, the BBC has found. Of the 136 local authorities that provided information to the BBC under Freedom of Information laws, 123 have overspent on their high needs budget. The government says it is providing an extra Â£250m to ease pressures, and Â£100m on new school places. Funding has not kept pace with the growth in extra support, say councils. Some of these extra pressures have resulted from a legal change in 2014 which handed councils responsibility for young adults' special educational needs between the ages of 18 and 25. They were already responsible for under-18s. This change led to a growth in the number of college and university students and apprentices being supported. In Dorset, since 2014, the number of under-25s on education, health and care plans - which give a legal right to specialist support - has grown by more than two-thirds. This led to the high needs budget being overspent every year, and now a Â£13m deficit is predicted for the coming financial year. Dorset county councillor Andrew Parry, who is responsible for education, said the council had run out of options. ""It is a multi-million pound problem. Up to now it's been a case of drawing on reserves, reorganising budgets. ""But there is a breaking point. ""Dorset is not alone in recognising that day of reckoning will be coming very soon,"" he said. According to the information obtained from England's councils, 76 local authorities have shifted money from other education budgets to meet their obligations to high needs children. This comes as spending per pupil in schools has fallen by 8% in real terms in England since 2010. Councils say they feel caught between legal duties and the need to balance budgets. And they are also facing growing pressure from unhappy parents, including legal challenges in the High Court. Bristol City Council had to reverse planned changes to its special needs spending, after being defeated in court last summer, over its failure to consult on the proposals. Surrey and Hackney councils are awaiting judgements in cases where parents also challenged the failure to consult and consider the needs of families who rely on special needs support.

An extra Â£250m was promised in December to be invested over the next two years, after intensive lobbying from councils. And more special school places to cater for those with the highest needs are being planned through the free school programme. Dorset is trying to find longer-term solutions to help it manage costs, such as reducing the need for children to travel out of its area for support. It is setting up five special needs units attached to schools across the county to ease the pressure on special schools and reduce the cost of out-of-area placements. One of these is up and running at Parley First School, in Ferndown, where a group of specially-designed classrooms run by specialist teaching staff have been built on to the existing mainstream school. They cater for 10 pupils who need extra support with complex communication needs. Malachi does not have a suitable school place Most of the pupils have autism spectrum disorder among their extra needs, so the classroom is designed to be calming. A special sensory room allows the boys to gradually increase the time they can join in classes in the rest of the school. Specialist teacher Sarah Rose said the work in the unit was about helping the pupils progress as a whole person. ""It might be something as simple as learning to say hello, maintain eye contact and show interest in the other person. ""It will help them with that social connection, now and in later life."" But six-year-old Malachi, who has multiple special needs, has been out of school since September, because of the difficulty in finding him a suitable place. This has forced his father, Alexander Lyes, to take six months of unpaid leave from work to help his wife Emma manage. Emma said: ""Malachi struggles every day of his life, because he's not getting the support and provisions he needs. ""I think he feels rejected because he can't go to school like every other child."" The government said it recognised the pressures on the Â£6bn high needs budget, and the additional Â£250m was intended to help over the next two years. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""Every parent rightly wants their child to get the support and education they deserve. My ambition for children with special educational needs is the same as theirs - that they succeed in education, find employment and lead a happy life."" The pressures on the high needs budget will be considered as part of the next government spending review. The situation will be watched with interest from Wales, which is introducing similar reforms with a transition to plans identifying additional learning needs up to the age of 25. In Scotland, where there has also been a trend of increasing demand, there is a presumption in law to educate most pupils with extra learning needs in mainstream schools. This has faced criticism. In Northern Ireland there has also been a rise in the number of pupils diagnosed with a special need. In addition, the Department of Education has a policy of inclusion, which has means many more pupils are educated in mainstream schools.
