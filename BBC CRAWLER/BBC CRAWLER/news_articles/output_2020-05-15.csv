The first minister said that any easing would be careful and gradual, because lives are still at stake. And while she was not yet able to give dates for when things might start to open again, she said that people ""can't live like this forever"". Ms Sturgeon said she could outline some ""minor changes"" next week. These would be unveiled alongside further details of the range of options the Scottish government has been looking at, she told her daily briefing. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest updates How lockdown rules differ between Scotland and England Why might the R number be higher in Scotland? There has already minor easing of the lockdown restrictions in England, with some people who cannot work from home returning to their workplaces on Wednesday. Most of these measures have not yet been introduced elsewhere in the UK - although the Scottish government has already relaxed its rules to allow outdoor exercise more than once a day and Wales hasoutlined a cautious route out of lockdownthat does not include any dates for when changes could be made. The number of people dying with coronavirus in Scotland has been falling over the past fortnight, but Ms Sturgeon said further lockdown changes would only be considered when ""we hopefully see more evidence of a downward trend in the virus"". And she said she would continue to err on the side of caution for as long as lives continued to be at risk. But Ms Sturgeon added: ""We can't live like this forever, so we need to get some normality back as we continue to suppress the virus. ""Even when we can't yet give firm dates on when things will open up again, at least we will seek to share with you the order of priority and further phasing. ""Next week I will share with you more information on the assessments we are making and the range of options we are now looking at, and also any further minor changes we might make in the short-term."" Scotland has been in lockdown for the past seven weeks The first minister also said that a balance would need be struck between getting the economy going again and allowing more social interaction. She said: ""A life where you go to work but stay locked down with no family interaction for the rest of the time is not one many of us, if any of us, would enjoy"". Teaching unions have been urging the Scottish government to explicitly rule out the possibility of schools reopening before the new term begins in August. Ms Sturgeon said there was no chance of schools getting back to normal ""in any way, shape or form"" before the summer holidays begin next month. She said discussions were taking place over whether it would be possible for any pupils to return to the classroom by then - but it was likely to be on a ""very limited basis"" if it was to happen at all. Few - if any - Scottish pupils are likely to return to school before the summer holidays The virus appears to have hit the central belt of Scotland and its larger cities harder than more rural areas, with Ms Sturgeon regularly warning that the infection rate - the so-called R number - continues to behigher north of the border than it is in England. Ms Sturgeon said on Thursday her government was ""not ruling out"" the possibility of more rural areas with fewer cases of the virus having their lockdowns eased first. However, she stressed that she was not proposing that approach ""at this stage"". A further 46 people in Scotland have died after testing positive for the virus, bringing the total by that measure to 2,053. However, the total number of deaths stands at more than 3,200 once those with suspected cases of Covid-19 are included. More than half of all registered deaths involving the virus continue to be happening in care homes, although the numbers have been falling. LOOK-UP TOOL:How exposed is your job?

The UK government has now started daily reporting of the R number, an important measure of how fast the virus is spreading. The latest estimate is between 0.7 and 1.0. It needs to stay below one if the virus is to remain under control. Previously it has been sitting at between 0.5 and 0.9 in England Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for primary care in England, said there was a range in the estimate because different models were being used. She also stressed it was a ""national average"" - in some places such as care homes it would be higher and in other places it would be lower. It is thought up to one in 400 people, about 148,000 individuals in England, have Covid-19 at any one time, she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New guidance says infected care home staff should keep working if not doing so would create an ""unacceptable risk"". Police Scotland issued 381 fixed penalty fines to people who breached the Covid-19 restrictions last week. The force also made 23 arrests across the country related to violations of the Scottish government's guidelines. The latest figures, for week ending 13 May, bring the total number of fines to 2,644. Fines start at Â£30, doubling to Â£60 if they are not paid within 28 days. Repeat offenders can face fines of up to Â£960. Meanwhile, the number of arrests since the lockdown was introduced now stands at 166. Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News Almost a third of forensic services staff in Scotland were absent at the end of March after showing coronavirus symptoms or due to self-isolation. AScottish Police Authority paper,externalsaid 79 people were off work on 29 March, which meant availability of staff  ""was as low as 71%"". But by 7 May the number
had fallen to 20. The report by Tom Nelson, director of Forensic
Services, said: ""Following a short period of
plateauing, there continues to be a steady reduction in the number of
Covid-19 related absences."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's teaching unions ""don't see any way"" that pupils can return to schools in June, Education Institute of Scotland chief executive Larry Flanagan tells BBC Radio Scotland. The unions have written to the Scottish government commending it on its ""cautious"" approach to ending the lockdown compared to the ""cavalier attitude"" of its UK counterpart but suggested that next month is too soon for a return to school. Given the current circumstances, where we are still in lockdown and still very cautious about the lockdown being lifted, the most pragmatic date would appear to be in August."" Larry Flanagan, EIS chief executive Rejecting a newspaper report accusing the unions of being ""militant"", he suggests teachers could return in June to prepare for an August return for pupils. However, he points out that schools and teachers would need time to prepare for a return that will be a combination of ""in-school provision and some remote learning"" and where social distancing will limit the number of pupils in school or classrooms at any one time. Classes that previously had 30 pupils are likely to be reduced to 10. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the number of deaths is ""falling each day in all settings"" and ""we are past the peak of this virus"". He promises that all residents and staff of care homes in England - both with and without symptoms - will be tested by early June Mr Hancock says Â£600m ($730m) has been made available to care homes this week to help control the infection. This is in addition to the Â£172m made available to devolved governments, he says. Follow the rest of the UK governmentbriefing here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland The families of frontline workers and social care staff in
England who die from coronavirus are entitled to a Â£60,000 one-off payment. In
Scotland, NHS staff will receive a lump sum of
twice the staff memberâs annual earnings. At the moment, social care staff are
not included in the Scottish figures. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says she has written to Scottish Care and Cosla inviting them to discuss the matter - stressing that they have responsibilities as employers - and says she will ""continue to press them to come to the table"". ""Care home workers are a vital part of the delivery of a really important service and they are working very hard in very difficult circumstances,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""Their capacity to do their job and feel valued has a direct connection to the quality of care that residents get."" The figure is now much closer to one - the point at which the virus starts spreading rapidly. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Fay Thomson has been left fearing for the future of her sister, who is a resident at the Skye care home where there have beennine deaths from Covid-19and where NHS Highland has stepped in to help run the facility. Ms Thomson, whose sister has tested positive for the virus and hopes the NHS will take permanent control, says it was a ""shock"" to hear the Care Inspectorate was taking legal action against Home Farm care home. ""We are just desperate to hear what's been going on and what's going to happen,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I've found it impossible to find out. ""Everyone knows there's been a massive shortage of care beds on Skye and it would be just disastrous if Home Farm closed. On a personal level, I'm extremely worried at the prospect of my sister being moved elsewhere because there are no places available on Skye."" It is worrying because it is pretty drastic action for the Care Inspectorate to take. Exactly what did they find?"" Fay Thomson Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland ""There are a number of very serious issues in terms of how the care home sector is structured and delivered,"" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman tells BBC Radio Scotland. However, she insists the system is not in any danger of collapsing because the government will see to it that the NHS step in anywhere where there are problems - as is the case right now at the Home Farm independent care home in Skye, where aninth resident has died today. ""That's a way of dealing with immediate problems and making sure residents get the care they should get,"" says Ms Freeman. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman, responding to claims that care workers are going to work with coronavirus symptoms because they cannot afford not to, agrees it is a ""very sad and difficult situation for them"". ""I can understand how someone feels if their normal weekly wage is between Â£400 and Â£800 and then it is reduced to a very low level,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I do think care home providers have a real responsibility here to have proper terms and conditions for their staff and I think that the level of fee they receive both from government, and also residents who fund themselves, should allow them to properly value their staff."" Ms Freeman says sheâs written to Scottish Care and Cosla, representing local services, inviting them for talks to see how the Scottish government might help. ""It is putting care home workers in a very difficult personal position when they know, as I do, that if they are symptomatic they should be at home to protect themselves and their families, and those they care for,"" she adds. ""If they are asymptomatic but test positive, they should also be at home. There should not be pressure on them to do anything other than that."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Care workers with symptoms of Covid 19 are hiding their illness and going to work because they cannot afford not to turn up, claims Deborah Clarke from trade union Unison. ""The government needs to step in and fund statutory sick pay for these workers,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""That needs to be done as a matter of urgency. ""They need more support, access to testing and training. In many months' time, I think we will be talking about post-traumatic stress disorders - it's having that much of an impact on staff. ""The care sector is in crisis - and it's been that way for a long time."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Colin McGowan Hamilton Academical have installed a fixed thermal heating camera at the main entrance to their stadium to help the club prevent illness among its staff and players - becoming the first football club in Scotland to do so. But, speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, the Scottish Premiership club's chief executive, Colin McGowan, admits he does not know when the country's professional football will restart. ""We just need to be guided by our governing bodies and the government,"" he says.""It will happen when it happens."" ""It is only a first line of defence,"" he adds. ""It won't actually tell us if the individual has Covid-19, but it would instantly alert us to something that's not right at that point and maybe help us stop a person who is infected entering the stadium.""

Lockdown in Wales could be relaxed in two weeks,"This video can not be played Coronavirus lockdown exit plan for Wales 'puts health first' There could be ""more things we are able to do"" in two weeks' time as Wales moves slowly out of lockdown, the first minister said. ""We are already in the red zone,"" Mark Drakeford said, as he unveiled a plan for returning to some form of normality. While no dates were given, he said his ""traffic lights"" route out of lockdown also included amber and green stages. There have been restrictions on daily life for seven weeks. ""We've already begun to leave lockdown as it was originally imposed and I am hopeful that, provided coronavirus remains at or below the levels we currently see, there will be more things we will be able to do in the red zone at the end of the current three weeks,"" he said. Lockdown has been in force since March A further three weeks of lockdown were announced last Friday, and Mr Drakeford added: ""We've got to be confident that the initial moves that we make don't inadvertently result in coronavirus being on the rise again."" The cautious route out of lockdown is ""putting people's health first"", he said. ""All our decisions will be based on the latest scientific advice. ""We will act carefully and cautiously, in partnership with people, in a way that is right for Wales. And we will put people's health first."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the UK and Welsh governments have worked closely together every step of the way. ""I am glad that this announcement brings that alignment even closer, providing more certainty for jobs and businesses across Wales."" Welsh Conservatives leader Paul Davies described it as ""a roadmap to a cul-de-sac, not a roadmap to recovery"", and a ""hopeless plan"". ""We need to begin to unlock society but Mark Drakeford seems to have lost his keys,"" he said. Who am I allowed to meet now? Welsh government 'not told about stay alert' Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the strategy was ""thin on detail"" and how it will end community transmission. He added New Zealand's model of driving down the R number to reduce avoidable deaths and ""eradicate"" new cases should be mirrored in Wales, and local lockdowns for clusters should eventually be considered. ""The onus will fall on the Welsh Government to urgently change gear on testing and tracing to allow us to move safely on to the next phase on the path to recovery,"" he said. The Brexit Party tweeted: ""Welsh Labour are playing politics during a pandemic. It's time to end the confusion and work on a UK-wide approach to fighting the virus."" The opening of garden centres was described as the ""first steps on our recovering journey"" after lockdown was introduced in March There has been pressure from some quarters for a faster easing of the lockdown in a bid to restart the economy. In England, a similar plan includes suggested timetables. In Wales, the government is using a traffic-light system for phased reductions in the lockdown. ""While the traffic light approach is useful, employers are still waiting for clear guidance about how they will be able to re-open premises and resume work safely in accordance with Welsh legislation,"" said Ian Price, director of industry body CBI Wales. ""Indicative timelines outlining when sectors and workplaces can come back online are also needed, so businesses of all shapes and sizes can quickly ramp-up essential restart planning and decision-making."" Mr Drakeford stressed the country was only now moving ""carefully and cautiously"" into the first red zone, what he called the ""first steps on our recovering journey"". Providing the virus remained under control, Wales would move to the amber zone which would see more signs of returning to normal. The ""green zone"" would come when the country was ""still on top of the virus"". There life would begin to look more like it was before coronavirus began ""but not identical to it,"" warned Mr Drakeford. He said until a vaccine or effective treatment was found, coronavirus would be ""with us for a long time to come"". Mr Drakeford said it would be ""self-policing"" rather than police officers enforcing rules which gets Wales through the crisis as officers' jobs will become harder if different sectors move out of restrictions at different times. The people of Wales ""need hope"" in terms of how restrictions are lifted, he said, and that his plan provided ""more detail than we've ever had before"". The Welsh Government says it would like to bring some children back to school before the summer holidays Mr Drakeford said the ""ambition"" was to get some children ""back into school before the summer break"". Education Minister Kirsty Williams published a document she said would be a ""stimulus for wider discussion and feedback"" on how social distancing and other measures will be implemented. Most schools have been closed since the start of the pandemic, with some open for the children of critical workers and those deemed as vulnerable. ""Nothing would make me happier than seeing our classrooms full again,"" Ms Williams said. ""But I want to be clear that this framework does not - and I will not - set an arbitrary date for when more pupils will return to school. ""Setting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do."" She said it will not be one decision but ""a series of decisions over time"". Ms Williams said when Wales was ready to move into the next phase, she would make sure there is enough time for preparation and for staff to carry out necessary training. Five key principles for schools returning - set out in April - focus on safety and mental, emotional and physical wellbeing of students and staff. The UK government intends schools in England to re-open to more pupils before the holiday, but there is no such timetable in the Welsh Government's roadmap. The theme throughout this Welsh Government document is caution - a slow and careful unfolding of the lockdown which will require difficult choices about priorities. It says an effective system of track and trace is essential as is the continued compliance of the general public. The document warns the capacity of the Welsh Government to put robust systems in place will dictate the timetable. A traffic lights system of red, amber and green gives lists of likely easements at different stages - but that depends on the headroomoffered by the R rate, indicating the disease's ability to spread, which will remain the focus. While easements are complicated and interlinked, it will be necessary to choose between them and those which offer the greatest relief for general quality of life will be prioritised. But the message is clear that ""normal life"" could be years away. The general public are invited to share their views on the way forward. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Coronavirus in Wales: Updates from Friday,"Wales will act carefully and cautiously in lifting Covid-19 restrictions, says First Minister Mark Drakeford as he unveils a roadmap of the way out of lockdown Education Minister Kirsty Williams says she 'will not set an arbitrary date' for more pupils to return to lessons Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales is ""one week away"" from being overrun by coronavirus, a consultant claims A further nine people with coronavirus have died in Wales, taking the total to 1,173 To date, 46,542 individuals have been tested for coronavirus Deaf people or those with hearing loss will struggle to communicate if more people wear non-medical face masks, a charity says James McCarthy, Gareth Vincent, Andy Roberts and Rhiannon Beacham That's it for the live page for Friday. Thank you all for joining us. Here are the main points from today:   Welsh universities face
a serious threat to their financial position as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to analysis from Cardiff Universityâs Wales Governance
Centre. The report by Cian SiÃ´n,
a researcher on the Wales fiscal analysis programme, takes into account
predicted falls in international and home student enrolment, and estimates the
sector could lose between Â£100m and Â£140m in 2020-21 from fee income alone. The report reveals the
sectorâs importance to the Welsh economy, with universities providing 17,300
full-time jobs, contributing 4.8% of gross value added and accounting for 32.5%
of the countryâs research and development spending. According to the
analysis, the three institutions with potentially the most to lose if there is
a fall in international student recruitment are Cardiff University, Cardiff
Metropolitan University and Bangor University.  This video can not be played Rainbow lights shine for carers at Prisoner village A
spectacular light show to thank carers during the coronavirus pandemic has lit
up the village that was home to 1960s TV cult classic Prisoner. The village of Portmeirion in Gwynedd was turned into a rainbow of
colour. Location
manager Meurig Jones described it as a ""beautiful, wonderful
experience"". Portmeirion became famous as the back drop for the TV show starring Patrick
McGoohan, and is home to hotels, restaurants and spectacular gardens - all
designed by Sir Clough Williams-Elis. Former Swansea City player Darren Pratley says the thought of returning to footballis ""a bit frightening""as BAME players are more at risk from Covid-19. The Office for National Statistics says black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die from coronavirus as white people in England and Wales. Charlton midfielder Pratley, 35, whose father is Jamaican, admits he has concerns about the prospect of elite football resuming. ""We've been told that BAME footballers are at higher risk, which is concerning being mixed raced,"" said Pratley, who won two promotions with Swansea during a five-year stint in Wales. The UK government has pledged an extra Â£35m to support Wales in the fight
against coronavirus. Wales' devolved administration will get the extra cash as a
result of the UK governmentâs investment in care homes in England. That is to
control infections, increase testing and clinical support, and ensure English councils have plans in place to support care homes. The UK government has now given Â£2.1bn to tackle coronavirus in Wales. Secretary
of State for Wales, Simon Hart, said: âWe are doing everything we can to
ensure Wales overcomes this crisis."" Ramadan is a ""transformative month"" and about developing a new appetite for charitable giving and community, according to Mo Janneh. But this year, with mosques closed, fasting and prayers are being observed behind closed doors because of lockdown. Mr Janneh describes what he is doing to keep the spirit of Ramadan alive forthe BBC1 Wales show The Great Indoors, available now on iPlayer. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Keeping Ramadan spirit alive under lockdown Coronavirus
could cost Cardiff council Â£29m in additional spend and lost revenue in the
first three months of the financial year. A
statement from cabinet to the council has laid bare the expense involved in
dealing with impact of the pandemic. The
authority estimates it will spend more than Â£18m responding to the crisis and a
further Â£11m could be lost in income by the end of June as a result of Covid-19. The cabinet
member for finance, modernisation and performance, Councillor Chris Weaver, said:
âCardiff council has reacted quickly to the crisis, changing the way we work,
putting clear focus on maintaining essential services which deliver for our
most vulnerable residents. âOver
the past two months our services have had to respond and adapt to the crisis as
events continued to unfold.â The
council hopes to claim back the Â£18m expenditure from the Welsh Government through
the Covid-19 Hardship Fund. To date the council has received Â£465,000 to
cover Covid-related spend during the latter weeks of March. âWe
are working now on the implications of moving towards what is likely to be a new normal as lockdown restrictions are eased and the recovery phase begins,â
Councillor Weaver added. âThere
may be significant financial implications, with income streams in particular
likely to take a considerable time to come back to normal levels.â A mother has described the fears for her five-month-old baby daughter after the infant developed a rare reaction to coronavirus. Hannah Godwin, from Risca, in Caerphilly county borough, said she and father Simon were left to ""watch and wait"" as baby Leia fought for her life. Medics initially thought the child may have had sepsis or meningitis. But then a worldwide alert on a Covid-19 syndrome affecting children was issued. ""Straightaway they were liaising with everyone who was going through similar cases,"" said Hannah. ""As we sat down and had our first meeting with the consultant and the special disease consultant, they said 'we don't know if this is gonna work, this is our line of attack, this is what we think is best'."" As well as developing a rash, temperature and breathing problems, baby Leia's arteries began to swell to life-threatening levels. ""The consultant was very, very honest with me and said: 'If there's a rupture she's not going to survive'. ""They're trying to get them back down, she's on all types of medication to stop any clotting or build-up or heart attacks or anything like that. ""We just watch and wait, that's the phrase with Leia.""  Leia tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, and continued to be treated in isolation at the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff. Hannah now hopes Leia will be back home next week, to be reunited with twin Thea, older sisters Nia, 12, Gracie, nine, and her father Simon. Leia's mother urged other parents to be aware of the way Covid-19 can affect children - and to seek medical help. ""You have to take them to the doctor's, if you think there's something wrong with them,"" she stressed. ""God knows what could have happened if she had't had the treatment she had early on."" The future of Welsh football's domestic seasonwill be decided next week. The Football Association of Wales outlined possible options to Cymru League and Welsh Women's League club representatives on Friday. Clubs have until Sunday to choose one of the options put before them and reply to the FAW with their decision. A final decision is then expected to be taken by the FAW board next week on whether to curtail football for this season in Wales. Chief Officer for North Wales Police Special Constabulary Mark Owen has tweeted a picture of all the volunteers who will helping to enforce lockdown regulations this weekend. Allow Twitter content?

Eradicating coronavirus is an ""ambitious"" target, the deputy chief medical officer for England has said. Jenny Harries said there was no immediate easy outcome to the pandemic, speaking at the UK government's daily briefing. She said smallpox was the only infectious disease that had ever been eradicated. To eradicate Covid-19 we need a vaccine, she said, and that was being worked on. BBC Radio Wales The director of National Association of Headteachers in Wales has said she was ""heartened"" that Education Minister Kirsty Williams did not make any promises on a date for pupils to return to school. Laura Doel told BBC Radio Wales Drive: ""Any return-to-school date must be based on scientific and medical evidence that it is safe to do so."" She added: ""I think to make any assumption at this stage about what year groups could go back when she doesnât have the information would be quite irresponsible."" Ms Williamspublished a document earlier todaystating she would not ""set an arbitrary date"" for more pupils to go back to school. Some schools have remained open during lockdown for the children of key workers who need looking after during the day, and others classed as vulnerable. Another nine deaths of people with Covid-19 in Wales have been confirmed by Public Health Wales. It takes the confirmed total to 1,173. This graph shows the number of deaths per day by the date they occurred, not the date they were announced. Glamorgan director of cricket Mark Wallace says the county is in the early stages oftalks with the Welsh Governmentover returning to training. Welsh rules for professional sports people have not been relaxed in line with England. ""They're aware of our situation and we're having conversations with them and with the ECB,"" said Wallace. Rescued pets being cared for by the RSPCA in Wales can now be re-homed for the first time since coronavirus restrictions came into force. While people are still not allowed to visit rescue centres, new guidance allows staff to transport animals to new homes or temporary foster homes as long as they observe social distancing guidelines, with measures such as virtual home checks and post-adoption support. RSPCA Cymru says the guidance is ""great news"" for nearly 200 rescued animals currently in their care at centres in Newport and Colwyn Bay. Coralie Farren, RSPCA regional operations manager for Wales, said:  ""Dedicated staff at our centres have provided amazing care for these animals during this crisis. ""But we know nothing can beat a loving home for an animal, and we're excited to start ensuring perfect matches across Wales following this very welcome announcement."" Cassie is one of nearly 200 rescue animals being cared for by the RSPCA in Wales Police in England and Wales have issued more than 14,000 fines for alleged breaches of lockdown laws. The figures, from 27 March to 11 May, show the most fixed penalty notices - 906 - were handed out in London, by the Metropolitan Police. Gwent Police issued the third-lowest number, with 71, fewer than any other force except Warwickshire and Staffordshire. The data covers the period before the penalty rose from Â£60 to Â£100 in England afterthe rules were eased.The penalty remains at Â£60 in Wales. The National Police Chiefs' Council says 13,445 fines were issued by forces in England and 799 in Wales for breaches of social distancing rules brought in to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Giant keys have appeared in Blaenau Gwent
as a mystery artist shows appreciation for the NHS. Blue and pink keys and ""thank you"" messages have been placed around the area over the last few days, but
nobody knows who is behind them. The mystery artist has been leaving their
mark outside care homes, supermarkets and hospitals. Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council
showed their gratitude for whoever was behind the art. âWe loved
getting this sign of appreciation for our hardworking and dedicated teams,"" the authority said on Facebook. ""So,
thank you, whoever you may be.â Another nine deaths of people with Covid-19 have been confirmed by Public Health Wales, taking the total to 1,173. Death rates continue to be higher in south east Wales than in other parts of the country. Wales' first minister has said he hopes
to announce further easing of the lockdown restrictions when the next review is
due in two weeks' time. It came as Mark Drakeford unveiled a documentindicating how measures would be amended,externalin a traffic-light strategy of steps, but opposition parties in Wales have criticised him for not being more specific on timescales. However, answering questions at the Welsh Governmentâs daily press briefing, he said: âWeâve already begun to leave
lockdown as it was originally imposed and I am hopeful that provided
coronavirus remains at or below the levels we currently see, there will be more
things we will be able to do in the red zone at the end of the current three
weeks. ""Iâve then just got to say that before we know whether we can take
further steps, weâve got to be confident that the initial moves that we make
donât inadvertently result in coronavirus being on the rise again.â Welsh Secretary Simon Hart says the UK and Welsh governments have âworked closely
together every step of the wayâ after First Minister Mark Drakeford announced Walesâ lockdown
exit plan. Mr
Drakeford said he was âdisappointedâ
over a lack of communication with the UK government over the last week. Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd have criticised the Welsh Government's roadmap out of the lockdown for a lack of detail on dates, but the exit strategy was welcomed by Mr Hart. ""Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the UK and Welsh Governments have worked closely together every step of the way,"" he said. ""I am glad that this announcement brings that alignment even closer, providing more certainty for jobs and businesses across Wales. âThe
approach being taken by the Welsh Government in its roadmap will allow us to
continue with a UK-wide response to the emergency at the same time as taking a
flexible approach according to the data in different parts of the UK. âThe
UK Government is providing the devolved governments with testing, funding, and
logistical support from our armed forces. âNo
one part of the UK could face this pandemic alone and the UK Government has
provided unprecedented support to every part of the UK. âThere
are far more similarities than differences in the approaches of the nations of
the UK. ""We entered this fight as a United Kingdom and we will come out of it
equally united."" Simon Hart says there are ""far more similarities than differences"" in the approaches of the nations of the UK Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Too soon to reopen schools, says doctors' union","Doctors have backed teachers' unions by saying Covid-19 infection rates are too high for England's schools to reopen. The British Medical Association said teachers and heads were ""absolutely right"" to urge caution and prioritise testing to avoid a second spike. It comes after teachers' unions met the government's scientific and medical advisers to express concerns about the planned phased reopening from 1 June. The NASUWT union said no school should reopen until it could show it was safe. England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted schools would only open their doors more widely when the conditions were right to do so, with the earliest date being 1 June. He said he had wanted to give head teachers and parents several weeks to plan for the event. This video can not be played Steve Chalke wants Oasis trust schools to reopen in June The governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have stepped back from setting a firm date. But since the prime minister announced there was to be a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, plans for the phased reopening from the beginning of next month seem to have hardened. After the meeting between the National Education Union and other teaching unions, and the government's top scientific advisers, Mr Williamson said schools would have all the ""guidance and support they will need"". However, teachers' unions say they still have ""unanswered questions"" about how pupils can be invited back and managed safely. When schools return they will have to introduce smaller classes and keep pupils apart NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said: ""No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak."" He added: ""No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided."" The British Medical Association said with so much ""conflicting"" evidence on opening schools, it was ""completely aligned"" with teachers' union calls to delay reopening. ""Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools,"" said a letter from the BMA's council chair. It added there was still too little clear evidence on the extent to which children were carriers of the disease, even though they usually got fewer and less serious symptoms than adults. Calls to publish scientific evidence for return to school Class sizes of no more than 15 when schools reopen How England is following Denmark's model for opening schools Speaking after the meeting NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney welcomed a promise to publish the scientific evidence on school reopening plans. But he called for a clarification over what thresholds would be used to judge if it was safe to open up. And he asked how it would be measured whether reopening increased the rate of infection in the wider community. His union is one of nine opposed to reopening schools on 1 June. But Mr Williamson said: ""I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June."" The DfE proposed teaching pupils in small groups of 15 or fewer and keeping them apart from other children during the school day to limit the spread of any infection, as well as maintaining good hygiene and hand washing. How do you social distance in schools? Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Do I have to send my children back to school? But one of England's biggest academy trusts has become one of the first school groups to say it will reopen from 1 June. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust which has 35 primary schools, says opposition to reopening fails to recognise the harm to disadvantaged children from missing school. Mr Chalke, whose schools on average have 45% of children eligible for free school meals, said: ""The greatest risks for many of our children are being stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise, little or no nutritious food."" Mr Chalke said the schools would not be ""forcing anyone to attend"", either pupils or staff, adding safety measures would be in place. But he stressed that the ""long-term social cost"" of not opening would ""outweigh any short-term medical risks"". Graham Gallagher and his wife Leanne have three young children with special needs. He says schools reopening on 1 June would ""benefit the whole family"", who live in a two-bedroom flat in Walsall in the West Midlands. He feels their children aren't getting a ""valuable learning experience"" at home and worry they could regress from the ""solid progress"" they have made during this school year. At home, the children struggle to concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and Leanne is struggling to manage the learning of all three children at once. Schools reopening would allow the children to learn and socialise in a distraction-free environment with more space and access to an outdoor area. He says the couple share teachers' concerns that they need to be ""properly protected"", and hopes ""plans will be put in place"" to alleviate their worries. LOCKDOWN:How are businesses coping? EVERYDAY HEROES:Stacey Dooley is on the hunt Primary school teacher Mary Newton, 49, says she ""feels very strongly"" that June is ""far too early"" to reopen schools. Her husband John, 56, who runs an educational books company, has been shielding at home after a recent heart attack and Mary says their children returning to school would be a concern for his health. They plan to keep their two children - who are in Years 4 and 6 - at home for as long as they can. She says it could be ""catastrophic"" for a child's mental health if they contracted the virus and transmitted it to a family member who became very ill from it. Children could be ""traumatised"" by the new rules that would have to be adhered to and staff would be anxious, she adds. ""I believe schools should continue to support children of key workers and those most vulnerable"", she says, ""but I certainly won't be sending my Year 6 child back to school in June"".

Ontario Premier Doug Ford wants people to start baking to fight coronavirus stress. After boasting of his baking prowess in a press conference, Mr Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, posted a video of himself making cherry cheesecake. ""If I wasn't premier, I'd open up a cheesecake factory."" Sporting a t-shirt with the phrase ""we're all in this together"", Mr Ford's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times. ""You can tell I've eaten one too many cheesecakes,"" the portly premier joked. Prior to the pandemic, the folksy, conservative politician was best known for public squabbles with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the local teacher's union. But his popularity has soared as people turn into his daily press conference for his no-nonsense takes, such as when he called anti-lockdown protestors ""a bunch of yahoos"".  Allow Twitter content?

Countries across Europe are continuing to report lowering daily death tolls this week, as lockdowns begin to ease. Italy was once the global epicentre of the pandemic, reporting over 900 deaths on 27 March. But authorities there have reported 262 for yesterday. France, Spain and the UK are among the other European states also reporting  declines. Denmark registered no new Covid-19 deaths for the first time since 13 March. Slovenia has become the first EU country to declare the Covid-19 epidemic over, though it is still leaving some protective measures  in place. But as the continent begins to emerge from lockdown, the economic impact of coronavirus is being acutely felt - with millions of consumers confined to their homes, many of them now jobless. Today Germany reported that its economy - the largest in Europe - shrank by 2.2% in the first three months of this year, pushing the country into recession. Dr Sarah Ali says Sudan's healthcare system failed long before coronavirus hit the country Sudanese doctor Sarah Ali is not surprised by the recent report that 250 million people in Africa could catch coronavirus in the first year of the pandemic. She toldthe BBC's OS radio programmethat coronavirus was a huge challenge because of her country's already ""collapsed healthcare system"". The junior doctor has symptoms of Covid-19 herself, so she's self-isolating at home. Ms Ali says the strain on health services means people are dying from other conditions such as heart attacks because there are so few doctors available. One of the biggest hospitals in the capital, Khartoum, is calling for doctors to come and help because [there are] only three doctors,"" she told the BBC. There is also a dire lack of medical equipment needed to fight the virus. [Doctors] canât examine patients because they don't have enough gloves,"" said Mr Ali. ""Weâve been promised that PPE [personal protective equipment] will be provided."" She said doctors like her fear that the actual number of coronavirus cases is ""much, much higher"" than the 1,964 currently reported. People have been permitted to exercise on beaches in Portugal, such as Cascais beach near Lisbon Portugal is set to further ease lockdown restrictions from Monday with the opening of some shops, cafes, restaurants, museums, monuments, galleries, crÃ¨ches and selected school classes. Meanwhile, prime minister Antonio Costa said the country's beaches would reopen on 6 June. He
encouraged the public to download an app that will tell them if
their beach of choice is full or still has space, while other rules needed to be adhered to. According to government figures, Portugal has had 1,190 deaths associated with Covid-19 which was up six from Thursday, and a cumulative total of 28,583 confirmed cases, an increase of 264. A member of the armed forces helping out at a Montreal care home Five soldiers stationed in Canadian nursing homes have been infected with coronavirus, the government confirms. Four soldiers were based in Quebec, one was in Ontario. ""There are always risks in what they do and they go into that knowingly and willingly, and that is why we offer them our deepest gratitude every day,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday. The Canadian Armed Forces have sent about 1,700 personnel to 30 long-term care facilities. The military was called to help in Quebec and Ontario in mid-April, after several outbreaks at residences exacerbated long-standing staffing issues. The military intends to release figures every two weeks on
the number of personnel in long-term care homes who are infected. Approximately 82% of all Covid-19 deaths in Canada occur in these facilities, according to the National Institute on Ageing. Moncef Slaoui (r) outlined the programme at a briefing with President Trump and Health Secretary Alex Azar (l) A bit more now on ""Operation Warp Speed"", the Trump plan to expedite vaccine development we told you about earlier. Moncef Slaoui, former vaccine chief at GlaxoSmithKline, and Gustave Perna, who oversees distribution for the US Army, will head the effort, which will begin with studies on 14 promising vaccine candidates for accelerated research and approval. Trump promised ""roughly $10bn"" to back the project. Speaking after Mr Trump, Mr Slaoui said he was ""confident"" that a ""few hundred million doses of vaccine"" will be delivered by the end of 2020. However, some health experts have remained sceptical about this. ""I don't understand how that happens,"" said Dr Peter Hotez, co-director of the Medicine Coronavirus Vaccine Team at Baylor College. ""I don't see a path by which any vaccine is licensed for emergency use or otherwise till the third quarter of 2021,"" he told CNN, citing safety concerns.

The Scottish Professional Football League will announce that the Premiership season - and the Scottish Cup - will not be completed, which means Celtic will be awarded their ninth consecutive title. The Hoops were 13 points ahead of Glasgow rivals Rangers with eight games remaining. Hearts will be relegated, while Rangers, Motherwell and Aberdeen will gain qualification for the Europa League. Dundee United will be promoted to the Scottish Premiership next season. The lower-league seasons were declared over in April after a controversial ballot. Allow Twitter content?

Katy WatsonBBC South America correspondent Nelson Teich was appointed as health minister on 17 April To lose one health minister was awkward, but to lose two in less than a month is not only embarrassing for Jair Bolsonaro but deeply worrying for Brazil. The country has become the latest coronavirus hotspot and rather than politicians trying to tackle it together, the pandemic has turned political.  The leader of the country is failing to provide direction for a population who really needs it. Nelson Teich didn't give any reasons for his departure, merely saying ""life is full of decisions and I decided to leave"" - but he didn't see eye-to-eye with his boss on the use of chloroquine and his health ministry was excluded this week when Bolsonaro decided to include beauty salons, hairdressers and gyms as essential services. It appears the job of health minister to Bolsonaro is a thankless task at the moment - but itâs a difficult job vacancy at the worst-possible time in Brazil. Ireland were due to tour Australia this summer Reality Check At todayâs press conference in the White House Rose Garden,
President Trump talked up the reopening of the US, saying that âas of this

the White House guidelines for a safe and phased opening of America - that's

Staff at the Toronto Zoo hope to raise C$70,000 ($49,600; Â£41,000) to reconfigure existing spaces to better accommodate the newborn. Masai giraffes are approximately 2m (6ft) tall at birth, and can grow to over 5.5 meters (19 feet) in adulthood. The money will also go to improving educational and monitoring opportunities. The zoo is facing financial difficulties after being forced to shut its doors due to the coronavirus lockdown. Staff say they plan to reopen as a drive-through experience as soon as they are able. The calf is the firstborn child of six-year-old mother Mstari, who was also born at the zoo. There are only 35,000 Masai giraffes left in the world, and the zoo heralded the birth as ""an important contribution to a genetically healthy Masai giraffe population"". One of the world's largest cigarette companies, British American Tobacco (BAT), says it is ready to begin human trials on a tobacco-based coronavirus vaccine. In a statement, the firm said it was using proteins from tobacco leaves, which have generated a positive immune response in pre-clinical trials. The maker of famous brands such as Lucky Strike said human trials could begin in late June, pending approval by the US Food and Drug Agency. It raised eyebrows after announcing plans for the jab in April, saying it could produce up to three million doses a week if it received government support. But it's not the only tobacco firm to do so - industry rival Philip Morris International is also working on its own vaccine. Police have warned Londoners against taking part in ""spontaneous or planned mass gatherings"" in public this weekend. ""Games of football ...outdoor concerts or parties, protest, marches or assemblies are still not permitted"", the Met's Ch Supt Karen Findlay said. Officers ""will engage and encourage people to comply"" with public health regulations, the force added. Some restrictions have been eased in England, where two people from different households are now allowed to meet in public, and sports in which people can keep apart are now allowed - such as tennis or golf. Social distancing of two metres still has to be observed, althoughpolice do not enforce this guidance,externalbecause it has not been written into the law. The warning came as latest figures show police in England and Walesissued more than 14,000 ticketsfor alleged breaches of lockdown laws. The minimum fine for breaches has recently increased from Â£60 ($73) to Â£100 (reduced to Â£50 if paid within two weeks), while repeat offenders can also face fines of up to Â£3,200. The pandemic has left European football leagues in a state of flux as they figured out how to conclude their respective seasons. Today, the Belgian top flight, like its Dutch and French counterparts, provided closure to its own competition by announcing Club Bruges as champions. It was a fairly easy decision because the Club had a 15-point lead over Gent with one match left when the season was suspended. It was also announced that Waasland-Beveren would be relegated while Gent would enter next season's Champions League. The German Bundesliga restarts this weekend behind closed doors,while the English Premier League,Italian Serie A and Spain's La Liga are hoping to resume in the second week of June. The Netherlands starting easing its lockdown earlier this week The Dutch government has issued new guidance to single people seeking intimacy during the pandemic: find a ""sex buddy"". The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) says singletons should come to an arrangement with one person. But couples should avoid sex if one of them suspects they have coronavirus, the advice says. It comes after critics argued social distancing rules have complicated intimate relations for partners not living together.

Guests have been visiting Universal Orlando's CityWalk in Florida, where some entertainment venues are open for limited hours Zion National Park in Springdale, Utah also had a limited reopening on Thursday Some businesses have been able to reopen in Ohio, such as Cincinnati's Findlay Market Construction work has begun again in parts of New York State In Wisconsin bars and restaurants reopened after the state's Supreme Court overturned a lockdown extension announced by Democratic governor Tony Evers earlier in the week. There have been 434 coronavirus-related deaths in Wisconsin, with more than 11,000 confirmed cases.

How did a country with a population of 97 million people, record only just over 300 cases of Covid-19 and not a single death? That country is Vietnam. It implemented extreme measures as soon as it recorded its first case on 23 January. In came travel restrictions, close monitoring and then closure of the border with China.  Health checks were increased at other borders. ""This is a country that has dealt with a lot of outbreaks in the past,"" said Prof Guy Thwaites, director of Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City. ""The government and population are very, very used to dealing with infectious diseases and are respectful of them, probably far more so than wealthier countries,"" he said. ""They know how to respond to these things."" Read more here Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Moscow has launched a mass screening programme for coronavirus antibodies, inviting people chosen at random from various age groups to clinics across the city. The hope is that the test results can allow the authorities to map their way out of lockdown, despite uncertainty over how much immunity to Covid-19 the antibodies actually provide. Three dozen Moscow clinics are collecting intravenous blood samples, which are sent to laboratories for analysis overnight. Russian doctors believe the method, known as IFA, is more accurate than express-testing used elsewhere. It identifies the Immunoglobulin M antibody (IgM), which appears when the body is fighting a new infection, and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) which shows that someone has previously been infected. Swabs for Covid-19 itself are taken at the same time. Free tests will be given to 70,000 people every three days, allowing Moscow to build a much clearer picture of the spread of the virus since the start of the epidemic â as well as isolating anyone who is sick, but didnât realise it. This is in addition to widespread coronavirus testing of those with symptoms thatâs already taking place. ""If thatâs whatâs needed, then itâs needed,"" one man who had received a text-message inviting him for testing told the BBC. ""The main thing is that itâs free!"" Vladimir Putin this week announced that the full nationwide lockdown was over, instructing regional leaders to decide when to lift specific restrictions. Moscowâs mayor has described that as the ""most difficult decision"" of his life, and schools and playgrounds, bars and many businesses remain closed until at least 31 May. Russia currently has one of the worldâs highest rates of coronavirus infection, with 10,598 new cases detected on Friday. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The UK has denied that travellers from France will be exempted from its planned quarantine measures. Under the plans - announced last weekend - people arriving in the UK from abroad will be obliged to isolate themselves for 14 days. Initially, the two governments said the exemption would apply to any travellers between France and the UK, and any future steps would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner. The policy attracted criticism from other governments and the EU. Some experts suggested it would be unworkable. But today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesmansaid there was no French exemption, and that the original statement referred to co-operation
to manage the common border. It now appears that those exempted from the policy could include freight drivers - to allow the flow of goods to continue - and people working on Covid-19 research, but not ordinary travellers.

Tests for all in English care homes by early June,"All residents and members of staff in care homes in England will have been tested for coronavirus by early June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He said the crisis had demonstrated the ""imperative"" need for reforming the sector - and local councils would now be required to carry out a daily review of all care homes in their area. More than a third of England's care homes have had cases of the virus. The government is spending Â£600m to improve infection control in the homes. There were 8,312deaths in care homes in England and Wales where coronavirus was written on the death certificateup to 1 May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Speaking during the government's daily briefing, Mr Hancock said 64% of care homes in England have not had any cases. Since late April, tests have been made available to any care home resident or staff member who requested one, whether they have coronavirus symptoms or not. Before that access to testing was more limited. But Mr Hancock said that now every single resident and worker in English care home was being tested as a matter of routine - and that process would be completed by early June. How many people have died in care homes? Care homes felt 'abandoned' as virus hit PM quizzed over 'unexplained' care home deaths In Scotland, staff and residents are tested for Covid-19 if there is at least one confirmed case. Testing is also carried out in homes that belong to the same chain, and there is some sample testing in homes with no cases. The government is assigning ""clinical leads"" to assess and advise all facilities in England, Mr Hancock added, and the NHS is helping to ensure that residents can see GPs via video link. And local authorities are now being required to carry out daily reviews of the situation in care homes, while care homes have to supply ""timely and accurate"" data so that ""local and national government can support and, where necessary, challenge and act"". There aremore than 15,000 residential and nursing homesproviding support for older and disabled people in England, according to the Care Quality Commission. Peter Port's father Thomas served in the Navy as a younger man. At 101, he was frail, but still determined - even in a pandemic. ""His reaction was: 'I picked up survivors on the Arctic and Atlantic convoys - I survived all that so I'm going to survive this',"" Peter told the BBC. But Thomas, who lived in a nursing home, died in April. Peter believes coronavirus arrived in the home with a patient discharged from hospital, and is angry that more was not done to protect residents. ""I believe thatâ¦ there was a fundamental error made at the beginning that care homes either weren't going to suffer the coronavirus, because of their enclosed environment, or alternatively they didn't really care about it or even think about it,"" he said. During the news conference, Mr Hancock revealed that he is among those with a ""loved one in a care home"", saying: ""I know it's been worrying.""

Disney forces explicit Club Penguin clones offline,"This video can not be played Unofficial Club Penguin games turn toxic Disney has ordered unauthorised copies of its Club Penguin game to close, after the BBC found children were being exposed to explicit messages. Visits to fan-run Club Penguin Online surged during the coronavirus pandemic with more than a million new players. But racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and sexual messages flow freely on the unauthorised platform. Disney said it was ""appalled"" by the website, and has ordered it to close or face legal action. Club Penguin Online appeared to go offline on Friday afternoon. One man involved in the site has been arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children. Detectives say the man from London has been released on bail pending further inquiries. Disney's Club Penguin was one of the first social networks for children. Launched in 2005, it had more than 200 million players at its peak. While anybody could join the original website, content filters and human moderators were employed to stop inappropriate messages or personal information from being shared. Children were sent inappropriate messages on Club Penguin Online, an unofficial clone But Disney closed the website in 2017. Since then, unofficial clones of the website have been operated by fans. These private servers were launched using stolen or copied source code, and can easily be found by children searching the internet. Club Penguin Online is the largest of the social network's unofficial and unauthorised clones. It says its popularity has exploded during the coronavirus pandemic and now has seven million registered players. The BBC set up an account on the English, Spanish and Portuguese versions of Club Penguin Online. It found: content filters designed to remove offensive language had been disabled on several servers, allowing swear words, homophobic slurs, anti-Semitism and racist messages to be posted publicly moderators were no longer removing racist content. One player invited the BBC to their igloo, which was decorated to spell out the n-word players were engaging in ""penguin e-sex"", sending and receiving explicit messages Disney's original game banned the sharing of personal details, but players on this cloned site are openly sharing Snapchat, Instagram and Discord account details. A Zoom ""meet-up"" was also advertised and codes and passwords shared openly. Many conversations turned to sex on the children's game Although it is impossible to verify the age of users, many told the BBC they were teenagers, and there were children playing, too. Kaden, 14, told the BBC there were areas of the game where it was safe to operate - but most players were in the unprotected ""mature"" sections. He said the conversations he had seen made him extremely uncomfortable. Fourteen-year-old Kaden was shocked by what he saw on Club Penguin Online ""Any kid can click on these mature sections and they just see all this inappropriate stuff,"" he said. ""I've seen people advertise strip club igloos, I've seen people ask for pimps. There's a lot of swearing on there and I've been asked a lot of crazy things. It's really put me off going on these mature servers."" Kaden's dad, Rick, told the BBC he had no idea what was happening in the game. ""I'm shocked. I thought that if he's on Club Penguin, then he's in a pretty safe place."" Players are invited to take part in penguin e-sex Another long-time Club Penguin fan, teenager Miranda, said the game had ""gone from being family-friendly and fun to being monstrous"". Club Penguin Online is the largest private server and uses Disney's branding. One former staff member told the BBC the project had made about Â£9,000 through adverts, while most of the staff were young unpaid volunteers. Competition between Club Penguin Online and other unofficial versions of the game had escalated in the past six months. Bullying and upsetting conversations were also seen in the game Server owners accused one another of hacking and harassment. One said it was a toxic community, ""like Game of Thrones with penguins"". The Club Penguin Online volunteer claims he was encouraged to carry out attacks on rival servers when he was a minor.

I carried outDDoS (distributed denial of service attacks)on other users, and I would threaten people. The stuff that I did was similar to what happened to me, which affected my whole family, but I do feel really bad about it now."" Club Penguin Online says it has added a million users during the coronavirus pandemic A current Club Penguin Online staff member denied that this sort of activity was encouraged. Some gamers think the toxic culture on some of these fan servers is a wider problem that needs addressing.

"Too soon to reopen schools, say doctors","Doctors have backed teachers' unions by saying Covid-19 infection rates are too high for England's schools to reopen. The British Medical Association said teachers and heads were ""absolutely right"" to urge caution and prioritise testing to avoid a second spike. It comes after teachers' unions met the government's scientific and medical advisers to express concerns about the planned phased reopening from 1 June. The NASUWT union said no school should reopen until it could show it was safe. England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted schools would only open their doors more widely when the conditions were right to do so, with the earliest date being 1 June. He said he had wanted to give head teachers and parents several weeks to plan for the event. This video can not be played Steve Chalke wants Oasis trust schools to reopen in June The governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have stepped back from setting a firm date. But since the prime minister announced there was to be a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, plans for the phased reopening from the beginning of next month seem to have hardened. After the meeting between the National Education Union and other teaching unions, and the government's top scientific advisers, Mr Williamson said schools would have all the ""guidance and support they will need"". However, teachers' unions say they still have ""unanswered questions"" about how pupils can be invited back and managed safely. When schools return they will have to introduce smaller classes and keep pupils apart NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said: ""No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak."" He added: ""No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided."" The British Medical Association said with so much ""conflicting"" evidence on opening schools, it was ""completely aligned"" with teachers' union calls to delay reopening. ""Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools,"" said a letter from the BMA's council chair. It added there was still too little clear evidence on the extent to which children were carriers of the disease, even though they usually got fewer and less serious symptoms than adults. Calls to publish scientific evidence for return to school Class sizes of no more than 15 when schools reopen How England is following Denmark's model for opening schools Speaking after the meeting NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney welcomed a promise to publish the scientific evidence on school reopening plans. But he called for a clarification over what thresholds would be used to judge if it was safe to open up. And he asked how it would be measured whether reopening increased the rate of infection in the wider community. His union is one of nine opposed to reopening schools on 1 June. But Mr Williamson said: ""I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June."" The DfE proposed teaching pupils in small groups of 15 or fewer and keeping them apart from other children during the school day to limit the spread of any infection, as well as maintaining good hygiene and hand washing. How do you social distance in schools? Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Do I have to send my children back to school? But one of England's biggest academy trusts has become one of the first school groups to say it will reopen from 1 June. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust which has 35 primary schools, says opposition to reopening fails to recognise the harm to disadvantaged children from missing school. Mr Chalke, whose schools on average have 45% of children eligible for free school meals, said: ""The greatest risks for many of our children are being stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise, little or no nutritious food."" Mr Chalke said the schools would not be ""forcing anyone to attend"", either pupils or staff, adding safety measures would be in place. But he stressed that the ""long-term social cost"" of not opening would ""outweigh any short-term medical risks"". Graham Gallagher and his wife Leanne have three young children with special needs. He says schools reopening on 1 June would ""benefit the whole family"", who live in a two-bedroom flat in Walsall in the West Midlands. He feels their children aren't getting a ""valuable learning experience"" at home and worry they could regress from the ""solid progress"" they have made during this school year. At home, the children struggle to concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and Leanne is struggling to manage the learning of all three children at once. Schools reopening would allow the children to learn and socialise in a distraction-free environment with more space and access to an outdoor area. He says the couple share teachers' concerns that they need to be ""properly protected"", and hopes ""plans will be put in place"" to alleviate their worries. LOCKDOWN:How are businesses coping? EVERYDAY HEROES:Stacey Dooley is on the hunt Primary school teacher Mary Newton, 49, says she ""feels very strongly"" that June is ""far too early"" to reopen schools. Her husband John, 56, who runs an educational books company, has been shielding at home after a recent heart attack and Mary says their children returning to school would be a concern for his health. They plan to keep their two children - who are in Years 4 and 6 - at home for as long as they can. She says it could be ""catastrophic"" for a child's mental health if they contracted the virus and transmitted it to a family member who became very ill from it. Children could be ""traumatised"" by the new rules that would have to be adhered to and staff would be anxious, she adds. ""I believe schools should continue to support children of key workers and those most vulnerable"", she says, ""but I certainly won't be sending my Year 6 child back to school in June"".

Coronavirus in Wales: Updates from FridayAll your coronavirus updates from 15 May.Wales,"Wales will act carefully and cautiously in lifting Covid-19 restrictions, says First Minister Mark Drakeford as he unveils a roadmap of the way out of lockdown Education Minister Kirsty Williams says she 'will not set an arbitrary date' for more pupils to return to lessons Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales is ""one week away"" from being overrun by coronavirus, a consultant claims A further nine people with coronavirus have died in Wales, taking the total to 1,173 To date, 46,542 individuals have been tested for coronavirus Deaf people or those with hearing loss will struggle to communicate if more people wear non-medical face masks, a charity says James McCarthy, Gareth Vincent, Andy Roberts and Rhiannon Beacham That's it for the live page for Friday. Thank you all for joining us. Here are the main points from today:   Welsh universities face
a serious threat to their financial position as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to analysis from Cardiff Universityâs Wales Governance
Centre. The report by Cian SiÃ´n,
a researcher on the Wales fiscal analysis programme, takes into account
predicted falls in international and home student enrolment, and estimates the
sector could lose between Â£100m and Â£140m in 2020-21 from fee income alone. The report reveals the
sectorâs importance to the Welsh economy, with universities providing 17,300
full-time jobs, contributing 4.8% of gross value added and accounting for 32.5%
of the countryâs research and development spending. According to the
analysis, the three institutions with potentially the most to lose if there is
a fall in international student recruitment are Cardiff University, Cardiff
Metropolitan University and Bangor University.  This video can not be played Rainbow lights shine for carers at Prisoner village A
spectacular light show to thank carers during the coronavirus pandemic has lit
up the village that was home to 1960s TV cult classic Prisoner. The village of Portmeirion in Gwynedd was turned into a rainbow of
colour. Location
manager Meurig Jones described it as a ""beautiful, wonderful
experience"". Portmeirion became famous as the back drop for the TV show starring Patrick
McGoohan, and is home to hotels, restaurants and spectacular gardens - all
designed by Sir Clough Williams-Elis. Former Swansea City player Darren Pratley says the thought of returning to footballis ""a bit frightening""as BAME players are more at risk from Covid-19. The Office for National Statistics says black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die from coronavirus as white people in England and Wales. Charlton midfielder Pratley, 35, whose father is Jamaican, admits he has concerns about the prospect of elite football resuming. ""We've been told that BAME footballers are at higher risk, which is concerning being mixed raced,"" said Pratley, who won two promotions with Swansea during a five-year stint in Wales. The UK government has pledged an extra Â£35m to support Wales in the fight
against coronavirus. Wales' devolved administration will get the extra cash as a
result of the UK governmentâs investment in care homes in England. That is to
control infections, increase testing and clinical support, and ensure English councils have plans in place to support care homes. The UK government has now given Â£2.1bn to tackle coronavirus in Wales. Secretary
of State for Wales, Simon Hart, said: âWe are doing everything we can to
ensure Wales overcomes this crisis."" Ramadan is a ""transformative month"" and about developing a new appetite for charitable giving and community, according to Mo Janneh. But this year, with mosques closed, fasting and prayers are being observed behind closed doors because of lockdown. Mr Janneh describes what he is doing to keep the spirit of Ramadan alive forthe BBC1 Wales show The Great Indoors, available now on iPlayer. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Keeping Ramadan spirit alive under lockdown Coronavirus
could cost Cardiff council Â£29m in additional spend and lost revenue in the
first three months of the financial year. A
statement from cabinet to the council has laid bare the expense involved in
dealing with impact of the pandemic. The
authority estimates it will spend more than Â£18m responding to the crisis and a
further Â£11m could be lost in income by the end of June as a result of Covid-19. The cabinet
member for finance, modernisation and performance, Councillor Chris Weaver, said:
âCardiff council has reacted quickly to the crisis, changing the way we work,
putting clear focus on maintaining essential services which deliver for our
most vulnerable residents. âOver
the past two months our services have had to respond and adapt to the crisis as
events continued to unfold.â The
council hopes to claim back the Â£18m expenditure from the Welsh Government through
the Covid-19 Hardship Fund. To date the council has received Â£465,000 to
cover Covid-related spend during the latter weeks of March. âWe
are working now on the implications of moving towards what is likely to be a new normal as lockdown restrictions are eased and the recovery phase begins,â
Councillor Weaver added. âThere
may be significant financial implications, with income streams in particular
likely to take a considerable time to come back to normal levels.â A mother has described the fears for her five-month-old baby daughter after the infant developed a rare reaction to coronavirus. Hannah Godwin, from Risca, in Caerphilly county borough, said she and father Simon were left to ""watch and wait"" as baby Leia fought for her life. Medics initially thought the child may have had sepsis or meningitis. But then a worldwide alert on a Covid-19 syndrome affecting children was issued. ""Straightaway they were liaising with everyone who was going through similar cases,"" said Hannah. ""As we sat down and had our first meeting with the consultant and the special disease consultant, they said 'we don't know if this is gonna work, this is our line of attack, this is what we think is best'."" As well as developing a rash, temperature and breathing problems, baby Leia's arteries began to swell to life-threatening levels. ""The consultant was very, very honest with me and said: 'If there's a rupture she's not going to survive'. ""They're trying to get them back down, she's on all types of medication to stop any clotting or build-up or heart attacks or anything like that. ""We just watch and wait, that's the phrase with Leia.""  Leia tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, and continued to be treated in isolation at the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff. Hannah now hopes Leia will be back home next week, to be reunited with twin Thea, older sisters Nia, 12, Gracie, nine, and her father Simon. Leia's mother urged other parents to be aware of the way Covid-19 can affect children - and to seek medical help. ""You have to take them to the doctor's, if you think there's something wrong with them,"" she stressed. ""God knows what could have happened if she had't had the treatment she had early on."" The future of Welsh football's domestic seasonwill be decided next week. The Football Association of Wales outlined possible options to Cymru League and Welsh Women's League club representatives on Friday. Clubs have until Sunday to choose one of the options put before them and reply to the FAW with their decision. A final decision is then expected to be taken by the FAW board next week on whether to curtail football for this season in Wales.

Eradicating coronavirus is an ""ambitious"" target, the deputy chief medical officer for England has said. Jenny Harries said there was no immediate easy outcome to the pandemic, speaking at the UK government's daily briefing. She said smallpox was the only infectious disease that had ever been eradicated. To eradicate Covid-19 we need a vaccine, she said, and that was being worked on. BBC Radio Wales The director of National Association of Headteachers in Wales has said she was ""heartened"" that Education Minister Kirsty Williams did not make any promises on a date for pupils to return to school. Laura Doel told BBC Radio Wales Drive: ""Any return-to-school date must be based on scientific and medical evidence that it is safe to do so."" She added: ""I think to make any assumption at this stage about what year groups could go back when she doesnât have the information would be quite irresponsible."" Ms Williamspublished a document earlier todaystating she would not ""set an arbitrary date"" for more pupils to go back to school. Some schools have remained open during lockdown for the children of key workers who need looking after during the day, and others classed as vulnerable. Another nine deaths of people with Covid-19 in Wales have been confirmed by Public Health Wales. It takes the confirmed total to 1,173. This graph shows the number of deaths per day by the date they occurred, not the date they were announced. Glamorgan director of cricket Mark Wallace says the county is in the early stages oftalks with the Welsh Governmentover returning to training. Welsh rules for professional sports people have not been relaxed in line with England. ""They're aware of our situation and we're having conversations with them and with the ECB,"" said Wallace. Rescued pets being cared for by the RSPCA in Wales can now be re-homed for the first time since coronavirus restrictions came into force. While people are still not allowed to visit rescue centres, new guidance allows staff to transport animals to new homes or temporary foster homes as long as they observe social distancing guidelines, with measures such as virtual home checks and post-adoption support. RSPCA Cymru says the guidance is ""great news"" for nearly 200 rescued animals currently in their care at centres in Newport and Colwyn Bay. Coralie Farren, RSPCA regional operations manager for Wales, said:  ""Dedicated staff at our centres have provided amazing care for these animals during this crisis. ""But we know nothing can beat a loving home for an animal, and we're excited to start ensuring perfect matches across Wales following this very welcome announcement."" Cassie is one of nearly 200 rescue animals being cared for by the RSPCA in Wales Police in England and Wales have issued more than 14,000 fines for alleged breaches of lockdown laws. The figures, from 27 March to 11 May, show the most fixed penalty notices - 906 - were handed out in London, by the Metropolitan Police. Gwent Police issued the third-lowest number, with 71, fewer than any other force except Warwickshire and Staffordshire. The data covers the period before the penalty rose from Â£60 to Â£100 in England afterthe rules were eased.The penalty remains at Â£60 in Wales. The National Police Chiefs' Council says 13,445 fines were issued by forces in England and 799 in Wales for breaches of social distancing rules brought in to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

to announce further easing of the lockdown restrictions when the next review is
due in two weeks' time. It came as Mark Drakeford unveiled a documentindicating how measures would be amended,externalin a traffic-light strategy of steps, but opposition parties in Wales have criticised him for not being more specific on timescales.

lockdown as it was originally imposed and I am hopeful that provided
coronavirus remains at or below the levels we currently see, there will be more
things we will be able to do in the red zone at the end of the current three
weeks. ""Iâve then just got to say that before we know whether we can take
further steps, weâve got to be confident that the initial moves that we make
donât inadvertently result in coronavirus being on the rise again.â Welsh Secretary Simon Hart says the UK and Welsh governments have âworked closely
together every step of the wayâ after First Minister Mark Drakeford announced Walesâ lockdown
exit plan. Mr
Drakeford said he was âdisappointedâ
over a lack of communication with the UK government over the last week. Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd have criticised the Welsh Government's roadmap out of the lockdown for a lack of detail on dates, but the exit strategy was welcomed by Mr Hart. ""Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the UK and Welsh Governments have worked closely together every step of the way,"" he said. ""I am glad that this announcement brings that alignment even closer, providing more certainty for jobs and businesses across Wales. âThe
approach being taken by the Welsh Government in its roadmap will allow us to

Coronavirus in Wales: Updates from FridayAll your coronavirus updates from 15 May.,"Wales will act carefully and cautiously in lifting Covid-19 restrictions, says First Minister Mark Drakeford as he unveils a roadmap of the way out of lockdown Education Minister Kirsty Williams says she 'will not set an arbitrary date' for more pupils to return to lessons Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales is ""one week away"" from being overrun by coronavirus, a consultant claims A further nine people with coronavirus have died in Wales, taking the total to 1,173 To date, 46,542 individuals have been tested for coronavirus Deaf people or those with hearing loss will struggle to communicate if more people wear non-medical face masks, a charity says James McCarthy, Gareth Vincent, Andy Roberts and Rhiannon Beacham That's it for the live page for Friday. Thank you all for joining us. Here are the main points from today:   Welsh universities face
a serious threat to their financial position as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to analysis from Cardiff Universityâs Wales Governance
Centre. The report by Cian SiÃ´n,
a researcher on the Wales fiscal analysis programme, takes into account
predicted falls in international and home student enrolment, and estimates the
sector could lose between Â£100m and Â£140m in 2020-21 from fee income alone. The report reveals the
sectorâs importance to the Welsh economy, with universities providing 17,300
full-time jobs, contributing 4.8% of gross value added and accounting for 32.5%
of the countryâs research and development spending. According to the
analysis, the three institutions with potentially the most to lose if there is
a fall in international student recruitment are Cardiff University, Cardiff
Metropolitan University and Bangor University.  This video can not be played Rainbow lights shine for carers at Prisoner village A
spectacular light show to thank carers during the coronavirus pandemic has lit
up the village that was home to 1960s TV cult classic Prisoner. The village of Portmeirion in Gwynedd was turned into a rainbow of
colour. Location
manager Meurig Jones described it as a ""beautiful, wonderful
experience"". Portmeirion became famous as the back drop for the TV show starring Patrick
McGoohan, and is home to hotels, restaurants and spectacular gardens - all
designed by Sir Clough Williams-Elis. Former Swansea City player Darren Pratley says the thought of returning to footballis ""a bit frightening""as BAME players are more at risk from Covid-19. The Office for National Statistics says black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die from coronavirus as white people in England and Wales. Charlton midfielder Pratley, 35, whose father is Jamaican, admits he has concerns about the prospect of elite football resuming. ""We've been told that BAME footballers are at higher risk, which is concerning being mixed raced,"" said Pratley, who won two promotions with Swansea during a five-year stint in Wales. The UK government has pledged an extra Â£35m to support Wales in the fight
against coronavirus. Wales' devolved administration will get the extra cash as a
result of the UK governmentâs investment in care homes in England. That is to
control infections, increase testing and clinical support, and ensure English councils have plans in place to support care homes. The UK government has now given Â£2.1bn to tackle coronavirus in Wales. Secretary
of State for Wales, Simon Hart, said: âWe are doing everything we can to
ensure Wales overcomes this crisis."" Ramadan is a ""transformative month"" and about developing a new appetite for charitable giving and community, according to Mo Janneh. But this year, with mosques closed, fasting and prayers are being observed behind closed doors because of lockdown. Mr Janneh describes what he is doing to keep the spirit of Ramadan alive forthe BBC1 Wales show The Great Indoors, available now on iPlayer. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Keeping Ramadan spirit alive under lockdown Coronavirus
could cost Cardiff council Â£29m in additional spend and lost revenue in the
first three months of the financial year. A
statement from cabinet to the council has laid bare the expense involved in
dealing with impact of the pandemic. The
authority estimates it will spend more than Â£18m responding to the crisis and a
further Â£11m could be lost in income by the end of June as a result of Covid-19. The cabinet
member for finance, modernisation and performance, Councillor Chris Weaver, said:
âCardiff council has reacted quickly to the crisis, changing the way we work,
putting clear focus on maintaining essential services which deliver for our
most vulnerable residents. âOver
the past two months our services have had to respond and adapt to the crisis as
events continued to unfold.â The
council hopes to claim back the Â£18m expenditure from the Welsh Government through
the Covid-19 Hardship Fund. To date the council has received Â£465,000 to
cover Covid-related spend during the latter weeks of March. âWe
are working now on the implications of moving towards what is likely to be a new normal as lockdown restrictions are eased and the recovery phase begins,â
Councillor Weaver added. âThere
may be significant financial implications, with income streams in particular
likely to take a considerable time to come back to normal levels.â A mother has described the fears for her five-month-old baby daughter after the infant developed a rare reaction to coronavirus. Hannah Godwin, from Risca, in Caerphilly county borough, said she and father Simon were left to ""watch and wait"" as baby Leia fought for her life. Medics initially thought the child may have had sepsis or meningitis. But then a worldwide alert on a Covid-19 syndrome affecting children was issued. ""Straightaway they were liaising with everyone who was going through similar cases,"" said Hannah. ""As we sat down and had our first meeting with the consultant and the special disease consultant, they said 'we don't know if this is gonna work, this is our line of attack, this is what we think is best'."" As well as developing a rash, temperature and breathing problems, baby Leia's arteries began to swell to life-threatening levels. ""The consultant was very, very honest with me and said: 'If there's a rupture she's not going to survive'. ""They're trying to get them back down, she's on all types of medication to stop any clotting or build-up or heart attacks or anything like that. ""We just watch and wait, that's the phrase with Leia.""  Leia tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, and continued to be treated in isolation at the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff. Hannah now hopes Leia will be back home next week, to be reunited with twin Thea, older sisters Nia, 12, Gracie, nine, and her father Simon. Leia's mother urged other parents to be aware of the way Covid-19 can affect children - and to seek medical help. ""You have to take them to the doctor's, if you think there's something wrong with them,"" she stressed. ""God knows what could have happened if she had't had the treatment she had early on."" The future of Welsh football's domestic seasonwill be decided next week. The Football Association of Wales outlined possible options to Cymru League and Welsh Women's League club representatives on Friday. Clubs have until Sunday to choose one of the options put before them and reply to the FAW with their decision. A final decision is then expected to be taken by the FAW board next week on whether to curtail football for this season in Wales.

Eradicating coronavirus is an ""ambitious"" target, the deputy chief medical officer for England has said. Jenny Harries said there was no immediate easy outcome to the pandemic, speaking at the UK government's daily briefing. She said smallpox was the only infectious disease that had ever been eradicated. To eradicate Covid-19 we need a vaccine, she said, and that was being worked on. BBC Radio Wales The director of National Association of Headteachers in Wales has said she was ""heartened"" that Education Minister Kirsty Williams did not make any promises on a date for pupils to return to school. Laura Doel told BBC Radio Wales Drive: ""Any return-to-school date must be based on scientific and medical evidence that it is safe to do so."" She added: ""I think to make any assumption at this stage about what year groups could go back when she doesnât have the information would be quite irresponsible."" Ms Williamspublished a document earlier todaystating she would not ""set an arbitrary date"" for more pupils to go back to school. Some schools have remained open during lockdown for the children of key workers who need looking after during the day, and others classed as vulnerable. Another nine deaths of people with Covid-19 in Wales have been confirmed by Public Health Wales. It takes the confirmed total to 1,173. This graph shows the number of deaths per day by the date they occurred, not the date they were announced. Glamorgan director of cricket Mark Wallace says the county is in the early stages oftalks with the Welsh Governmentover returning to training. Welsh rules for professional sports people have not been relaxed in line with England. ""They're aware of our situation and we're having conversations with them and with the ECB,"" said Wallace. Rescued pets being cared for by the RSPCA in Wales can now be re-homed for the first time since coronavirus restrictions came into force. While people are still not allowed to visit rescue centres, new guidance allows staff to transport animals to new homes or temporary foster homes as long as they observe social distancing guidelines, with measures such as virtual home checks and post-adoption support. RSPCA Cymru says the guidance is ""great news"" for nearly 200 rescued animals currently in their care at centres in Newport and Colwyn Bay. Coralie Farren, RSPCA regional operations manager for Wales, said:  ""Dedicated staff at our centres have provided amazing care for these animals during this crisis. ""But we know nothing can beat a loving home for an animal, and we're excited to start ensuring perfect matches across Wales following this very welcome announcement."" Cassie is one of nearly 200 rescue animals being cared for by the RSPCA in Wales Police in England and Wales have issued more than 14,000 fines for alleged breaches of lockdown laws. The figures, from 27 March to 11 May, show the most fixed penalty notices - 906 - were handed out in London, by the Metropolitan Police. Gwent Police issued the third-lowest number, with 71, fewer than any other force except Warwickshire and Staffordshire. The data covers the period before the penalty rose from Â£60 to Â£100 in England afterthe rules were eased.The penalty remains at Â£60 in Wales. The National Police Chiefs' Council says 13,445 fines were issued by forces in England and 799 in Wales for breaches of social distancing rules brought in to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

Teachers still unconvinced safe to open schoolsBritish Medical Association agrees should not open schools until number of cases is lower.Family & Education,"Doctors have backed teachers' unions by saying Covid-19 infection rates are too high for England's schools to reopen. The British Medical Association said teachers and heads were ""absolutely right"" to urge caution and prioritise testing to avoid a second spike. It comes after teachers' unions met the government's scientific and medical advisers to express concerns about the planned phased reopening from 1 June. The NASUWT union said no school should reopen until it could show it was safe. England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted schools would only open their doors more widely when the conditions were right to do so, with the earliest date being 1 June. He said he had wanted to give head teachers and parents several weeks to plan for the event. This video can not be played Steve Chalke wants Oasis trust schools to reopen in June The governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have stepped back from setting a firm date. But since the prime minister announced there was to be a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, plans for the phased reopening from the beginning of next month seem to have hardened. After the meeting between the National Education Union and other teaching unions, and the government's top scientific advisers, Mr Williamson said schools would have all the ""guidance and support they will need"". However, teachers' unions say they still have ""unanswered questions"" about how pupils can be invited back and managed safely. When schools return they will have to introduce smaller classes and keep pupils apart NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said: ""No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak."" He added: ""No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided."" The British Medical Association said with so much ""conflicting"" evidence on opening schools, it was ""completely aligned"" with teachers' union calls to delay reopening. ""Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools,"" said a letter from the BMA's council chair. It added there was still too little clear evidence on the extent to which children were carriers of the disease, even though they usually got fewer and less serious symptoms than adults. Calls to publish scientific evidence for return to school Class sizes of no more than 15 when schools reopen How England is following Denmark's model for opening schools Speaking after the meeting NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney welcomed a promise to publish the scientific evidence on school reopening plans. But he called for a clarification over what thresholds would be used to judge if it was safe to open up. And he asked how it would be measured whether reopening increased the rate of infection in the wider community. His union is one of nine opposed to reopening schools on 1 June. But Mr Williamson said: ""I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June."" The DfE proposed teaching pupils in small groups of 15 or fewer and keeping them apart from other children during the school day to limit the spread of any infection, as well as maintaining good hygiene and hand washing. How do you social distance in schools? Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Do I have to send my children back to school? But one of England's biggest academy trusts has become one of the first school groups to say it will reopen from 1 June. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust which has 35 primary schools, says opposition to reopening fails to recognise the harm to disadvantaged children from missing school. Mr Chalke, whose schools on average have 45% of children eligible for free school meals, said: ""The greatest risks for many of our children are being stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise, little or no nutritious food."" Mr Chalke said the schools would not be ""forcing anyone to attend"", either pupils or staff, adding safety measures would be in place. But he stressed that the ""long-term social cost"" of not opening would ""outweigh any short-term medical risks"". Graham Gallagher and his wife Leanne have three young children with special needs. He says schools reopening on 1 June would ""benefit the whole family"", who live in a two-bedroom flat in Walsall in the West Midlands. He feels their children aren't getting a ""valuable learning experience"" at home and worry they could regress from the ""solid progress"" they have made during this school year. At home, the children struggle to concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and Leanne is struggling to manage the learning of all three children at once. Schools reopening would allow the children to learn and socialise in a distraction-free environment with more space and access to an outdoor area. He says the couple share teachers' concerns that they need to be ""properly protected"", and hopes ""plans will be put in place"" to alleviate their worries. LOCKDOWN:How are businesses coping? EVERYDAY HEROES:Stacey Dooley is on the hunt Primary school teacher Mary Newton, 49, says she ""feels very strongly"" that June is ""far too early"" to reopen schools. Her husband John, 56, who runs an educational books company, has been shielding at home after a recent heart attack and Mary says their children returning to school would be a concern for his health. They plan to keep their two children - who are in Years 4 and 6 - at home for as long as they can. She says it could be ""catastrophic"" for a child's mental health if they contracted the virus and transmitted it to a family member who became very ill from it. Children could be ""traumatised"" by the new rules that would have to be adhered to and staff would be anxious, she adds. ""I believe schools should continue to support children of key workers and those most vulnerable"", she says, ""but I certainly won't be sending my Year 6 child back to school in June"".

Ontario Premier Doug Ford wants people to start baking to fight coronavirus stress. After boasting of his baking prowess in a press conference, Mr Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, posted a video of himself making cherry cheesecake. ""If I wasn't premier, I'd open up a cheesecake factory."" Sporting a t-shirt with the phrase ""we're all in this together"", Mr Ford's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times. ""You can tell I've eaten one too many cheesecakes,"" the portly premier joked. Prior to the pandemic, the folksy, conservative politician was best known for public squabbles with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the local teacher's union. But his popularity has soared as people turn into his daily press conference for his no-nonsense takes, such as when he called anti-lockdown protestors ""a bunch of yahoos"".  Allow Twitter content?

Countries across Europe are continuing to report lowering daily death tolls this week, as lockdowns begin to ease. Italy was once the global epicentre of the pandemic, reporting over 900 deaths on 27 March. But authorities there have reported 262 for yesterday. France, Spain and the UK are among the other European states also reporting  declines. Denmark registered no new Covid-19 deaths for the first time since 13 March. Slovenia has become the first EU country to declare the Covid-19 epidemic over, though it is still leaving some protective measures  in place. But as the continent begins to emerge from lockdown, the economic impact of coronavirus is being acutely felt - with millions of consumers confined to their homes, many of them now jobless. Today Germany reported that its economy - the largest in Europe - shrank by 2.2% in the first three months of this year, pushing the country into recession. Dr Sarah Ali says Sudan's healthcare system failed long before coronavirus hit the country Sudanese doctor Sarah Ali is not surprised by the recent report that 250 million people in Africa could catch coronavirus in the first year of the pandemic. She toldthe BBC's OS radio programmethat coronavirus was a huge challenge because of her country's already ""collapsed healthcare system"". The junior doctor has symptoms of Covid-19 herself, so she's self-isolating at home. Ms Ali says the strain on health services means people are dying from other conditions such as heart attacks because there are so few doctors available. One of the biggest hospitals in the capital, Khartoum, is calling for doctors to come and help because [there are] only three doctors,"" she told the BBC. There is also a dire lack of medical equipment needed to fight the virus. [Doctors] canât examine patients because they don't have enough gloves,"" said Mr Ali. ""Weâve been promised that PPE [personal protective equipment] will be provided."" She said doctors like her fear that the actual number of coronavirus cases is ""much, much higher"" than the 1,964 currently reported. People have been permitted to exercise on beaches in Portugal, such as Cascais beach near Lisbon Portugal is set to further ease lockdown restrictions from Monday with the opening of some shops, cafes, restaurants, museums, monuments, galleries, crÃ¨ches and selected school classes. Meanwhile, prime minister Antonio Costa said the country's beaches would reopen on 6 June. He
encouraged the public to download an app that will tell them if
their beach of choice is full or still has space, while other rules needed to be adhered to. According to government figures, Portugal has had 1,190 deaths associated with Covid-19 which was up six from Thursday, and a cumulative total of 28,583 confirmed cases, an increase of 264. A member of the armed forces helping out at a Montreal care home Five soldiers stationed in Canadian nursing homes have been infected with coronavirus, the government confirms. Four soldiers were based in Quebec, one was in Ontario. ""There are always risks in what they do and they go into that knowingly and willingly, and that is why we offer them our deepest gratitude every day,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday. The Canadian Armed Forces have sent about 1,700 personnel to 30 long-term care facilities. The military was called to help in Quebec and Ontario in mid-April, after several outbreaks at residences exacerbated long-standing staffing issues. The military intends to release figures every two weeks on
the number of personnel in long-term care homes who are infected. Approximately 82% of all Covid-19 deaths in Canada occur in these facilities, according to the National Institute on Ageing. Moncef Slaoui (r) outlined the programme at a briefing with President Trump and Health Secretary Alex Azar (l) A bit more now on ""Operation Warp Speed"", the Trump plan to expedite vaccine development we told you about earlier. Moncef Slaoui, former vaccine chief at GlaxoSmithKline, and Gustave Perna, who oversees distribution for the US Army, will head the effort, which will begin with studies on 14 promising vaccine candidates for accelerated research and approval. Trump promised ""roughly $10bn"" to back the project. Speaking after Mr Trump, Mr Slaoui said he was ""confident"" that a ""few hundred million doses of vaccine"" will be delivered by the end of 2020. However, some health experts have remained sceptical about this. ""I don't understand how that happens,"" said Dr Peter Hotez, co-director of the Medicine Coronavirus Vaccine Team at Baylor College. ""I don't see a path by which any vaccine is licensed for emergency use or otherwise till the third quarter of 2021,"" he told CNN, citing safety concerns.

The Scottish Professional Football League will announce that the Premiership season - and the Scottish Cup - will not be completed, which means Celtic will be awarded their ninth consecutive title. The Hoops were 13 points ahead of Glasgow rivals Rangers with eight games remaining. Hearts will be relegated, while Rangers, Motherwell and Aberdeen will gain qualification for the Europa League. Dundee United will be promoted to the Scottish Premiership next season. The lower-league seasons were declared over in April after a controversial ballot. Allow Twitter content?

Katy WatsonBBC South America correspondent Nelson Teich was appointed as health minister on 17 April To lose one health minister was awkward, but to lose two in less than a month is not only embarrassing for Jair Bolsonaro but deeply worrying for Brazil. The country has become the latest coronavirus hotspot and rather than politicians trying to tackle it together, the pandemic has turned political.  The leader of the country is failing to provide direction for a population who really needs it. Nelson Teich didn't give any reasons for his departure, merely saying ""life is full of decisions and I decided to leave"" - but he didn't see eye-to-eye with his boss on the use of chloroquine and his health ministry was excluded this week when Bolsonaro decided to include beauty salons, hairdressers and gyms as essential services. It appears the job of health minister to Bolsonaro is a thankless task at the moment - but itâs a difficult job vacancy at the worst-possible time in Brazil. Ireland were due to tour Australia this summer Reality Check At todayâs press conference in the White House Rose Garden,
President Trump talked up the reopening of the US, saying that âas of this
morning almost every state has taken steps to begin reopeningâ. He added: ""Tomorrow will mark 30 days since we released
the White House guidelines for a safe and phased opening of America - that's
what we're doing."" But some states have eased restrictions before meeting the
reopening criteria proposed by the Trump administration - and Dr Anthony Fauci,
the White House's top infectious disease adviser, has said he's concerned some
states are opening up too soon. Read more inour pieceon the
reopening guidelines and whether states are meeting them. A Masai giraffe near Nairobi A cash-strapped Canadian zoo is fundraising for its latest addition - a baby Masai giraffe born on 12 May. Staff at the Toronto Zoo hope to raise C$70,000 ($49,600; Â£41,000) to reconfigure existing spaces to better accommodate the newborn. Masai giraffes are approximately 2m (6ft) tall at birth, and can grow to over 5.5 meters (19 feet) in adulthood. The money will also go to improving educational and monitoring opportunities. The zoo is facing financial difficulties after being forced to shut its doors due to the coronavirus lockdown. Staff say they plan to reopen as a drive-through experience as soon as they are able. The calf is the firstborn child of six-year-old mother Mstari, who was also born at the zoo. There are only 35,000 Masai giraffes left in the world, and the zoo heralded the birth as ""an important contribution to a genetically healthy Masai giraffe population"". One of the world's largest cigarette companies, British American Tobacco (BAT), says it is ready to begin human trials on a tobacco-based coronavirus vaccine. In a statement, the firm said it was using proteins from tobacco leaves, which have generated a positive immune response in pre-clinical trials. The maker of famous brands such as Lucky Strike said human trials could begin in late June, pending approval by the US Food and Drug Agency. It raised eyebrows after announcing plans for the jab in April, saying it could produce up to three million doses a week if it received government support. But it's not the only tobacco firm to do so - industry rival Philip Morris International is also working on its own vaccine. Police have warned Londoners against taking part in ""spontaneous or planned mass gatherings"" in public this weekend. ""Games of football ...outdoor concerts or parties, protest, marches or assemblies are still not permitted"", the Met's Ch Supt Karen Findlay said. Officers ""will engage and encourage people to comply"" with public health regulations, the force added. Some restrictions have been eased in England, where two people from different households are now allowed to meet in public, and sports in which people can keep apart are now allowed - such as tennis or golf. Social distancing of two metres still has to be observed, althoughpolice do not enforce this guidance,externalbecause it has not been written into the law. The warning came as latest figures show police in England and Walesissued more than 14,000 ticketsfor alleged breaches of lockdown laws. The minimum fine for breaches has recently increased from Â£60 ($73) to Â£100 (reduced to Â£50 if paid within two weeks), while repeat offenders can also face fines of up to Â£3,200. The pandemic has left European football leagues in a state of flux as they figured out how to conclude their respective seasons. Today, the Belgian top flight, like its Dutch and French counterparts, provided closure to its own competition by announcing Club Bruges as champions. It was a fairly easy decision because the Club had a 15-point lead over Gent with one match left when the season was suspended. It was also announced that Waasland-Beveren would be relegated while Gent would enter next season's Champions League. The German Bundesliga restarts this weekend behind closed doors,while the English Premier League,Italian Serie A and Spain's La Liga are hoping to resume in the second week of June. The Netherlands starting easing its lockdown earlier this week The Dutch government has issued new guidance to single people seeking intimacy during the pandemic: find a ""sex buddy"". The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) says singletons should come to an arrangement with one person. But couples should avoid sex if one of them suspects they have coronavirus, the advice says. It comes after critics argued social distancing rules have complicated intimate relations for partners not living together.

Guests have been visiting Universal Orlando's CityWalk in Florida, where some entertainment venues are open for limited hours Zion National Park in Springdale, Utah also had a limited reopening on Thursday Some businesses have been able to reopen in Ohio, such as Cincinnati's Findlay Market Construction work has begun again in parts of New York State In Wisconsin bars and restaurants reopened after the state's Supreme Court overturned a lockdown extension announced by Democratic governor Tony Evers earlier in the week. There have been 434 coronavirus-related deaths in Wisconsin, with more than 11,000 confirmed cases. Images of people going out for a meal soon emerged - for instance Nick's Bar in Platteville shared a picture showing it was packed with patrons. Allow Twitter content?

How did a country with a population of 97 million people, record only just over 300 cases of Covid-19 and not a single death? That country is Vietnam. It implemented extreme measures as soon as it recorded its first case on 23 January. In came travel restrictions, close monitoring and then closure of the border with China.  Health checks were increased at other borders. ""This is a country that has dealt with a lot of outbreaks in the past,"" said Prof Guy Thwaites, director of Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City. ""The government and population are very, very used to dealing with infectious diseases and are respectful of them, probably far more so than wealthier countries,"" he said. ""They know how to respond to these things."" Read more here Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Moscow has launched a mass screening programme for coronavirus antibodies, inviting people chosen at random from various age groups to clinics across the city. The hope is that the test results can allow the authorities to map their way out of lockdown, despite uncertainty over how much immunity to Covid-19 the antibodies actually provide. Three dozen Moscow clinics are collecting intravenous blood samples, which are sent to laboratories for analysis overnight. Russian doctors believe the method, known as IFA, is more accurate than express-testing used elsewhere. It identifies the Immunoglobulin M antibody (IgM), which appears when the body is fighting a new infection, and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) which shows that someone has previously been infected. Swabs for Covid-19 itself are taken at the same time. Free tests will be given to 70,000 people every three days, allowing Moscow to build a much clearer picture of the spread of the virus since the start of the epidemic â as well as isolating anyone who is sick, but didnât realise it. This is in addition to widespread coronavirus testing of those with symptoms thatâs already taking place. ""If thatâs whatâs needed, then itâs needed,"" one man who had received a text-message inviting him for testing told the BBC. ""The main thing is that itâs free!"" Vladimir Putin this week announced that the full nationwide lockdown was over, instructing regional leaders to decide when to lift specific restrictions. Moscowâs mayor has described that as the ""most difficult decision"" of his life, and schools and playgrounds, bars and many businesses remain closed until at least 31 May. Russia currently has one of the worldâs highest rates of coronavirus infection, with 10,598 new cases detected on Friday. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The UK has denied that travellers from France will be exempted from its planned quarantine measures. Under the plans - announced last weekend - people arriving in the UK from abroad will be obliged to isolate themselves for 14 days. Initially, the two governments said the exemption would apply to any travellers between France and the UK, and any future steps would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner. The policy attracted criticism from other governments and the EU. Some experts suggested it would be unworkable. But today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesmansaid there was no French exemption, and that the original statement referred to co-operation
to manage the common border. It now appears that those exempted from the policy could include freight drivers - to allow the flow of goods to continue - and people working on Covid-19 research, but not ordinary travellers.

Teachers still unconvinced safe to open schools,"Doctors have backed teachers' unions by saying Covid-19 infection rates are too high for England's schools to reopen. The British Medical Association said teachers and heads were ""absolutely right"" to urge caution and prioritise testing to avoid a second spike. It comes after teachers' unions met the government's scientific and medical advisers to express concerns about the planned phased reopening from 1 June. The NASUWT union said no school should reopen until it could show it was safe. England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted schools would only open their doors more widely when the conditions were right to do so, with the earliest date being 1 June. He said he had wanted to give head teachers and parents several weeks to plan for the event. This video can not be played Steve Chalke wants Oasis trust schools to reopen in June The governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have stepped back from setting a firm date. But since the prime minister announced there was to be a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, plans for the phased reopening from the beginning of next month seem to have hardened. After the meeting between the National Education Union and other teaching unions, and the government's top scientific advisers, Mr Williamson said schools would have all the ""guidance and support they will need"". However, teachers' unions say they still have ""unanswered questions"" about how pupils can be invited back and managed safely. When schools return they will have to introduce smaller classes and keep pupils apart NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said: ""No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak."" He added: ""No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided."" The British Medical Association said with so much ""conflicting"" evidence on opening schools, it was ""completely aligned"" with teachers' union calls to delay reopening. ""Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools,"" said a letter from the BMA's council chair. It added there was still too little clear evidence on the extent to which children were carriers of the disease, even though they usually got fewer and less serious symptoms than adults. Calls to publish scientific evidence for return to school Class sizes of no more than 15 when schools reopen How England is following Denmark's model for opening schools Speaking after the meeting NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney welcomed a promise to publish the scientific evidence on school reopening plans. But he called for a clarification over what thresholds would be used to judge if it was safe to open up. And he asked how it would be measured whether reopening increased the rate of infection in the wider community. His union is one of nine opposed to reopening schools on 1 June. But Mr Williamson said: ""I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June."" The DfE proposed teaching pupils in small groups of 15 or fewer and keeping them apart from other children during the school day to limit the spread of any infection, as well as maintaining good hygiene and hand washing. How do you social distance in schools? Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Do I have to send my children back to school? But one of England's biggest academy trusts has become one of the first school groups to say it will reopen from 1 June. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust which has 35 primary schools, says opposition to reopening fails to recognise the harm to disadvantaged children from missing school. Mr Chalke, whose schools on average have 45% of children eligible for free school meals, said: ""The greatest risks for many of our children are being stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise, little or no nutritious food."" Mr Chalke said the schools would not be ""forcing anyone to attend"", either pupils or staff, adding safety measures would be in place. But he stressed that the ""long-term social cost"" of not opening would ""outweigh any short-term medical risks"". Graham Gallagher and his wife Leanne have three young children with special needs. He says schools reopening on 1 June would ""benefit the whole family"", who live in a two-bedroom flat in Walsall in the West Midlands. He feels their children aren't getting a ""valuable learning experience"" at home and worry they could regress from the ""solid progress"" they have made during this school year. At home, the children struggle to concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and Leanne is struggling to manage the learning of all three children at once. Schools reopening would allow the children to learn and socialise in a distraction-free environment with more space and access to an outdoor area. He says the couple share teachers' concerns that they need to be ""properly protected"", and hopes ""plans will be put in place"" to alleviate their worries. LOCKDOWN:How are businesses coping? EVERYDAY HEROES:Stacey Dooley is on the hunt Primary school teacher Mary Newton, 49, says she ""feels very strongly"" that June is ""far too early"" to reopen schools. Her husband John, 56, who runs an educational books company, has been shielding at home after a recent heart attack and Mary says their children returning to school would be a concern for his health. They plan to keep their two children - who are in Years 4 and 6 - at home for as long as they can. She says it could be ""catastrophic"" for a child's mental health if they contracted the virus and transmitted it to a family member who became very ill from it. Children could be ""traumatised"" by the new rules that would have to be adhered to and staff would be anxious, she adds. ""I believe schools should continue to support children of key workers and those most vulnerable"", she says, ""but I certainly won't be sending my Year 6 child back to school in June"".

Sturgeon: Scots 'need to get some normality back',"This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'We can't live like this forever' Nicola Sturgeon has said that Scotland ""needs to get some normality back"" as she hinted that some measures to ease lockdown could be unveiled next week. The first minister said that any easing would be careful and gradual, because lives are still at stake. And while she was not yet able to give dates for when things might start to open again, she said that people ""can't live like this forever"". Ms Sturgeon said she could outline some ""minor changes"" next week. These would be unveiled alongside further details of the range of options the Scottish government has been looking at, she told her daily briefing. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest updates How lockdown rules differ between Scotland and England Why might the R number be higher in Scotland? There has already minor easing of the lockdown restrictions in England, with some people who cannot work from home returning to their workplaces on Wednesday. Most of these measures have not yet been introduced elsewhere in the UK - although the Scottish government has already relaxed its rules to allow outdoor exercise more than once a day and Wales hasoutlined a cautious route out of lockdownthat does not include any dates for when changes could be made. The number of people dying with coronavirus in Scotland has been falling over the past fortnight, but Ms Sturgeon said further lockdown changes would only be considered when ""we hopefully see more evidence of a downward trend in the virus"". And she said she would continue to err on the side of caution for as long as lives continued to be at risk. But Ms Sturgeon added: ""We can't live like this forever, so we need to get some normality back as we continue to suppress the virus. ""Even when we can't yet give firm dates on when things will open up again, at least we will seek to share with you the order of priority and further phasing. ""Next week I will share with you more information on the assessments we are making and the range of options we are now looking at, and also any further minor changes we might make in the short-term."" Scotland has been in lockdown for the past seven weeks The first minister also said that a balance would need be struck between getting the economy going again and allowing more social interaction. She said: ""A life where you go to work but stay locked down with no family interaction for the rest of the time is not one many of us, if any of us, would enjoy"". Teaching unions have been urging the Scottish government to explicitly rule out the possibility of schools reopening before the new term begins in August. Ms Sturgeon said there was no chance of schools getting back to normal ""in any way, shape or form"" before the summer holidays begin next month. She said discussions were taking place over whether it would be possible for any pupils to return to the classroom by then - but it was likely to be on a ""very limited basis"" if it was to happen at all. Few - if any - Scottish pupils are likely to return to school before the summer holidays The virus appears to have hit the central belt of Scotland and its larger cities harder than more rural areas, with Ms Sturgeon regularly warning that the infection rate - the so-called R number - continues to behigher north of the border than it is in England. Ms Sturgeon said on Thursday her government was ""not ruling out"" the possibility of more rural areas with fewer cases of the virus having their lockdowns eased first. However, she stressed that she was not proposing that approach ""at this stage"". A further 46 people in Scotland have died after testing positive for the virus, bringing the total by that measure to 2,053. However, the total number of deaths stands at more than 3,200 once those with suspected cases of Covid-19 are included. More than half of all registered deaths involving the virus continue to be happening in care homes, although the numbers have been falling. LOOK-UP TOOL:How exposed is your job?

London congestion charge to be reinstated,"TfL said NHS and care workers would be exempt from the congestion charge. The congestion charge for people driving into central London will be reintroduced on Monday under the terms of a Â£1.6bn government bailout. It follows a deal in which Transport for London (TfL) secured emergency funding to keep Tube and bus services going until September. From 22 June, the congestion charge will also rise from Â£11.50 to Â£15. Downing Street defended the changes saying it ""only applied to a small area of central London"". The prime minister's official spokesman said roads in these areas ""would come to a halt without it"" and it was an ""important tool to ensure that emissions in London remain low and support better air quality"". TfL said the resumed congestion charge would be temporarily extended to between 07:00 and 22:00, seven days a week, from 22 June and the price rise would be in place for a year. Both measures will be reviewed later to see if they are made permanent. A system of reimbursement for NHS workers in place before the charge was suspended on 23 March will also be extended to care home workers. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to socially distance on public transport Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the measures were designed to avoid a build up of traffic after the government urged people returning to work to avoid public transport. TfL said the plans would ""create more space for social distancing when walking and cycling, ensuring that the people who have no choice but to return to work in central London can do so as safely as possible"". Some streets will be converted to walking and cycling only, with others restricted to all traffic apart from buses, creating ""one of the world's largest car-free zones"". Government agrees Â£1.6bn London transport bailout How will transport need to change? Waterloo Bridge and London Bridge may be restricted to people walking, cycling and buses only, with pavements widened to enable people to safely travel between busy railway stations and their workplaces. Mr Khan warned public transport must only be used ""as a last resort"". The low emission zone and ultra low emission zone - imposing levies on high-polluting vehicles - also comes back into operation on Monday. Also under the conditions of the government deal, children will no longer have free travel across London and restrictions on travel passes for people with a disability or over the age of 60 will also be imposed during peak hours. Fares on buses - scrapped to help protect drivers from Covid-19 - will also be reintroduced. The Department for Transport (DfT) said these changes would be put in place ""as soon as practicable"".

Black-cab driver and general secretary of the London Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA) Steve McNamara said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" no one had been consulted about plans to change the use of some roads. ""Usually you have to consult with the public and businesses - they are using a health emergency to get around the laws to consult people before you do these things,"" he said. ""It's a land grab to exclude Londoners from their roads and to widen pavements for more cycling."" Coronavirus has had a significant impact on the London Underground Mr Khan said the government deal was necessary because coronavirus had had a ""catastrophic impact on TfL's finances"". ""I want to be completely honest and upfront with Londoners,"" the mayor said. ""This is not the deal I wanted. But it was the only deal the government put on the table and I had no choice but to accept it to keep the Tubes and buses running."" New coronavirus data shows London ethnic breakdown Woman says coronavirus saved her life 'I found out I had cancer on the day of lockdown' The DfT also announced TfL will introduce fare rises of 1% above the rate of inflation from next year. Mr Khan hasfrozen single fares since he became mayor in May 2016. The congestion charge was suspended on March 23 as the country went into lockdown Natalie Chapman, of the Freight Transport Association, said the congestion charge hike ""ignored the needs of London businesses"".

By Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent The old adage in promoting cycling and walking or active travel is you have to make driving cars horrible - and that is certainly what's happening here. These are radical changes to London's streets. If you want to drive around central London be prepared not to be allowed in certain roads and to pay Â£15 a day. Drivers fear gridlock. But cycling and walking advocates will be rejoicing that parts of the city are being given over to them. The other side story here is the political row between the government and the Mayor and the many strings attached to the bailout. Future infrastructure is up in the air and fare rises will happen in January. Sadiq Khan says he won't be able to be the mayor he wants to be and Londoners are being punished.

Google spotlights more suspected gadget-scam adsSome large ads at the top of its results were for sites it now believes were stealing users' cash.Technology,"Fresh evidence that scam stores are exploiting Google's Shopping service to appear at the top of its search results has been discovered by the BBC.

Germany enters recession,"German GDP growth has been negative for two successive quarters, the definition of a recession. Germany's economy shrank by 2.2% in the first three months of this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed it into recession, official figures indicate. It was the biggest quarterly fall since 2009, when the country was engulfed in the global financial crisis. The figures from the Federal Statistics Office,externalcome as Germany takes its first tentative steps to exit lockdown. Shops are reopening, pupils will gradually return to class and football is restarting behind closed doors. At the same time, figures for the final three months of 2019 were revised to show a contraction of 0.1%. That means German GDP growth has been negative for two successive quarters, the technical definition of a recession. The figures are in line with market expectations, says BBC global trade correspondent Dharshini David. The German economy was already lacklustre before the onset of the pandemic, as the US-China trade war cast a shadow over activity, our correspondent points out. The statistics office warned that the figures were subject to extreme uncertainty, with the next estimate due out on 25 May. EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' Germany is Europe's largest economy, but the drop is not as bad as in some of its neighbours, such as France, which has seen a decline of 5.8%, and Italy, which reported a 4.7% fall. This effect is partly due to a decision by Germany's 16 states to allow factories and construction sites to stay open, as well as an unprecedented rescue package by the government. Economists expect a deeper slump in the second quarter of the year, as the full effects of the lockdown become apparent. Germany, along with just about every other economy on the planet, has been hit by the combination of official restrictions on movement and commercial activity, as well as by personal choices to avoid the risk of infection. Consumer spending was down and so was investment (apart from construction which, along with government spending, softened the economic blow). Germany is a big power in global trade and imports and exports were both lower. It was a sharp contraction overall, but so far at least, the blows to the German economy have not generally been as severe as those suffered by the rest of the eurozone. The other three largest economies - France, Italy and Spain - were all hit much harder by the health crisis and have seen much larger declines in the first three months of 2020. For the quarter now under way, Germany will take a hit, but it has an advantage compared to those others. Tourism is a smaller part of the economy and it's a sector that is facing an extremely challenging 2020 summer season. Separate growth figures released byEU statistics office Eurostat for the eurozone,externalas a whole confirmed an earlier estimate showing a record decline of 3.8% in the January-to-March period. For the 27-nation EU, the equivalent figure was 3.3%. Eurostat also issued figures showing a 0.2% fall in eurozone employment, the first such decline since 2013. ""The German economy has been tiptoeing on the edge of recession since the beginning of 2019, but it can hide no longer,"" said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""The German business cycle expansion, which started in 2013, ended decisively in Q1, and more pain is ahead in the near term before the recovery."" RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Financial district prepares for new way of working,"London's Canary Wharf has drawn up detailed plans to bring back tens of thousands of bankers, lawyers and accountants to the financial district as the coronavirus pandemic eases. Rules on lift capacity, one-way routes around the Manhattan-style towers, and staggered working will be put in place. The Docklands complex, the European home of HSBC, Barclays and Citigroup, has a working population of 120,000. Canary Wharf expects a tenth of that to return over the next couple of weeks. Like vast swathes of the population, many employees at Canary Wharf have been working from home. However, as firstreported in the Financial Times,external, with signs that the national lockdown is starting to ease, Canary Wharf has been talking to firms about measures to improve safety and social distancing. Howard Dawber managing director of strategy at Britain's single biggest office complex, told the BBC that the company was assuming that social distancing would be ""kept in place for some time"" by the government. ""We are talking about a new way of working, and we've had to re-think from first principles,"" he said. A lot of office and soft furnishings have been removed from the 16.5 million sq. ft. of office and retail space to enable greater social distancing. There will also be restrictions on numbers using lifts. The company has calculated that with four people in each lift, its office tower at One Canada Square - the second highest building in the UK behind the Shard - can move 56 people every five minutes per lift bank. This equates to almost 2,700 per hour over the four banks of eight lifts used in the 50-storey building. After talks with Canary Wharf's tenants, Mr Dawber expects between 10% and 20% of employees to return in the next few weeks. But he says a lot will depend on public transport availability and the re-opening of schools. But the return to work comes amid debate about the future of office working and if the rise in video-conferencing during the lockdown will continue. Last month, the chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, said that having thousands of bank workers in big, expensive city offices ""may be a thing of the past"". This had led to a rethink of the bank's long term ""location strategy"", Mr Staley said. Mr Dawber said: ""May be home working during lockdown will accelerate trends, but big companies will still need a central hub."" ""It's possible our next generation of interior design may be different, may involve more collaborative space like tech hubs,"" he said. In addition to the workforce, Canary Wharf was getting 40,000 daily visitors before the lockdown. A survey from the Chartered Management Institute suggests 60% of its members want to split their working week between home and office after the pandemic. Occupational psychologists call it blended working and suggest it can improve productivity, motivation and job satisfaction. They say blended work suits people who are motivated and organised. It does not suit employees who need more structure and guidance - or those who don't have space at home. A substantial percentage of workers staying at home for half of the week would have unpredictable but potentially major ramifications. There would be much more room on buses and trains, and traffic would be eased - meaning fewer emissions and cleaner air, and less spending on new roads. Car parks in city centres could become green space instead. There would implications for commercial property prices as companies shrink their office space, and for residential property too, because statistics suggest that if people work partly at home, some choose to live even further from the office.

Katherine Ryan: Miscarriage 'felt shameful',"Ryan says ""girls need to know that you can have this secret, silent miscarriage"" Katherine Ryan has said her miscarriage in February made her feel ""embarrassed and shameful"", adding women and girls need more information on losing a baby. ""I think it needs to be on the curriculum, I think girls need to know that you can have this secret, silent miscarriage,"" she told Love Island host Laura Whitmore'sCastaway podcast,external. ""I felt embarrassed for getting excited before the loss,"" said the Canadian comedian and actress. She had been 10 weeks pregnant. Ryan told Whitmore: ""I know it can be a very lonely experience, and it's shrouded in all this embarrassment... I felt all these things, and I looked for stories and I really couldn't find many of them. ""I felt like a walking tomb and it took me a month to sort it out to get it out. It's crazy, they don't teach us this in school."" 'Teach schoolchildren about baby loss' 'I thought I was losing my mind after miscarriage' The Department for Education told the BBC: ""We want to support all young people to be happy, healthy and safe.

I genuinely didn't know that a miscarriage can happen in this way.""

""So I was having a scan, and was then told I needed an internal scan, and I thought 'something's weird', but by now the doctor had turned the screen to herself so I couldn't see it and I just knew something was wrong. ""The doctor said 'oh I'm sorry, we would expect to see a heartbeat but we don't, and we're going to have to have a very different conversation here', and then I thought 'well that's done'. ""I think I was really embarrassed, I don't want anyone to see when I'm upset, so I was happy, smiley, she must have thought who is this psycho...? ""I had a gig in Liverpool that evening, so I said 'I'm sorry I have to go to work'."" She said she carried on working, saying: ""You think you did something wrong but you keep it to yourself."" Ryan's body continued to carry the embryo, and she explained: ""Basically my mind knew I had lost the baby, my body just would not recognise it had lost this baby. ""So three weeks passed and I tried the medical management three times, and it didn't work. That was was the hardest part of it - remaining pregnant with a deceased embryo for that long. ""And having to work, doing the job that I do, and smile and I was just not the same human being, it was crazy to me, the most nuts thing. I would not recommend it to anyone. Laura Whitmore spoke on the podcast about her own miscarriage in 2018 ""I had surgery, but in that three weeks you can't be positive, you don't have that part of your brain that says carry on - it's like this terrible dark, deep feeling. ""People recover and they don't mention it again, they start to forget the hardest part, but right now I haven't forgotten yet. It was so grim and I felt like a bad mom, I couldn't get it out - 'maybe this little soul is scared and doesn't want to be alone'."" At this moment on the podcast, Ryan became emotional and paused, before adding: ""It's fine now, that's just always the bit that gets me. ""So if that should be a story that touches your own life, I really hope it doesn't. The last thing I would want is that hopelessness and shame and weird energy of 'keep it to yourself, don't upset anyone, be a good girl and take it on the chin and keep it moving. I have felt this collective grief."" Whitmore said this echoed her own miscarriage in 2018, adding: ""It's crazy you said that, because I've never told you this, but I remember in my situation about two years ago when we went for our scan, it was supposed to be the first proper scan, and there was no heartbeat. ""I think for the doctors it happens so much that they're quite used to it, I didn't realise the figures until afterwards. So I didn't know how I was supposed to react, was I supposed to be upset, was I supposed to be 'oh, ok' and move on. ""I remember being all over the place, and I remember [my partner] Ian saying to me, 'shall we just go home', and I said 'I want to have a little bit of escapism, I want to go out, have a glass of wine, I want to laugh, I want to watch a show and then I want to deal with this - everyone reacts differently"". They went on to see Ryan performing stand-up at a live gig that evening, and Whitmore said she carried on working afterwards, including at the MTV Awards. ""I was on stage doing a show - people don't know the secrets woman are carrying around because people are afraid to share them,"" she said. Katherine Ryan has lived in the UK for more than a decade Ryan said on her own podcast: ""When it happens to you, that's when you realise how traumatic it is. Women historically have been expected to get on with things. ""The reason we don't talk about miscarriage more is not for the sufferer of the miscarriage, not for the mom and family, it's for everyone else. It's a way of being polite - nobody wants you to say you found out you lost a baby. "" She told Whitmore: ""I think the more women that tell their stories about this... it was important for me to share it, even if it helps just one person.""

Unions demand assurances over 1 June school plan,"Doctors have backed teachers' unions by saying Covid-19 infection rates are too high for England's schools to reopen. The British Medical Association said teachers and heads were ""absolutely right"" to urge caution and prioritise testing to avoid a second spike. It comes after teachers' unions met the government's scientific and medical advisers to express concerns about the planned phased reopening from 1 June. The NASUWT union said no school should reopen until it could show it was safe. England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted schools would only open their doors more widely when the conditions were right to do so, with the earliest date being 1 June. He said he had wanted to give head teachers and parents several weeks to plan for the event. This video can not be played Steve Chalke wants Oasis trust schools to reopen in June The governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have stepped back from setting a firm date. But since the prime minister announced there was to be a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, plans for the phased reopening from the beginning of next month seem to have hardened. After the meeting between the National Education Union and other teaching unions, and the government's top scientific advisers, Mr Williamson said schools would have all the ""guidance and support they will need"". However, teachers' unions say they still have ""unanswered questions"" about how pupils can be invited back and managed safely. When schools return they will have to introduce smaller classes and keep pupils apart NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said: ""No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak."" He added: ""No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided."" The British Medical Association said with so much ""conflicting"" evidence on opening schools, it was ""completely aligned"" with teachers' union calls to delay reopening. ""Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools,"" said a letter from the BMA's council chair. It added there was still too little clear evidence on the extent to which children were carriers of the disease, even though they usually got fewer and less serious symptoms than adults. Calls to publish scientific evidence for return to school Class sizes of no more than 15 when schools reopen How England is following Denmark's model for opening schools Speaking after the meeting NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney welcomed a promise to publish the scientific evidence on school reopening plans. But he called for a clarification over what thresholds would be used to judge if it was safe to open up. And he asked how it would be measured whether reopening increased the rate of infection in the wider community. His union is one of nine opposed to reopening schools on 1 June. But Mr Williamson said: ""I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June."" The DfE proposed teaching pupils in small groups of 15 or fewer and keeping them apart from other children during the school day to limit the spread of any infection, as well as maintaining good hygiene and hand washing. How do you social distance in schools? Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Do I have to send my children back to school? But one of England's biggest academy trusts has become one of the first school groups to say it will reopen from 1 June. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust which has 35 primary schools, says opposition to reopening fails to recognise the harm to disadvantaged children from missing school. Mr Chalke, whose schools on average have 45% of children eligible for free school meals, said: ""The greatest risks for many of our children are being stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise, little or no nutritious food."" Mr Chalke said the schools would not be ""forcing anyone to attend"", either pupils or staff, adding safety measures would be in place. But he stressed that the ""long-term social cost"" of not opening would ""outweigh any short-term medical risks"". Graham Gallagher and his wife Leanne have three young children with special needs. He says schools reopening on 1 June would ""benefit the whole family"", who live in a two-bedroom flat in Walsall in the West Midlands. He feels their children aren't getting a ""valuable learning experience"" at home and worry they could regress from the ""solid progress"" they have made during this school year. At home, the children struggle to concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and Leanne is struggling to manage the learning of all three children at once. Schools reopening would allow the children to learn and socialise in a distraction-free environment with more space and access to an outdoor area. He says the couple share teachers' concerns that they need to be ""properly protected"", and hopes ""plans will be put in place"" to alleviate their worries. LOCKDOWN:How are businesses coping? EVERYDAY HEROES:Stacey Dooley is on the hunt Primary school teacher Mary Newton, 49, says she ""feels very strongly"" that June is ""far too early"" to reopen schools. Her husband John, 56, who runs an educational books company, has been shielding at home after a recent heart attack and Mary says their children returning to school would be a concern for his health. They plan to keep their two children - who are in Years 4 and 6 - at home for as long as they can. She says it could be ""catastrophic"" for a child's mental health if they contracted the virus and transmitted it to a family member who became very ill from it. Children could be ""traumatised"" by the new rules that would have to be adhered to and staff would be anxious, she adds. ""I believe schools should continue to support children of key workers and those most vulnerable"", she says, ""but I certainly won't be sending my Year 6 child back to school in June"".

Lockdown exit plan for Wales 'puts health first',"This video can not be played Coronavirus lockdown exit plan for Wales 'puts health first' There could be ""more things we are able to do"" in two weeks' time as Wales moves slowly out of lockdown, the first minister said. ""We are already in the red zone,"" Mark Drakeford said, as he unveiled a plan for returning to some form of normality. While no dates were given, he said his ""traffic lights"" route out of lockdown also included amber and green stages. There have been restrictions on daily life for seven weeks. ""We've already begun to leave lockdown as it was originally imposed and I am hopeful that, provided coronavirus remains at or below the levels we currently see, there will be more things we will be able to do in the red zone at the end of the current three weeks,"" he said. Lockdown has been in force since March A further three weeks of lockdown were announced last Friday, and Mr Drakeford added: ""We've got to be confident that the initial moves that we make don't inadvertently result in coronavirus being on the rise again."" The cautious route out of lockdown is ""putting people's health first"", he said. ""All our decisions will be based on the latest scientific advice. ""We will act carefully and cautiously, in partnership with people, in a way that is right for Wales. And we will put people's health first."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the UK and Welsh governments have worked closely together every step of the way. ""I am glad that this announcement brings that alignment even closer, providing more certainty for jobs and businesses across Wales."" Welsh Conservatives leader Paul Davies described it as ""a roadmap to a cul-de-sac, not a roadmap to recovery"", and a ""hopeless plan"". ""We need to begin to unlock society but Mark Drakeford seems to have lost his keys,"" he said. Who am I allowed to meet now? Welsh government 'not told about stay alert' Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the strategy was ""thin on detail"" and how it will end community transmission. He added New Zealand's model of driving down the R number to reduce avoidable deaths and ""eradicate"" new cases should be mirrored in Wales, and local lockdowns for clusters should eventually be considered. ""The onus will fall on the Welsh Government to urgently change gear on testing and tracing to allow us to move safely on to the next phase on the path to recovery,"" he said. The Brexit Party tweeted: ""Welsh Labour are playing politics during a pandemic. It's time to end the confusion and work on a UK-wide approach to fighting the virus."" The opening of garden centres was described as the ""first steps on our recovering journey"" after lockdown was introduced in March There has been pressure from some quarters for a faster easing of the lockdown in a bid to restart the economy. In England, a similar plan includes suggested timetables. In Wales, the government is using a traffic-light system for phased reductions in the lockdown. ""While the traffic light approach is useful, employers are still waiting for clear guidance about how they will be able to re-open premises and resume work safely in accordance with Welsh legislation,"" said Ian Price, director of industry body CBI Wales. ""Indicative timelines outlining when sectors and workplaces can come back online are also needed, so businesses of all shapes and sizes can quickly ramp-up essential restart planning and decision-making."" Mr Drakeford stressed the country was only now moving ""carefully and cautiously"" into the first red zone, what he called the ""first steps on our recovering journey"". Providing the virus remained under control, Wales would move to the amber zone which would see more signs of returning to normal. The ""green zone"" would come when the country was ""still on top of the virus"". There life would begin to look more like it was before coronavirus began ""but not identical to it,"" warned Mr Drakeford. He said until a vaccine or effective treatment was found, coronavirus would be ""with us for a long time to come"". Mr Drakeford said it would be ""self-policing"" rather than police officers enforcing rules which gets Wales through the crisis as officers' jobs will become harder if different sectors move out of restrictions at different times. The people of Wales ""need hope"" in terms of how restrictions are lifted, he said, and that his plan provided ""more detail than we've ever had before"". The Welsh Government says it would like to bring some children back to school before the summer holidays Mr Drakeford said the ""ambition"" was to get some children ""back into school before the summer break"". Education Minister Kirsty Williams published a document she said would be a ""stimulus for wider discussion and feedback"" on how social distancing and other measures will be implemented. Most schools have been closed since the start of the pandemic, with some open for the children of critical workers and those deemed as vulnerable. ""Nothing would make me happier than seeing our classrooms full again,"" Ms Williams said. ""But I want to be clear that this framework does not - and I will not - set an arbitrary date for when more pupils will return to school. ""Setting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do."" She said it will not be one decision but ""a series of decisions over time"". Ms Williams said when Wales was ready to move into the next phase, she would make sure there is enough time for preparation and for staff to carry out necessary training. Five key principles for schools returning - set out in April - focus on safety and mental, emotional and physical wellbeing of students and staff. The UK government intends schools in England to re-open to more pupils before the holiday, but there is no such timetable in the Welsh Government's roadmap. The theme throughout this Welsh Government document is caution - a slow and careful unfolding of the lockdown which will require difficult choices about priorities. It says an effective system of track and trace is essential as is the continued compliance of the general public. The document warns the capacity of the Welsh Government to put robust systems in place will dictate the timetable. A traffic lights system of red, amber and green gives lists of likely easements at different stages - but that depends on the headroomoffered by the R rate, indicating the disease's ability to spread, which will remain the focus. While easements are complicated and interlinked, it will be necessary to choose between them and those which offer the greatest relief for general quality of life will be prioritised. But the message is clear that ""normal life"" could be years away. The general public are invited to share their views on the way forward. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

UK warns of 'very little progress' in EU talks,"""Very little progress"" has been made in the latest round of UK-EU trade talks, the UK government has said. The UK's negotiator David Frost said a far-reaching free trade agreement could be agreed before the end of the year ""without major difficulties"". But it was being held up by the EU's desire to ""bind"" the UK to its laws and seek unfair access to fishing waters. The EU's Michel Barnier suggested the UK's own demands were ""not realistic"" and warned of a looming stalemate. Speaking in Brussels, the bloc's chief negotiator said ""no progress had been made on the most difficult issues"". Asked by the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler what the chances were of an agreement. Mr Barnier said he was ""still determined but not optimistic"". The EU, he added, would not accept a deal ""at any price"" and it was stepping up preparations for a no-deal outcome, in which the two sides would trade with each other under World Trade Organisation rules. UK urges EU to uphold rights of British expats What happens after Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Insisting the EU would not negotiate ""in haste"", he said the UK must consider whether it was feasible to strike a deal before the end of 2020, when the current 11-month transition period is due to end. The UK has said it will not extend the process beyond 31 December, despite coming under growing pressure at home to allow more time for a deal due to the coronavirus pandemic. The two sides have been discussing their future economic and security partnership following the UK's withdrawal from the 27-member bloc on 31 January. In a statement, Mr Frost said there was a ""good understanding"" between the negotiators but that little or no progress had been on the most ""significant outstanding issues"". Analysis by Gavin Lee, Brussels reporter Former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker used to describe Brexit talks as being like a ""dance"" and regularly rolled out the stock phrase that ""it takes two to tango"". There's no dancing anymore. Today Michel Barnier made clear he'd rejected any such romantic terms for these trade negotiations, telling reporters it was neither ""a dance nor a tango or any other kind of dance"". He said the teams weren't ""even in the same room"" and this wasn't nearly as effective as getting together around a table. The hours of screen time have led to an impasse, with both sides now urging the other to change strategy, and to understand the other's position more clearly. I spoke to Spanish and French diplomats in Brussels. ""Quelle surprise"" was the view. They believe both sides will ""continue to play tough and offer little ground"" and that genuine compromise may come in a month, for the fourth and final scheduled round before the summer. But few officials here are following the twists and turns with the dedication of the past. The urgency of dealing with the pandemic has reduced the attention to Brexit. He said the EU was insisting upon a ""set of novel and unbalanced proposals"" in relation to competition issues that went well beyond other comparable trade agreements struck with other major economies. The UK, he said, would not agree to ""a so-called level playing field which would bind this country to EU law or standards, or determine our domestic legal regimes"". The EU's Michel Barnier said he was ""not optimistic"" about the prospects of an agreement by the end of 2020 A level-playing field is a term for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country undercutting their rivals and gaining a competitive advantage over those operating in other countries. The EU, Mr Frost added, was seeking continued access to UK fishing waters after the transition period ""in a way that is incompatible with our future status as an independent coastal state"". ""It is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement,"" he said. ""We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on 1 June. ""The UK will continue to work hard to find an agreement, for as long as there is a constructive process in being, and continues to believe that this is possible."" Mr Frost said the UK would make public all its draft legal texts next week so EU member states and interested observers ""can see our approach in detail"". In his update, Mr Barnier said the EU's aim was a ""modern, forward-looking"" agreement which would avoid any tariffs or quotas on trade. But he said it was not prepared to ""copy and paste"" aspects of existing agreements with Canada, Japan and South Korea or do sector-by-sector deals ""rooted in past precedents"". Tariff-free access to the EU's single market had to be accompanied by obligations, he added, and the UK could not ""pick and choose"" which of these it adhered to. ""You cannot have the best of both worlds,"" he said. ""Open and fair competition is not a nice to have. It is a must-have."" A ""new dynamism"" would be needed in the next round of talks to deliver ""tangible progress"", he added. Mr Barnier said he would listen to concerns the UK had about the treatment of British expats on the continent as part of the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement governing the terms of the UK's exit.

UK warns of 'very little progress' in EU talksDisagreements remain over fishing and competition as the EU's Michel Barnier warns of a stalemate.UK PoliticsComments,"""Very little progress"" has been made in the latest round of UK-EU trade talks, the UK government has said. The UK's negotiator David Frost said a far-reaching free trade agreement could be agreed before the end of the year ""without major difficulties"". But it was being held up by the EU's desire to ""bind"" the UK to its laws and seek unfair access to fishing waters. The EU's Michel Barnier suggested the UK's own demands were ""not realistic"" and warned of a looming stalemate. Speaking in Brussels, the bloc's chief negotiator said ""no progress had been made on the most difficult issues"". Asked by the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler what the chances were of an agreement. Mr Barnier said he was ""still determined but not optimistic"". The EU, he added, would not accept a deal ""at any price"" and it was stepping up preparations for a no-deal outcome, in which the two sides would trade with each other under World Trade Organisation rules. UK urges EU to uphold rights of British expats What happens after Brexit? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Insisting the EU would not negotiate ""in haste"", he said the UK must consider whether it was feasible to strike a deal before the end of 2020, when the current 11-month transition period is due to end. The UK has said it will not extend the process beyond 31 December, despite coming under growing pressure at home to allow more time for a deal due to the coronavirus pandemic. The two sides have been discussing their future economic and security partnership following the UK's withdrawal from the 27-member bloc on 31 January. In a statement, Mr Frost said there was a ""good understanding"" between the negotiators but that little or no progress had been on the most ""significant outstanding issues"". Analysis by Gavin Lee, Brussels reporter Former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker used to describe Brexit talks as being like a ""dance"" and regularly rolled out the stock phrase that ""it takes two to tango"". There's no dancing anymore. Today Michel Barnier made clear he'd rejected any such romantic terms for these trade negotiations, telling reporters it was neither ""a dance nor a tango or any other kind of dance"". He said the teams weren't ""even in the same room"" and this wasn't nearly as effective as getting together around a table. The hours of screen time have led to an impasse, with both sides now urging the other to change strategy, and to understand the other's position more clearly. I spoke to Spanish and French diplomats in Brussels. ""Quelle surprise"" was the view. They believe both sides will ""continue to play tough and offer little ground"" and that genuine compromise may come in a month, for the fourth and final scheduled round before the summer. But few officials here are following the twists and turns with the dedication of the past. The urgency of dealing with the pandemic has reduced the attention to Brexit. He said the EU was insisting upon a ""set of novel and unbalanced proposals"" in relation to competition issues that went well beyond other comparable trade agreements struck with other major economies. The UK, he said, would not agree to ""a so-called level playing field which would bind this country to EU law or standards, or determine our domestic legal regimes"". The EU's Michel Barnier said he was ""not optimistic"" about the prospects of an agreement by the end of 2020 A level-playing field is a term for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country undercutting their rivals and gaining a competitive advantage over those operating in other countries. The EU, Mr Frost added, was seeking continued access to UK fishing waters after the transition period ""in a way that is incompatible with our future status as an independent coastal state"". ""It is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement,"" he said. ""We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on 1 June. ""The UK will continue to work hard to find an agreement, for as long as there is a constructive process in being, and continues to believe that this is possible."" Mr Frost said the UK would make public all its draft legal texts next week so EU member states and interested observers ""can see our approach in detail"". In his update, Mr Barnier said the EU's aim was a ""modern, forward-looking"" agreement which would avoid any tariffs or quotas on trade. But he said it was not prepared to ""copy and paste"" aspects of existing agreements with Canada, Japan and South Korea or do sector-by-sector deals ""rooted in past precedents"". Tariff-free access to the EU's single market had to be accompanied by obligations, he added, and the UK could not ""pick and choose"" which of these it adhered to. ""You cannot have the best of both worlds,"" he said. ""Open and fair competition is not a nice to have. It is a must-have."" A ""new dynamism"" would be needed in the next round of talks to deliver ""tangible progress"", he added. Mr Barnier said he would listen to concerns the UK had about the treatment of British expats on the continent as part of the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement governing the terms of the UK's exit.

Royal Mail boss in surprise exit after two years,"The boss of Royal Mail is leaving after less than two years in the role amid reports he has been running the business from his home in Switzerland. Rico Back will step down as chief executive with immediate effect and Keith Williams, the former boss of BA, will take over as executive chairman. Mr Back has reportedly been at his Lake Zurich house since just after lockdown. The Royal Mail said he was ""following government advice to work from home unless you cannot"". Royal Mail has seen a sharp fall in letter volumes since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced in the UK on 23 March. The company said that while there had been a ""substantial switch from letters to parcels in the UK"", revenues during April fell Â£22m compared to the same month last year. It has also facedcriticism from its own staff, who said last month that there was a shortage of gloves, masks and hand sanitiser to protect them from contracting coronavirus. Royal Mail said it had invested in safety equipment and said the costs of running its UK postal service had risen by Â£40m ""driven by overtime and agency resource costs due to high levels of absence, the introduction of social distancing measures and PPE"". Mr Back has been put on gardening leave until 15 August, during which he will receive his pay and benefits. He will then receive nine monthly payments totalling Â£480,000. Royal Mail also said it would provide up to Â£50,000 towards his legal fees and a maximum Â£25,000 towards outplacement support. Mr Back's compensation has been at the centre of controversy in the past after he received a Â£5.8m payment in July 2017 when his contract as boss of Royal Mail's European parcels business was renegotiated. It prompted a letter from Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee, to Royal Maildemanding an explanation,external. Mr Back, who has worked at Royal Mail for two decades, said: ""It has been a privilege to lead a company that is so much a part of UK life at this crucial time in its history."" Royal Mail also announced that its executive directors will not receive bonuses for the 2019-20 financial year and said Â£25m has been set aside for ""cash awards for frontline staff, in recognition of their role during COVID-19"". Just prior to lockdown, postal workers had voted to go on strike in a row over pay and working conditions but delayed the action because of the pandemic. Commenting on Mr Back's departure, the Communication Workers' Union said: ""The change of chief executive by Royal Mail Group must now bring about a total change in strategy and direction. ""Postal workers have been outstanding during this pandemic and are ready to embrace innovation, new products and building on their role in every community in the UK."" Royal Mail has been attempting to refocus the business as parcel volumes grow, fuelled by online shopping, and the number of letters being sent falls. In its most recent trading update, Royal Mail said UK parcel volumes rose 31% in April while addressed letters dropped by 33%. Royal Mail said that Mr Williams said will lead discussions ""about an accelerated pace of change across the business"". It also said that the chairman will remain in the executive role until a permanent chief executive of Royal Mail is appointed. Royal Mail's share price rose 7.5% to 174.57p each.

US risks its 'darkest winter in modern history',"This video can not be played Ousted US vaccine supremo's dire warnings A former top US health official has told Congress the country could face its ""darkest winter in modern history"" because of the coronavirus. Rick Bright led the government agency trying to develop a vaccine, but was removed from his post last month. Mr Bright says he was ousted from the job after refusing to promote an untested drug treatment being touted as a ""game changer"" by President Trump. Mr Trump has claimed Mr Bright is a ""disgruntled"" employee. 'Ousted' US vaccine expert to file complaint Senate intelligence chief steps down for FBI probe How the pandemic is relaxing US drinking laws Mr Bright also told the House of Representatives subcommittee on health ""lives were lost"" because of government ""inaction"" in the early stages of the outbreak. He said he first spoke out about a medical equipment shortage in January, raising the issue to the ""highest levels"" of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but ""got no response"". In other US developments: A total of 85,807 people have now died with the coronavirus in the US. New York state continues to have the highest death toll in the US, with 27,607 deaths Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the US Senate intelligence committee, has saidhe will step downwhile an investigation into allegations of insider trading is carried out. Mr Burr is accused of using inside information to avoid market losses from the coronavirus pandemic Michigan's state legislature cancelled its Thursday session after receiving death threats and facing more armed protests from right-wing groups campaigning against lockdown measures Almost a quarter of US workersare now claiming unemployment benefits, after the number of people seeking unemployment jumped by almost three million last week President Trump's Florida resort Mar-a-Lago will partially re-open this weekend, but guests will need to maintain social distancing, US broadcasterCNN reports,external. During his testimony, Mr Bright warned that the US's ""window of opportunity"" to deal with the coronavirus was ""closing"". ""If we fail to improve our response now, based on science, I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged,"" he said. ""Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history."" Mr Bright also told the subcommittee that in January he received an email he would ""never forget"", from a supplier of medical-grade face masks who warned of a severe shortage. ""He said... we need to act. And I pushed that forward to the highest level that I could of HHS - and got no response."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mr Bright said his removal from his post was the result of his insisting that money allocated by Congress to deal with the virus should be put ""into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit"". ""I spoke out then, and I am testifying today, because science - not politics or cronyism - must lead the way to combat this deadly virus,"" he added. A whistleblower complaint, filed earlier this month, says Mr Bright was removed from his post as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) for political reasons. Mr Bright says he was ousted for refusing to push the drugs hydroxychloroquine and the related chloroquine as potential cures for Covid-19. This video can not be played Reality Check debunks coronavirus claims by politicians President Trump had referred to hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, as a potential ""game-changer"" in the treatment of Covid-19 - despite many experts cautioning that it could be ineffective or even dangerous. Research conducted by the Veterans Health Administration in the US which has been submitted for expert review suggests the drug gave no benefits for those taking it, and could actually raise the risk of death for patients in US veterans hospitals. Why a drug to treat malaria is selling out around the world Mr Bright's complaint alleges that he chose to speak to a journalist because government officials ""refused to listen"" to his warnings. He said he had an obligation to try and protect the public ""from drugs which he believed constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety"". After the hearing, President Trump told reporters: ""I don't know him. I never met him. I don't want to meet him. ""But I watched him, and he looks like an angry, disgruntled employee who, frankly, according to some people, didn't do a very good job."" Health secretary Alex Azar claimed officials had followed Mr Bright's recommendations. ""Everything he was complaining about was achieved - what he talked about was done,"" Mr Azar said. ""He said he talked about the need for respirators. We procured respirators at the president's direction. He said we need a Manhattan Project on a vaccine. We had a Manhattan Project.""

"Punters betting on table tennis amid sports lullWilliam Hill says gamblers have switched to ""alternative sports"" during the coronavirus pandemic.BusinessComments","William Hill says its punters have been betting on table tennis since the coronavirus pandemic put paid to most conventional sporting events. The bookmaker said the sport was part of its offer of ""alternative products"" for gamblers during the lockdown. Other opportunities for wagers include football in emerging market countries not yet as badly affected by the virus. Looking ahead, the firm said German football and French horseracing were its best potential earners. Germany's Bundesliga is starting fixtures againbehind closed doors this weekend, while racecourses had already resumed activities in France. ""While this is clearly an evolving situation, there are positive signs that some sports organisations are considering the resumption of live sports behind closed doors as early as this summer,"" William Hill said. Countries where football has not been suspended include Belarus, which has seen its Premier League attracta new global followingas a result. The announcement came as William Hill unveiled a trading update covering the 17 weeks to 28 April. It said that in the period to 10 March, before coronavirus curbs started to bite, its performance was ""robust"", although group revenues were down 5% year-on-year. From 11 March onwards, however, its revenues fell 57%, because of the absence of live sports content. William Hill said its betting shops were closed in the UK and US. UK retail staff have been furloughed and the bookmaker is topping up their wages to make sure they receive 100% of their salaries. As it seeks to expand its US operations, William Hill has had to find innovative ways to get round restrictions on gambling in certain states. In Nevada, people who wish to place bets using mobile phone apps have to sign up in person for the service at a betting shop before being allowed to use the app. Since those facilities are currently closed, William Hill has set up temporary drive-thru services at several locations in Nevada. Would-be punters have to download the app before heading for the drive-thru. To complete the registration process, they need to submit a picture of their state ID card and take a selfie with the app. Gambling firms to stop advertising during lockdown 'I'm being bombarded by gambling ads' Pandemic 'a disaster' for gambling addicts William Hill boss leaves as 700 bookies close 4,500 jobs at risk as William Hill axes 700 stores Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

London congestion charge to be reinstatedThe charge will resume on Monday and go up in June to avoid a build up of traffic in the capital.LondonComments,"TfL said NHS and care workers would be exempt from the congestion charge. The congestion charge for people driving into central London will be reintroduced on Monday under the terms of a Â£1.6bn government bailout. It follows a deal in which Transport for London (TfL) secured emergency funding to keep Tube and bus services going until September. From 22 June, the congestion charge will also rise from Â£11.50 to Â£15. Downing Street defended the changes saying it ""only applied to a small area of central London"". The prime minister's official spokesman said roads in these areas ""would come to a halt without it"" and it was an ""important tool to ensure that emissions in London remain low and support better air quality"". TfL said the resumed congestion charge would be temporarily extended to between 07:00 and 22:00, seven days a week, from 22 June and the price rise would be in place for a year. Both measures will be reviewed later to see if they are made permanent. A system of reimbursement for NHS workers in place before the charge was suspended on 23 March will also be extended to care home workers. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to socially distance on public transport Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the measures were designed to avoid a build up of traffic after the government urged people returning to work to avoid public transport. TfL said the plans would ""create more space for social distancing when walking and cycling, ensuring that the people who have no choice but to return to work in central London can do so as safely as possible"". Some streets will be converted to walking and cycling only, with others restricted to all traffic apart from buses, creating ""one of the world's largest car-free zones"". Government agrees Â£1.6bn London transport bailout How will transport need to change? Waterloo Bridge and London Bridge may be restricted to people walking, cycling and buses only, with pavements widened to enable people to safely travel between busy railway stations and their workplaces. Mr Khan warned public transport must only be used ""as a last resort"". The low emission zone and ultra low emission zone - imposing levies on high-polluting vehicles - also comes back into operation on Monday. Also under the conditions of the government deal, children will no longer have free travel across London and restrictions on travel passes for people with a disability or over the age of 60 will also be imposed during peak hours. Fares on buses - scrapped to help protect drivers from Covid-19 - will also be reintroduced. The Department for Transport (DfT) said these changes would be put in place ""as soon as practicable"".

Black-cab driver and general secretary of the London Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA) Steve McNamara said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" no one had been consulted about plans to change the use of some roads. ""Usually you have to consult with the public and businesses - they are using a health emergency to get around the laws to consult people before you do these things,"" he said. ""It's a land grab to exclude Londoners from their roads and to widen pavements for more cycling."" Coronavirus has had a significant impact on the London Underground Mr Khan said the government deal was necessary because coronavirus had had a ""catastrophic impact on TfL's finances"". ""I want to be completely honest and upfront with Londoners,"" the mayor said. ""This is not the deal I wanted. But it was the only deal the government put on the table and I had no choice but to accept it to keep the Tubes and buses running."" New coronavirus data shows London ethnic breakdown Woman says coronavirus saved her life 'I found out I had cancer on the day of lockdown' The DfT also announced TfL will introduce fare rises of 1% above the rate of inflation from next year. Mr Khan hasfrozen single fares since he became mayor in May 2016. The congestion charge was suspended on March 23 as the country went into lockdown Natalie Chapman, of the Freight Transport Association, said the congestion charge hike ""ignored the needs of London businesses"". She added: ""How are shops to be supplied, restaurants and cafes to be stocked and the rest of the capital's economy to obtain the products it needs when those charged with delivering these needs are to be punitively taxed at a time when their own industry is in recovery?"" By Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent The old adage in promoting cycling and walking or active travel is you have to make driving cars horrible - and that is certainly what's happening here. These are radical changes to London's streets. If you want to drive around central London be prepared not to be allowed in certain roads and to pay Â£15 a day. Drivers fear gridlock. But cycling and walking advocates will be rejoicing that parts of the city are being given over to them. The other side story here is the political row between the government and the Mayor and the many strings attached to the bailout. Future infrastructure is up in the air and fare rises will happen in January. Sadiq Khan says he won't be able to be the mayor he wants to be and Londoners are being punished.

"Sturgeon: Scots 'need to get some normality back'The first minister says people ""can't live like this forever"" as she hints that lockdown changes could be made next week.Scotland","This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'We can't live like this forever' Nicola Sturgeon has said that Scotland ""needs to get some normality back"" as she hinted that some measures to ease lockdown could be unveiled next week. The first minister said that any easing would be careful and gradual, because lives are still at stake. And while she was not yet able to give dates for when things might start to open again, she said that people ""can't live like this forever"". Ms Sturgeon said she could outline some ""minor changes"" next week. These would be unveiled alongside further details of the range of options the Scottish government has been looking at, she told her daily briefing. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest updates How lockdown rules differ between Scotland and England Why might the R number be higher in Scotland? There has already minor easing of the lockdown restrictions in England, with some people who cannot work from home returning to their workplaces on Wednesday. Most of these measures have not yet been introduced elsewhere in the UK - although the Scottish government has already relaxed its rules to allow outdoor exercise more than once a day and Wales hasoutlined a cautious route out of lockdownthat does not include any dates for when changes could be made. The number of people dying with coronavirus in Scotland has been falling over the past fortnight, but Ms Sturgeon said further lockdown changes would only be considered when ""we hopefully see more evidence of a downward trend in the virus"". And she said she would continue to err on the side of caution for as long as lives continued to be at risk. But Ms Sturgeon added: ""We can't live like this forever, so we need to get some normality back as we continue to suppress the virus. ""Even when we can't yet give firm dates on when things will open up again, at least we will seek to share with you the order of priority and further phasing. ""Next week I will share with you more information on the assessments we are making and the range of options we are now looking at, and also any further minor changes we might make in the short-term."" Scotland has been in lockdown for the past seven weeks The first minister also said that a balance would need be struck between getting the economy going again and allowing more social interaction. She said: ""A life where you go to work but stay locked down with no family interaction for the rest of the time is not one many of us, if any of us, would enjoy"". Teaching unions have been urging the Scottish government to explicitly rule out the possibility of schools reopening before the new term begins in August. Ms Sturgeon said there was no chance of schools getting back to normal ""in any way, shape or form"" before the summer holidays begin next month. She said discussions were taking place over whether it would be possible for any pupils to return to the classroom by then - but it was likely to be on a ""very limited basis"" if it was to happen at all. Few - if any - Scottish pupils are likely to return to school before the summer holidays The virus appears to have hit the central belt of Scotland and its larger cities harder than more rural areas, with Ms Sturgeon regularly warning that the infection rate - the so-called R number - continues to behigher north of the border than it is in England. Ms Sturgeon said on Thursday her government was ""not ruling out"" the possibility of more rural areas with fewer cases of the virus having their lockdowns eased first. However, she stressed that she was not proposing that approach ""at this stage"". A further 46 people in Scotland have died after testing positive for the virus, bringing the total by that measure to 2,053. However, the total number of deaths stands at more than 3,200 once those with suspected cases of Covid-19 are included. More than half of all registered deaths involving the virus continue to be happening in care homes, although the numbers have been falling. LOOK-UP TOOL:How exposed is your job?

Punters betting on table tennis amid sports lull,"William Hill says its punters have been betting on table tennis since the coronavirus pandemic put paid to most conventional sporting events. The bookmaker said the sport was part of its offer of ""alternative products"" for gamblers during the lockdown. Other opportunities for wagers include football in emerging market countries not yet as badly affected by the virus. Looking ahead, the firm said German football and French horseracing were its best potential earners. Germany's Bundesliga is starting fixtures againbehind closed doors this weekend, while racecourses had already resumed activities in France. ""While this is clearly an evolving situation, there are positive signs that some sports organisations are considering the resumption of live sports behind closed doors as early as this summer,"" William Hill said. Countries where football has not been suspended include Belarus, which has seen its Premier League attracta new global followingas a result. The announcement came as William Hill unveiled a trading update covering the 17 weeks to 28 April. It said that in the period to 10 March, before coronavirus curbs started to bite, its performance was ""robust"", although group revenues were down 5% year-on-year. From 11 March onwards, however, its revenues fell 57%, because of the absence of live sports content. William Hill said its betting shops were closed in the UK and US. UK retail staff have been furloughed and the bookmaker is topping up their wages to make sure they receive 100% of their salaries. As it seeks to expand its US operations, William Hill has had to find innovative ways to get round restrictions on gambling in certain states. In Nevada, people who wish to place bets using mobile phone apps have to sign up in person for the service at a betting shop before being allowed to use the app. Since those facilities are currently closed, William Hill has set up temporary drive-thru services at several locations in Nevada. Would-be punters have to download the app before heading for the drive-thru. To complete the registration process, they need to submit a picture of their state ID card and take a selfie with the app. Gambling firms to stop advertising during lockdown 'I'm being bombarded by gambling ads' Pandemic 'a disaster' for gambling addicts William Hill boss leaves as 700 bookies close 4,500 jobs at risk as William Hill axes 700 stores Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Coronavirus takes its toll on the German economy,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says all residents and staff in care homes will have been tested by early June The death toll in the UK rose in the past day by 384 to 33,998 It comes as Germany - Europeâs largest economy - shrinks by 2.2%, the worst since 2009 US retail figures plunge by 16.4% - the biggest two-month decline on record Police in England and Wales hand out more than 14,000 fines for breaches of lockdown regulations Brazil's health minister resigns after disagreements with President Bolsonaro - the second post-holder to go in a month The three Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - create borderless travel zone for their citizens More than 1.5m people have recovered from the virus worldwide, but 300,000 have died, says Johns Hopkins University Edited by Sean Fanning and Chris Clayton Thank you for following our updates.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford wants people to start baking to fight coronavirus stress. After boasting of his baking prowess in a press conference, Mr Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, posted a video of himself making cherry cheesecake. ""If I wasn't premier, I'd open up a cheesecake factory."" Sporting a t-shirt with the phrase ""we're all in this together"", Mr Ford's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times. ""You can tell I've eaten one too many cheesecakes,"" the portly premier joked. Prior to the pandemic, the folksy, conservative politician was best known for public squabbles with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the local teacher's union. But his popularity has soared as people turn into his daily press conference for his no-nonsense takes, such as when he called anti-lockdown protestors ""a bunch of yahoos"".  Allow Twitter content?

Countries across Europe are continuing to report lowering daily death tolls this week, as lockdowns begin to ease. Italy was once the global epicentre of the pandemic, reporting over 900 deaths on 27 March. But authorities there have reported 262 for yesterday. France, Spain and the UK are among the other European states also reporting  declines. Denmark registered no new Covid-19 deaths for the first time since 13 March. Slovenia has become the first EU country to declare the Covid-19 epidemic over, though it is still leaving some protective measures  in place. But as the continent begins to emerge from lockdown, the economic impact of coronavirus is being acutely felt - with millions of consumers confined to their homes, many of them now jobless. Today Germany reported that its economy - the largest in Europe - shrank by 2.2% in the first three months of this year, pushing the country into recession. Dr Sarah Ali says Sudan's healthcare system failed long before coronavirus hit the country Sudanese doctor Sarah Ali is not surprised by the recent report that 250 million people in Africa could catch coronavirus in the first year of the pandemic. She toldthe BBC's OS radio programmethat coronavirus was a huge challenge because of her country's already ""collapsed healthcare system"". The junior doctor has symptoms of Covid-19 herself, so she's self-isolating at home. Ms Ali says the strain on health services means people are dying from other conditions such as heart attacks because there are so few doctors available. One of the biggest hospitals in the capital, Khartoum, is calling for doctors to come and help because [there are] only three doctors,"" she told the BBC. There is also a dire lack of medical equipment needed to fight the virus. [Doctors] canât examine patients because they don't have enough gloves,"" said Mr Ali. ""Weâve been promised that PPE [personal protective equipment] will be provided."" She said doctors like her fear that the actual number of coronavirus cases is ""much, much higher"" than the 1,964 currently reported. People have been permitted to exercise on beaches in Portugal, such as Cascais beach near Lisbon Portugal is set to further ease lockdown restrictions from Monday with the opening of some shops, cafes, restaurants, museums, monuments, galleries, crÃ¨ches and selected school classes. Meanwhile, prime minister Antonio Costa said the country's beaches would reopen on 6 June. He
encouraged the public to download an app that will tell them if
their beach of choice is full or still has space, while other rules needed to be adhered to. According to government figures, Portugal has had 1,190 deaths associated with Covid-19 which was up six from Thursday, and a cumulative total of 28,583 confirmed cases, an increase of 264. A member of the armed forces helping out at a Montreal care home Five soldiers stationed in Canadian nursing homes have been infected with coronavirus, the government confirms. Four soldiers were based in Quebec, one was in Ontario. ""There are always risks in what they do and they go into that knowingly and willingly, and that is why we offer them our deepest gratitude every day,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday. The Canadian Armed Forces have sent about 1,700 personnel to 30 long-term care facilities. The military was called to help in Quebec and Ontario in mid-April, after several outbreaks at residences exacerbated long-standing staffing issues. The military intends to release figures every two weeks on
the number of personnel in long-term care homes who are infected. Approximately 82% of all Covid-19 deaths in Canada occur in these facilities, according to the National Institute on Ageing. Moncef Slaoui (r) outlined the programme at a briefing with President Trump and Health Secretary Alex Azar (l) A bit more now on ""Operation Warp Speed"", the Trump plan to expedite vaccine development we told you about earlier. Moncef Slaoui, former vaccine chief at GlaxoSmithKline, and Gustave Perna, who oversees distribution for the US Army, will head the effort, which will begin with studies on 14 promising vaccine candidates for accelerated research and approval. Trump promised ""roughly $10bn"" to back the project. Speaking after Mr Trump, Mr Slaoui said he was ""confident"" that a ""few hundred million doses of vaccine"" will be delivered by the end of 2020. However, some health experts have remained sceptical about this. ""I don't understand how that happens,"" said Dr Peter Hotez, co-director of the Medicine Coronavirus Vaccine Team at Baylor College. ""I don't see a path by which any vaccine is licensed for emergency use or otherwise till the third quarter of 2021,"" he told CNN, citing safety concerns.

The Scottish Professional Football League will announce that the Premiership season - and the Scottish Cup - will not be completed, which means Celtic will be awarded their ninth consecutive title. The Hoops were 13 points ahead of Glasgow rivals Rangers with eight games remaining. Hearts will be relegated, while Rangers, Motherwell and Aberdeen will gain qualification for the Europa League. Dundee United will be promoted to the Scottish Premiership next season. The lower-league seasons were declared over in April after a controversial ballot. Allow Twitter content?

Katy WatsonBBC South America correspondent Nelson Teich was appointed as health minister on 17 April To lose one health minister was awkward, but to lose two in less than a month is not only embarrassing for Jair Bolsonaro but deeply worrying for Brazil. The country has become the latest coronavirus hotspot and rather than politicians trying to tackle it together, the pandemic has turned political.  The leader of the country is failing to provide direction for a population who really needs it. Nelson Teich didn't give any reasons for his departure, merely saying ""life is full of decisions and I decided to leave"" - but he didn't see eye-to-eye with his boss on the use of chloroquine and his health ministry was excluded this week when Bolsonaro decided to include beauty salons, hairdressers and gyms as essential services. It appears the job of health minister to Bolsonaro is a thankless task at the moment - but itâs a difficult job vacancy at the worst-possible time in Brazil. Ireland were due to tour Australia this summer Reality Check At todayâs press conference in the White House Rose Garden,
President Trump talked up the reopening of the US, saying that âas of this
morning almost every state has taken steps to begin reopeningâ. He added: ""Tomorrow will mark 30 days since we released
the White House guidelines for a safe and phased opening of America - that's
what we're doing."" But some states have eased restrictions before meeting the
reopening criteria proposed by the Trump administration - and Dr Anthony Fauci,

Staff at the Toronto Zoo hope to raise C$70,000 ($49,600; Â£41,000) to reconfigure existing spaces to better accommodate the newborn. Masai giraffes are approximately 2m (6ft) tall at birth, and can grow to over 5.5 meters (19 feet) in adulthood. The money will also go to improving educational and monitoring opportunities. The zoo is facing financial difficulties after being forced to shut its doors due to the coronavirus lockdown. Staff say they plan to reopen as a drive-through experience as soon as they are able. The calf is the firstborn child of six-year-old mother Mstari, who was also born at the zoo. There are only 35,000 Masai giraffes left in the world, and the zoo heralded the birth as ""an important contribution to a genetically healthy Masai giraffe population"". One of the world's largest cigarette companies, British American Tobacco (BAT), says it is ready to begin human trials on a tobacco-based coronavirus vaccine. In a statement, the firm said it was using proteins from tobacco leaves, which have generated a positive immune response in pre-clinical trials. The maker of famous brands such as Lucky Strike said human trials could begin in late June, pending approval by the US Food and Drug Agency. It raised eyebrows after announcing plans for the jab in April, saying it could produce up to three million doses a week if it received government support. But it's not the only tobacco firm to do so - industry rival Philip Morris International is also working on its own vaccine. Police have warned Londoners against taking part in ""spontaneous or planned mass gatherings"" in public this weekend. ""Games of football ...outdoor concerts or parties, protest, marches or assemblies are still not permitted"", the Met's Ch Supt Karen Findlay said. Officers ""will engage and encourage people to comply"" with public health regulations, the force added. Some restrictions have been eased in England, where two people from different households are now allowed to meet in public, and sports in which people can keep apart are now allowed - such as tennis or golf. Social distancing of two metres still has to be observed, althoughpolice do not enforce this guidance,externalbecause it has not been written into the law. The warning came as latest figures show police in England and Walesissued more than 14,000 ticketsfor alleged breaches of lockdown laws. The minimum fine for breaches has recently increased from Â£60 ($73) to Â£100 (reduced to Â£50 if paid within two weeks), while repeat offenders can also face fines of up to Â£3,200. The pandemic has left European football leagues in a state of flux as they figured out how to conclude their respective seasons. Today, the Belgian top flight, like its Dutch and French counterparts, provided closure to its own competition by announcing Club Bruges as champions. It was a fairly easy decision because the Club had a 15-point lead over Gent with one match left when the season was suspended. It was also announced that Waasland-Beveren would be relegated while Gent would enter next season's Champions League. The German Bundesliga restarts this weekend behind closed doors,while the English Premier League,Italian Serie A and Spain's La Liga are hoping to resume in the second week of June. The Netherlands starting easing its lockdown earlier this week The Dutch government has issued new guidance to single people seeking intimacy during the pandemic: find a ""sex buddy"". The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) says singletons should come to an arrangement with one person. But couples should avoid sex if one of them suspects they have coronavirus, the advice says. It comes after critics argued social distancing rules have complicated intimate relations for partners not living together.

How did a country with a population of 97 million people, record only just over 300 cases of Covid-19 and not a single death? That country is Vietnam. It implemented extreme measures as soon as it recorded its first case on 23 January. In came travel restrictions, close monitoring and then closure of the border with China.  Health checks were increased at other borders. ""This is a country that has dealt with a lot of outbreaks in the past,"" said Prof Guy Thwaites, director of Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City. ""The government and population are very, very used to dealing with infectious diseases and are respectful of them, probably far more so than wealthier countries,"" he said. ""They know how to respond to these things."" Read more here Sarah RainsfordBBC Moscow Correspondent Moscow has launched a mass screening programme for coronavirus antibodies, inviting people chosen at random from various age groups to clinics across the city. The hope is that the test results can allow the authorities to map their way out of lockdown, despite uncertainty over how much immunity to Covid-19 the antibodies actually provide. Three dozen Moscow clinics are collecting intravenous blood samples, which are sent to laboratories for analysis overnight. Russian doctors believe the method, known as IFA, is more accurate than express-testing used elsewhere. It identifies the Immunoglobulin M antibody (IgM), which appears when the body is fighting a new infection, and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) which shows that someone has previously been infected. Swabs for Covid-19 itself are taken at the same time. Free tests will be given to 70,000 people every three days, allowing Moscow to build a much clearer picture of the spread of the virus since the start of the epidemic â as well as isolating anyone who is sick, but didnât realise it. This is in addition to widespread coronavirus testing of those with symptoms thatâs already taking place. ""If thatâs whatâs needed, then itâs needed,"" one man who had received a text-message inviting him for testing told the BBC. ""The main thing is that itâs free!"" Vladimir Putin this week announced that the full nationwide lockdown was over, instructing regional leaders to decide when to lift specific restrictions. Moscowâs mayor has described that as the ""most difficult decision"" of his life, and schools and playgrounds, bars and many businesses remain closed until at least 31 May. Russia currently has one of the worldâs highest rates of coronavirus infection, with 10,598 new cases detected on Friday. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The UK has denied that travellers from France will be exempted from its planned quarantine measures. Under the plans - announced last weekend - people arriving in the UK from abroad will be obliged to isolate themselves for 14 days. Initially, the two governments said the exemption would apply to any travellers between France and the UK, and any future steps would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner. The policy attracted criticism from other governments and the EU. Some experts suggested it would be unworkable. But today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesmansaid there was no French exemption, and that the original statement referred to co-operation
to manage the common border. It now appears that those exempted from the policy could include freight drivers - to allow the flow of goods to continue - and people working on Covid-19 research, but not ordinary travellers.

Coronavirus: Wales will act 'carefully and cautiously',"Wales will act carefully and cautiously in lifting Covid-19 restrictions, says First Minister Mark Drakeford as he unveils a roadmap of the way out of lockdown Education Minister Kirsty Williams says she 'will not set an arbitrary date' for more pupils to return to lessons Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales is ""one week away"" from being overrun by coronavirus, a consultant claims A further nine people with coronavirus have died in Wales, taking the total to 1,173 To date, 46,542 individuals have been tested for coronavirus Deaf people or those with hearing loss will struggle to communicate if more people wear non-medical face masks, a charity says James McCarthy, Gareth Vincent, Andy Roberts and Rhiannon Beacham That's it for the live page for Friday. Thank you all for joining us. Here are the main points from today:   Welsh universities face
a serious threat to their financial position as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to analysis from Cardiff Universityâs Wales Governance
Centre. The report by Cian SiÃ´n,
a researcher on the Wales fiscal analysis programme, takes into account
predicted falls in international and home student enrolment, and estimates the
sector could lose between Â£100m and Â£140m in 2020-21 from fee income alone. The report reveals the
sectorâs importance to the Welsh economy, with universities providing 17,300
full-time jobs, contributing 4.8% of gross value added and accounting for 32.5%
of the countryâs research and development spending. According to the
analysis, the three institutions with potentially the most to lose if there is
a fall in international student recruitment are Cardiff University, Cardiff
Metropolitan University and Bangor University.  This video can not be played Rainbow lights shine for carers at Prisoner village A
spectacular light show to thank carers during the coronavirus pandemic has lit
up the village that was home to 1960s TV cult classic Prisoner. The village of Portmeirion in Gwynedd was turned into a rainbow of
colour. Location
manager Meurig Jones described it as a ""beautiful, wonderful
experience"". Portmeirion became famous as the back drop for the TV show starring Patrick
McGoohan, and is home to hotels, restaurants and spectacular gardens - all
designed by Sir Clough Williams-Elis. Former Swansea City player Darren Pratley says the thought of returning to footballis ""a bit frightening""as BAME players are more at risk from Covid-19. The Office for National Statistics says black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die from coronavirus as white people in England and Wales. Charlton midfielder Pratley, 35, whose father is Jamaican, admits he has concerns about the prospect of elite football resuming. ""We've been told that BAME footballers are at higher risk, which is concerning being mixed raced,"" said Pratley, who won two promotions with Swansea during a five-year stint in Wales. The UK government has pledged an extra Â£35m to support Wales in the fight
against coronavirus. Wales' devolved administration will get the extra cash as a
result of the UK governmentâs investment in care homes in England. That is to
control infections, increase testing and clinical support, and ensure English councils have plans in place to support care homes. The UK government has now given Â£2.1bn to tackle coronavirus in Wales. Secretary
of State for Wales, Simon Hart, said: âWe are doing everything we can to
ensure Wales overcomes this crisis."" Ramadan is a ""transformative month"" and about developing a new appetite for charitable giving and community, according to Mo Janneh. But this year, with mosques closed, fasting and prayers are being observed behind closed doors because of lockdown. Mr Janneh describes what he is doing to keep the spirit of Ramadan alive forthe BBC1 Wales show The Great Indoors, available now on iPlayer. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Keeping Ramadan spirit alive under lockdown Coronavirus
could cost Cardiff council Â£29m in additional spend and lost revenue in the
first three months of the financial year. A
statement from cabinet to the council has laid bare the expense involved in
dealing with impact of the pandemic. The
authority estimates it will spend more than Â£18m responding to the crisis and a
further Â£11m could be lost in income by the end of June as a result of Covid-19. The cabinet
member for finance, modernisation and performance, Councillor Chris Weaver, said:
âCardiff council has reacted quickly to the crisis, changing the way we work,
putting clear focus on maintaining essential services which deliver for our
most vulnerable residents. âOver
the past two months our services have had to respond and adapt to the crisis as
events continued to unfold.â The
council hopes to claim back the Â£18m expenditure from the Welsh Government through
the Covid-19 Hardship Fund. To date the council has received Â£465,000 to
cover Covid-related spend during the latter weeks of March. âWe
are working now on the implications of moving towards what is likely to be a new normal as lockdown restrictions are eased and the recovery phase begins,â
Councillor Weaver added. âThere
may be significant financial implications, with income streams in particular
likely to take a considerable time to come back to normal levels.â A mother has described the fears for her five-month-old baby daughter after the infant developed a rare reaction to coronavirus. Hannah Godwin, from Risca, in Caerphilly county borough, said she and father Simon were left to ""watch and wait"" as baby Leia fought for her life. Medics initially thought the child may have had sepsis or meningitis. But then a worldwide alert on a Covid-19 syndrome affecting children was issued. ""Straightaway they were liaising with everyone who was going through similar cases,"" said Hannah. ""As we sat down and had our first meeting with the consultant and the special disease consultant, they said 'we don't know if this is gonna work, this is our line of attack, this is what we think is best'."" As well as developing a rash, temperature and breathing problems, baby Leia's arteries began to swell to life-threatening levels. ""The consultant was very, very honest with me and said: 'If there's a rupture she's not going to survive'. ""They're trying to get them back down, she's on all types of medication to stop any clotting or build-up or heart attacks or anything like that. ""We just watch and wait, that's the phrase with Leia.""  Leia tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, and continued to be treated in isolation at the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff. Hannah now hopes Leia will be back home next week, to be reunited with twin Thea, older sisters Nia, 12, Gracie, nine, and her father Simon. Leia's mother urged other parents to be aware of the way Covid-19 can affect children - and to seek medical help. ""You have to take them to the doctor's, if you think there's something wrong with them,"" she stressed. ""God knows what could have happened if she had't had the treatment she had early on."" The future of Welsh football's domestic seasonwill be decided next week. The Football Association of Wales outlined possible options to Cymru League and Welsh Women's League club representatives on Friday. Clubs have until Sunday to choose one of the options put before them and reply to the FAW with their decision. A final decision is then expected to be taken by the FAW board next week on whether to curtail football for this season in Wales.

Eradicating coronavirus is an ""ambitious"" target, the deputy chief medical officer for England has said. Jenny Harries said there was no immediate easy outcome to the pandemic, speaking at the UK government's daily briefing. She said smallpox was the only infectious disease that had ever been eradicated. To eradicate Covid-19 we need a vaccine, she said, and that was being worked on. BBC Radio Wales The director of National Association of Headteachers in Wales has said she was ""heartened"" that Education Minister Kirsty Williams did not make any promises on a date for pupils to return to school. Laura Doel told BBC Radio Wales Drive: ""Any return-to-school date must be based on scientific and medical evidence that it is safe to do so."" She added: ""I think to make any assumption at this stage about what year groups could go back when she doesnât have the information would be quite irresponsible."" Ms Williamspublished a document earlier todaystating she would not ""set an arbitrary date"" for more pupils to go back to school. Some schools have remained open during lockdown for the children of key workers who need looking after during the day, and others classed as vulnerable. Another nine deaths of people with Covid-19 in Wales have been confirmed by Public Health Wales. It takes the confirmed total to 1,173. This graph shows the number of deaths per day by the date they occurred, not the date they were announced. Glamorgan director of cricket Mark Wallace says the county is in the early stages oftalks with the Welsh Governmentover returning to training. Welsh rules for professional sports people have not been relaxed in line with England. ""They're aware of our situation and we're having conversations with them and with the ECB,"" said Wallace. Rescued pets being cared for by the RSPCA in Wales can now be re-homed for the first time since coronavirus restrictions came into force. While people are still not allowed to visit rescue centres, new guidance allows staff to transport animals to new homes or temporary foster homes as long as they observe social distancing guidelines, with measures such as virtual home checks and post-adoption support. RSPCA Cymru says the guidance is ""great news"" for nearly 200 rescued animals currently in their care at centres in Newport and Colwyn Bay. Coralie Farren, RSPCA regional operations manager for Wales, said:  ""Dedicated staff at our centres have provided amazing care for these animals during this crisis. ""But we know nothing can beat a loving home for an animal, and we're excited to start ensuring perfect matches across Wales following this very welcome announcement."" Cassie is one of nearly 200 rescue animals being cared for by the RSPCA in Wales Police in England and Wales have issued more than 14,000 fines for alleged breaches of lockdown laws. The figures, from 27 March to 11 May, show the most fixed penalty notices - 906 - were handed out in London, by the Metropolitan Police. Gwent Police issued the third-lowest number, with 71, fewer than any other force except Warwickshire and Staffordshire. The data covers the period before the penalty rose from Â£60 to Â£100 in England afterthe rules were eased.The penalty remains at Â£60 in Wales. The National Police Chiefs' Council says 13,445 fines were issued by forces in England and 799 in Wales for breaches of social distancing rules brought in to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Giant keys have appeared in Blaenau Gwent
as a mystery artist shows appreciation for the NHS. Blue and pink keys and ""thank you"" messages have been placed around the area over the last few days, but
nobody knows who is behind them. The mystery artist has been leaving their
mark outside care homes, supermarkets and hospitals. Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council
showed their gratitude for whoever was behind the art. âWe loved
getting this sign of appreciation for our hardworking and dedicated teams,"" the authority said on Facebook. ""So,
thank you, whoever you may be.â Another nine deaths of people with Covid-19 have been confirmed by Public Health Wales, taking the total to 1,173. Death rates continue to be higher in south east Wales than in other parts of the country. Wales' first minister has said he hopes
to announce further easing of the lockdown restrictions when the next review is
due in two weeks' time. It came as Mark Drakeford unveiled a documentindicating how measures would be amended,externalin a traffic-light strategy of steps, but opposition parties in Wales have criticised him for not being more specific on timescales. However, answering questions at the Welsh Governmentâs daily press briefing, he said: âWeâve already begun to leave
lockdown as it was originally imposed and I am hopeful that provided
coronavirus remains at or below the levels we currently see, there will be more
things we will be able to do in the red zone at the end of the current three
weeks. ""Iâve then just got to say that before we know whether we can take
further steps, weâve got to be confident that the initial moves that we make
donât inadvertently result in coronavirus being on the rise again.â Welsh Secretary Simon Hart says the UK and Welsh governments have âworked closely
together every step of the wayâ after First Minister Mark Drakeford announced Walesâ lockdown
exit plan. Mr
Drakeford said he was âdisappointedâ
over a lack of communication with the UK government over the last week. Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd have criticised the Welsh Government's roadmap out of the lockdown for a lack of detail on dates, but the exit strategy was welcomed by Mr Hart. ""Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the UK and Welsh Governments have worked closely together every step of the way,"" he said. ""I am glad that this announcement brings that alignment even closer, providing more certainty for jobs and businesses across Wales. âThe
approach being taken by the Welsh Government in its roadmap will allow us to
continue with a UK-wide response to the emergency at the same time as taking a
flexible approach according to the data in different parts of the UK. âThe
UK Government is providing the devolved governments with testing, funding, and
logistical support from our armed forces. âNo
one part of the UK could face this pandemic alone and the UK Government has
provided unprecedented support to every part of the UK. âThere
are far more similarities than differences in the approaches of the nations of
the UK. ""We entered this fight as a United Kingdom and we will come out of it
equally united."" Simon Hart says there are ""far more similarities than differences"" in the approaches of the nations of the UK Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Coronavirus pushes Germany into recession,"German GDP growth has been negative for two successive quarters, the definition of a recession. Germany's economy shrank by 2.2% in the first three months of this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed it into recession, official figures indicate. It was the biggest quarterly fall since 2009, when the country was engulfed in the global financial crisis. The figures from the Federal Statistics Office,externalcome as Germany takes its first tentative steps to exit lockdown. Shops are reopening, pupils will gradually return to class and football is restarting behind closed doors. At the same time, figures for the final three months of 2019 were revised to show a contraction of 0.1%. That means German GDP growth has been negative for two successive quarters, the technical definition of a recession. The figures are in line with market expectations, says BBC global trade correspondent Dharshini David. The German economy was already lacklustre before the onset of the pandemic, as the US-China trade war cast a shadow over activity, our correspondent points out. The statistics office warned that the figures were subject to extreme uncertainty, with the next estimate due out on 25 May. EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' Germany is Europe's largest economy, but the drop is not as bad as in some of its neighbours, such as France, which has seen a decline of 5.8%, and Italy, which reported a 4.7% fall. This effect is partly due to a decision by Germany's 16 states to allow factories and construction sites to stay open, as well as an unprecedented rescue package by the government. Economists expect a deeper slump in the second quarter of the year, as the full effects of the lockdown become apparent. Germany, along with just about every other economy on the planet, has been hit by the combination of official restrictions on movement and commercial activity, as well as by personal choices to avoid the risk of infection. Consumer spending was down and so was investment (apart from construction which, along with government spending, softened the economic blow). Germany is a big power in global trade and imports and exports were both lower. It was a sharp contraction overall, but so far at least, the blows to the German economy have not generally been as severe as those suffered by the rest of the eurozone. The other three largest economies - France, Italy and Spain - were all hit much harder by the health crisis and have seen much larger declines in the first three months of 2020. For the quarter now under way, Germany will take a hit, but it has an advantage compared to those others. Tourism is a smaller part of the economy and it's a sector that is facing an extremely challenging 2020 summer season. Separate growth figures released byEU statistics office Eurostat for the eurozone,externalas a whole confirmed an earlier estimate showing a record decline of 3.8% in the January-to-March period. For the 27-nation EU, the equivalent figure was 3.3%. Eurostat also issued figures showing a 0.2% fall in eurozone employment, the first such decline since 2013. ""The German economy has been tiptoeing on the edge of recession since the beginning of 2019, but it can hide no longer,"" said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""The German business cycle expansion, which started in 2013, ended decisively in Q1, and more pain is ahead in the near term before the recovery."" RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Lockdown exit plan for Wales 'puts health first'Wales' first minister announces a cautious plan for easing restrictions on daily life.,"This video can not be played Coronavirus lockdown exit plan for Wales 'puts health first' There could be ""more things we are able to do"" in two weeks' time as Wales moves slowly out of lockdown, the first minister said. ""We are already in the red zone,"" Mark Drakeford said, as he unveiled a plan for returning to some form of normality. While no dates were given, he said his ""traffic lights"" route out of lockdown also included amber and green stages. There have been restrictions on daily life for seven weeks. ""We've already begun to leave lockdown as it was originally imposed and I am hopeful that, provided coronavirus remains at or below the levels we currently see, there will be more things we will be able to do in the red zone at the end of the current three weeks,"" he said. Lockdown has been in force since March A further three weeks of lockdown were announced last Friday, and Mr Drakeford added: ""We've got to be confident that the initial moves that we make don't inadvertently result in coronavirus being on the rise again."" The cautious route out of lockdown is ""putting people's health first"", he said. ""All our decisions will be based on the latest scientific advice. ""We will act carefully and cautiously, in partnership with people, in a way that is right for Wales. And we will put people's health first."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the UK and Welsh governments have worked closely together every step of the way. ""I am glad that this announcement brings that alignment even closer, providing more certainty for jobs and businesses across Wales."" Welsh Conservatives leader Paul Davies described it as ""a roadmap to a cul-de-sac, not a roadmap to recovery"", and a ""hopeless plan"". ""We need to begin to unlock society but Mark Drakeford seems to have lost his keys,"" he said. Who am I allowed to meet now? Welsh government 'not told about stay alert' Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the strategy was ""thin on detail"" and how it will end community transmission. He added New Zealand's model of driving down the R number to reduce avoidable deaths and ""eradicate"" new cases should be mirrored in Wales, and local lockdowns for clusters should eventually be considered. ""The onus will fall on the Welsh Government to urgently change gear on testing and tracing to allow us to move safely on to the next phase on the path to recovery,"" he said. The Brexit Party tweeted: ""Welsh Labour are playing politics during a pandemic. It's time to end the confusion and work on a UK-wide approach to fighting the virus."" The opening of garden centres was described as the ""first steps on our recovering journey"" after lockdown was introduced in March There has been pressure from some quarters for a faster easing of the lockdown in a bid to restart the economy. In England, a similar plan includes suggested timetables. In Wales, the government is using a traffic-light system for phased reductions in the lockdown. ""While the traffic light approach is useful, employers are still waiting for clear guidance about how they will be able to re-open premises and resume work safely in accordance with Welsh legislation,"" said Ian Price, director of industry body CBI Wales. ""Indicative timelines outlining when sectors and workplaces can come back online are also needed, so businesses of all shapes and sizes can quickly ramp-up essential restart planning and decision-making."" Mr Drakeford stressed the country was only now moving ""carefully and cautiously"" into the first red zone, what he called the ""first steps on our recovering journey"". Providing the virus remained under control, Wales would move to the amber zone which would see more signs of returning to normal. The ""green zone"" would come when the country was ""still on top of the virus"". There life would begin to look more like it was before coronavirus began ""but not identical to it,"" warned Mr Drakeford. He said until a vaccine or effective treatment was found, coronavirus would be ""with us for a long time to come"". Mr Drakeford said it would be ""self-policing"" rather than police officers enforcing rules which gets Wales through the crisis as officers' jobs will become harder if different sectors move out of restrictions at different times. The people of Wales ""need hope"" in terms of how restrictions are lifted, he said, and that his plan provided ""more detail than we've ever had before"". The Welsh Government says it would like to bring some children back to school before the summer holidays Mr Drakeford said the ""ambition"" was to get some children ""back into school before the summer break"". Education Minister Kirsty Williams published a document she said would be a ""stimulus for wider discussion and feedback"" on how social distancing and other measures will be implemented. Most schools have been closed since the start of the pandemic, with some open for the children of critical workers and those deemed as vulnerable. ""Nothing would make me happier than seeing our classrooms full again,"" Ms Williams said. ""But I want to be clear that this framework does not - and I will not - set an arbitrary date for when more pupils will return to school. ""Setting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do."" She said it will not be one decision but ""a series of decisions over time"". Ms Williams said when Wales was ready to move into the next phase, she would make sure there is enough time for preparation and for staff to carry out necessary training. Five key principles for schools returning - set out in April - focus on safety and mental, emotional and physical wellbeing of students and staff. The UK government intends schools in England to re-open to more pupils before the holiday, but there is no such timetable in the Welsh Government's roadmap. The theme throughout this Welsh Government document is caution - a slow and careful unfolding of the lockdown which will require difficult choices about priorities. It says an effective system of track and trace is essential as is the continued compliance of the general public. The document warns the capacity of the Welsh Government to put robust systems in place will dictate the timetable. A traffic lights system of red, amber and green gives lists of likely easements at different stages - but that depends on the headroomoffered by the R rate, indicating the disease's ability to spread, which will remain the focus. While easements are complicated and interlinked, it will be necessary to choose between them and those which offer the greatest relief for general quality of life will be prioritised. But the message is clear that ""normal life"" could be years away. The general public are invited to share their views on the way forward. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Royal Mail chief executive in surprise exitRico Back leaves after less than two years in the role amid reports he ran the firm from Switzerland.Business,"The boss of Royal Mail is leaving after less than two years in the role amid reports he has been running the business from his home in Switzerland. Rico Back will step down as chief executive with immediate effect and Keith Williams, the former boss of BA, will take over as executive chairman. Mr Back has reportedly been at his Lake Zurich house since just after lockdown. The Royal Mail said he was ""following government advice to work from home unless you cannot"". Royal Mail has seen a sharp fall in letter volumes since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced in the UK on 23 March. The company said that while there had been a ""substantial switch from letters to parcels in the UK"", revenues during April fell Â£22m compared to the same month last year. It has also facedcriticism from its own staff, who said last month that there was a shortage of gloves, masks and hand sanitiser to protect them from contracting coronavirus. Royal Mail said it had invested in safety equipment and said the costs of running its UK postal service had risen by Â£40m ""driven by overtime and agency resource costs due to high levels of absence, the introduction of social distancing measures and PPE"". Mr Back has been put on gardening leave until 15 August, during which he will receive his pay and benefits. He will then receive nine monthly payments totalling Â£480,000. Royal Mail also said it would provide up to Â£50,000 towards his legal fees and a maximum Â£25,000 towards outplacement support. Mr Back's compensation has been at the centre of controversy in the past after he received a Â£5.8m payment in July 2017 when his contract as boss of Royal Mail's European parcels business was renegotiated. It prompted a letter from Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee, to Royal Maildemanding an explanation,external. Mr Back, who has worked at Royal Mail for two decades, said: ""It has been a privilege to lead a company that is so much a part of UK life at this crucial time in its history."" Royal Mail also announced that its executive directors will not receive bonuses for the 2019-20 financial year and said Â£25m has been set aside for ""cash awards for frontline staff, in recognition of their role during COVID-19"". Just prior to lockdown, postal workers had voted to go on strike in a row over pay and working conditions but delayed the action because of the pandemic. Commenting on Mr Back's departure, the Communication Workers' Union said: ""The change of chief executive by Royal Mail Group must now bring about a total change in strategy and direction. ""Postal workers have been outstanding during this pandemic and are ready to embrace innovation, new products and building on their role in every community in the UK."" Royal Mail has been attempting to refocus the business as parcel volumes grow, fuelled by online shopping, and the number of letters being sent falls. In its most recent trading update, Royal Mail said UK parcel volumes rose 31% in April while addressed letters dropped by 33%. Royal Mail said that Mr Williams said will lead discussions ""about an accelerated pace of change across the business"". It also said that the chairman will remain in the executive role until a permanent chief executive of Royal Mail is appointed. Royal Mail's share price rose 7.5% to 174.57p each.

Doctors 'told not to discuss PPE shortages',"Some NHS managers have tried to stop doctors speaking publicly about shortages of personal protective equipment, the BBC has been told. WhistleblowersUK said more than 100 healthcare workers had contacted them since the beginning of March, raising concerns about Covid-19 and PPE. The Department of Health said no one should be prevented from speaking up. But Newsnight has seen evidence of pressure being applied to doctors to not share concerns they have about PPE. A newsletter sent out to staff at one trust suggested subjects for tweets, such as thanking staff for their hard work, paying tribute to retired NHS staff who had returned to the workforce and retweeting posts from the trust's account. It specified that staff were to avoid ""commenting on political issues, such as PPE"". Another trust put up posters in hospital staff areas which told healthcare workers not to ""make public appeals for equipment, donations or volunteers"". One doctor who had posted concerns about PPE shortages online spoke to BBC Newsnight anonymously, for fear of reprisal from his hospital. ""They hauled me up in front of a panel of senior managers - it was very, very intimidating"", he said. ""They kept on feeding me what felt like government type of lines, saying 'this hospital has never had PPE shortages' - which I know to be factually untrue. And that essentially I should stop causing a fuss. ""There have been colleagues who've died at my hospital. And there have been a handful more who've been in ICU (intensive care units). ""It's very, very concerning that we can't even say our colleagues have died, please don't let us be next."" Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? PPE 'designed for women' needed on frontline A4-sized PPE visors 'too narrow' says regulator Another doctor told the programme they were called into a meeting with senior NHS managers after speaking to the press about a lack of PPE. They said they were told by their manager that if they continued to speak out they would get a ""reputation"" and ""find it hard to get a job at that trust or others in the region"". The doctor said: ""I was told we need positive messaging that suggested everyone in the NHS is working very hard, we are doing our best in the pandemic. I was told this is what we need to be putting out, not negative stories."" Dr Jenny Vaughan, law and policy lead at campaigning organisation Doctors' Association UK, said their concerns ""weren't listened to properly"". ""These are people who had tried the right channels. These are people genuinely raising concerns who went to the people who should have listened to them and felt either they couldn't raise a concern or they weren't listened to. ""If you have a transparent, open culture of reporting and people feel free that they can speak up about safety concerns, it saves lives"". WhistleblowingUK is a not-for-profit organisation that helps people who want to make anonymous disclosures. ""The system is completely broken,"" said Georgina Halford-Hall, its chief executive. ""What we see time and time again in the evidence that comes back is that when an individual has raised a concern it goes straight to HR, who immediately begin to investigate the whistle-blower and look for things that they're doing wrong rather than looking at the actual issues that they're raising. ""The default position is an auto-immune response against the whistle-blower, and not - absolutely no intention whatsoever - to investigate or look into the allegations that they make."" SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Conservative MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group for whistleblowing, Mary Robinson, said: ""If we don't listen to the concerns of people on the front line we don't have the right tools to deal with issues like PPE shortages"" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Whistleblowers perform a vital and courageous service in ensuring safe care, and no one should ever be prevented from speaking up or discriminated against if they do. ""Freedom to Speak Up Guardians are now established in every NHS trust in England to ensure workers who speak up are listened to, thanked and supported, and they have handled over 19,000 cases in the last two years.""

Unions demand assurances over 1 June school planTeachers say they want to see the scientific evidence that it is safe to open schools in England.,"Doctors have backed teachers' unions by saying Covid-19 infection rates are too high for England's schools to reopen. The British Medical Association said teachers and heads were ""absolutely right"" to urge caution and prioritise testing to avoid a second spike. It comes after teachers' unions met the government's scientific and medical advisers to express concerns about the planned phased reopening from 1 June. The NASUWT union said no school should reopen until it could show it was safe. England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted schools would only open their doors more widely when the conditions were right to do so, with the earliest date being 1 June. He said he had wanted to give head teachers and parents several weeks to plan for the event. This video can not be played Steve Chalke wants Oasis trust schools to reopen in June The governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have stepped back from setting a firm date. But since the prime minister announced there was to be a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, plans for the phased reopening from the beginning of next month seem to have hardened. After the meeting between the National Education Union and other teaching unions, and the government's top scientific advisers, Mr Williamson said schools would have all the ""guidance and support they will need"". However, teachers' unions say they still have ""unanswered questions"" about how pupils can be invited back and managed safely. When schools return they will have to introduce smaller classes and keep pupils apart NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said: ""No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak."" He added: ""No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided."" The British Medical Association said with so much ""conflicting"" evidence on opening schools, it was ""completely aligned"" with teachers' union calls to delay reopening. ""Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools,"" said a letter from the BMA's council chair. It added there was still too little clear evidence on the extent to which children were carriers of the disease, even though they usually got fewer and less serious symptoms than adults. Calls to publish scientific evidence for return to school Class sizes of no more than 15 when schools reopen How England is following Denmark's model for opening schools Speaking after the meeting NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney welcomed a promise to publish the scientific evidence on school reopening plans. But he called for a clarification over what thresholds would be used to judge if it was safe to open up. And he asked how it would be measured whether reopening increased the rate of infection in the wider community. His union is one of nine opposed to reopening schools on 1 June. But Mr Williamson said: ""I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June."" The DfE proposed teaching pupils in small groups of 15 or fewer and keeping them apart from other children during the school day to limit the spread of any infection, as well as maintaining good hygiene and hand washing. How do you social distance in schools? Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Do I have to send my children back to school? But one of England's biggest academy trusts has become one of the first school groups to say it will reopen from 1 June. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust which has 35 primary schools, says opposition to reopening fails to recognise the harm to disadvantaged children from missing school. Mr Chalke, whose schools on average have 45% of children eligible for free school meals, said: ""The greatest risks for many of our children are being stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise, little or no nutritious food."" Mr Chalke said the schools would not be ""forcing anyone to attend"", either pupils or staff, adding safety measures would be in place. But he stressed that the ""long-term social cost"" of not opening would ""outweigh any short-term medical risks"". Graham Gallagher and his wife Leanne have three young children with special needs. He says schools reopening on 1 June would ""benefit the whole family"", who live in a two-bedroom flat in Walsall in the West Midlands. He feels their children aren't getting a ""valuable learning experience"" at home and worry they could regress from the ""solid progress"" they have made during this school year. At home, the children struggle to concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and Leanne is struggling to manage the learning of all three children at once. Schools reopening would allow the children to learn and socialise in a distraction-free environment with more space and access to an outdoor area. He says the couple share teachers' concerns that they need to be ""properly protected"", and hopes ""plans will be put in place"" to alleviate their worries. LOCKDOWN:How are businesses coping? EVERYDAY HEROES:Stacey Dooley is on the hunt Primary school teacher Mary Newton, 49, says she ""feels very strongly"" that June is ""far too early"" to reopen schools. Her husband John, 56, who runs an educational books company, has been shielding at home after a recent heart attack and Mary says their children returning to school would be a concern for his health. They plan to keep their two children - who are in Years 4 and 6 - at home for as long as they can. She says it could be ""catastrophic"" for a child's mental health if they contracted the virus and transmitted it to a family member who became very ill from it. Children could be ""traumatised"" by the new rules that would have to be adhered to and staff would be anxious, she adds. ""I believe schools should continue to support children of key workers and those most vulnerable"", she says, ""but I certainly won't be sending my Year 6 child back to school in June"".

Baby found in recycling 'less than 48 hours old',"This video can not be played Needham Market recycling centre baby death investigators plea to mum A baby girl, whose body was found in a household recycling centre, is thought to have been taken there in a bin lorry. The newborn, thought to be less than 48 hours old, was found by staff at the Sackers facility in Needham Market, Suffolk, shortly after 15:00 BST on Thursday. The death is being treated as unexplained. Police want to speak to the mother as they are concerned for her welfare. A Suffolk Police spokesman said they believed ""the most likely scenario"" was that the baby was taken to the recycling centre via refuse collection from Ipswich and the surrounding area. However, he said a number of possibilities were still being explored. It is thought the baby's body was taken to the recycling centre during a refuse collection Det Ch Supt Eamonn Bridger said: ""It's our current thinking it is likely the baby was born within the last 48 hours. ""We can only imagine the emotional distress and physical distress that lady's been through, and it's essential she gets the help of medical professionals that she needs. ""Obviously we keep a really open mind about the nature of the investigation but at this time the absolute priority is her wellbeing."" Det Ch Supt Bridger made a direct appeal to the mother, or anyone who knows who she might be, to come forward. He said detectives had been at the recycling site since ""staff made the shocking and tragic discovery"", and a team had remained there overnight as investigations continued. Coronavirus: Live updates from across the East of England A spokeswoman for Sackers said: ""Our recycling sorting facilities are so thorough that we believe the baby was found very quickly once it was at our Needham Market site."" She said the company was supporting the staff who found the baby's body and assisting Suffolk Police with its investigations.

Katherine Ryan: Miscarriage made me feel 'shamefulâ,"Ryan says ""girls need to know that you can have this secret, silent miscarriage"" Katherine Ryan has said her miscarriage in February made her feel ""embarrassed and shameful"", adding women and girls need more information on losing a baby. ""I think it needs to be on the curriculum, I think girls need to know that you can have this secret, silent miscarriage,"" she told Love Island host Laura Whitmore'sCastaway podcast,external. ""I felt embarrassed for getting excited before the loss,"" said the Canadian comedian and actress. She had been 10 weeks pregnant. Ryan told Whitmore: ""I know it can be a very lonely experience, and it's shrouded in all this embarrassment... I felt all these things, and I looked for stories and I really couldn't find many of them. ""I felt like a walking tomb and it took me a month to sort it out to get it out. It's crazy, they don't teach us this in school."" 'Teach schoolchildren about baby loss' 'I thought I was losing my mind after miscarriage' The Department for Education told the BBC: ""We want to support all young people to be happy, healthy and safe. The introduction of compulsoryRelationships and Sex Education,externalfrom September will ensure that secondary aged pupils will be taught the facts in relation to pregnancy, including miscarriage."" The performer found out about her pregnancy loss earlier this year during a routine scan, and said: ""I'm 36, I thought I was very well-versed on women's issues. I genuinely didn't know that a miscarriage can happen in this way."" Ryan regularly performs stand-up comedy She is in a civil partnership with her childhood sweetheart Bobby Kootstra, and has a daughter, Violet, from a previous relationship. On her own podcast, calledKatherine Ryan: Telling Everybody Everything,external, she explained what happened. ""So I was having a scan, and was then told I needed an internal scan, and I thought 'something's weird', but by now the doctor had turned the screen to herself so I couldn't see it and I just knew something was wrong. ""The doctor said 'oh I'm sorry, we would expect to see a heartbeat but we don't, and we're going to have to have a very different conversation here', and then I thought 'well that's done'. ""I think I was really embarrassed, I don't want anyone to see when I'm upset, so I was happy, smiley, she must have thought who is this psycho...? ""I had a gig in Liverpool that evening, so I said 'I'm sorry I have to go to work'."" She said she carried on working, saying: ""You think you did something wrong but you keep it to yourself."" Ryan's body continued to carry the embryo, and she explained: ""Basically my mind knew I had lost the baby, my body just would not recognise it had lost this baby. ""So three weeks passed and I tried the medical management three times, and it didn't work. That was was the hardest part of it - remaining pregnant with a deceased embryo for that long. ""And having to work, doing the job that I do, and smile and I was just not the same human being, it was crazy to me, the most nuts thing. I would not recommend it to anyone. Laura Whitmore spoke on the podcast about her own miscarriage in 2018 ""I had surgery, but in that three weeks you can't be positive, you don't have that part of your brain that says carry on - it's like this terrible dark, deep feeling. ""People recover and they don't mention it again, they start to forget the hardest part, but right now I haven't forgotten yet. It was so grim and I felt like a bad mom, I couldn't get it out - 'maybe this little soul is scared and doesn't want to be alone'."" At this moment on the podcast, Ryan became emotional and paused, before adding: ""It's fine now, that's just always the bit that gets me. ""So if that should be a story that touches your own life, I really hope it doesn't. The last thing I would want is that hopelessness and shame and weird energy of 'keep it to yourself, don't upset anyone, be a good girl and take it on the chin and keep it moving. I have felt this collective grief."" Whitmore said this echoed her own miscarriage in 2018, adding: ""It's crazy you said that, because I've never told you this, but I remember in my situation about two years ago when we went for our scan, it was supposed to be the first proper scan, and there was no heartbeat. ""I think for the doctors it happens so much that they're quite used to it, I didn't realise the figures until afterwards. So I didn't know how I was supposed to react, was I supposed to be upset, was I supposed to be 'oh, ok' and move on. ""I remember being all over the place, and I remember [my partner] Ian saying to me, 'shall we just go home', and I said 'I want to have a little bit of escapism, I want to go out, have a glass of wine, I want to laugh, I want to watch a show and then I want to deal with this - everyone reacts differently"". They went on to see Ryan performing stand-up at a live gig that evening, and Whitmore said she carried on working afterwards, including at the MTV Awards. ""I was on stage doing a show - people don't know the secrets woman are carrying around because people are afraid to share them,"" she said. Katherine Ryan has lived in the UK for more than a decade Ryan said on her own podcast: ""When it happens to you, that's when you realise how traumatic it is. Women historically have been expected to get on with things. ""The reason we don't talk about miscarriage more is not for the sufferer of the miscarriage, not for the mom and family, it's for everyone else. It's a way of being polite - nobody wants you to say you found out you lost a baby. "" She told Whitmore: ""I think the more women that tell their stories about this... it was important for me to share it, even if it helps just one person.""

Treat NHS staff like military 'returning from war',"Dr Rony Berrebi says fear is a big factor for many staff NHS staff are at risk of high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder if they don't get the right support as the coronavirus outbreak subsides, health service adviser Prof Neil Greenberg has said. For now there's a national focus on health and care workers. Public billboards praise them, millions turn out on the street for a weekly round of applause and volunteers have been rushing to help in any way they can. But the height of the crisis is when many staff will be in coping mode. It's when things slow down - and the clapping stops - that, psychologists believe, the real risk of difficulties will arise. People may need months or even years of ""active monitoring"" of their mental health after things return to some semblance of normality, according to Prof Greenberg, a world-leading expert in trauma at King's College London. The NHS in England is providing crisis support to its staff. But it hasn't produced a formal long-term plan to offer extra psychological services in the aftermath of the pandemic. .Coronavirus: Mental health hotline for NHS staff An invisible wound for health workers and soldiers As the crisis passes its peak, there is an ""urgent"" need to work out how staff calling new NHS mental health hotlines can be referred on to specialist services, says Dr Michael Bloomfield, a psychiatrist at University College London (UCL) and Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust's traumatic stress clinic. The clinic was set up as a result of the King's Cross Station fire in 1987, which killed 31 people and injured 100, and specialises in helping people following events like terror attacks. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Studies after the Sars outbreak found about 10% of health staff had PTSD, and many more had other signs of psychological distress. The British Psychological Society (BPS) points out that health workers are highly resilient people who are used to dealing with difficult and sometimes traumatic situations. But this current crisis has particular risk factors - including fear for staff's own and their families' health and the loss of informal support networks because of social distancing and working outside their usual teams. Dr Rony Berrebi, an intensive care consultant in London, says: ""People are scared. I think the fear factor is massive."" ""Imagine going to work every day and coming back home knowing the virus could be in your hair, your clothes, your shoes, or you might be brewing it,"" he says. It's what happens after the trauma that is ""most predictive of what people will be like in terms of their mental health"",  according to Prof Greenberg. How well people are supported and how much stress they're put under as they try to recover can make or break whether someone manages well or develops far more serious difficulties including PTSD. ""If we muck it up then that's going to make the trauma they've already had much more difficult to deal with,"" he says. Many staff have lost their support networks - some have even moved out of their homes to protect family members At the height of the crisis, evidence suggests good leadership from managers and support from peers are the most helpful things. Psychologists expect the real demand for more structured mental health support to come later. Dr Julie Highfield, a clinical psychologist in an intensive care unit who is involved in putting together national guidance through the BPS, says she doesn't expect the NHS hotline to be used very much during the ""active period when everyone's just trying to cope moment to moment"". She is concerned to stress the NHS shouldn't see this lack of demand as a general lack of need. ""What's really needed long-term is an 18-month to two-year recovery period,"" with access to counselling and trauma-focused therapy, she says. Dr Berrebi has made a music video to raise funds for counselling for front-line workers Some therapy can be accessed now through in-house psychological services - but provision across the UK is ""patchy"", says Dr Highfield. She would like the NHS to commit to a shared ""minimum response"". Dr Berrebi says his hospital has in-house psychologists but thinks some of his colleagues are not aware that it's available or how to access it. He's made a music video to raise funds for counselling for front-line workers. Some resist comparing intensive care units to the battlefield. But Prof Greenberg, who has worked for decades with the military on the mental health of personnel, says NHS staff should be treated like soldiers after tours - with time off and a gradual return to normal work. National mental health director Claire Murdoch said NHS England is offering mental health care and support ""within trusts, and new text, online and telephone support services"". The Scottish government has launched a ""national wellbeing hub"" where staff can access online resources, which it says has been created by ""trauma and other specialists"". This is designed to ""respond to the current pandemic and to help provide long-term support to staff,"" a spokesperson said. Northern Ireland's plan outlines support for both the ""active"" phase and the ""recovery"" phase, including access to ""evidenced-based psychological therapies for those with ongoing difficulties"" and team-based reflection. While in Wales, Â£1m has been put aside to provide support services including for PTSD. A number of voluntary schemes have also been set up to provide therapy for NHS staff, in an attempt to fill the gaps. Some, like Project 5 and Frontline-19, require volunteers to be accredited, highly vetted and commit to a minimum number of sessions. But this commitment varies. Prof Greenberg says some voluntary schemes are really good, but the quality varies: ""Some follow evidence-based guidelines, but some are, to be fair very well-intentioned, but often not very well put together. ""It would be quite dangerous to allow a proliferation of well-meaning charities, which might distract or detract people from going and getting the right care."" And people may not want to access these services now, but later - at which point well-meaning volunteers may well have had to return to their day jobs. Kate Perry, a psychologist volunteering for Frontline-19, says she is committed to providing free care in the longer-term: ""It's very clear - you take someone into practice and treat them as you would a paying client, for as long as they need it."" Trauma experts are particularly concerned about schemes that offer just one session or those that do not carefully vet volunteers' qualifications. This would be a concern, Dr Bloomfield says, because ""some interventions can interfere with the natural healing process and make PTSD more likely"".

London congestion charge to be reinstatedThe charge will resume on Monday and go up in June to avoid a build-up of traffic in the capital.London,"TfL said NHS and care workers would be exempt from the congestion charge. The congestion charge for people driving into central London will be reintroduced on Monday under the terms of a Â£1.6bn government bailout. It follows a deal in which Transport for London (TfL) secured emergency funding to keep Tube and bus services going until September. From 22 June, the congestion charge will also rise from Â£11.50 to Â£15. Downing Street defended the changes saying it ""only applied to a small area of central London"". The prime minister's official spokesman said roads in these areas ""would come to a halt without it"" and it was an ""important tool to ensure that emissions in London remain low and support better air quality"". TfL said the resumed congestion charge would be temporarily extended to between 07:00 and 22:00, seven days a week, from 22 June and the price rise would be in place for a year. Both measures will be reviewed later to see if they are made permanent. A system of reimbursement for NHS workers in place before the charge was suspended on 23 March will also be extended to care home workers. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to socially distance on public transport Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the measures were designed to avoid a build up of traffic after the government urged people returning to work to avoid public transport. TfL said the plans would ""create more space for social distancing when walking and cycling, ensuring that the people who have no choice but to return to work in central London can do so as safely as possible"". Some streets will be converted to walking and cycling only, with others restricted to all traffic apart from buses, creating ""one of the world's largest car-free zones"". Government agrees Â£1.6bn London transport bailout How will transport need to change? Waterloo Bridge and London Bridge may be restricted to people walking, cycling and buses only, with pavements widened to enable people to safely travel between busy railway stations and their workplaces. Mr Khan warned public transport must only be used ""as a last resort"". The low emission zone and ultra low emission zone - imposing levies on high-polluting vehicles - also comes back into operation on Monday. Also under the conditions of the government deal, children will no longer have free travel across London and restrictions on travel passes for people with a disability or over the age of 60 will also be imposed during peak hours. Fares on buses - scrapped to help protect drivers from Covid-19 - will also be reintroduced. The Department for Transport (DfT) said these changes would be put in place ""as soon as practicable"".

Black-cab driver and general secretary of the London Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA) Steve McNamara said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" no one had been consulted about plans to change the use of some roads. ""Usually you have to consult with the public and businesses - they are using a health emergency to get around the laws to consult people before you do these things,"" he said. ""It's a land grab to exclude Londoners from their roads and to widen pavements for more cycling."" Coronavirus has had a significant impact on the London Underground Mr Khan said the government deal was necessary because coronavirus had had a ""catastrophic impact on TfL's finances"". ""I want to be completely honest and upfront with Londoners,"" the mayor said. ""This is not the deal I wanted. But it was the only deal the government put on the table and I had no choice but to accept it to keep the Tubes and buses running."" New coronavirus data shows London ethnic breakdown Woman says coronavirus saved her life 'I found out I had cancer on the day of lockdown' The DfT also announced TfL will introduce fare rises of 1% above the rate of inflation from next year. Mr Khan hasfrozen single fares since he became mayor in May 2016. The congestion charge was suspended on March 23 as the country went into lockdown Natalie Chapman, of the Freight Transport Association, said the congestion charge hike ""ignored the needs of London businesses"". She added: ""How are shops to be supplied, restaurants and cafes to be stocked and the rest of the capital's economy to obtain the products it needs when those charged with delivering these needs are to be punitively taxed at a time when their own industry is in recovery?"" By Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent The old adage in promoting cycling and walking or active travel is you have to make driving cars horrible - and that is certainly what's happening here. These are radical changes to London's streets. If you want to drive around central London be prepared not to be allowed in certain roads and to pay Â£15 a day. Drivers fear gridlock. But cycling and walking advocates will be rejoicing that parts of the city are being given over to them. The other side story here is the political row between the government and the Mayor and the many strings attached to the bailout. Future infrastructure is up in the air and fare rises will happen in January. Sadiq Khan says he won't be able to be the mayor he wants to be and Londoners are being punished.

""We've already begun to leave lockdown as it was originally imposed and I am hopeful that, provided coronavirus remains at or below the levels we currently see, there will be more things we will be able to do in the red zone at the end of the current three weeks,"" he said. Lockdown has been in force since March A further three weeks of lockdown were announced last Friday, and Mr Drakeford added: ""We've got to be confident that the initial moves that we make don't inadvertently result in coronavirus being on the rise again."" The cautious route out of lockdown is ""putting people's health first"", he said. ""All our decisions will be based on the latest scientific advice. ""We will act carefully and cautiously, in partnership with people, in a way that is right for Wales. And we will put people's health first."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the UK and Welsh governments have worked closely together every step of the way. ""I am glad that this announcement brings that alignment even closer, providing more certainty for jobs and businesses across Wales."" Welsh Conservatives leader Paul Davies described it as ""a roadmap to a cul-de-sac, not a roadmap to recovery"", and a ""hopeless plan"". ""We need to begin to unlock society but Mark Drakeford seems to have lost his keys,"" he said. Who am I allowed to meet now? Welsh government 'not told about stay alert' Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the strategy was ""thin on detail"" and how it will end community transmission. He added New Zealand's model of driving down the R number to reduce avoidable deaths and ""eradicate"" new cases should be mirrored in Wales, and local lockdowns for clusters should eventually be considered. ""The onus will fall on the Welsh Government to urgently change gear on testing and tracing to allow us to move safely on to the next phase on the path to recovery,"" he said. The Brexit Party tweeted: ""Welsh Labour are playing politics during a pandemic. It's time to end the confusion and work on a UK-wide approach to fighting the virus."" The opening of garden centres was described as the ""first steps on our recovering journey"" after lockdown was introduced in March There has been pressure from some quarters for a faster easing of the lockdown in a bid to restart the economy. In England, a similar plan includes suggested timetables. In Wales, the government is using a traffic-light system for phased reductions in the lockdown. ""While the traffic light approach is useful, employers are still waiting for clear guidance about how they will be able to re-open premises and resume work safely in accordance with Welsh legislation,"" said Ian Price, director of industry body CBI Wales. ""Indicative timelines outlining when sectors and workplaces can come back online are also needed, so businesses of all shapes and sizes can quickly ramp-up essential restart planning and decision-making."" Mr Drakeford stressed the country was only now moving ""carefully and cautiously"" into the first red zone, what he called the ""first steps on our recovering journey"". Providing the virus remained under control, Wales would move to the amber zone which would see more signs of returning to normal. The ""green zone"" would come when the country was ""still on top of the virus"". There life would begin to look more like it was before coronavirus began ""but not identical to it,"" warned Mr Drakeford. He said until a vaccine or effective treatment was found, coronavirus would be ""with us for a long time to come"". Mr Drakeford said it would be ""self-policing"" rather than police officers enforcing rules which gets Wales through the crisis as officers' jobs will become harder if different sectors move out of restrictions at different times. The people of Wales ""need hope"" in terms of how restrictions are lifted, he said, and that his plan provided ""more detail than we've ever had before"". The Welsh Government says it would like to bring some children back to school before the summer holidays Mr Drakeford said the ""ambition"" was to get some children ""back into school before the summer break"". Education Minister Kirsty Williams published a document she said would be a ""stimulus for wider discussion and feedback"" on how social distancing and other measures will be implemented. Most schools have been closed since the start of the pandemic, with some open for the children of critical workers and those deemed as vulnerable. ""Nothing would make me happier than seeing our classrooms full again,"" Ms Williams said. ""But I want to be clear that this framework does not - and I will not - set an arbitrary date for when more pupils will return to school. ""Setting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do."" She said it will not be one decision but ""a series of decisions over time"". Ms Williams said when Wales was ready to move into the next phase, she would make sure there is enough time for preparation and for staff to carry out necessary training. Five key principles for schools returning - set out in April - focus on safety and mental, emotional and physical wellbeing of students and staff. The UK government intends schools in England to re-open to more pupils before the holiday, but there is no such timetable in the Welsh Government's roadmap. The theme throughout this Welsh Government document is caution - a slow and careful unfolding of the lockdown which will require difficult choices about priorities. It says an effective system of track and trace is essential as is the continued compliance of the general public. The document warns the capacity of the Welsh Government to put robust systems in place will dictate the timetable. A traffic lights system of red, amber and green gives lists of likely easements at different stages - but that depends on the headroomoffered by the R rate, indicating the disease's ability to spread, which will remain the focus. While easements are complicated and interlinked, it will be necessary to choose between them and those which offer the greatest relief for general quality of life will be prioritised. But the message is clear that ""normal life"" could be years away. The general public are invited to share their views on the way forward. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

French drug giant rows back after vaccine storm,"Sanofi's HQ is in Paris and the firm has received French state tax breaks The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has rowed back on an apparent promise to prioritise the US market with any potential Covid-19 vaccine. Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson sparked a row by saying the US government had ""the right to the largest pre-order because it's invested in taking the risk"". French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe responded by saying access for all was ""non-negotiable"". Sanofi's chairman has now vowed equal access for everyone. How close to developing a vaccine are we? World leaders pledge billions for vaccine fight Cyber-spies seek coronavirus vaccine secrets ""I am going to be extremely clear: there will be no particular advance for any country,"" Serge Weinberg told France 2 TV. He said Mr Hudson's words had been distorted. Prime Minister Philippe said he had spoken to Mr Weinberg and received ""all the necessary assurance regarding the distribution of an eventual Sanofi vaccine"". President Emmanuel Macron said that recent efforts had proved a vaccine should not be subject to market forces and he is due to meet top Sanofi officials next week. The EU insisted that all countries should get equal access to a vaccine. ""The vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,"" said European Commission spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker, quoted by AFP news agency. The deadly coronavirus pandemic has made the search for a Covid-19 vaccine the top priority for labs worldwide, with intense pressure to speed up a process that usually take years to develop. Earlier this month the EU chaired a global online summit to boost coronavirus research, and secured pledges of $8bn (Â£6.5bn) from some 40 countries and donors. The funding is aimed at developing a coronavirus vaccine and treatments for Covid-19. The UK co-hosted the summit but the US and Russia did not take part. Sanofi's Covid-19 vaccine research is partly funded by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) but in recent years Sanofi received tens of millions of euros in tax credits from the French government to help its research. Mr Hudson's remarks in a Bloomberg interview provoked uproar among politicians on the right and left in France. The Socialists estimated that Sanofi had received some â¬150m (Â£133m; $162m) in research tax credit and millions more in other tax credit. Sanofi's chief in France, Olivier Bogillot, said the goal was to have a vaccine ""available to the US as well as France and Europe at the same time"". But speaking on French news channel BFMTV, he said this would only be possible ""if Europeans work as quickly as the Americans"", and added that the US government had pledged to spend ""several hundreds of millions of euros"". The row was reminiscent of reports in March of a US attempt to buy German biotech firm CureVac, which has also been researching a possible vaccine. CureVac insisted there had been no US attempt to buy the firm or its manufacturing capacity. Last month Sanofi also teamed up with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to work on a vaccine, though trials have not yet started. EUROPE'S EASING:How lockdown is being lifted THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? Sanofi's head of vaccine research, John Shiver, says ""we are using an existing technology that was designed for influenza, and we're applying it to the new virus that causes Covid-19 disease"". Sanofi says GSK ""will contribute its adjuvant technology, an ingredient added to enhance the immune response, reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose and improve the chances of delivering an effective vaccine that can be manufactured at scale"". The candidate vaccine is expected to enter clinical trials in the second half of 2020 and to be available by the second half of 2021.

How to social distance in schools,"Pupils will work at school some of the time and at home for the rest of the time Scottish schoolchildren are set to return to classrooms in August using a ""blended model"". This will involve a mix of ordinary classroom learning, online learning and homework. But how will this work in practice? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced on Thursday thatpupils would return to school from 11 Augustand that teachers would start preparing classrooms next month. She said there would be a different way of learning, using a ""blended model."" This will involve part-time study in school combined with some learning at home, but social distancing will still need to be observed. The Scottish government has published astrategic framework document,externalexplaining the factors that contributed to its plan for the reopening of schools. The precise date for pupils to return to class will have to be confirmed by individual councils. Social distancing will still have to be observed Class sizes will be significantly reduced, with most pupils spending about half their time in class and half learning at home. Time in school will increase further as soon as it is safe to do so. Some children could attend school in the morning while others will go after lunch or different groups of children could attend on alternate days or even alternate weeks. Schools will implement physical distancing measures, such as providing seating that is two metres (6ft 6in) apart and staggering arrival, departure and break times. Innovative use will be made of existing teachers and staff and, where necessary, the role of former teachers will be considered to return to the classroom or for virtual teaching to support in-home learning. The physical space available for teaching will be expanded by making use of libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference venues, and taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation. A further Â£30m is being offered to provide laptops for disadvantaged children to reflect the fact that pupils will continue to be learning part of their time at home. Ms Sturgeon also said transition support would be given, where possible, to children going into Primary 1 or moving from primary to secondary schools. England, Wales and Northern Ireland In England, from 1 June, children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 will be able to return to school if infection rates and the UK government's other tests at the time allow it. However, scores of councilssay they cannot guarantee primaries will reopen on 1 June, throwing the government's plans into chaos. No date has been given for the reopening of schools in Wales, however,they will not reopen on 1 June. Some pupils in Northern Irelandwill return to school in late Augustwith a phased return for the remainder. Denmark Pupils in Denmark stay in small groups all day Primary children in Denmark have been back at school for a month. It was the first country in Europe to reopen its primary schools, after containing the virus early on. It is assumed that social distancing will be unreliable with young children, so instead children stay in small groups all day, in ""protective bubbles"". These micro-groups of pupils arrive at a separate time, eat their lunch separately, stay in their own zones in the playground and are taught by one teacher. No face masks are used by pupils or teachers. At Danish schools there are regular pauses for hand washing through the day There is a huge amount of hand washing and sterilising. ""There is pretty much hourly washing going on,"" says Dom Maher, head of the international section of St Josef's school in Roskilde, so much so that the new problem is skin irritation and eczema. But he says the idea of perfect social distancing with small children is not realistic. ""Most of them are pretty good with it and mindful of space. But they do forget,"" he adds. Germany In Germany older year groups have gone back first When some schools opened in Germany last month, individual seating plans were put in place. Shaun Roberts, principal of the Cologne International School, says there is a fixed place for each student - so that if someone is found with the virus, the contact tracers will know exactly who was sitting nearest. The oldest year groups have gone back first. Some classrooms have been converted in Germany Exam halls are one of the few locations that lend themselves to social distancing. There is a one-way system in the corridors to minimise contact, break times are staggered, there is a strict cleaning regime and face masks are worn in common areas. The school days are shorter and mixed with online lessons, so different year groups can share classrooms that might now only hold 10 pupils. And there are staff and pupils who are staying at home because of their health issues or because of concerns about someone in their family. Norway In Norway schools have returned with pupils separated around the classroom Children in Norway went back to school at the beginning of May. Classes have been reduced to a maximum of 15 students to allow for social distancing. Some school playgrounds are divided, and there is a large focus on hygiene. France Primary schools and nurseries opened in much of France on 11 May. Schools for 11 to 15-year-olds known as collÃ¨ges opened only in green zones - where the outbreak is not as bad - on 18 May. Schools for 15 to 18-year-olds (lycÃ©es) are not opening before June. Schools have reduced class sizes but some local authorities are keeping schools closed. Masks are mandatory in secondary schools. Belgium No more than 10 children are allowed in each classroom in Belgium Schools resumed classes from 18 May, but no more than 10 children are allowed in each classroom. Elsewhere in Europe Schools in Spain will partially reopen from Tuesday. This will allow for revision classes and state exams but a full reopening is not expected until September. Secondary school pupils in the Netherlands are due to return to class on 2 June. In Greece, schools reopened on 11 May for final-year students only, with special measures including students attending classes on different days. In Austria, final-year school pupils returned to classes at the beginning of May. Schools reopened in Switzerland on 11 May with strict social distancing measures in place. Some pupils have returned in Portugal but many classes continue remotely. Schools in Italy and Ireland will not open until September and remain shut in Russia. Schools were never shut in Sweden. New Zealand Schools returned on Monday but instead of escorting their children to class, parents dropped them at ""kiss and go"" zones, while early childhood centres recorded personal details needed for contact tracing. South Korea Teachers in South Korea went back in April and gave online lessons via video link In South Korea, classrooms opened again at the beginning of April. But they remained empty of pupils as a decision was taken to start the new term online. Teachers communicated with their pupils via laptops and video links. Concerns have been raised about pupils using handrails on stairs Edinburgh primary teacher Blair Minchin said the way schools now work would have to be taken into consideration. ""It's no longer sitting and looking at the teacher at your desk,"" he said. ""We're collaborative, we're creative. We have kids move around the class. ""They're touching concrete materials, blocks and cubes. Would they need to be washed every time a kid touches one? And what about handrails on stairs?"" Mr Minchin said that as a teacher who had been working in one of the hubs for the children of key workers, it was possible to distance small groups of pupils, but difficult. ""If you have a child that gets stuck its very hard for a teacher to socially distance from that pupil."" Jude Barber, director at Glasgow-based Collective Architecture,told the Architects' Journal:,external""Given the spatial and behavioural challenges surrounding the pandemic, it seems only right that architects, landscape architects and planners should be central to the discussion and share their ideas and expertise."" But Alan Dunlop, visiting professor in architecture at the University of Liverpool, said the cost of the measure would be ""prohibitive"" and added: ""Even if you could compartmentalise classrooms, there is the issue of common areas, such as stairways, corridors, toilets etc and the no small matter of parents and carers collecting and dropping off children at the same time.

Denmark's school safety model,"Schools have begun to open in Denmark and Germany. Can you really keep pupils safely apart? Primary schools in England could reopen from 1 June - and the safety approach closely follows Denmark's example, where schools opened last month. This assumes that social distancing will be unreliable with young children, so instead children stay in small groups all day, in ""protective bubbles"". Re-opening schools is going to be one of the biggest symbolic steps towards loosening the lockdown. It has divided opinion about whether it can be safe - and who should go back first. But there are places, such as Denmark and Germany, where it's already happened. ""There was anxiety in the community,"" says Dom Maher, head of the international section of St Josef's school in Roskilde, on the Danish island of Zealand. ""A large percentage of parents were in two minds,"" he says. ""And there were some who decided to wait a few days to see."" But several three weeks after re-opening, he thinks it has worked better than might have been expected. Children were relieved to be back and parents have become more confident about safety - and numbers attending schools have steadily risen. In St Josef's in Roskilde the social distancing continues into the playground Primary school children have returned first in Denmark, and a system is in place to keep children in small groups and with as little contact with others as possible. They spend their school day in a kind of virtual cocoon, with no cross-over with others. These micro-groups of pupils arrive at a separate time, eat their lunch separately, stay in their own zones in the playground and are taught by one teacher. There are about a dozen pupils in these groups. Social distancing means that's about the maximum number who can go into one room, which requires dividing classes and teaching staff. 1 June earliest 'realistic' date for re-opening schools, say heads Teachers warn of virus spike if return to school too early Schools will reopen in phases, says education secretary What will be the 'new normal'? ""Most schools in Denmark are structured where you have primary and lower secondary in the same school,"" says Mr Maher. That  means there is space to spread out, with only about half of the usual thousand pupils on site. ""We've had enough classrooms to do that - if school opening went ahead where all students were back, it would be a real struggle,"" says the head. ""We wouldn't have enough classrooms and would have to start doing morning and afternoon shifts."" At St Josef's in Roskilde there are regular pauses for hand washing through the day The other lynchpin of the Danish approach is a huge amount of hand washing and sterilising. ""There is pretty much hourly washing going on,"" says, Mr Maher, so much so that the new problem is skin irritation and eczema. But he says the idea of perfect social distancing with small children is not realistic. ""Most of them are pretty good with it and mindful of space. But they do forget,"" he says. There are no face masks - either for pupils or teachers. Dorte Lange, vice president of the Danish Union of Teachers, says this lack of personal protection hasn't been an issue, because the medical advice has focused on the strategy of keeping pupils distanced, in isolated groups, and a strong emphasis on hygiene. ""We are glad to say the re-opening up to now has been quite successful,"" the union leader told the BBC. Teachers who have health issues, or who have family members who might be at risk, can teach online from home, she says. Younger children back first in Denmark - older students in Germany Smaller groups of students so social distancing can be maximised Groups maintained for duration of the day Regular breaks for hand-washing In Germany, face masks in communal areas in line with the national plan But she suggests the mood has shifted towards wanting to get children into school again. ""We can see many of the older students are not thriving at home. They really need to be back in the community of the school,"" she says. There has been a collective approach to re-opening between teachers' unions, local authorities and government, says Ms Lange. If a further opening of schools were to increase the rate of infection, she says there would have to be a change of plan. ""But if they say it's safe to open for older kids, we'll make it possible."" There are still worries among parents, including a Facebook page with worries about not treating children as ""guinea pigs"". Sirin posted to say she has kept her four-year-old at home despite the re-opening, but her daughter ""asks me every day when she's going to kindergarten again and that she misses her friends so much"". ""So I thought about sending them off in about two weeks - since I don't think this virus will be gone for a long time and I have to start working at some point."" Another mother says she feels pressured into sending her child into school. ""I'm not comfortable with it. And I have my grandma who's on vacation with us."" At the Copenhagen International School there is a measured entrance into school On Copenhagen's waterfront there is a one-way sign into a school, indicating the highly-structured nature of the Covid-19-shaped school day. Ida Storm Jansen, an administrator in Copenhagen International School, says about 10 students are allowed per classroom. It's an international school but all such schools have to follow their countries' health advice. ""I had a great conversation with a four year old. He said we used to sit on the carpet and now we sit on the tape marks,"" she says. In Norway schools have returned with pupils separated around the classroom The system of isolating these small groups of children is more practical than only relying on social distancing, she suggests. ""Frankly it's impossible. When they play, of course they forget,"" she says. But with constant hand washing and minimal contact with any other group, she says there is an effective system - and children have adapted to it very quickly. Ms Jansen says fears of a ""big backlash from parents"" over re-opening didn't materialise - and children were relieved to be back with their friends. In Germany it has been older year groups which have gone back first When some schools opened in Germany last month, the detail of planning went down to individual seating plans. Shaun Roberts, principal of the Cologne International School, says there is a fixed place for each student - so that if someone is found with the virus, the contact tracers will know exactly who was sitting nearest. In Germany, it's the oldest year groups which have gone back first. The top class is revising for the Abitur, the German equivalent of A-levels, which have not been cancelled. Exam halls are one of the few locations which lend themselves to social distancing. There is a one-way system in the corridors to minimise contact, break times are staggered, there is a strict cleaning regime - and face masks are worn in common areas. ""People do what they have to do without making a fuss,"" says Mr Roberts. But it isn't ""business as usual"". Decisions about when schools in the UK will open will soon be taken The school days are shorter and mixed with online lessons, so different year groups can share classrooms which might now only hold 10 pupils. And there are staff and pupils who are staying at home because of their health issues or because of concerns about someone in their family. ""The great unspoken"", he says is that schools might have re-opened, but there are limits to what can be provided. France and The Netherlands will be the next to open schools next week - with strong opinions for and against returning. And plans for schools in the UK will become clearer in the next few days. Mr Roberts in Cologne describes it as a ""journey back to normality"", which will continue long beyond the summer break and into the autumn. It might only be beginning - but he says, it has to start somewhere.

Lockdown exit plan for Wales to be publishedWales' first minister will say how he plans to lift the country out of coronavirus restrictions.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Coronavirus lockdown exit plan for Wales 'puts health first' There could be ""more things we are able to do"" in two weeks' time as Wales moves slowly out of lockdown, the first minister said. ""We are already in the red zone,"" Mark Drakeford said, as he unveiled a plan for returning to some form of normality. While no dates were given, he said his ""traffic lights"" route out of lockdown also included amber and green stages. There have been restrictions on daily life for seven weeks. ""We've already begun to leave lockdown as it was originally imposed and I am hopeful that, provided coronavirus remains at or below the levels we currently see, there will be more things we will be able to do in the red zone at the end of the current three weeks,"" he said. Lockdown has been in force since March A further three weeks of lockdown were announced last Friday, and Mr Drakeford added: ""We've got to be confident that the initial moves that we make don't inadvertently result in coronavirus being on the rise again."" The cautious route out of lockdown is ""putting people's health first"", he said. ""All our decisions will be based on the latest scientific advice. ""We will act carefully and cautiously, in partnership with people, in a way that is right for Wales. And we will put people's health first."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the UK and Welsh governments have worked closely together every step of the way. ""I am glad that this announcement brings that alignment even closer, providing more certainty for jobs and businesses across Wales."" Welsh Conservatives leader Paul Davies described it as ""a roadmap to a cul-de-sac, not a roadmap to recovery"", and a ""hopeless plan"". ""We need to begin to unlock society but Mark Drakeford seems to have lost his keys,"" he said. Who am I allowed to meet now? Welsh government 'not told about stay alert' Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the strategy was ""thin on detail"" and how it will end community transmission. He added New Zealand's model of driving down the R number to reduce avoidable deaths and ""eradicate"" new cases should be mirrored in Wales, and local lockdowns for clusters should eventually be considered. ""The onus will fall on the Welsh Government to urgently change gear on testing and tracing to allow us to move safely on to the next phase on the path to recovery,"" he said. The Brexit Party tweeted: ""Welsh Labour are playing politics during a pandemic. It's time to end the confusion and work on a UK-wide approach to fighting the virus."" The opening of garden centres was described as the ""first steps on our recovering journey"" after lockdown was introduced in March There has been pressure from some quarters for a faster easing of the lockdown in a bid to restart the economy. In England, a similar plan includes suggested timetables. In Wales, the government is using a traffic-light system for phased reductions in the lockdown. ""While the traffic light approach is useful, employers are still waiting for clear guidance about how they will be able to re-open premises and resume work safely in accordance with Welsh legislation,"" said Ian Price, director of industry body CBI Wales. ""Indicative timelines outlining when sectors and workplaces can come back online are also needed, so businesses of all shapes and sizes can quickly ramp-up essential restart planning and decision-making."" Mr Drakeford stressed the country was only now moving ""carefully and cautiously"" into the first red zone, what he called the ""first steps on our recovering journey"". Providing the virus remained under control, Wales would move to the amber zone which would see more signs of returning to normal. The ""green zone"" would come when the country was ""still on top of the virus"". There life would begin to look more like it was before coronavirus began ""but not identical to it,"" warned Mr Drakeford. He said until a vaccine or effective treatment was found, coronavirus would be ""with us for a long time to come"". Mr Drakeford said it would be ""self-policing"" rather than police officers enforcing rules which gets Wales through the crisis as officers' jobs will become harder if different sectors move out of restrictions at different times. The people of Wales ""need hope"" in terms of how restrictions are lifted, he said, and that his plan provided ""more detail than we've ever had before"". The Welsh Government says it would like to bring some children back to school before the summer holidays Mr Drakeford said the ""ambition"" was to get some children ""back into school before the summer break"". Education Minister Kirsty Williams published a document she said would be a ""stimulus for wider discussion and feedback"" on how social distancing and other measures will be implemented. Most schools have been closed since the start of the pandemic, with some open for the children of critical workers and those deemed as vulnerable. ""Nothing would make me happier than seeing our classrooms full again,"" Ms Williams said. ""But I want to be clear that this framework does not - and I will not - set an arbitrary date for when more pupils will return to school. ""Setting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do."" She said it will not be one decision but ""a series of decisions over time"". Ms Williams said when Wales was ready to move into the next phase, she would make sure there is enough time for preparation and for staff to carry out necessary training. Five key principles for schools returning - set out in April - focus on safety and mental, emotional and physical wellbeing of students and staff. The UK government intends schools in England to re-open to more pupils before the holiday, but there is no such timetable in the Welsh Government's roadmap. The theme throughout this Welsh Government document is caution - a slow and careful unfolding of the lockdown which will require difficult choices about priorities. It says an effective system of track and trace is essential as is the continued compliance of the general public. The document warns the capacity of the Welsh Government to put robust systems in place will dictate the timetable. A traffic lights system of red, amber and green gives lists of likely easements at different stages - but that depends on the headroomoffered by the R rate, indicating the disease's ability to spread, which will remain the focus. While easements are complicated and interlinked, it will be necessary to choose between them and those which offer the greatest relief for general quality of life will be prioritised. But the message is clear that ""normal life"" could be years away. The general public are invited to share their views on the way forward. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Why is India's contact tracing app controversial?,"The app has crossed 100 million downloads India's Covid-19 contact tracing app has been downloaded 100 million times, according to the information technology ministry, despite fears over privacy. The app - Aarogya Setu, which means ""bridge to health"" in Sanskrit - was launched just six weeks ago. India has made it mandatory for government and private sector employees to download it. But users and experts in India and around the world say the app raises huge data security concerns. How does it work? Using a phone's Bluetooth and location data, Aarogya Setu lets users know if they have been near a person with Covid-19 by scanning a database of known cases of infection. The data is then shared with the government. ""If you've met someone in the last two weeks who has tested positive, the app calculates your risk of infection based on how recent it was and proximity, and recommends measures,"" Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov at India's IT ministry which built the app, told the BBC. While your name and number won't be made public, the app does collect this information, as well as your gender, travel history and whether you're a smoker. Is it mandatory to download the app? Prime Minster Narendra Modi has tweeted in support of the app, urging everyone to download it, and it's been made mandatory for citizens living in containment zones and for all government and private sector employees. Noida, a suburb of the capital, Delhi, has made it compulsory for all residents to have the app, saying they can be jailed for six months for not complying. Food delivery start-ups such as Zomato and Swiggy have also made it mandatory for all staff. But the government directive is being questioned by some. Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work and is my data safe? Coronavirus contact-tracing: World split between two types of app Coronavirus: India replaces ringing tone with health info In an interview with The Indian Express newspaper, former Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna said the drive to make people use the app was ""utterly illegal"". ""Under what law do you mandate it? So far it is not backed by any law,"" he told the newspaper. MIT Technology Review's Covid Tracing Tracker lists 25 contact tracing apps,externalfrom countries around the globe - and there are concerns about some of them too. Critics say apps such as China's Health Code system, which records a user's spending history in order to deter them from breaking quarantine, is invasive. ""Forcing people to install an app doesn't make a success story. It just means that repression works,"" says French ethical hacker Robert Baptiste, who goes by the name Elliot Alderson. What are the main concerns about India's app? Aarogya Setu stores location data and requires constant access to the phone's Bluetooth which, experts say, makes it invasive from a security and privacy viewpoint. In Singapore, for example, the TraceTogether app can be used only by its health ministry to access data. It assures citizens that the data is to be used strictly for disease control and will not be shared with law enforcement agencies for enforcing lockdowns and quarantine. ""Aarogya Setu retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure compliance of legal orders and so on,"" says the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights and liberties advocacy group in Delhi. Aarogya Setu requires constant access to a user's Bluetooth and GPS to collect multiple points of data about a user The app builders, however, insist that at no point does it reveal a user's identity. ""Your data is not going to be used for any other purpose. No third party has access to it,"" Mr Singh of MyGov said. The big issue with the app is that it tracks location, which globally has been deemed unnecessary, says Nikhil Pahwa, editor of internet watchdog Medianama. ""Any app that tracks who you have been in contact with and your location at all times is a clear violation of privacy."" He is also worried by the Bluetooth function on the app. ""If I'm on the third floor and you are on the fourth floor, it will show that we have met, even though we are on different floors, given that Bluetooth travels through walls. This shows 'false positives' or incorrect data."" What are the concerns over privacy? The app allows the authorities to upload the collected information to a government-owned and operated ""server"",  which will ""provide data to persons carrying out medical and administrative interventions necessary in relation to Covid-19"". The Software Freedom Law Centre, a consortium of lawyers, technology experts and students, says it is problematic as it means the government can share the data with ""practically anyone it wants"". MyGov says ""the app has been built with privacy as a core principle"" and the processing of contact tracing and risk assessment is done in an ""anonymised manner"". Mr Singh says when you register, the app assigns you a unique ""anonymised"" device ID. All interactions with the government server from your device are done through this ID only and no personal information is exchanged after registration. But experts have raised doubts about the government claim. Mr Alderson has said there are flaws in the app which make it possible to know who is sick anywhere in India. ""Basically, I was able to see if someone was sick at the PMO [prime minister's office] or the Indian parliament. I was able to see if someone was sick in a specific house if I wanted,""he wrote on his blog,external. Aarogya Setu denied any such privacy breach in a statement. But, India has ""a terrible history"" of protecting privacy, says Mr Pahwa, referring to Aadhaar - the world's largest and most controversial biometrics-based identity database. Critics have repeatedly warned that the scheme puts personal information at risk and have criticised government efforts to compulsorily link it to bank accounts and mobile phone numbers. ""This government has argued that privacy isn't a fundamental right in court,"" Mr Pahwa said. ""We cannot trust it."" India's Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that the controversial Aadhaar scheme was constitutional and did not violate the right to privacy. And the question of transparency? Unlike the UK's Covid-19 tracing app, Aarogya Setu is not open source, which means that it cannot be audited for security flaws by independent coders and researchers. A senior IT ministry official told a newspaper that the government had not made the source code of Aarogya Setu public because it ""feared that many will point to flaws in it and overburden the staff overseeing the app's development"". Mr Singh said ""all applications are made open source ultimately and the same is applicable to Aarogya Setu also"". Can you beat the system? To register, users have to give their name, gender, travel history, telephone number and location. ""People can fill the form incorrectly and the government cannot verify it, so the efficacy of the data is questionable,"" Mr Pahwa told the BBC. According to a Buzzfeedreport,external, an Indian software engineer had hacked the app to bypass the registration page, and even stopped the app from gathering data through GPS and Bluetooth. The report also mentioned a comment on Reddit suggesting phone wallpaper as a simple workaround to not downloading the app. ""The privacy conscious are likely to do this. Those who don't want to be forced to give their data to the government will look for and find workarounds. It could be by using a modified app or a screenshot, people will find ways,"" Mr Pahwa says. But Mr Singh argues that ""if one is staying home and not meeting anyone, it would not matter whether they have the app, or deleted it or switched the Bluetooth off or lied on self-assessment"".

US risks its 'darkest winter in modern history'The dire warning on coronavirus comes from a former top health official who says he was ousted.,"This video can not be played Ousted US vaccine supremo's dire warnings A former top US health official has told Congress the country could face its ""darkest winter in modern history"" because of the coronavirus. Rick Bright led the government agency trying to develop a vaccine, but was removed from his post last month. Mr Bright says he was ousted from the job after refusing to promote an untested drug treatment being touted as a ""game changer"" by President Trump. Mr Trump has claimed Mr Bright is a ""disgruntled"" employee. 'Ousted' US vaccine expert to file complaint Senate intelligence chief steps down for FBI probe How the pandemic is relaxing US drinking laws Mr Bright also told the House of Representatives subcommittee on health ""lives were lost"" because of government ""inaction"" in the early stages of the outbreak. He said he first spoke out about a medical equipment shortage in January, raising the issue to the ""highest levels"" of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but ""got no response"". In other US developments: A total of 85,807 people have now died with the coronavirus in the US.

During his testimony, Mr Bright warned that the US's ""window of opportunity"" to deal with the coronavirus was ""closing"". ""If we fail to improve our response now, based on science, I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged,"" he said. ""Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history."" Mr Bright also told the subcommittee that in January he received an email he would ""never forget"", from a supplier of medical-grade face masks who warned of a severe shortage. ""He said... we need to act. And I pushed that forward to the highest level that I could of HHS - and got no response."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mr Bright said his removal from his post was the result of his insisting that money allocated by Congress to deal with the virus should be put ""into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit"". ""I spoke out then, and I am testifying today, because science - not politics or cronyism - must lead the way to combat this deadly virus,"" he added. A whistleblower complaint, filed earlier this month, says Mr Bright was removed from his post as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) for political reasons. Mr Bright says he was ousted for refusing to push the drugs hydroxychloroquine and the related chloroquine as potential cures for Covid-19. This video can not be played Reality Check debunks coronavirus claims by politicians President Trump had referred to hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, as a potential ""game-changer"" in the treatment of Covid-19 - despite many experts cautioning that it could be ineffective or even dangerous. Research conducted by the Veterans Health Administration in the US which has been submitted for expert review suggests the drug gave no benefits for those taking it, and could actually raise the risk of death for patients in US veterans hospitals. Why a drug to treat malaria is selling out around the world Mr Bright's complaint alleges that he chose to speak to a journalist because government officials ""refused to listen"" to his warnings. He said he had an obligation to try and protect the public ""from drugs which he believed constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety"". After the hearing, President Trump told reporters: ""I don't know him. I never met him. I don't want to meet him. ""But I watched him, and he looks like an angry, disgruntled employee who, frankly, according to some people, didn't do a very good job."" Health secretary Alex Azar claimed officials had followed Mr Bright's recommendations. ""Everything he was complaining about was achieved - what he talked about was done,"" Mr Azar said. ""He said he talked about the need for respirators. We procured respirators at the president's direction. He said we need a Manhattan Project on a vaccine. We had a Manhattan Project.""

"Academy trust will open all its schools on 1 JuneOpposition to reopening schools is ""rather middle class"" claims head of academy trust.","Doctors have backed teachers' unions by saying Covid-19 infection rates are too high for England's schools to reopen. The British Medical Association said teachers and heads were ""absolutely right"" to urge caution and prioritise testing to avoid a second spike. It comes after teachers' unions met the government's scientific and medical advisers to express concerns about the planned phased reopening from 1 June. The NASUWT union said no school should reopen until it could show it was safe. England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted schools would only open their doors more widely when the conditions were right to do so, with the earliest date being 1 June. He said he had wanted to give head teachers and parents several weeks to plan for the event. This video can not be played Steve Chalke wants Oasis trust schools to reopen in June The governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have stepped back from setting a firm date. But since the prime minister announced there was to be a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, plans for the phased reopening from the beginning of next month seem to have hardened. After the meeting between the National Education Union and other teaching unions, and the government's top scientific advisers, Mr Williamson said schools would have all the ""guidance and support they will need"". However, teachers' unions say they still have ""unanswered questions"" about how pupils can be invited back and managed safely. When schools return they will have to introduce smaller classes and keep pupils apart NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said: ""No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak."" He added: ""No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided."" The British Medical Association said with so much ""conflicting"" evidence on opening schools, it was ""completely aligned"" with teachers' union calls to delay reopening. ""Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools,"" said a letter from the BMA's council chair. It added there was still too little clear evidence on the extent to which children were carriers of the disease, even though they usually got fewer and less serious symptoms than adults. Calls to publish scientific evidence for return to school Class sizes of no more than 15 when schools reopen How England is following Denmark's model for opening schools Speaking after the meeting NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney welcomed a promise to publish the scientific evidence on school reopening plans. But he called for a clarification over what thresholds would be used to judge if it was safe to open up. And he asked how it would be measured whether reopening increased the rate of infection in the wider community. His union is one of nine opposed to reopening schools on 1 June. But Mr Williamson said: ""I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June."" The DfE proposed teaching pupils in small groups of 15 or fewer and keeping them apart from other children during the school day to limit the spread of any infection, as well as maintaining good hygiene and hand washing. How do you social distance in schools? Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Do I have to send my children back to school? But one of England's biggest academy trusts has become one of the first school groups to say it will reopen from 1 June. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust which has 35 primary schools, says opposition to reopening fails to recognise the harm to disadvantaged children from missing school. Mr Chalke, whose schools on average have 45% of children eligible for free school meals, said: ""The greatest risks for many of our children are being stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise, little or no nutritious food."" Mr Chalke said the schools would not be ""forcing anyone to attend"", either pupils or staff, adding safety measures would be in place. But he stressed that the ""long-term social cost"" of not opening would ""outweigh any short-term medical risks"". Graham Gallagher and his wife Leanne have three young children with special needs. He says schools reopening on 1 June would ""benefit the whole family"", who live in a two-bedroom flat in Walsall in the West Midlands. He feels their children aren't getting a ""valuable learning experience"" at home and worry they could regress from the ""solid progress"" they have made during this school year. At home, the children struggle to concentrate for more than an hour at a time, and Leanne is struggling to manage the learning of all three children at once. Schools reopening would allow the children to learn and socialise in a distraction-free environment with more space and access to an outdoor area. He says the couple share teachers' concerns that they need to be ""properly protected"", and hopes ""plans will be put in place"" to alleviate their worries. LOCKDOWN:How are businesses coping? EVERYDAY HEROES:Stacey Dooley is on the hunt Primary school teacher Mary Newton, 49, says she ""feels very strongly"" that June is ""far too early"" to reopen schools. Her husband John, 56, who runs an educational books company, has been shielding at home after a recent heart attack and Mary says their children returning to school would be a concern for his health. They plan to keep their two children - who are in Years 4 and 6 - at home for as long as they can. She says it could be ""catastrophic"" for a child's mental health if they contracted the virus and transmitted it to a family member who became very ill from it. Children could be ""traumatised"" by the new rules that would have to be adhered to and staff would be anxious, she adds. ""I believe schools should continue to support children of key workers and those most vulnerable"", she says, ""but I certainly won't be sending my Year 6 child back to school in June"".

'Make or break' moment to prevent PTSD,"Dr Rony Berrebi says fear is a big factor for many staff NHS staff are at risk of high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder if they don't get the right support as the coronavirus outbreak subsides, health service adviser Prof Neil Greenberg has said. For now there's a national focus on health and care workers. Public billboards praise them, millions turn out on the street for a weekly round of applause and volunteers have been rushing to help in any way they can. But the height of the crisis is when many staff will be in coping mode. It's when things slow down - and the clapping stops - that, psychologists believe, the real risk of difficulties will arise. People may need months or even years of ""active monitoring"" of their mental health after things return to some semblance of normality, according to Prof Greenberg, a world-leading expert in trauma at King's College London. The NHS in England is providing crisis support to its staff. But it hasn't produced a formal long-term plan to offer extra psychological services in the aftermath of the pandemic. .Coronavirus: Mental health hotline for NHS staff An invisible wound for health workers and soldiers As the crisis passes its peak, there is an ""urgent"" need to work out how staff calling new NHS mental health hotlines can be referred on to specialist services, says Dr Michael Bloomfield, a psychiatrist at University College London (UCL) and Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust's traumatic stress clinic. The clinic was set up as a result of the King's Cross Station fire in 1987, which killed 31 people and injured 100, and specialises in helping people following events like terror attacks. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Studies after the Sars outbreak found about 10% of health staff had PTSD, and many more had other signs of psychological distress. The British Psychological Society (BPS) points out that health workers are highly resilient people who are used to dealing with difficult and sometimes traumatic situations. But this current crisis has particular risk factors - including fear for staff's own and their families' health and the loss of informal support networks because of social distancing and working outside their usual teams. Dr Rony Berrebi, an intensive care consultant in London, says: ""People are scared. I think the fear factor is massive."" ""Imagine going to work every day and coming back home knowing the virus could be in your hair, your clothes, your shoes, or you might be brewing it,"" he says. It's what happens after the trauma that is ""most predictive of what people will be like in terms of their mental health"",  according to Prof Greenberg. How well people are supported and how much stress they're put under as they try to recover can make or break whether someone manages well or develops far more serious difficulties including PTSD. ""If we muck it up then that's going to make the trauma they've already had much more difficult to deal with,"" he says. Many staff have lost their support networks - some have even moved out of their homes to protect family members At the height of the crisis, evidence suggests good leadership from managers and support from peers are the most helpful things. Psychologists expect the real demand for more structured mental health support to come later. Dr Julie Highfield, a clinical psychologist in an intensive care unit who is involved in putting together national guidance through the BPS, says she doesn't expect the NHS hotline to be used very much during the ""active period when everyone's just trying to cope moment to moment"". She is concerned to stress the NHS shouldn't see this lack of demand as a general lack of need. ""What's really needed long-term is an 18-month to two-year recovery period,"" with access to counselling and trauma-focused therapy, she says. Dr Berrebi has made a music video to raise funds for counselling for front-line workers Some therapy can be accessed now through in-house psychological services - but provision across the UK is ""patchy"", says Dr Highfield. She would like the NHS to commit to a shared ""minimum response"". Dr Berrebi says his hospital has in-house psychologists but thinks some of his colleagues are not aware that it's available or how to access it. He's made a music video to raise funds for counselling for front-line workers. Some resist comparing intensive care units to the battlefield. But Prof Greenberg, who has worked for decades with the military on the mental health of personnel, says NHS staff should be treated like soldiers after tours - with time off and a gradual return to normal work. National mental health director Claire Murdoch said NHS England is offering mental health care and support ""within trusts, and new text, online and telephone support services"". The Scottish government has launched a ""national wellbeing hub"" where staff can access online resources, which it says has been created by ""trauma and other specialists"". This is designed to ""respond to the current pandemic and to help provide long-term support to staff,"" a spokesperson said. Northern Ireland's plan outlines support for both the ""active"" phase and the ""recovery"" phase, including access to ""evidenced-based psychological therapies for those with ongoing difficulties"" and team-based reflection. While in Wales, Â£1m has been put aside to provide support services including for PTSD. A number of voluntary schemes have also been set up to provide therapy for NHS staff, in an attempt to fill the gaps. Some, like Project 5 and Frontline-19, require volunteers to be accredited, highly vetted and commit to a minimum number of sessions. But this commitment varies. Prof Greenberg says some voluntary schemes are really good, but the quality varies: ""Some follow evidence-based guidelines, but some are, to be fair very well-intentioned, but often not very well put together. ""It would be quite dangerous to allow a proliferation of well-meaning charities, which might distract or detract people from going and getting the right care."" And people may not want to access these services now, but later - at which point well-meaning volunteers may well have had to return to their day jobs. Kate Perry, a psychologist volunteering for Frontline-19, says she is committed to providing free care in the longer-term: ""It's very clear - you take someone into practice and treat them as you would a paying client, for as long as they need it."" Trauma experts are particularly concerned about schemes that offer just one session or those that do not carefully vet volunteers' qualifications. This would be a concern, Dr Bloomfield says, because ""some interventions can interfere with the natural healing process and make PTSD more likely"".

Academy trust will open all its schools on 1 June,"Doctors have backed teachers' unions by saying Covid-19 infection rates are too high for England's schools to reopen. The British Medical Association said teachers and heads were ""absolutely right"" to urge caution and prioritise testing to avoid a second spike. It comes after teachers' unions met the government's scientific and medical advisers to express concerns about the planned phased reopening from 1 June. The NASUWT union said no school should reopen until it could show it was safe. England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted schools would only open their doors more widely when the conditions were right to do so, with the earliest date being 1 June. He said he had wanted to give head teachers and parents several weeks to plan for the event. This video can not be played Steve Chalke wants Oasis trust schools to reopen in June The governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have stepped back from setting a firm date. But since the prime minister announced there was to be a gradual lifting of lockdown measures, plans for the phased reopening from the beginning of next month seem to have hardened. After the meeting between the National Education Union and other teaching unions, and the government's top scientific advisers, Mr Williamson said schools would have all the ""guidance and support they will need"". However, teachers' unions say they still have ""unanswered questions"" about how pupils can be invited back and managed safely. When schools return they will have to introduce smaller classes and keep pupils apart NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said: ""No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak."" He added: ""No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided."" The British Medical Association said with so much ""conflicting"" evidence on opening schools, it was ""completely aligned"" with teachers' union calls to delay reopening. ""Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools,"" said a letter from the BMA's council chair. It added there was still too little clear evidence on the extent to which children were carriers of the disease, even though they usually got fewer and less serious symptoms than adults. Calls to publish scientific evidence for return to school Class sizes of no more than 15 when schools reopen How England is following Denmark's model for opening schools Speaking after the meeting NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney welcomed a promise to publish the scientific evidence on school reopening plans. But he called for a clarification over what thresholds would be used to judge if it was safe to open up. And he asked how it would be measured whether reopening increased the rate of infection in the wider community. His union is one of nine opposed to reopening schools on 1 June. But Mr Williamson said: ""I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June."" The DfE proposed teaching pupils in small groups of 15 or fewer and keeping them apart from other children during the school day to limit the spread of any infection, as well as maintaining good hygiene and hand washing. How do you social distance in schools? Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Do I have to send my children back to school? But one of England's biggest academy trusts has become one of the first school groups to say it will reopen from 1 June. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust which has 35 primary schools, says opposition to reopening fails to recognise the harm to disadvantaged children from missing school. Mr Chalke, whose schools on average have 45% of children eligible for free school meals, said: ""The greatest risks for many of our children are being stuck in a council block, with no fresh air, no exercise, little or no nutritious food."" Mr Chalke said the schools would not be ""forcing anyone to attend"", either pupils or staff, adding safety measures would be in place. But he stressed that the ""long-term social cost"" of not opening would ""outweigh any short-term medical risks"". Graham Gallagher and his wife Leanne have three young children with special needs.

"Minister 'opens door' for football returnThe plans should include ""widening access for fans to view live coverage"" the culture secretary says.BBC Sport","The Premier League hopes to resume again on 12 June The government says it is ""opening the door"" for the return of professional football in England in June. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said Thursday's meeting with the Football Association, Premier League and English Football League had ""progressed plans"". He added that plans for the sport to resume should ""include widening access for fans to view live coverage"". Meanwhile, England's deputy chief medical officer said any return would be ""slow"" and ""measured"". The Premier League met on Monday to discuss ""Project Restart"" and hopes for a return to action on 12 June, with matches played behind closed doors. ""We all agreed that we will only go ahead if it is safe to do so and the health and welfare of players, coaches and staff comes first,"" said Dowden. ""It is now up to the football authorities to agree and finalise the detail of their plans, and there is combined goodwill to achieve this for their fans, the football community and the nation as a whole. ""The government and our medical experts will continue to offer guidance and support."" He added that plans to return should ""ensure finances from the game's resumption supportsÂ the wider football family"". The next meeting of Premier League clubs will take place on Monday, when top-flight players may return to initial group training under social distancing protocols. Footballers have so far been limited to individual training but Premier League bosses hope a first phase of team training, under strict guidelines and restricted to 75 minutes, can begin next week. Premier League clubs facing Â£340m TV refund even if season resumes Restrictions in place for team training under 'Project Restart' Premier League clubs confident neutral venues stance to be reversed England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said: ""There will be small, carefully measured, step-wise approaches to see what can be achieved safely. The first of those is to return safely to training, still observing social distancing. ""We will have to see how that goes before we can even think about moving on to the return of competitive football matches."" Monday's meeting will come after a weekend when the Bundesliga, Germany's top flight, becomes the first major league to restart. Bundesliga: What you need to know about this season The Premier League has been suspended since 13 March because of the Covid-19 pandemic and most teams have nine fixtures left to play. Brighton had a third player test positive for coronavirus earlier in May and boss Graham Potter is wary about a return to action. ""We are in uncharted territory. It's a hugely complex situation,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to call one day to the next. The general will from all the clubs is to play out the season as close to the format as possible. Whatever date that is remains to be seen. ""We are sanitising the environment. The players are not coming in for any length of time. ""It will be as safe as it is made to be. The challenge will be when [we have] contact, larger groups and different teams. We need to see where we are on Monday and then Tuesday."" He added:  ""There are concerns, of course. We have come out of lockdown. The situation is not totally resolved. ""I have a young family. My wife's family has health issues. We are human beings."" Meanwhile, the Premier League confirmed clubs had decided that short-term contract extensions could be agreed with players whose deals run out on 30 June, with the season set to go beyond that date. Clubs and players will now have until 23 June to agree extensions which run until whenever the campaign is scheduled to finish. Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said it was decided ""to ensure as far as possible that clubs complete the season with the same squad they had available prior to the suspension of the campaign"". Elsewhere,six League One clubshave united to express their determination to finish the season. Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has released a statement on behalf of Posh, Oxford, Sunderland, Fleetwood, Portsmouth and Ipswich. League One clubs are due to meet with the EFL board on Friday to discuss options for completing the season. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor The fact the government summoned the three football bodies to a meeting together tells its own story. Ministers want football to think collectively during this crisis, and act in the interests of the whole game. And to understand that any government financial bailouts for the sport are highly unlikely. The Premier League was reminded that if its season does resume next month, it will be expected to do what it can for clubs in the EFL and for grassroots football. And to ensure that, while honouring contracts with its broadcast partners, as many matches as possible are shown free to air, so that as many people as possible can watch them. With the Premier League lobbying government to scrap the idea of neutral stadiums to keep their clubs happy, ministers are now asking for something in return. It was significant today that despite continued police concerns over the risk of fans gathering outside grounds once matches resume, the government reinforced its support for the resumption of matches. But it also warned that games will only take place if the phased return to training goes to plan, and the sense is that 'Project Restart' still hangs in the balance.

US risks its 'darkest winter in modern history'The dire warning on coronavirus comes from a former top health official who says he was ousted.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Ousted US vaccine supremo's dire warnings A former top US health official has told Congress the country could face its ""darkest winter in modern history"" because of the coronavirus. Rick Bright led the government agency trying to develop a vaccine, but was removed from his post last month. Mr Bright says he was ousted from the job after refusing to promote an untested drug treatment being touted as a ""game changer"" by President Trump. Mr Trump has claimed Mr Bright is a ""disgruntled"" employee. 'Ousted' US vaccine expert to file complaint Senate intelligence chief steps down for FBI probe How the pandemic is relaxing US drinking laws Mr Bright also told the House of Representatives subcommittee on health ""lives were lost"" because of government ""inaction"" in the early stages of the outbreak. He said he first spoke out about a medical equipment shortage in January, raising the issue to the ""highest levels"" of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but ""got no response"".

During his testimony, Mr Bright warned that the US's ""window of opportunity"" to deal with the coronavirus was ""closing"". ""If we fail to improve our response now, based on science, I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged,"" he said. ""Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history."" Mr Bright also told the subcommittee that in January he received an email he would ""never forget"", from a supplier of medical-grade face masks who warned of a severe shortage. ""He said... we need to act. And I pushed that forward to the highest level that I could of HHS - and got no response."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mr Bright said his removal from his post was the result of his insisting that money allocated by Congress to deal with the virus should be put ""into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit"". ""I spoke out then, and I am testifying today, because science - not politics or cronyism - must lead the way to combat this deadly virus,"" he added. A whistleblower complaint, filed earlier this month, says Mr Bright was removed from his post as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) for political reasons. Mr Bright says he was ousted for refusing to push the drugs hydroxychloroquine and the related chloroquine as potential cures for Covid-19. This video can not be played Reality Check debunks coronavirus claims by politicians President Trump had referred to hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, as a potential ""game-changer"" in the treatment of Covid-19 - despite many experts cautioning that it could be ineffective or even dangerous. Research conducted by the Veterans Health Administration in the US which has been submitted for expert review suggests the drug gave no benefits for those taking it, and could actually raise the risk of death for patients in US veterans hospitals. Why a drug to treat malaria is selling out around the world Mr Bright's complaint alleges that he chose to speak to a journalist because government officials ""refused to listen"" to his warnings. He said he had an obligation to try and protect the public ""from drugs which he believed constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety"". After the hearing, President Trump told reporters: ""I don't know him. I never met him. I don't want to meet him. ""But I watched him, and he looks like an angry, disgruntled employee who, frankly, according to some people, didn't do a very good job."" Health secretary Alex Azar claimed officials had followed Mr Bright's recommendations. ""Everything he was complaining about was achieved - what he talked about was done,"" Mr Azar said. ""He said he talked about the need for respirators. We procured respirators at the president's direction. He said we need a Manhattan Project on a vaccine. We had a Manhattan Project.""

Guardian Soulmates to close next month,"The Guardian is closing its online dating service Guardian Soulmates because it is ""no longer viable"". The service, which has about 35,000 free members and paid subscribers, will close at the end of June, it said. The ""online dating landscape has changed dramatically"" since it launched in 2004, it added - making it a ""very little fish in a very big pool"". The 15 years since its launch has seen the growth of global dating apps such as Tinder, Hinge and Bumble. Guardian Soulmates said on its website: ""There are so many dating apps now, so many ways to meet people, which are often free and very quick. ""To keep up with the changing times we'd need to invest heavily in new technology and develop a new way of operating, and it's just not viable."" Membership to the site is free, but it has seen about a 40% fall in the number of paid subscribers - with access to advanced search and messaging options - over the past six years.

Dorries told to check 'validity' of postsMinister who shared false allegations about Labour leader told to be more responsible by Tory bosses.UK Politics,"Nadine Dorries has deleted the post from her Twitter timeline Health minister Nadine Dorries and two other Tory MPs have been ordered to ""check the validity"" of social media posts before sharing them. Party bosses spoke to the MPs after they retweeted false allegations about Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Sir Keir said he was satisfied with the actions taken by the party and the MPs, who have deleted the tweets. ""There are more important things in the world to concentrate on than a doctored video of me,"" he added. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""These tweets have rightly been deleted. ""The MPs involved have been spoken to by the Whips' Office and reminded of their responsibility to check the validity of information before they post on social media sites."" As director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013, Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service, the body that decides whether or not to prosecute someone accused of a crime. The clip shared by Ms Dorries and fellow Tory MPs Maria Caulfield and Lucy Allan was from a 2013 Channel 5 interview with Sir Keir. In it, he appeared to be listing a series of reasons for not bringing charges against grooming gangs - including if the alleged victims had been in trouble with the police, or had been abusing drink or drugs. But the clip does not include the reporter's question, which asks Sir Keir about the incorrect use of guidelines being used by the authorities in the reporting and investigating of child sexual abuse allegations. As can be seen fromthe full exchange,external, Sir Keir was talking about how the police wrongly applied the guidelines, and how police culture had to change. Ms Dorries retweeted the edited clip and allegations against Sir Keir, from the right-wing @NJamesWorld account, with the one word comment ""revealing"". Labour MP and shadow Treasury minister Wes Streeting replied: ""What's revealing is that: 1. You've spread fake news and indulged a smear being promoted by the far right. 2. You had time to do this despite being a minister in the Department of Health during a public health crisis. ""It's either malevolence or stupidity. Probably both."" Former senior prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who was involved in bringing a number of cases, said the clip was being used to suggest Sir Keir did not take child sexual abuse seriously, when the opposite was true. ""As national lead, I can assure you that he and I put right the failings of a generation of those who should have safeguarded children. He inherited failure and left success,"" he tweeted. Earlier, a Labour Party source said: ""This is a doctored video tweeted by a far-right social media account. ""As a government minister, we hope Nadine Dorries acknowledges this and takes it down."" The edited video was viewed more than 239,000 times before the @NJamesWorld account was suspended. Ms Caulfield subsequently locked her Twitter account. while Ms Dorries and Ms Allan both deleted their tweets.
