What to expect at the Democratic convention,"Joe Biden will be the official Democratic nominee once he is formally chosen by party delegates Balloons. Confetti. Signs. Big hats. It's the moment US election enthusiasts have been waiting four years for. It's convention season. We've reached the final night of the Democratic National Convention - and Joe Biden has been crowned as the party's presidential nominee. Of course this year, things are looking a bit different. Here's everything you need to know about this year's convention, Covid-19 changes and all. Officially, it's being held in a convention centre in Milwaukee, in the Midwestern state of Wisconsin, from Monday 17 August to Thursday 20 August. But Covid-19 restrictions and concerns mean that the only people attending in-person are those necessary to orchestrating the event. Instead of 50,000 people gathering for the traditional calendar with days full of speeches, receptions and rallies, sessions are being streamed from the Democratic Party's social media channels and aired live on most US news channels from 21:00 to 23:00 EDT each night. Thursday night's jam-packed schedule will include: A speech from Mr Biden, accepting the party's presidential nomination Appearances from several ex-2020 contenders, like former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana Speeches from California Governor Gavin Newsom, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, and Wisconsin Senator Tammy Duckworth, the first openly-gay woman elected to Congress Performances by singer John Legend, hip hop star Common, and country pop band The Chicks It is where the Democratic Party comes together to formally name - and hype up - their candidates. You may be thinking, ""wasn't Joe Biden already the nominee?"" Yes - and no. Before the convention he was certainly the presumptive Democratic candidate, but it wasn't until the ceremonial roll call on Tuesday that he was officially anointed. Biden is crowned as Democratic nominee Party members will also unveil the 2020 Democratic platform, the list of party values and policy priorities which they believe distinguish them from their rival Republicans.

How you can be US president without winning most votes The old normal: A lot of people all in one place, on the final day of the 2016 Democratic convention Mr Biden will not be in Wisconsin. The presidential nominee will be dialling in from his home state of Delaware, and he'll deliver his speech from the Chase Center, in Wilmington. That's also where Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential pick, gave her acceptance speech on Wednesday. He's already had appearances on the first two nights though. On Monday he led a recorded conversation on race with politicians and activists, and on Tuesday he joined his wife Jill for her speech. Where Joe Biden stands on the key issues Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders addressed the virtual crowds on Monday night. Former President Bill Clinton was the headline act on Tuesday. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Former president Barack Obama took a primetime slot on Wednesday night, as did Hillary Clinton, Mr Obama's former secretary of state and the Democrats' presidential nominee in 2016. This political convention won't look like any we've seen before but the stakes are as high as ever. Here's what I'm looking out for: Biden as the anti-Trump:First and foremost, this is Joe Biden's moment in the spotlight. He will attack President Trump not only for his policies - which he says have ""left the US in tatters"" - but for his behaviour in the White House. Biden frames this election as a ""fight for the soul of the nation"" and will present himself as the candidate who can unite and heal America. Signs of weakness:There have been doubts, encouraged by his political adversaries, that the 77-year-old has lost a step in recent years. He's traditionally been a compelling public speaker, and Democrats will be hoping he can rise to the moment and put doubts to rest about his endurance and abilities. An appeal to multiple audiences:Biden will use the convention to appeal to a national audience tuning into the campaign for the first time - especially independents and moderate Republicans - but he also needs to energise the base, including those on the left of the party. Barack Obama was the last Democrat to build a winning coalition - with the former president, and his wife Michelle, closing out two nights, his campaign clearly hopes some of the Obama magic rubs off. The rising stars:While Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate has made her an heir apparent, there are other names on the speaking schedule who might someday challenge her. That includes a gaggle of governors, such as New York's Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom of California, five of Biden's 2020 campaign rivals and several members of his vice-presidential short list. Then there's Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who at 30 is still several cycles away from a possible presidential bid but is already a power in the progressive wing of the party. Will any of them follow in the steps of then-state senator Obama in 2004, and seize the moment? Not to worry - you'll hear from ordinary, relatable Americans too. Planners have promised ""fewer people behind podiums - and more people in living rooms, on factory floors, at small businesses, and in schools and town squares"". Alicia Keys performed at the 2016 Democratic convention This line-up includes educators, gun safety advocates, healthcare workers and even some former Republicans. We've heard from a Pennsylvania farmer, Rick Telesz, who voted for Trump in 2016, but changed his mind after his family farm suffered amid the president's trade war. Another highlighted voice this year is gun safety advocate DeAndra Dycus, an Indiana mother whose 13-year-old son was shot and injured at a birthday party. It's rare, though not unprecedented, to have members of the other party show up. This time, former Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican and Trump critic, addressed the convention on Monday. Another Republican, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, spoke on Tuesday. They represent moderate conservatives unhappy with the direction the president has taken the Republican Party. If you've been following along with the primary election season so far, you know why the nomination vote was a formality for Biden. After a shaky start in the primary elections when each party picks its candidate, he convincingly won the race ahead of Bernie Sanders. Delegates from across the US formally vote at the convention for the candidate that won their state's Democratic primary election or caucus. Usually delegates are in the convention hall when they vote, but this year it was what planners described was a ""re-imagined roll call process"" taking viewers to all 57 states and territories. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? As for those delegates who were promised to other candidates who've since withdrawn from the race, they're free to vote as they will. If you want to know more about the delegate system, you can read about it inour guide to primaries and caucuses. Don't worry, convention season isn't over yet. We've got the Republican National Convention coming up from August 24-27, though the pandemic has upended plans for that, too. After that, presidential campaigning will be in full force until the general election on 3 November. Make a note in your calendars for the debates, too. The first presidential debate is scheduled for 29 September, with two more in October. The US election process can be confusing. The BBC is here to help make sense of it.

How could Kamala help - or hurt - Joe Biden,"Sometimes the obvious pick is obvious for a reason. Kamala Harris was the front-runner to be Joe Biden's running mate pretty much since the moment the presumptive Democratic nominee announced in March that he would pick a woman to be on his ticket. She was a safe pick and a practical one. She's also now in the position to be the heir apparent for the Democratic Party - whether it's in four years because Biden loses in November or doesn't run for re-election or eight years if Biden serves two full terms. That could be why it seemed that there were so many attempts to knock Harris down a peg, or advance alternative candidates over the past month. This was, in effect, the first fight of the next presidential nomination contest, and Harris - whose ambitions are clear - now has a step on the competition. But determining future Democratic nominees is a battle for another day. The pressing concern for the party at the moment is how Harris might help Biden win the White House. Here are some strengths she brings to the ticket and, perhaps, some concerns Democrats may have. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots To put it bluntly, today's Democratic Party doesn't look like Joe Biden. It's young and it's ethnically diverse. It was increasingly obvious that the presumptive nominee needed to find someone younger and, well, less white to have a ticket that reflects the people who will vote for it. Harris, whose father was Jamaican and mother came from India, fills this particular need. She becomes both the first black woman and the first Asian to run on a major party presidential ticket. And although at 55 years old she's not exactly young, when compared to 77-year-old Joe Biden, she's downright spry. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? On Tuesday afternoon, before she was announced as Biden's pick, Harris tweeted about the need for diversity in the leadership of the party. ""Black women and women of color have long been underrepresented in elected office and in November we have an opportunity to change that,"" she wrote. It turns out Harris could be directly responsible for some of that change. One of the traditional roles of a vice-presidential running mate is to get down and dirty with the opposition. While the person at the top of the ticket takes the rhetorical high road, the number-two cracks out the brass knuckles for the opposition. In 2008, Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, more than lived up to her nickname, Sarah the Barracuda, for instance. If this is a duty that falls on Harris, history suggests she will be up to the task. Biden certainly recalls that it was Harris who went after him with gusto during the first Democratic primary debate in July 2019, criticisinghis opposition to bussing to end segregation in public schools. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Harris has also proven to be a very determined and aggressive interrogator during her time in the US Senate. Donald Trump clearly remembers this, as he remarked on Tuesday evening that he thought Harris was ""extraordinarily nasty"" to his second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Trump may not like it, but nasty may be exactly what Biden is looking for this autumn. One thing politicians who have run for national office have said time and time again is that it's impossible to understand the intense pressure such campaigns create until one has actually been in one. Although Harris's 2020 presidential bid was unsuccessful, and she dropped out before most of her competitors, she still knows what it's like to be under such scrutiny. When she launched her campaign before tens of thousands of supporters in January 2019, she was treated like a top-tier presidential contender. For a time in July, after her strong first debate performance, she rose towards the top of some primary polls. Harris has been through the fire, at least for a time, and knows what it feels like. If there were serious, dinosaur-sized skeletons in her closet, they would have come out by now. Given that she's already sought the presidency, its not impossible for many Americans to imagine her as president someday. The California senator may not have been the most dynamic candidate on the campaign trail in 2019, and she was certainly not nearly the most successful one, but at this point she's a known quantity. And for Biden,who is currently up in the polls, the fewer surprises the rest of the campaign the better. More than almost any of the other contenders for the vice-presidential spot, Harris comes from a law-enforcement background. Given the recent demonstrations over police brutality and allegations of institutional racism in law enforcement, Harris's resume may give some progressives within the Democratic Party pause. It certainly did during Harris's presidential campaign, when ""Harris is a cop"" was a derisive accusation thrown at the California senator on more than one occasion. This video can not be played President Trump calls Kamala Harris ""meanest"" US senator Both as San Francisco district attorney and as California's attorney general, Harris has sided with police over suspects - even in cases where those suspects may have been wrongfully convicted. Although she's expressed personal opposition to the death penalty, she's supported its use while she's been in office. Being a hard-nosed crime-fighter may be an attractive attribute among independent and conservative-leaning voters in the general election, but if that support comes at the cost of enthusiasm for the Biden-Harris ticket on the left, then it may not be a net positive. Since the death of George Floyd, Harris has been outspoken in advocating law-enforcement reform, winning praise from some progressives. But it's safe to say they still harbour some doubts. Above, Harris having run a presidential campaign was noted as a mark in her favour. There's a flip side to that, however. Her campaign, while it started with a bang and had its moments, also had some serious flaws - and some of those flaws related to the candidate herself. Although Harris has a pretty moderate record as a senator and state attorney general, she tried to tack to the left during her presidential campaign. She came out in favour of free college education, the Green New Deal environmental programme and universal healthcare, for instance, but never sounded all that convincing about it. Mr Biden tells Ms Harris she will be his running mate on Tuesday She particularly got tripped up on the question of whether private insurance should be banned - which, while fine with progressives, gives many moderate heartburn. ""Let's eliminate all of that,"" she said rather glibly during one interview. ""Let's move on."" In this day and age, the death knell for politicians is to seem too political - to be perceived as willing to shift values and beliefs based on what the voters want. Sincerity, or at least the appearance of it, is a virtue voters prize  - and part of the reason why Donald Trump became president. While his supporters didn't always agree with him, they felt like he speaks his mind. Harris's move from moderate, then to the left and now back, perhaps, to the Biden middle could leave some voters wondering where her core values lie - or if she has any core values at all.

Dwayne Johnson is highest-paid male actor,"Dwayne Johnson - commonly known by his wrestling name ""the Rock"" - earned $87.5m in a year Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson has been named the highest-paid male actor for a second year in a row, according to wealth magazine Forbes. The former wrestler reportedly earned $87.5m (Â£67m) between 1 June 2019 and 1 June 2020, including $23.5m for the Netflix thriller Red Notice. He also made money from his fitness clothing line, Project Rock. The 10 top earners combined made $545.5m this year - more than a quarter of that from Netflix, Forbes said. Johnson's Red Notice co-star Ryan Reynolds was the second-highest paid actor, with earnings of $71.5m. Among his movie deals were $20m, also for Red Notice, and $20m for Six Underground, another Netflix film. Third on the list was actor and producer Mark Wahlberg, who earned $58m, while Ben Affleck came in fourth and Vin Diesel fifth. Akshay Kumar was the only Bollywood actor in the top ten Indian actor Akshay Kumar was the only Bollywood star in the top 10. He came in sixth place with earnings of $48.5m, which Forbes said mostly came from product endorsement deals. The Rock ranks as Instagram's 'most valuable star' WWE: The Rock's daughter steps into the ring Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's father dies aged 75 Also on the list were Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, actors Will Smith and Adam Sandler, and veteran movie star Jackie Chan. The highest-paid actresses for the same period are released as a separate list, and are yet to be announced. Last year, Scarlett Johansson topped that list with an income of $56m - less than that year's seventh-placed actor.

Scottish school pupils have results upgraded,"Some pupils held protests against the downgrading Tens of thousands of school pupils are to have their exam results upgraded after the Scottish government agreed to accept teacher estimates of scores. The government U-turn follows an outcry from pupils after a moderation system saw 125,000 estimated results being downgraded. All results that were downgraded will now be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates. The move affects about 75,000 pupils across Scotland. There had been claims that the moderation system unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed as well. And many pupils said they had been given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams at the start of the year. Sturgeon 'sorry' over Scottish exam results Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland How grades were worked out for Scottish pupils Education Secretary John Swinney said he was sorry for the ""feeling of unfairness"" caused by the downgrading, adding that it was ""deeply regrettable we got this wrong"". Mr Swinney and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had both previously argued that basing grades on teacher estimates alone would damage the credibility of this year's results compared to previous years. Opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament are pushing for a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney, with Labour and the Conservatives calling for him to quit. This video can not be played Mr Swinney said 'all downgraded results will be withdrawn' The coronavirus lockdown saw all of Scotland's school exams cancelled for the first time ever, with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) drawing up a new system to calculate results. This was to be based on teacher estimates for each of their individual pupils, based on their work during the school year. But these estimates were then fed through an SQA moderation system, which downgraded the marks handed out by teachers to bring them closer in line with previous years. This sparked an outcry from students, particularly when it emerged that the Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds wasreduced by 15.2 percentage points,external, but only by 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Swinney both insisted last week that it would not be credible to base the results on teacher estimates alone Mr Swinney accepted there was ""clear anger and frustration from young people and their families"" about this, saying it had ""left many young people feeling their future had been determined by statistical modelling rather than their own ability"". He said he would now direct the SQA to reissue grades ""based solely on teacher or lecturer judgement"". Fresh certificates will be issued and the university admissions body informed of the changes so applications can be processed. A review of what has gone wrong will also be held, as well as a longer-term study of how future qualifications should balance exams and teacher assessments. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously said that accepting teacher estimates without moderation would lead to an exceptionally high pass rate compared to previous years, which she said would not be ""credible"". And Mr Swinney said last week that he believed teachers were often ""optimistic and aspirational"" about their pupils' abilities, while an exam system ""does something different"". This year's Higher pass rate will now sit at 89.2%, up 14.4 percentage points on 2019, while the Advanced Higher pass rate is at 93.1%, up 13.7 points from the previous year. At Ms Sturgeon's coronavirus briefing on Tuesday, she said she now believed concerns about the credibility of the unusually high pass rate were outweighed by the risk of students thinking the system was ""stacked against them"". Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended A Motherwell pupil whose dream of becoming a doctor appeared to have been shattered by downgraded Higher results will now get the five As that she needed. Olivia Biggartbelieved she was downgradedto two As and three Bs because her school is in a deprived area. The 16-year-old said she cheered atJohn Swinney's announcementthat she would now get her original estimated grades. She will now be able to apply for medical school in October. ""I am over the moon because finally there is justice and I can pursue my career,"" she said. ""I am happy with what he said - and glad he apologised to us."" Read more here Labour are pushing for a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney, likely to be held at Holyrood later in the week. The party's education spokesman Iain Gray said Mr Swinney had left students ""twisting in the wind for a week"", and urged him to ""take full responsibility for it happening in the first place and resign"". Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene said Mr Swinney's statement had been ""the longest resignation speech in history, minus the resignation"", and Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the education secretary was ""part of the problem, not the solution"". The Scottish Greens said Mr Swinney had ""refused to listen"" to earlier concerns, but welcomed that he had met the conditions the party had set for backing him in any confidence vote - likely securing his future. This decision in Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK - where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotland's students are given higher grades based on teachers' predictions, how will it be fair if they're competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly-boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupils' results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. And it raises the question which is more important, fairness for the individual, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotland's change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK - but like turning an ethical Rubik cube - any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England using teachers' predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average there will be some teachers who have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities that could fill court rooms for years. Until now England's Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised.

Airline refunds âstill too slowâ despite warning,"The couple have still not recovered their Â£1,742 David Hanson had to cancel a dream trip to New Zealand because of Covid-19 - but five months on he's still waiting for a refund. The Manchester man was due to fly in March with girlfriend Jemima Rodwell, but the flight with Emirates was cancelled with three days' notice when the Foreign Office advised against travel. ""I'm extremely frustrated, really angry just how they can get away with it in terms of being so long,"" he said. The airline, agency he used to book the flight, and his insurer have been little help, he said. And he's not alone in struggling to get money back months after cancelled plans. A new report by consumer group Which? says airlines are still taking too long to refund passengers. It comes after the airline regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, said last month that it was ""not satisfied"" that Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair or Tui were processing refunds quickly enough. Which? says that despite the intervention from the CAA, refunds are still too slow and airlines are ""falling short"" of promises made to the regulator. David and Jemima had booked their trip because she was maid of honour at her best friend's wedding. ""We had a full trip planned with the campervan, and then we were going to end up in Queensland for the wedding,"" he told the BBC. ""We had spent months planning, it was going to be a real dream trip. ""However, nearly five months later we are still yet to receive a refund on our flights totalling Â£1,742, which is a lot of money for us."" He said the couple had spent ""months and months"" chasing the booking agency, airline and their insurer but they ""seem to have got nowhere. ""You end up just feel really powerless."" The BBC has approached Emirates for comment. 'My once-in-lifetime holiday hasn't been refunded' 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?' The CAA's report last month said Ryanair was taking 10 weeks or even longer to process refunds and asked the airline to reduce that time. But Which? says that, despite promises, the airline is still taking months to process some refunds. Pupil support worker Kirsty Ness from Edinburgh was due to fly to Gdansk in Poland with her boyfriend in early April, just after schools broke up for Easter in Scotland. But Ryanair cancelled their flight because of the pandemic. Despite asking for a cash refund, Ms Ness says she was initially sent a voucher to rebook. After five phone calls and dozens of emails, Ms Ness says she finally received her money this week. ""As a low-paid key worker Â£126 is a lot of money not to have for five months,"" she told the BBC. Ryanair said it had issued more than Â£670m in refunds and had cleared over 90% of its claims backlog. Virgin Atlantic, meanwhile, made customers wait up to 120 days for a refund, the CAA said in its July report. It was the only airline threatened with action by the regulator, which reviewed the refund waiting times of 18 major airlines. But Which? said it had heard from two passengers who had been waiting for 130 days for a refund for flights cancelled in March. It said it had also heard from a Tui customer who had still not received a refund for travel cancelled in April. Tui said it now issued refunds automatically and normally processed cash refunds within two weeks. Virgin said it was ""very sorry"" that a ""small number"" of customers had to wait more than 120 days for a refund. Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? ""Time after time, Which? has exposed airlines breaking the law on refunds for cancelled flights due to the pandemic and treating their passengers unfairly, and we're concerned that they now feel empowered to do as they please without fear of punishment,"" said Rory Boland, Editor of Which? Travel. ""Passengers must be able to rely on a regulator that has effective powers to protect their rights - especially at a time of unprecedented turmoil,"" he said. Which? has called for the CAA to be given new powers to take action against airlines that are slow to refund passengers. ""The government needs to step up and ensure the CAA has the tools it needs to hold airlines to account, or risk consumer trust in the travel industry being damaged beyond repair,"" Mr Boland said. In a statement, a CAA spokesman said: ""While our initial review has concluded, we have been clear that we will continue to monitor performance closely and should any airline fall short of the commitments they have made to us, we will take further action as required."" The report from Which? comes as rail companies have called on the government to tax some flights more heavily. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators, says train companies should pay less tax on the electricity they use to power trains to encourage greener travel. The cost, they say, could be covered by airlines paying more tax on flights, possibly on routes which could be made by rail instead. But the demand has not gone down well with airlines, which say that the railways are heavily subsidised by the government.

Lawsuit over mystery of Tiger King star's husband,"Carole Baskin runs the Big Cat Rescue sanctuary Tiger King star Carole Baskin is facing a lawsuit from the family of her former husband Don Lewis, who disappeared in 1997 and is presumed dead. Lewis's family are also offering a $100,000 (Â£76,300) reward for information about what happened to him. A lawyer for the family has filed the lawsuit in an attempt to force Baskin to give evidence on the record. Lewis disappeared a day before a scheduled trip to Costa Rica, and was declared legally dead in 2002. Lewis and Baskin started an animal sanctuary together in Tampa, Florida, which later became Big Cat Rescue Corporation. They were married at the time of his disappearance, but he had filed for a restraining order against her two months earlier. Theories about what happened to him formed part of the hit Netflix series, including suggestions that Baskin, who received most of his $6m (Â£4.5m) estate, was responsible for his disappearance. She has vehemently denied having anything to do with it,external. ""The unsavoury lies are better for getting viewers,"" she has said. Tiger King: Missing husband's will is 'forgery' Tiger King zoo handed to rival Carole Baskin The rush to make Tiger King spin-offs and sequels Baskin told investigators of reported sightings in Costa Rica, and said he had been involved with local gangsters there. No-one has ever been arrested over his disappearance. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Lewis's youngest daughter Gale Rathbone referred to the renewed interest in the case brought on by the series. ""Amazingly, our little family tragedy has become your tragedy,"" she said. ""Our search for closure and truth has become your mission also. ""We all know by now that [Lewis] was not a perfect man. But do only the perfect among us deserve justice?"" Baskin told The Associated Press: ""It's been my policy not to discuss pending litigation until it's been resolved. ""I had told some news outlets that I thought the press conference on 10 Aug was just a publicity stunt, but at that time was not aware there would be pending litigation.""

New dinosaur related to T. rex discovered,"A CGI image has been created of an impression of the final moments of the Vectaerovenator inopinatus A new species of dinosaur has been discovered on the Isle of Wight. Palaeontologists at the University of Southampton believe four bones found at Shanklin last year belong to a new species of theropod dinosaur. It lived in the Cretaceous period, 115 million years ago, and is estimated to have been up to 4m (13ft) long. It has been named Vectaerovenator inopinatus and belongs to the group of dinosaurs that includes Tyrannosaurus rex and modern-day birds. The name refers to the large air spaces found in some of the bones - from the neck, back and tail of the creature - which is one of the traits that helped the scientists identify its theropod origins. These air sacs, also seen in modern birds, were extensions of the lung, and it is likely they ""helped fuel an efficient breathing system while also making the skeleton lighter"", the University of Southampton said. The dinosaur fossils were discovered on the beach at Shanklin The fossils were found in three separate discoveries in 2019 and handed in to the nearby Dinosaur Isle Museum at Sandown, where they are being displayed. Robin Ward, a regular fossil hunter from Stratford-upon-Avon, was visiting the Isle of Wight with his family when they made their discovery. ""The joy of finding the bones we discovered was absolutely fantastic,"" he said. James Lockyer, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, was also visiting the island when he found another of the bones. The four bones were found in three separate discoveries in 2019 ""It looked different from marine reptile vertebrae I have come across in the past,"" he said. ""I was searching a spot at Shanklin and had been told, and read, that I wouldn't find much there. ""However, I always make sure I search the areas others do not, and on this occasion it paid off."" Paul Farrell, from Ryde, added: ""I was walking along the beach, kicking stones and came across what looked like a bone from a dinosaur. ""I was really shocked to find out it could be a new species."" Chris Barker, who led the University of Southampton study, said: ""We were struck by just how hollow this animal was - it's riddled with air spaces. ""Parts of its skeleton must have been rather delicate. ""The record of theropod dinosaurs from the 'mid' Cretaceous period in Europe isn't that great, so it's been really exciting to be able to increase our understanding of the diversity of dinosaur species from this time. ""You don't usually find dinosaurs in the deposits at Shanklin as they were laid down in a marine habitat. You're much more likely to find fossil oysters or drift wood, so this is a rare find indeed."" It is likely that the Vectaerovenator lived in an area just north of where its remains were found, with the carcass having washed out into the shallow sea nearby. The university findings are due to be published in the journal Papers in Palaeontology and co-authored by those who discovered the fossils.

"Johnson warns 'long, long way to go' for UK economy","Boris Johnson has warned the UK has a ""long, long way to go"" before the economy improves, after official figures showed the largest drop in employment in over a decade. ""Clearly there are going to be bumpy months ahead and a long, long way to go,"" the Prime Minister said. However, he said parts of the economy were ""showing great resilience"". Between April and June, the number of people in work fell by 220,000, the Office for National Statistics said. The drop in the number of people employed was the largest quarterly decrease since May to July 2009, the depths of the financial crisis. Mr Johnson said he had ""absolutely no doubt"" that government schemes would ""help this country get through it"", adding: ""it will get through it stronger than ever before"". The youngest workers, oldest workers and those in manual occupations were the worst hit during the pandemic, the ONS added. The figures do not include the millions of people who are furloughed, those on zero-hours contracts but not getting shifts, or people on temporary unpaid leave from a job, as they still count as employed. As such, they do not capture the full impact of the pandemic. Similarly, the UK unemployment rate was estimated at 3.9%, largely unchanged on the year and the previous quarter. What is redundancy and what are my rights? How many people are looking for work? What jobs are available post-lockdown? Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""The groups of people most affected are younger workers, 24 and under, or older workers and those in more routine or less skilled jobs. ""This is concerning, as it's harder for these groups to find a new job or get into a job as easily as other workers."" The UK economy has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic, but unemployment has not surged as much as feared because large numbers of firms have furloughed staff. However, analysts said unemployment was set to worsen in coming months as the scheme wound down, warning of a looming ""cliff-edge"" and a ""lull before the storm"". From restaurants to retailers, many UK businesses are already planning job cutswith 140,000 redundancies announced in June alone. According to the ONS, the number of average hours worked continued to fall in April-June, reaching record lows both on the year and on the quarter. The number of people claiming universal credit - a benefit for those on low pay as well as unemployed people - rose to 2.7 million in July, up by 117% since March. Theatre technician Charlotte Baker, 29, is out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She started a new job at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon in September last year and was furloughed in March. In June, she was made redundant, even though she could have been kept on furlough. Now management at the Fairfield Halls has said the venue will not reopen until April next year, forcing her to contemplate a possible career change. ""It's definitely an uphill struggle and it's proving harder than previous ones,"" she told the BBC. ""It's hard to have a positive outlook."" Charlotte has been looking into doing a carpentry course, but to obtain the necessary City and Guilds qualification would require her to spend Â£5,000 on training. ""It's a mountain to climb. I wouldn't mind climbing that mountain if it's something that I'm passionate about, but I'm not sure,"" she says. ""I'm hoping to make a decision by the end of August."" Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive' This video can not be played Julie Morris explains what it is like to be job hunting in your late 50s during coronavirus Between April and June there were falls in pay for those still working, with regular pay levels down 0.2% compared with a year earlier - the first negative pay growth since records began in 2001. The number of people on zero-hours contracts also increased to more than one million. ""Early indicators for July 2020 suggest that the number of employees in the UK on payrolls is down around 730,000 compared with March 2020,"" said the ONS. It believes the main reason this is more extreme than the fall in employment is because of workers who have a job but are not doing any paid work at the moment. Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' Which sectors are hiring and which are cutting back? It added that a large number of people were estimated to be temporarily away from work, including furloughed workers - approximately 7.5 million in June 2020, with more than three million of these being away for three months or more. The number of workers covered by the furlough scheme has since risen to 9.6 million by 9 August, and has yet to record a fall in any week since it began,separate statistics published on Tuesday by HM Revenue and Customs show.,external The ONS said there had also been a sharp fall in the number of self-employed people between April and June. It said there were 4.76 million self-employed people, 14.5% of all people in employment, a record 238,000 fewer than the previous quarter. If you're a glass-half-full sort of person, there is some less than awful news in the latest labour market figures. The number of vacancies, for example, rose from its record low by 10% in May to July as lockdown restrictions were eased. The number of hours worked saw a record drop in the second quarter from April to June, but in July it was down by only 3%, less than half the fall in May and June. However, there are some less jolly signs. The number on employer payrolls had only dropped marginally in the previous two months, but saw a much bigger drop in July, down 114,000, in spite of the reopening of many shops, restaurants and pubs. And employers are increasingly making employees bear the risk that there isn't enough work for them to do, with the number of zero-hours contracts rising above one million for the first time. And then there's the record drop in self-employment. And all this in spite of the government spending more than Â£40bn trying to protect employment through furlough and self-employed income support. Unemployment tends to peak well after economic shocks have been and gone: this time will be no different. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest employment figures were ""the lull before the storm"". She added: ""The cracks evident in the latest batch of labour market data are likely to soon turn into a chasm, with the unemployment rate rising from 3.9% to around 7% by mid-2021."" She said further rises in unemployment in the coming months were ""all but inevitable as the furlough scheme unwinds"". Capital Economics forecasts that the unemployment rate will peak at 7% in mid-2021 and remain above its pre-pandemic level of 4% until the end of 2022. Ms Gregory said this suggested that the economic recovery would be ""slow going"". UK employment falls by biggest amount in a decade Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at Equals Money, said the figures showed the true level of those out of work had been ""very effectively lowered by the government's furlough scheme"" and that the worst lay ahead. ""Unfortunately, the end of the furlough scheme will present a cliff-edge, statistically and economically, for those currently relying on government support to make up their wages."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed that the government's ""unprecedented support measures"" were working to ""safeguard millions of jobs and livelihoods that could otherwise have been lost"". Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was ""extremely worrying"" that older workers, the self-employed and part-time workers had been hit hardest. ""Labour has repeatedly warned the government their one-size-fits-all approach will lead to job losses. These figures confirm what we feared - Britain is in the midst of a jobs crisis.""

"Lawrence murder: 'Met might give up, I never will'","Racist murder victim Stephen Lawrence's mother has vowed she will never give up on her son despite the Met Police declaring investigations ""inactive"". Detectives have said all ""identified lines of inquiry have been completed"" into the 1993 killing. But Baroness Doreen Lawrence said: ""Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will. ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible... may not be brought to justice."" Stephen, 18, was killed in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of his murder in 2012. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said Mr Lawrence's family had been told about the latest operational developments. Duwayne Brooks, who was with Mr Lawrence on the night he was murdered, has also been told about the Met's decision, the force said. Ms Dick said she was sad that the Met had been ""unable to secure any further convictions for Stephen, his family and friends"". She added: ""The investigation has now moved to an 'inactive' phase, but I have given Stephen's family the assurance that we will continue to deal with any new information that comes to light."" Reacting to the announcement, Stephen's father, Neville, said he was disappointed but not surprised that it had been shelved by police. He said that he ""will always live with the hope that someone might come forward with evidence which will allow us to achieve full justice for Stephen"". Stephen's mother, Doreen, entered the House of Lords in 2013 after being made a peer by Labour Baroness Lawrence said: ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible for my son's racist killing may not be brought to justice. ""It is never too late to give a mother justice for the murder of her son. Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will."" She thanked senior investigating officer Clive Driscoll, who secured the convictions of Dobson and Norris after she had campaigned for nearly 20 years. ""Having Clive Driscoll on Stephen's case made all the difference to me and had he had the opportunity of continuing to investigate the murder there may have been more convictions,"" she said. The latest phase of the investigation into Stephen's murder began in January 2014, with Det Ch Insp Chris Le Pere taking over as the lead officer. Since then more than 240 new witness statements have been taken. Gary Dobson (left) and David Norris were convicted of murder in 2012 Another development in the case came from a woman's DNA profile obtained from a bag strap discarded at the scene of the murder. Despite a significant appeal for information and other investigations, that woman has not been identified. Officers also sought to identify a man who had been near the murder scene wearing a jacket with a distinctive V-shaped emblem. Police appealed for a man in a distinctive jacket, seen in an off-licence near to the murder scene, to come forward A third line of inquiry had been to track down a man who had called the BBC's Crimewatch in 2013 to say he had information about the attack. ""The appeal generated more than 40 lines of enquiry for the investigation team to work through,"" the Met said. ""Despite exhaustive efforts, officers were unable to trace the individuals."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Knife crime plans 'criminalise' children Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually Initial attempts to catch Mr Lawrence's killers were found to have been hampered by incompetence and institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police. No arrests were made for two weeks after his death, despite five suspects being named by anonymous informants. A bag strap was left on the road near to where Stephen Lawrence was attacked Dobson and Norris were among a group of up to six men accused of attacking Mr Lawrence and Mr Brooks. Critics of the case say others evaded justice. The Macpherson Report into the investigation into Mr Lawrence's death found that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police.

Farmer's 'blackmail of Tesco put babies at risk',"Mr Wright claimed to be part of a group of disgruntled dairy farmers who had been underpaid by Tesco, the Old Bailey heard Two mothers came close to feeding their babies food laced with metal fragments after a sheep farmer tried to blackmail Tesco, a court heard. They found the metal in the jars of Heinz food, after Nigel Wright allegedly contaminated them in a Â£1.4m bitcoin plot, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Wright, 45 and of Lincolnshire, claimed he was a dairy farmer underpaid by Tesco, the jury heard. He denies two counts of contaminating goods and three counts of blackmail. Mr Wright, from Market Rasen, told Tesco he would reveal which stores he had planted the contaminated jars in, between May 2018 and February 2020, if they paid him in bitcoin, prosecutors said. He claimed to be one of a number of dairy farmers calling themselves ""Guy Brush and the Dairy Pirates"" who believed they had been underpaid, they said. More stories from Lincolnshire The court heard Morven Smith was feeding her 10-month-old son a jar of Heinz sweet and sour chicken baby food in December 2019 when she noticed the shards of a craft knife blade. Tesco then issued a national recall of all jars of the product, prompting Harpeet Kaur Singh to say she too had discovered fragments of metal when she was feeding her nine-month-old daughter. Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC told the jury: ""The defendant hoped to make himself rich by means of blackmail."" The two customers had found the slivers of metal in November and December 2019, in Rochdale and Lockerbie. There is no evidence any other products were actually contaminated, the court was told. Mr Wright also claimed salmonella and chemicals had been injected into cans and threatened to continue poisoning Tesco products if payment was not made, Mr Christopher said. In a separate charge of blackmail he is accused of demanding Â£150,000 worth of bitcoin from a driver with whom he had had a road rage altercation. A draft of messages sent to Tesco was found on his laptop along with photos of food tins, jars of baby food and slivers of metal, the court heard. Mr Wright admits various elements of the campaign but claims he was forced to do so by travellers who had demanded he give them Â£1m and he was acting in fear of his life. The trial continues.

"Khan 'misleading' over HQ move savings, say Tories","The lease for City Hall was agreed in 2001 Sadiq Khan has been accused of ""misleading"" voters by exaggerating potential savings from moving London's government out of City Hall. Conservative Party analysis claimed a proposed move to The Crystal building in Newham would save Â£5.6m a year. The Mayor of London promised moving out of City Hall, near Tower Bridge,would save Â£11.1m a year in rent and charges. The mayor's office said the figure was calculated by professionally-qualified finance officers. A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: ""The proposed move to the Crystal Building will save the Greater London Authority (GLA) Group Â£55m over five years. ""The move is only necessary because the government is not adequately funding local and regional government in London for the cost of tackling Covid-19."" The Crystal was opened in 2012, having been commissioned by Siemens as an exemplar of sustainable design Norman Foster-designed City Hall has been the official home of the GLA since it opened in 2002. Under the plans the mayor's office and London Assembly would move to the GLA-owned The Crystal in the Royal Docks, which was commissioned to be one of the most environmentally sustainable offices in the world. The move would also see the GLA use office space at Palestra House at Blackfriars, currently used by Transport for London. A formal six-week consultation on the move ended on 5 August. The Conservatives said Mr Khan failed to include potential lost income from leasing The Crystal and Palestra to private renters in his announcement. If the GLA was to stay put, letting these spaces could generate Â£4.7m a year, according to the analysis. The Conservatives said Mr Khan also failed to include the Â£280,000 a year generated by public events held at City Hall and the Crystal under the current set-up. This would halve total savings over five years from Â£55m to Â£27.76m, the party said. But the mayor's office said ""significantly lower running costs"" at the new sites would be expected ""to offset any hypothetical loss of income from renting out The Crystal"". Susan Hall called on the Mayor of London to ""come up with an honest assessment of the cost of moving City Hall"" Susan Hall, Conservative leader on the London Assembly, said: ""The mayor is misleading Londoners. ""We've calculated that the real savings figure could be less than Â£6m a year, which pales in comparison to the millions of pounds Mr Khan wastes each year. ""This is yet another example of the mayor putting PR before policy. ""I urge the mayor to go back to the drawing board and come up with an honest assessment of the cost of moving City Hall."" The lease for City Hall was agreed with a private landlord, the Kuwaiti-owned St Martins Property Group, in 2001 and is due to run for 25 years. But the agreement allows for a break in the contract after 20 years - in December 2021 - which will be the only chance the GLA has to leave early.

Patel takes on Ben and Jerry's over migrant boats,"Not a vanilla response: A source defended Priti Patel and hit out at the firm A source close to Home Secretary Priti Patel has branded Ben and Jerry's ice cream ""overpriced junk food"" after the company criticised her stance on cross-channel migrant crossings. In aseries of tweets,,externalthe firm urged her and others to show more ""humanity"", adding that ""people cannot be illegal"". The government earlier said the UK must consider changing asylum laws to deter migrants from crossing the Channel. More than 4,000 people have made the journey successfully this year. On Saturday, the Home Office asked defence chiefs to help make crossings of the dangerous route in small boats ""unviable"". PM considers law change for migrant removals Use of navy ships to stop migrants 'dangerous' What and where Channel migrants are escaping from Did Ben & Jerry's change Unilever? On Tuesday, the official Ben and Jerry's UK Twitter account posted several tweets tagging the home secretary, which began: ""Hey @PritiPatel, we think the real crisis is our lack of humanity for people fleeing war, climate change and torture."" It added: ""People wouldn't make dangerous journeys if they had any other choice."" The account also tweeted: ""People cannot be illegal."" It's not long ago that corporate statements on anything even tangentially political were anodyne to the point of being crashingly boring. And that's if they said anything at all. Well, things have changed. Brands, big and small, feel increasingly confident about getting stuck in on social media. The risks are obvious: in a space that revels in the pithy, binary and divisive, to proclaim is to pick a side - and so potentially irritate a sizeable chunk of your customers. So why do it? To stand up for something you believe in, sure - but also to act as a brand multiplier, to get people talking about you and your stuff. To catch the public mood, or at least a majority of it. The curious thing with this intervention, directly targeting the home secretary, is that Priti Patel has said very little publicly about what's been happening. But a Home Office source replied: ""Priti is working day and night to bring an end to these small boat crossings, which are facilitated by international criminal gangs and are rightly of serious concern to the British people.

As it happened: Biden reveals vice-presidential pick,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden named Kamala Harris as his running mate The California senator is the first black woman and first Asian-American to be chosen as a vice-presidential candidate Ms Harris was also the first woman to serve as California's attorney general Joe Biden will face Donald Trump in the US election on 3 November Mr Biden previously served as vice-president under Barack Obama Max Matza, Ritu Prasad, Ashitha Nagesh, Boer Deng and Holly Honderich That concludes our coverage of this history-making vice-presidential pick - thanks for joining us. California Senator Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden, a former vice-president himself, on the 2020 ticket for the Democrats. She's the first black woman and Asian-American woman to become a presidential running mate for a major US political party. Her selection has been met with praise from top Democrats, though some left-leaning members of the party have expressed concerns over her past as a prosecutor. We're expecting to hear from Biden and Harris at an event tomorrow. The Biden-Harris team will face President Donald Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, on 3 November. You can follow updates to the story of the Biden-Harris tickethere. Want more?Check out these features on Kamala Harris and the US election. Sarah Palin - the former Republican Alaska governor picked as John McCain's running mate in 2008 - has offered some words of advice to Kamala Harris. ""Climb upon Geraldine Ferraro's and my shoulders,"" Palin wrote on Instagram - referring to Geraldine Ferraro, America's first female vice-presidential nominee back in 1984. Harris now joins Ferraro and Palin as member's of a three-person club: the only female vice-presidential nominees of a major American political party. ""Out of the chute trust no one new,"" Palin wrote. ""Don't get muzzled - connect with media and voters in your own unique way. Some yahoos running campaigns will suffocate you with their own self-centred agenda so remember YOU were chosen for who YOU are."" And ""don't forget the women who came before you"".

On a day like today, many may ask how the two presidential candidates are doing as we inch closer to election day, 3 November 2020. National polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, but they're not necessarily a good way to predict the result of the election. In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton led in the polls and won nearly three million more votes than Donald Trump, but she still lost. That's because the US uses an electoral college system, so winning the most votes doesn't always win you the election. With that caveat aside, Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in national polls for most of the year. Biden has hovered around 50% in recent weeks and has had a 10-point lead on occasions. The BBC is keeping track of those polls hereand trying to work out what they can and can't tell us about who will win the election. Maya Harris, Kamala Harris's younger sister, said she was ""incredibly proud"" - and shared a photo from Kamala's (much) younger days. The Harris sisters are close, and the elder wrote in her autobiography that both of them were immersed in Oakland's black culture. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she said. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" Allow Twitter content?

Many former Biden and Harris rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have weighed in to offer their praise and congratulations on Twitter. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warrenwrote that she's known Harris a long time and that she's always been ""unafraid and an inspiration to millions of women who see themselves in her"". New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, another rising party star and black American, wrote: ""I'm proud to call Kamala Harris my dear friend and sister - and next year, I'll be even more proud to call her our vice-president.

This is history."" Amy Klobuchar, US Senator from Minnesota, said she was ""filled with joy"" that Harris is the nominee. ""This is a historic moment, and I know that her leadership, experience, and character will help move our country forward when she and Joe Biden take back the White House!"" Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigiegsaid Harris has fought ""tirelessly for justice, dignity and equality for All Americans"" and that he ""can't wait"" to call her vice-president. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg, former New York City mayor, said Harris was a ""smart choice who will be a strong partner in the White House"" while offering a criticism of President Trump, saying: ""The best executives know that you're only as good as the team you build. It's a lesson that clearly escaped our current president."" Asked again to react to Biden's vice-presidential announcement, Trump responds: ""Well I like Vice-President Mike Pence much better. He is solid as a rock."" ""I will take him over Kamala and the horrible way she treated Justice Kavanaugh,"" he says, referring to her grilling of the then-Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct as a teenager. ""I thought she was the meanest and most horrible and most disrespectful of anyone in the US senate,"" Trump continues. ""She's also known, from what I understand, the most liberal person in the US senate,"" he claims, saying that her progressive credentials will not serve to aid Biden's campaign for president.  Trump is now laying into Harris during his White House briefing. ""She is a person that has told many many stories that werenât true. Sheâs very big into raising taxes."" ""She wants to slash funds for our military at a level which nobody can even believe,"" he says. ""Sheâs against fracking. Sheâs against petroleum products,"" he continues, saying that her anti-fossil fuel believes could cost her in some states such as Pennsylvania. ""She's in favour of socialised medicine,"" he says, claiming that she wants to strip health insurance from 180m Americans. Trump claimed Harris was his ""number one draft pick"" to be named as Biden's running-mate. ""And we'll see how she works out. She did very very poorly in the primaries as you know,"" he says. He also said he would not forget Harris's assertive questioning of Brett Kavanaugh, one of Trump's picks for the Supreme Court who was accused of sexual misconduct, during the judge's confirmation hearing. Trump claimed the senator was ""extraordinarily nasty"" towards Kavanaugh, who was later confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.  Peyton Forte, 21, is a recent graduate at North Carolina
A&T State University. She tells the BBC what she thinks of Kamala Harris as
the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee. âTo have the first black woman vice-president in American
history â it looks good, it sounds good, but what can you do, sheâs not my
pick. I would have liked for Joe Biden to go for more of a
progressive, like Elizabeth Warren. Kamala doesnât shake the table enough for me in terms of her
demands for things that I hold dear, such as universal health care, the total
elimination of student debt and raising the minimum wage. I think that we kind of get carried away, especially as black
people, by the âfirst thisâ and âfirst thatâ, itâs just seen as a gigantic
milestone. But are you fighting for some of the values that the black community
holds dear? Are you actually speaking to fellow black folks about what theyâd
like to see? Iâm not thrilled, but it was a safe choice. Maybe in 2024, things
will be different.â Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington LaNitra Walker teaches African Americans studies As a presidential candidate, Kamala Harris went after Joe Biden during a debate, calling him out for his opposition to school busing in the 1970s and telling her own personal story about desegregation. ""Thatâs why sheâs a good choice,"" says George Mason Universityâs LaNitra Walker, a member of the affiliate faculty on African Americans studies. Ms Walker believes Harris would challenge Biden on issues and would bring an important perspective to the executive branch. The California senator attended Howard University, a historically black college and is âa voice for racial justice and the Black Lives Matter movementâ, says Ms Walker. On a personal level, she says she was thrilled to hear the announcement. She ran and told her eight-year-old son, Nathan, (pictured with her) explaining âhow historical it wasâ. She adds: âHe was just really excited to hear that thereâs a black leader on the presidential ticket.â President Donald Trump announced a last minute press conference after news emerged of the Democratic vice-presidential pick. He is speaking live from the White House briefing room now. âThe Democrats are being taken over by the radical leftâ the president claims, denouncing âlooting and riotingâ that has happened in cities run by majority Democrat government. He has yet to directly address Biden's choice for running mate, but is continuing to criticise Democrats, who he accuses of appointing prosecutors ""who side with the criminals"". Sanders and Harris in the first Democratic primary debate, which was 14 months ago Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who campaigned against both Biden and Harris to be the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has just tweeted his approval. ""Congratulations to@KamalaHarris,external, who will make history as our next Vice-President,"" says the self-described Democratic Socialist. ""She understands what it takes to stand up for working people, fight for health care for all, and take down the most corrupt administration in history,"" he continues. ""Letâs get to work and win."" However, not all of Sanders supports feel the same way, as indicated in the reactions to his tweet. Many view Harris as a ""cop"" who is far too cozy with law enforcement. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America's largest grassroots civil rights organisation, called Harris's selection as vice-presidential candidate a ""defining moment in US history"". ""Throughout the history of this nation, black women have been at the forefront of moving us toward a more representative and unified society,""says NAACP president Derrick Johnson,external. ""But their representation in the highest levels of government has never matched their unwavering participation in our democracy. Todayâs announcement of a black woman, Senator Kamala Harris, as the first vice-presidential candidate of a major political party, breaks down one of these barriers in historic proportions. ""That it comes at a time in which black Americans face dueling threats from a global health crisis and ingrained racism is all the more powerful."" Johnson said the moment - a ""culmination of the tireless work"" of other black women activists and lawmakers like Shirley Chisholm and Rosa Parks, was ""long overdue"", and every American, regardless of party, should be proud of this milestone. The NAACP also cautioned that coverage of Harris's candidacy should not ""decline into ugly racist and sexist stereotypes and attacks"". Aâkayla Sellers, 21, is a Democrat from South Carolina. She is about to attend her final year at the College of Charleston, and is part of the historically African American sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha - of which Kamala Harris was also a member. ""Iâm very impressed that not only did he choose a woman but an African-American woman - thatâs exciting. I was going for Kamala at the beginning. What attracted me to Kamala earlier on was that she was an African-American woman that worked from the ground up. I know a lot of African Americans werenât fans of Harris. Her prison reform stance. A big thing for her is that she really wanted to go for the African-American community and act like her policies were going to benefit us, but her track record didnât line up with her policy stances so it made a lot of people wary. Still, she can bring awareness to black issues, she can bring awareness to needs of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and awareness to the needs of minority students at predominately white institutions. She can bring awareness to the needs of affordable education. I can see a lot of great things coming from this."" Not everyone is as thrilled as high profile party members over having Kamala Harris on the ticket. Some more left-leaning Democrats have expressed concerns over picking the former prosecutor. Former Bernie Sanders campaign National Press Secretary Briahna Joy Gray echoed some of the early criticisms of Harris' presidential bid on Twitter, saying: ""We are in the midst of the largest protest movement in American history, the subject of which is excessive policing, and the Democratic party chose a 'top cop' and the author of the Joe Biden crime bill to save us from Trump."" It's a similar story in the replies to Senator Sanders' tweet congratulating Harris, with progressive Democrats criticising the party's pick of a ""cop"". Micah Uetricht, an author and deputy editor of the socialist Jacobin magazine, wrote: ""The largest uprising of any kind in American history just took place against exactly the kind of policies Kamala Harris has instituted throughout her political career - and that uprising made zero impact on Biden's decision-making for his VP pick. Pretty amazing."" Obama and Biden pictured in 2005, when both men were still US senators ""Choosing a vice-president is the first important decision a president makes,"" says former President Barack Obama in a statement. ""Joe Biden nailed this decision. By choosing Senator Kamala Harris as Americaâs next vice-president, heâs underscored his own judgment and character,"" he says. To remind you, Obama picked Biden to be his running mate in 2008 and Biden served under him for eight years as vice-president. ""Iâve known Senator Harris for a long time. She is more than prepared for the job,"" Obama continues. ""Sheâs spent her career defending our constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. Her own life story is one that I and so many others can see ourselves in: a story that says that no matter where you come from, what you look like, how you worship, or who you love, thereâs a place for you here."" He concludes: ""This is a good day for our country. Now letâs go win this thing."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington ""Joe Biden gets something right."" Thatâs what Georgetown Universityâs Marcia Chatelain, the author of South Side Girls: Growing Up in the Great Migration, and others say. Biden decision to pick Kamala Harris as a running mate, says Ms Chatelain, is a ârecognition of the moment of racial reckoning that the country is on nowâ. Ms Chatelain acknowledges that some progressives are unhappy with her work as a district attorney in California, pointing to âdraconianâ policies that she supported in the criminal justice system. But since then, Harris has changed, says Ms Chatelain. An experienced campaigner, Harris is now âpractised at defending her record and revising her positionsâ - skills that will serve her well during the final weeks of the campaign. Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, says she's ""thrilled"" to see Harris on the ticket - and knows ""she'll be a strong partner to Joe Biden"".

Harris began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. She became San Francisco's top prosecutor in 2003 and rose to become the first woman and first African American to serve as California's attorney general. In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, and used the momentum to propel her election victory as California's junior US senator in 2017. A self-described ""progressive prosecutor"", Harris has tried to emphasise more left-leaning parts of her legacy - requiring body cameras for some special agents at the California Department of Justice, the first state agency to adopt them, and launching a database that provided public access to crime statistics. However, some have questioned her commitment to left-wing policies. While her law enforcement background may have hindered her early 2020 campaign efforts, those same credentials could prove beneficial in the general election when Democrats need to win over more moderate voters and independents.

""I understand black women in particular those who are labeled ambitious tend to only have negative things brought up about them. With Kamala as a vice-presidential nominee, it's 100% going to make the race more racially polarised. When Obama was campaigning they attacked Michelle and she wasnât even campaigning. I canât imagine what itâs going to be like for Senator Harris. Theyâre going to find reasons to attack her but I think itâs the job of those of us who are supportive to be very vocal on the other side and be a champion for her. As a black person, I'm happy because I feel like we will finally have someone center the issues that matter to me. She will be able to talk to Biden and have his ear and let him know how this is going to impact the black community."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Replacement A-level grades 'no lower than mock exams',"Schools in England can appeal for an upgrade if their students' A-level and GCSE results are lower than mock exams. The Department for Education has announced a last-minute ""triple lock"" - which could raise replacement grades for exams cancelled in the pandemic. It means pupils could have whichever result is highest from estimated grades, mocks or exams in the autumn. But the Ofqual exams watchdog says it cannot say how appeals over mocks might be verified until next week. Ofqual said in a statement it was ""working urgently"" to ""determine what standards of evidence will be required for the appeal"". The National Union of Students said using mock results risked ""making a mockery"" of the exam system. And head teachers attacked the change, the day before A-level results are published, as ""panicked and chaotic"". England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was a ""safety net"" for those getting estimated grades this summer. In Wales, in another ""guarantee"" over grades, Education Minister Kirsty Williams has promised that ""a learner's final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade"". The change means that if pupils get an estimated grade lower than their mock exam they can appeal - but this will have to be through their school, with the terms for approving appeals still to be decided by the exam watchdog, Ofqual. But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the move ""beggars belief"" because mock exams are carried out in many different ways and are not consistent enough to be used for A-level and GCSE results. ""The government doesn't appear to understand how mock exams work. They aren't a set of exams which all conform to the same standards. The clue is in the name 'mock',"" said Mr Barton. Changes being considered for A-levels in Wales Students want exams to be upgraded across the UK Scottish pupils have results upgraded Universities told to hold places while pupils appeal over grades How will exam results day work this year? West Sussex head teacher Jules White described the decision as a ""shambles"" - and a ""total botch job"". He said in some schools pupils might know in advance the specific topics on which they are going to be tested - and in other schools they might not have taken mocks before the lockdown. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the governmentâs handling of Thursday's A-level exam results âsmacks of incompetenceâ Other schools might be tough on marking mocks as a way of getting pupils to revise. To use such different circumstances for results ""defies logic and credibility,"" said Mr White. ""The use of mock exams results risks making a mockery of the whole system,"" said Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students. She warned there was a ""lack of a standard approach to mock exams"" and ""they are not taken by all candidates"". England: the key information for A-levels and GCSEs will be how pupils are ranked by their school and results in their schools and colleges in previous years. Plus a ""triple lock"" with the highest grade out of the allocated grade, an autumn written exam or a mock exam, dependent on a successful appeal through a school Vocational qualifications will have estimated results for some courses, but not the same ""triple lock"" Northern Irelandwill allow appeals based on mocks and includes AS-levels in deciding results Scotlandhas switched to using teachers' predicted grades Waleshas promised students that A-level results will not be lower than their AS-level results The move in England comes after 76,000 pupils in Scotland had their results upgraded after being lowered by a moderating system which critics claimed was a ""postcode lottery"" as it linked pupils' results with their schools' past performances. It drew accusations that high-achieving pupils in low-performing schools would lose out - and that this would particularly discriminate against young people in deprived areas. The Scottish government has apologised and results will now be based on teachers' predicted grades. Protests have changed exam grades in Scotland - now students want the same for the rest of the UK England's schools minister Nick Gibb told BBC Breakfast being able to appeal on the basis of their mock results was ""an extra safety net for a small group of pupils"". He rejected concerns about confusion and said he would ""apologise to nobody for finding solutions - even at the eleventh hour ""to stop students being disadvantaged. It will mean that mock exams will now have an impact on A-level and GCSE results in England and Northern Ireland, alongside how pupils are ranked on ability and the share of grades that their schools and colleges have achieved in recent years. England's exam regulator Ofqual said relying on teachers' predictions would have unfairly inflated results. Using teachers' predictions would have meant about 38% of entries would have been A* or A grades this year - considerably higher than the previous record of 27%. Vocational qualifications will have some estimated grades issued - but not the ""triple lock"" appeal system For vocational qualifications, such as BTECs,estimated grades are also being issued- but not for subjects which depend on tests for practical skills, which need to be carried out in person. The ""triple lock"" approach, linked to mocks and exams in the autumn, will not apply in the same way to vocational qualifications. The Welsh government has given A-level students a guarantee that their final results will not be lower than their AS-level grades - and they are initially lower a revised grade will be issued. Mary Bousted of the National Education Union warned students in different parts of the UK were now applying for the same university places with results based on ""completely different criteria and wildly different pass rates"". With A-level results only a day away, Universities UK wants ""urgent clarification"" about what these changes will mean for deciding on places. A-level results are going to be estimated this year after exams were cancelled Universities have been told if students miss out on grades, but their schools are appealing, places have to be kept open until that appeal has been decided. But the universities organisation says it is far from clear how this will work for appeals over mock exams - and is asking whether results based on mocks can be considered as having ""equal status"" in deciding who gets accepted or rejected. They also warn about the practical complications, such as trying to allocate accommodation. ""Never in recent memory have we been faced with such uncertainty and challenge on the eve of A-level and BTec results day,"" said Anja Hazebroek from the University of Hull. But it is still expected to be a good year for students looking for university places - with an anticipated fall in overseas students leaving many places to be filled. ""Those near-miss candidates, if they've dropped one or two grades, universities are being super-flexible about that,"" said Clare Marchant of the Ucas admissions service..

Coronavirus cases surge as France goes 'wrong way',"French Prime Minister Jean Castex (left) made the dire warning in Montpellier on Tuesday New coronavirus infections have nearly doubled in France in recent weeks as Prime Minister Jean Castex warned that the country had been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks. The health ministry reported 1,397 new infections of Covid-19 since Monday. Fourteen people have died. A ban on meetings of more than 5,000 people has been extended to 30 October. Mr Castex also asked local authorities to further extend the requirement to wear face masks in public. ""The epidemiological situation, which we are following very closely, is deteriorating: 2,000 new cases per day compared to 1,000 three weeks ago,"" Mr Castex said at a press conference in Montpellier. ""About 25 new clusters are identified every day compared to five three weeks ago,"" he added. It is already compulsory to wear face coverings nationwide on public transport and in indoor spaces including shops and government offices. Local authorities have the ability to impose mask-wearing and some have introduced it in outdoor spaces, including Paris tourist hot spots and the banks of the river Seine. More than 30,000 people have already died from the disease in France, which experienced a significant wave of cases in March and April. An additional 14 people have died since Monday, according to the health ministry. Its death toll remains the seventh highest in the world, although it is far below the US and Brazil where more than 100,000 have died in each country, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins university. Following a national lockdown, restrictions in France were eased in May and June and tourism permitted as the summer holiday season began and foreign visitors allowed. Is the world winning the coronavirus fight? New Zealand records first virus cases in 102 days Russia's Putin says vaccine approved for use Public gatherings of more than 5,000 people, including concerts or sports events, were due to resume  at the end of August, but Mr Castex has extended the ban until 30 October. At the weekend, more than 10,000 people attended an illegal rave in remote and sparsely populated mountain area Lozere in southern France. This video can not be played How South Korea is trying to keep its beaches safe amid the coronavirus pandemic Mr Castex said that unless people took action, the country would expose itself ""to a high risk of epidemic resumption that will be difficult to control."" On Monday the health ministry reported that 10,800 new coronavirus cases have been identified in the past week. The spread of the virus is particularly prominent among young people and in cities such as Paris and Marseille, it added. Experts inSpainsay the country has once again reached a ""critical situation"" with the worst infection rate in Europe. It reported an average daily rise of 4,923 cases during the last seven days, according to AFP news agency. The health ministry reports that there are currently 500 outbreak clusters nationwide. Spain was badly hit during a wave of infections in March and April, and more than 28,000 people have died from the disease. Russiasays it has developeda coronavirus vaccinethat is approved for use after just two months of testing on humans. President Vladimir Putin said his daughter had already been given it.

New Zealand records first virus cases in 102 days,"Restrictions had been lifted in New Zealand after the country declared it had eliminated the virus New Zealand has put its largest city back into lockdown after recording four new Covid-19 cases, ending a 102-day streak without a local infection. A three-day lockdown was swiftly imposed in Auckland after the cases were confirmed. The four new cases are all members of a single family.Â None had travelled recently. The restrictions will come into effect on Wednesday, as authorities scramble to trace contacts of the family. Auckland residents will be asked to stay at home, large gatherings will be banned, non-essential businesses will be shut, and some social-distancing restrictions will be reintroduced in the rest of the country. The country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also on Wednesday deferred the dissolution of parliament, following the latest Covid-19 cases. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has delayed the dissolution of parliament The dissolution of parliament, which is required to make way for a general election, has now been deferred until Monday. Ms Ardern said no decision had yet been made on postponing the election - originally scheduled for 19 September. ""We have some time to work through that,"" she said, according to a TVNZ report. New Zealand has fared better than other countries, recording 1,220 confirmed cases and 22 deaths since the virus arrived in late February. New Zealand gets its coffee back How NZ's 'team of five million' took on Covid-19 New Zealand went 'hard and early' to beat Covid-19 Before Tuesday, New Zealand had gone 102 days without recording a locally transmitted case of Covid-19, one of the few countries to reach such a milestone. All 22 active cases of the virus before Tuesday's announcement were among returning travellers quarantined in isolation facilities. Praised internationally for its handling of the pandemic, the country's government had lifted almost all of its lockdown restrictions, first imposed in March. An early lockdown, tough border restrictions, effective health messaging and an aggressive test-and-trace programme have all been credited with virtually eliminating the virus in the country. But as infections continue to rise across the world, surpassing 20 million globally on Tuesday, New Zealand officials have warned against complacency. This video can not be played Epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker: ""New Zealand will get rid of the virus again"" Announcing the lockdown, Ms Ardern said it was necessary to go hard and go early to stamp out the virus. Auckland - a city of around 1.6 million people - would move to level three restrictions from 12:00 local time (01:00 BST) on Wednesday as a ""precautionary approach"", she said. The prime minister said the rest of the country would move to level two ofNew Zealand's 4-tier alert system of measures against Covid-19,external. ""This is something we have prepared for,"" Ms Ardern said at a news conference. ""We have had 102 days and it was easy to feel New Zealand was out of the woods. No country has gone as far as we did without having a resurgence. And because we were the only ones, we had to plan. And we have planned,"" she said. Director-General of Health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said at least three days of lockdown were needed in Auckland to trace the source of the new cases. ""We're expecting to see other cases,"" Dr Bloomfield said. ""We want to find those other cases as soon as possible and identify or isolate any contacts."" Shoppers were seen queuing at supermarkets after the lockdown was announced Michael Baker, professor of Public Health at the University of Otago, told BBC's Newsnight programme that even with the most successful strategies in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak ""one thing you have to plan for is setbacks"". ""I think New Zealand will succeed and get rid of the virus,"" he added. In anticipation of a pre-lockdown rush to supermarkets, Ms Ardern and the mayor of Auckland, Phil Goff, called for calm, saying there was no need to panic-buy. Despite their pleas, large crowds of shoppers were seen queuing at supermarkets on Tuesday night, as they attempted to stock up before lockdown. One video posted to social media shows customers streaming through the door of a supermarket as a security guard tries to prevent them from entering. Allow Twitter content?

The World Health Organization (WHO) had hailed New Zealand as an example to others for having ""successfully eliminated community transmission"". But other countries have had early success in suppressing the virus, only to see infections rise again after lifting lockdown restrictions that damaged the economy. Vietnam went 99 days with no community transmission until July, when a 57-year-old man in Da Nang tested positive for the virus. By the end of July, Da Nang was the epicentre of a new coronavirus outbreak, leading to the country's first coronavirus death since the pandemic began. Australia, too, has seen a resurgence of Covid-19 in some states, including New South Wales and Victoria, where a strict lockdown has been imposed.

As it happened: Biden reveals vice-presidential pickKamala Harris is chosen as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate.,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden named Kamala Harris as his running mate The California senator is the first black woman and first Asian-American to be chosen as a vice-presidential candidate Ms Harris was also the first woman to serve as California's attorney general Joe Biden will face Donald Trump in the US election on 3 November Mr Biden previously served as vice-president under Barack Obama Max Matza, Ritu Prasad, Ashitha Nagesh, Boer Deng and Holly Honderich That concludes our coverage of this history-making vice-presidential pick - thanks for joining us. California Senator Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden, a former vice-president himself, on the 2020 ticket for the Democrats. She's the first black woman and Asian-American woman to become a presidential running mate for a major US political party. Her selection has been met with praise from top Democrats, though some left-leaning members of the party have expressed concerns over her past as a prosecutor. We're expecting to hear from Biden and Harris at an event tomorrow. The Biden-Harris team will face President Donald Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, on 3 November. You can follow updates to the story of the Biden-Harris tickethere. Want more?Check out these features on Kamala Harris and the US election. Sarah Palin - the former Republican Alaska governor picked as John McCain's running mate in 2008 - has offered some words of advice to Kamala Harris. ""Climb upon Geraldine Ferraro's and my shoulders,"" Palin wrote on Instagram - referring to Geraldine Ferraro, America's first female vice-presidential nominee back in 1984. Harris now joins Ferraro and Palin as member's of a three-person club: the only female vice-presidential nominees of a major American political party. ""Out of the chute trust no one new,"" Palin wrote. ""Don't get muzzled - connect with media and voters in your own unique way. Some yahoos running campaigns will suffocate you with their own self-centred agenda so remember YOU were chosen for who YOU are."" And ""don't forget the women who came before you"".

On a day like today, many may ask how the two presidential candidates are doing as we inch closer to election day, 3 November 2020. National polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, but they're not necessarily a good way to predict the result of the election. In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton led in the polls and won nearly three million more votes than Donald Trump, but she still lost. That's because the US uses an electoral college system, so winning the most votes doesn't always win you the election. With that caveat aside, Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in national polls for most of the year. Biden has hovered around 50% in recent weeks and has had a 10-point lead on occasions. The BBC is keeping track of those polls hereand trying to work out what they can and can't tell us about who will win the election. Maya Harris, Kamala Harris's younger sister, said she was ""incredibly proud"" - and shared a photo from Kamala's (much) younger days. The Harris sisters are close, and the elder wrote in her autobiography that both of them were immersed in Oakland's black culture. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she said. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" Allow Twitter content?

Many former Biden and Harris rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have weighed in to offer their praise and congratulations on Twitter. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warrenwrote that she's known Harris a long time and that she's always been ""unafraid and an inspiration to millions of women who see themselves in her"". New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, another rising party star and black American, wrote: ""I'm proud to call Kamala Harris my dear friend and sister - and next year, I'll be even more proud to call her our vice-president.

This is history."" Amy Klobuchar, US Senator from Minnesota, said she was ""filled with joy"" that Harris is the nominee. ""This is a historic moment, and I know that her leadership, experience, and character will help move our country forward when she and Joe Biden take back the White House!"" Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigiegsaid Harris has fought ""tirelessly for justice, dignity and equality for All Americans"" and that he ""can't wait"" to call her vice-president. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg, former New York City mayor, said Harris was a ""smart choice who will be a strong partner in the White House"" while offering a criticism of President Trump, saying: ""The best executives know that you're only as good as the team you build. It's a lesson that clearly escaped our current president."" Asked again to react to Biden's vice-presidential announcement, Trump responds: ""Well I like Vice-President Mike Pence much better. He is solid as a rock."" ""I will take him over Kamala and the horrible way she treated Justice Kavanaugh,"" he says, referring to her grilling of the then-Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct as a teenager. ""I thought she was the meanest and most horrible and most disrespectful of anyone in the US senate,"" Trump continues. ""She's also known, from what I understand, the most liberal person in the US senate,"" he claims, saying that her progressive credentials will not serve to aid Biden's campaign for president.  Trump is now laying into Harris during his White House briefing. ""She is a person that has told many many stories that werenât true. Sheâs very big into raising taxes."" ""She wants to slash funds for our military at a level which nobody can even believe,"" he says. ""Sheâs against fracking. Sheâs against petroleum products,"" he continues, saying that her anti-fossil fuel believes could cost her in some states such as Pennsylvania. ""She's in favour of socialised medicine,"" he says, claiming that she wants to strip health insurance from 180m Americans. Trump claimed Harris was his ""number one draft pick"" to be named as Biden's running-mate. ""And we'll see how she works out. She did very very poorly in the primaries as you know,"" he says. He also said he would not forget Harris's assertive questioning of Brett Kavanaugh, one of Trump's picks for the Supreme Court who was accused of sexual misconduct, during the judge's confirmation hearing. Trump claimed the senator was ""extraordinarily nasty"" towards Kavanaugh, who was later confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.  Peyton Forte, 21, is a recent graduate at North Carolina
A&T State University. She tells the BBC what she thinks of Kamala Harris as
the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee. âTo have the first black woman vice-president in American
history â it looks good, it sounds good, but what can you do, sheâs not my
pick. I would have liked for Joe Biden to go for more of a
progressive, like Elizabeth Warren. Kamala doesnât shake the table enough for me in terms of her
demands for things that I hold dear, such as universal health care, the total
elimination of student debt and raising the minimum wage. I think that we kind of get carried away, especially as black
people, by the âfirst thisâ and âfirst thatâ, itâs just seen as a gigantic
milestone. But are you fighting for some of the values that the black community
holds dear? Are you actually speaking to fellow black folks about what theyâd
like to see? Iâm not thrilled, but it was a safe choice. Maybe in 2024, things
will be different.â Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington LaNitra Walker teaches African Americans studies As a presidential candidate, Kamala Harris went after Joe Biden during a debate, calling him out for his opposition to school busing in the 1970s and telling her own personal story about desegregation. ""Thatâs why sheâs a good choice,"" says George Mason Universityâs LaNitra Walker, a member of the affiliate faculty on African Americans studies. Ms Walker believes Harris would challenge Biden on issues and would bring an important perspective to the executive branch. The California senator attended Howard University, a historically black college and is âa voice for racial justice and the Black Lives Matter movementâ, says Ms Walker. On a personal level, she says she was thrilled to hear the announcement. She ran and told her eight-year-old son, Nathan, (pictured with her) explaining âhow historical it wasâ. She adds: âHe was just really excited to hear that thereâs a black leader on the presidential ticket.â President Donald Trump announced a last minute press conference after news emerged of the Democratic vice-presidential pick. He is speaking live from the White House briefing room now. âThe Democrats are being taken over by the radical leftâ the president claims, denouncing âlooting and riotingâ that has happened in cities run by majority Democrat government. He has yet to directly address Biden's choice for running mate, but is continuing to criticise Democrats, who he accuses of appointing prosecutors ""who side with the criminals"". Sanders and Harris in the first Democratic primary debate, which was 14 months ago Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who campaigned against both Biden and Harris to be the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has just tweeted his approval. ""Congratulations to@KamalaHarris,external, who will make history as our next Vice-President,"" says the self-described Democratic Socialist. ""She understands what it takes to stand up for working people, fight for health care for all, and take down the most corrupt administration in history,"" he continues. ""Letâs get to work and win."" However, not all of Sanders supports feel the same way, as indicated in the reactions to his tweet. Many view Harris as a ""cop"" who is far too cozy with law enforcement. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America's largest grassroots civil rights organisation, called Harris's selection as vice-presidential candidate a ""defining moment in US history"". ""Throughout the history of this nation, black women have been at the forefront of moving us toward a more representative and unified society,""says NAACP president Derrick Johnson,external. ""But their representation in the highest levels of government has never matched their unwavering participation in our democracy. Todayâs announcement of a black woman, Senator Kamala Harris, as the first vice-presidential candidate of a major political party, breaks down one of these barriers in historic proportions. ""That it comes at a time in which black Americans face dueling threats from a global health crisis and ingrained racism is all the more powerful."" Johnson said the moment - a ""culmination of the tireless work"" of other black women activists and lawmakers like Shirley Chisholm and Rosa Parks, was ""long overdue"", and every American, regardless of party, should be proud of this milestone. The NAACP also cautioned that coverage of Harris's candidacy should not ""decline into ugly racist and sexist stereotypes and attacks"". Aâkayla Sellers, 21, is a Democrat from South Carolina. She is about to attend her final year at the College of Charleston, and is part of the historically African American sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha - of which Kamala Harris was also a member. ""Iâm very impressed that not only did he choose a woman but an African-American woman - thatâs exciting. I was going for Kamala at the beginning. What attracted me to Kamala earlier on was that she was an African-American woman that worked from the ground up. I know a lot of African Americans werenât fans of Harris. Her prison reform stance. A big thing for her is that she really wanted to go for the African-American community and act like her policies were going to benefit us, but her track record didnât line up with her policy stances so it made a lot of people wary. Still, she can bring awareness to black issues, she can bring awareness to needs of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and awareness to the needs of minority students at predominately white institutions. She can bring awareness to the needs of affordable education. I can see a lot of great things coming from this."" Not everyone is as thrilled as high profile party members over having Kamala Harris on the ticket. Some more left-leaning Democrats have expressed concerns over picking the former prosecutor. Former Bernie Sanders campaign National Press Secretary Briahna Joy Gray echoed some of the early criticisms of Harris' presidential bid on Twitter, saying: ""We are in the midst of the largest protest movement in American history, the subject of which is excessive policing, and the Democratic party chose a 'top cop' and the author of the Joe Biden crime bill to save us from Trump."" It's a similar story in the replies to Senator Sanders' tweet congratulating Harris, with progressive Democrats criticising the party's pick of a ""cop"". Micah Uetricht, an author and deputy editor of the socialist Jacobin magazine, wrote: ""The largest uprising of any kind in American history just took place against exactly the kind of policies Kamala Harris has instituted throughout her political career - and that uprising made zero impact on Biden's decision-making for his VP pick. Pretty amazing."" Obama and Biden pictured in 2005, when both men were still US senators ""Choosing a vice-president is the first important decision a president makes,"" says former President Barack Obama in a statement. ""Joe Biden nailed this decision. By choosing Senator Kamala Harris as Americaâs next vice-president, heâs underscored his own judgment and character,"" he says. To remind you, Obama picked Biden to be his running mate in 2008 and Biden served under him for eight years as vice-president. ""Iâve known Senator Harris for a long time. She is more than prepared for the job,"" Obama continues. ""Sheâs spent her career defending our constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. Her own life story is one that I and so many others can see ourselves in: a story that says that no matter where you come from, what you look like, how you worship, or who you love, thereâs a place for you here."" He concludes: ""This is a good day for our country. Now letâs go win this thing."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington ""Joe Biden gets something right."" Thatâs what Georgetown Universityâs Marcia Chatelain, the author of South Side Girls: Growing Up in the Great Migration, and others say. Biden decision to pick Kamala Harris as a running mate, says Ms Chatelain, is a ârecognition of the moment of racial reckoning that the country is on nowâ. Ms Chatelain acknowledges that some progressives are unhappy with her work as a district attorney in California, pointing to âdraconianâ policies that she supported in the criminal justice system. But since then, Harris has changed, says Ms Chatelain. An experienced campaigner, Harris is now âpractised at defending her record and revising her positionsâ - skills that will serve her well during the final weeks of the campaign. Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, says she's ""thrilled"" to see Harris on the ticket - and knows ""she'll be a strong partner to Joe Biden"".

Harris began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. She became San Francisco's top prosecutor in 2003 and rose to become the first woman and first African American to serve as California's attorney general. In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, and used the momentum to propel her election victory as California's junior US senator in 2017. A self-described ""progressive prosecutor"", Harris has tried to emphasise more left-leaning parts of her legacy - requiring body cameras for some special agents at the California Department of Justice, the first state agency to adopt them, and launching a database that provided public access to crime statistics. However, some have questioned her commitment to left-wing policies. While her law enforcement background may have hindered her early 2020 campaign efforts, those same credentials could prove beneficial in the general election when Democrats need to win over more moderate voters and independents.

The 37-year-old environmental justice advocate tells the BBC what he thinks of Harris as the VP pick. ""I understand black women in particular those who are labeled ambitious tend to only have negative things brought up about them. With Kamala as a vice-presidential nominee, it's 100% going to make the race more racially polarised. When Obama was campaigning they attacked Michelle and she wasnât even campaigning. I canât imagine what itâs going to be like for Senator Harris. Theyâre going to find reasons to attack her but I think itâs the job of those of us who are supportive to be very vocal on the other side and be a champion for her.

Mock exam results to be A-level 'safety net',"Schools in England can appeal for an upgrade if their students' A-level and GCSE results are lower than mock exams. The Department for Education has announced a last-minute ""triple lock"" - which could raise replacement grades for exams cancelled in the pandemic. It means pupils could have whichever result is highest from estimated grades, mocks or exams in the autumn. But the Ofqual exams watchdog says it cannot say how appeals over mocks might be verified until next week. Ofqual said in a statement it was ""working urgently"" to ""determine what standards of evidence will be required for the appeal"". The National Union of Students said using mock results risked ""making a mockery"" of the exam system. And head teachers attacked the change, the day before A-level results are published, as ""panicked and chaotic"". England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was a ""safety net"" for those getting estimated grades this summer. In Wales, in another ""guarantee"" over grades, Education Minister Kirsty Williams has promised that ""a learner's final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade"". The change means that if pupils get an estimated grade lower than their mock exam they can appeal - but this will have to be through their school, with the terms for approving appeals still to be decided by the exam watchdog, Ofqual. But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the move ""beggars belief"" because mock exams are carried out in many different ways and are not consistent enough to be used for A-level and GCSE results. ""The government doesn't appear to understand how mock exams work. They aren't a set of exams which all conform to the same standards. The clue is in the name 'mock',"" said Mr Barton. Changes being considered for A-levels in Wales Students want exams to be upgraded across the UK Scottish pupils have results upgraded Universities told to hold places while pupils appeal over grades How will exam results day work this year? West Sussex head teacher Jules White described the decision as a ""shambles"" - and a ""total botch job"". He said in some schools pupils might know in advance the specific topics on which they are going to be tested - and in other schools they might not have taken mocks before the lockdown. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the governmentâs handling of Thursday's A-level exam results âsmacks of incompetenceâ Other schools might be tough on marking mocks as a way of getting pupils to revise. To use such different circumstances for results ""defies logic and credibility,"" said Mr White. ""The use of mock exams results risks making a mockery of the whole system,"" said Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students. She warned there was a ""lack of a standard approach to mock exams"" and ""they are not taken by all candidates"". England: the key information for A-levels and GCSEs will be how pupils are ranked by their school and results in their schools and colleges in previous years. Plus a ""triple lock"" with the highest grade out of the allocated grade, an autumn written exam or a mock exam, dependent on a successful appeal through a school Vocational qualifications will have estimated results for some courses, but not the same ""triple lock"" Northern Irelandwill allow appeals based on mocks and includes AS-levels in deciding results Scotlandhas switched to using teachers' predicted grades Waleshas promised students that A-level results will not be lower than their AS-level results The move in England comes after 76,000 pupils in Scotland had their results upgraded after being lowered by a moderating system which critics claimed was a ""postcode lottery"" as it linked pupils' results with their schools' past performances. It drew accusations that high-achieving pupils in low-performing schools would lose out - and that this would particularly discriminate against young people in deprived areas. The Scottish government has apologised and results will now be based on teachers' predicted grades. Protests have changed exam grades in Scotland - now students want the same for the rest of the UK England's schools minister Nick Gibb told BBC Breakfast being able to appeal on the basis of their mock results was ""an extra safety net for a small group of pupils"". He rejected concerns about confusion and said he would ""apologise to nobody for finding solutions - even at the eleventh hour ""to stop students being disadvantaged. It will mean that mock exams will now have an impact on A-level and GCSE results in England and Northern Ireland, alongside how pupils are ranked on ability and the share of grades that their schools and colleges have achieved in recent years. England's exam regulator Ofqual said relying on teachers' predictions would have unfairly inflated results. Using teachers' predictions would have meant about 38% of entries would have been A* or A grades this year - considerably higher than the previous record of 27%. Vocational qualifications will have some estimated grades issued - but not the ""triple lock"" appeal system For vocational qualifications, such as BTECs,estimated grades are also being issued- but not for subjects which depend on tests for practical skills, which need to be carried out in person. The ""triple lock"" approach, linked to mocks and exams in the autumn, will not apply in the same way to vocational qualifications. The Welsh government has given A-level students a guarantee that their final results will not be lower than their AS-level grades - and they are initially lower a revised grade will be issued. Mary Bousted of the National Education Union warned students in different parts of the UK were now applying for the same university places with results based on ""completely different criteria and wildly different pass rates"". With A-level results only a day away, Universities UK wants ""urgent clarification"" about what these changes will mean for deciding on places. A-level results are going to be estimated this year after exams were cancelled Universities have been told if students miss out on grades, but their schools are appealing, places have to be kept open until that appeal has been decided. But the universities organisation says it is far from clear how this will work for appeals over mock exams - and is asking whether results based on mocks can be considered as having ""equal status"" in deciding who gets accepted or rejected. They also warn about the practical complications, such as trying to allocate accommodation. ""Never in recent memory have we been faced with such uncertainty and challenge on the eve of A-level and BTec results day,"" said Anja Hazebroek from the University of Hull. But it is still expected to be a good year for students looking for university places - with an anticipated fall in overseas students leaving many places to be filled. ""Those near-miss candidates, if they've dropped one or two grades, universities are being super-flexible about that,"" said Clare Marchant of the Ucas admissions service..

Students want exam results upgraded across UK,"Protests have changed exam grades in Scotland - now students want the same for the rest of the UK Students are calling for exam results across the UK to follow Scotland in ditching the moderation process that has lowered grades. The National Union of Students wants teachers' predicted grades to be used. A-level results are being published on Thursday - linked to how schools performed in previous years, in a way rejected as unfair in Scotland. England's exam watchdog said using teachers' predictions would mean inflated numbers of top grades. England's Department for Education has so far rejected changes to how replacement grades are calculated for exams cancelled by the pandemic. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has defended the system as ""fundamentally a fair one"". But NUS president Larissa Kennedy said switching to teachers' predicted grades and removing the moderation that pushed down grades in 125,000 exam entries in Scotland, was the ""least worst option available"". Scottish pupils have results upgraded Universities told to hold places while pupils appeal over grades How will exam results day work this year? A-level results to be higher this year, says watchdog The row in Scotland, which has ended in a government u-turn, was over the fairness of linking estimated grades to the performance of a school in previous years. It drew accusations that high-achieving pupils in low-performing schools would lose out - and that this would particularly discriminate against young people in deprived areas. But this is similar to the approach being used in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for A-level results being published this week. The NUS says that it will be unfair if ""thousands of students do not receive the grades they deserve because of where they live"". Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union said the decision in Scotland created ""huge problems"" for the government in England. She said it meant their students applying for UK university places with results based on ""completely different criteria and wildly different pass rates"". ""This will only increase the worries that students in England have about the fairness of the grades they will receive on Thursday,"" said Dr Bousted. England's exam watchdog Ofqual has warned that using teachers' predictions would push up grades to an extent that it would make it unfair for those with A-levels from previous years. The watchdog says that using teachers' predictions the proportion getting top grades would have risen by over 12 percentage points, so that about 38% of entries would have got A* or A grades, much higher than any previous year. Instead the watchdog has used a system of moderation with the biggest factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous results in a school. This gives limited influence to teachers' predictions and there is no direct link to how an individual pupil did in previous exams, such as their GCSE results. But if pupils miss out on a university place, but a school then appeals against the result, universities have been told to keep the place open until the appeal has been completed. Scottish school pupils have results upgraded Universities told to hold places open until appeal 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Profile: Who is Kamala Harris?,"Kamala Harris savoured the moment she became the first woman, and the first black and Asian American, to be vice-president-elect, with a very hearty laugh. In a video posted to her social media she shares the news with President-elect Joe Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" Her words are about him but the history of the moment is hers. Just over a year ago, as the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency, she launched a potent attack on Joe Biden over race during a debate. Many thought it inflicted a serious blow on his ambitions. But by the end of the year her campaign was dead and it was Mr Biden who returned the 56-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. What happens now? What Biden's victory means for rest of world US election results in maps and charts Election results in full ""It is a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris,"" says Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 and who has critiqued her run for the presidential nomination. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent."" What she has demonstrated from the moment she took the national stage with her pitch for the presidency - is grit. Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. Kamala as child with her mother and younger sister Maya She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Americast: Kamala Harris makes history Profile: Kamala Harris (audio) Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation."" They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa"" and the Martin Luther King  holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson says. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explains - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. She returned to address students at Howard in 2017 and  took them on a journey from the Ferguson race protests of 2014 to the halls of Capitol Hill in just one sentence: ""You students have joined the fight for justice - you protested. From the streets of Ferguson to the halls of the United States Congress, you have lived the words of James Baldwin, 'There is never a time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment, the time is always now.'"" But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". Shetold the Washington Post,externalin 2019, that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. In 2014, Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff - now a fixture at her campaign stops - and became stepmother to his two children. Last year shewrote an article for Elle magazine,externalabout the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. On becoming vice-president-elect, she is unlikely to lose this nickname but many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,"" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. ""Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible."" But from the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness."" Wit and humour is part of that armoury. The laugh she greeted the president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate -  to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.  She wasn't afraid of confrontation as in this Twitter exchange with Donald Trump Jr last October. ""Why is @KamalaHarris the only person that laughs at her jokes... always way to long and way too hard?"" Mr Trump's son asked. ""You wouldn't know a joke if one raised you,"" she wrote back. A simple burn on social media, but a popular shorthand for the kind of skills that meant a career in law and politics was a natural fit. Although her career as a prosecutor is what made her a politician, it brought with it political benefits and risks. She began work in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her election as California's junior US senator in 2017. Harris began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office in Oakland, California. But straddling the line between pleasing left-leaning California Democrats and being a politician for a nation where the left does not decide who gets to be president has been hard. She gained favour among progressives for her acerbic questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but as a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris? When Harris could draw a crowd of 20,000 Walking the fine line between the progressive and moderate wings of her party, she ended up appealing to neither. Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not really being progressive enough. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""Kamala is a cop"" became a common refrain on the campaign trail. But those same law enforcement credentials proved beneficial on the national stage when Democrats needed to win over more moderate voters and independents. She was ""someone with a law enforcement background, and perceived in her own state as being insufficiently progressive... and trying to project an inauthentic self"", Mr Duran says, but adds ""that looks very different in a vice-presidential slot"". As the US grapples with an ongoing racial reckoning and there is scrutiny over police brutality, Ms Harris has taken a front row seat, using her sizable microphone. Kamala Harris endorsed Joe Biden two months after quitting the race Majority of Americans don't support 'defunding' the police On talk shows she calls for changes to police practices across the US, on Twitter she calls for the arrests of the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American woman from Kentucky, and she speaks frequently about the need to dismantle systemic racism. She has the law enforcement background but she has often said that her identity makes her uniquely suited to represent those on the margins. Now she has the chance to do just that and from inside the White House. The US state looking to take down Trump Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris?

'She embraces her black and Indian roots',"US Senator Kamala Harris - chosen by Joe Biden as his Democratic vice-presidential candidate - is known as a prominent black politician. But she has also embraced her Indian roots. ""My name is pronounced ""comma-la"", like the punctuation mark,"" Kamala Harris writes in her 2018 autobiography, The Truths We Hold. The California senator, daughter of an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father, then explains the meaning of her Indian name. ""It means 'lotus flower', which is a symbol of significance in Indian culture. A lotus grows underwater, its flowers rising above the surface while the roots are planted firmly in the river bottom."" Early in life, young Kamala and her sister Maya grew up in a house filled with music by black American artists. Her mother would sing along to Aretha Franklin's early gospel, and her jazz-loving father, who taught economics at Stanford University, would play Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane on the turntable. Shyamala Gopalan and Donald Harris separated when Ms Harris was five. Raised primarily by her Hindu single mother, a cancer researcher and a civil rights activist, Kamala, Maya and Shyamala were known as ""Shyamala and the girls"". Her mother made sure her two daughters were aware of their background. Senator Kamala Harris and her sister, Maya Lakshmi Harris, are close ""My mother understood very well she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident black women,"" she wrote. ""Harris grew up embracing her Indian culture,but living a proudly African-American life,"" wrote the Washington Post last year.,external When she ran for a senate seat in 2015,the Economist magazine described her as the ""daughter of an Indian cancer researcher and a Jamaican economics professor,external, she is the first woman, first African-American and first Asian attorney general of California"". The 55-year-old senator says she has not grappled with her identity and describes herself simply as ""an American"". Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Who will Biden pick as his running mate? Diplomat and lightning rod - Biden's Susan Rice dilemma In many ways, say people who know her, Ms Harris straddles both communities effortlessly. Ina video with Indian-American comedian and actress Mindy Kaling, posted to the senator's Youtube page,externalduring Ms Harris's presidential run, the two cook Indian food together and chat about their shared south Indian background. Kaling says that while not everyone knows about that half of Ms Harris's heritage, other Indian-Americans she meets often bring up the fact. ""It's like our thing we're so excited about, to have you running for president,"" says Kaling. Kaling asks Ms Harris whether she was raised eating south Indian food. Ms Harris reels off names of Indian dishes made at home: ""Lots of rice and yogurt, potato curry, dal, lots of dal, idli"". She also says when she visited her mother's home in India, her grandfather would cheekily ask for French toast - made with eggs -  when her vegetarian grandmother was out (in India, eggs are considered non-vegetarian). In her book, she writes about making Indian biryani - and spaghetti Bolognese - at home. (On Tuesday, Kaling called Ms Harris's vice-presidential candidacy an ""exciting day...especially for my Black and Indian sisters""). When Ms Harris got married to Douglas Emhoff, a lawyer, in 2014, ""in keeping with [our] respective Indian and Jewish heritage"", she put a flower garland around her new husband's neck and he stomped on a glass. Ms Harris's public image has been more tied to her identity as an African-American politician, especially recently during the current conversation around race and the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. But Indian-Americans also view her as one of their own, her candidacy suggesting a potential wider recognition of the Indian and South Asian communities in the country. It is clear that her late mother was a big inspiration for Ms Harris. Gopalan was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai, the oldest of four children. She graduated from the University of Delhi at the age of 19, and applied to a graduate programme at Berkeley, ""a university she'd never seen, in a country she'd never visited"". She left India in 1958 to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology, and later became a breast cancer researcher. ""It's hard to me to imagine how difficult it must have been for her parents to let her go. Commercial jet travel was only just starting to spread globally. It wouldn't be a simple matter to stay in touch. Yet, when my mother asked permission to move to California, my grandparents didn't stay in the way,"" Ms Harris said. Ms Harris writes that her mother was expected to return home after completing her education, and to agree to an arranged marriage. ""But fate had other plans."" She met Kamala Harris's father and fell in love at Berkeley while participating in the civil rights movement. ""Her marriage - and her decision to stay in the US - were the ultimate acts of self-determination and love,"" Ms Harris writes. Gopalan picked up her doctorate degree at age 25 in 1964, the same year Ms Harris was born. Ms Harris writes her mother kept working right up to the moment of delivery of both her daughters  - ""in the first case her water broke when she was at the lab; and the other while she was making apple strudel"". Back in India, Gopalan had been raised in a household of ""political activism and civic leadership"". Her grandmother never attended high school, but was a community organiser taking in victims of domestic violence and educating women about contraception. Her grandfather, PV Gopalan, was a senior diplomat in the Indian government who lived in Zambia after it gained independence, and he helped settle refugees. In her book, she doesn't say too much about her trips to India. But she writes she is close to her mother's brother and two sisters, with whom she kept in touch through long distance calls and letters and periodic trips. Ms Harris's mother died in 2009, at age 70. US Democratic Party activists like Shekar Narasimhan say her candidacy would be ""seismic"" for the Indian-American community. ""She's a woman, she biracial, she will help win the election for Biden, she appeals to various communities and she's really smart."" ""Why should Indian-Americans not be proud of her? It's a signal that we are coming of age."" 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

""Harris grew up embracing her Indian culture,but living a proudly African-American life,"" wrote the Washington Post last year.,external When she ran for a senate seat in 2015,the Economist magazine described her as the ""daughter of an Indian cancer researcher and a Jamaican economics professor,external, she is the first woman, first African-American and first Asian attorney general of California"". The 55-year-old senator says she has not grappled with her identity and describes herself simply as ""an American"". Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Who will Biden pick as his running mate? Diplomat and lightning rod - Biden's Susan Rice dilemma In many ways, say people who know her, Ms Harris straddles both communities effortlessly. Ina video with Indian-American comedian and actress Mindy Kaling, posted to the senator's Youtube page,externalduring Ms Harris's presidential run, the two cook Indian food together and chat about their shared south Indian background. Kaling says that while not everyone knows about that half of Ms Harris's heritage, other Indian-Americans she meets often bring up the fact. ""It's like our thing we're so excited about, to have you running for president,"" says Kaling. Kaling asks Ms Harris whether she was raised eating south Indian food. Ms Harris reels off names of Indian dishes made at home: ""Lots of rice and yogurt, potato curry, dal, lots of dal, idli"". She also says when she visited her mother's home in India, her grandfather would cheekily ask for French toast - made with eggs -  when her vegetarian grandmother was out (in India, eggs are considered non-vegetarian). In her book, she writes about making Indian biryani - and spaghetti Bolognese - at home. (On Tuesday, Kaling called Ms Harris's vice-presidential candidacy an ""exciting day...especially for my Black and Indian sisters""). When Ms Harris got married to Douglas Emhoff, a lawyer, in 2014, ""in keeping with [our] respective Indian and Jewish heritage"", she put a flower garland around her new husband's neck and he stomped on a glass. Ms Harris's public image has been more tied to her identity as an African-American politician, especially recently during the current conversation around race and the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. But Indian-Americans also view her as one of their own, her candidacy suggesting a potential wider recognition of the Indian and South Asian communities in the country. It is clear that her late mother was a big inspiration for Ms Harris. Gopalan was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai, the oldest of four children. She graduated from the University of Delhi at the age of 19, and applied to a graduate programme at Berkeley, ""a university she'd never seen, in a country she'd never visited"". She left India in 1958 to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology, and later became a breast cancer researcher. ""It's hard to me to imagine how difficult it must have been for her parents to let her go. Commercial jet travel was only just starting to spread globally. It wouldn't be a simple matter to stay in touch. Yet, when my mother asked permission to move to California, my grandparents didn't stay in the way,"" Ms Harris said. Ms Harris writes that her mother was expected to return home after completing her education, and to agree to an arranged marriage. ""But fate had other plans."" She met Kamala Harris's father and fell in love at Berkeley while participating in the civil rights movement. ""Her marriage - and her decision to stay in the US - were the ultimate acts of self-determination and love,"" Ms Harris writes. Gopalan picked up her doctorate degree at age 25 in 1964, the same year Ms Harris was born. Ms Harris writes her mother kept working right up to the moment of delivery of both her daughters  - ""in the first case her water broke when she was at the lab; and the other while she was making apple strudel"". Back in India, Gopalan had been raised in a household of ""political activism and civic leadership"". Her grandmother never attended high school, but was a community organiser taking in victims of domestic violence and educating women about contraception. Her grandfather, PV Gopalan, was a senior diplomat in the Indian government who lived in Zambia after it gained independence, and he helped settle refugees. In her book, she doesn't say too much about her trips to India. But she writes she is close to her mother's brother and two sisters, with whom she kept in touch through long distance calls and letters and periodic trips. Ms Harris's mother died in 2009, at age 70. US Democratic Party activists like Shekar Narasimhan say her candidacy would be ""seismic"" for the Indian-American community. ""She's a woman, she biracial, she will help win the election for Biden, she appeals to various communities and she's really smart."" ""Why should Indian-Americans not be proud of her? It's a signal that we are coming of age."" 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Scottish school pupils have results upgradedThe Scottish government u-turn follows an outcry over the downgrading of 125,000 results.","Some pupils held protests against the downgrading Tens of thousands of school pupils are to have their exam results upgraded after the Scottish government agreed to accept teacher estimates of scores. The government U-turn follows an outcry from pupils after a moderation system saw 125,000 estimated results being downgraded. All results that were downgraded will now be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates. The move affects about 75,000 pupils across Scotland. There had been claims that the moderation system unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed as well. And many pupils said they had been given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams at the start of the year. Sturgeon 'sorry' over Scottish exam results Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland How grades were worked out for Scottish pupils Education Secretary John Swinney said he was sorry for the ""feeling of unfairness"" caused by the downgrading, adding that it was ""deeply regrettable we got this wrong"". Mr Swinney and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had both previously argued that basing grades on teacher estimates alone would damage the credibility of this year's results compared to previous years. Opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament are pushing for a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney, with Labour and the Conservatives calling for him to quit. This video can not be played Mr Swinney said 'all downgraded results will be withdrawn' The coronavirus lockdown saw all of Scotland's school exams cancelled for the first time ever, with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) drawing up a new system to calculate results. This was to be based on teacher estimates for each of their individual pupils, based on their work during the school year. But these estimates were then fed through an SQA moderation system, which downgraded the marks handed out by teachers to bring them closer in line with previous years. This sparked an outcry from students, particularly when it emerged that the Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds wasreduced by 15.2 percentage points,external, but only by 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Swinney both insisted last week that it would not be credible to base the results on teacher estimates alone Mr Swinney accepted there was ""clear anger and frustration from young people and their families"" about this, saying it had ""left many young people feeling their future had been determined by statistical modelling rather than their own ability"". He said he would now direct the SQA to reissue grades ""based solely on teacher or lecturer judgement"". Fresh certificates will be issued and the university admissions body informed of the changes so applications can be processed. A review of what has gone wrong will also be held, as well as a longer-term study of how future qualifications should balance exams and teacher assessments. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously said that accepting teacher estimates without moderation would lead to an exceptionally high pass rate compared to previous years, which she said would not be ""credible"". And Mr Swinney said last week that he believed teachers were often ""optimistic and aspirational"" about their pupils' abilities, while an exam system ""does something different"". This year's Higher pass rate will now sit at 89.2%, up 14.4 percentage points on 2019, while the Advanced Higher pass rate is at 93.1%, up 13.7 points from the previous year. At Ms Sturgeon's coronavirus briefing on Tuesday, she said she now believed concerns about the credibility of the unusually high pass rate were outweighed by the risk of students thinking the system was ""stacked against them"". Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended A Motherwell pupil whose dream of becoming a doctor appeared to have been shattered by downgraded Higher results will now get the five As that she needed. Olivia Biggartbelieved she was downgradedto two As and three Bs because her school is in a deprived area. The 16-year-old said she cheered atJohn Swinney's announcementthat she would now get her original estimated grades. She will now be able to apply for medical school in October. ""I am over the moon because finally there is justice and I can pursue my career,"" she said. ""I am happy with what he said - and glad he apologised to us."" Read more here Labour are pushing for a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney, likely to be held at Holyrood later in the week. The party's education spokesman Iain Gray said Mr Swinney had left students ""twisting in the wind for a week"", and urged him to ""take full responsibility for it happening in the first place and resign"". Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene said Mr Swinney's statement had been ""the longest resignation speech in history, minus the resignation"", and Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the education secretary was ""part of the problem, not the solution"". The Scottish Greens said Mr Swinney had ""refused to listen"" to earlier concerns, but welcomed that he had met the conditions the party had set for backing him in any confidence vote - likely securing his future. This decision in Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK - where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotland's students are given higher grades based on teachers' predictions, how will it be fair if they're competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly-boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupils' results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. And it raises the question which is more important, fairness for the individual, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotland's change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK - but like turning an ethical Rubik cube - any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England using teachers' predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average there will be some teachers who have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities that could fill court rooms for years. Until now England's Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised.

Farmer 'blackmailed Tesco over contaminated food',"Mr Wright claimed to be part of a group of disgruntled dairy farmers who had been underpaid by Tesco, the Old Bailey heard Two mothers came close to feeding their babies food laced with metal fragments after a sheep farmer tried to blackmail Tesco, a court heard. They found the metal in the jars of Heinz food, after Nigel Wright allegedly contaminated them in a Â£1.4m bitcoin plot, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Wright, 45 and of Lincolnshire, claimed he was a dairy farmer underpaid by Tesco, the jury heard. He denies two counts of contaminating goods and three counts of blackmail. Mr Wright, from Market Rasen, told Tesco he would reveal which stores he had planted the contaminated jars in, between May 2018 and February 2020, if they paid him in bitcoin, prosecutors said. He claimed to be one of a number of dairy farmers calling themselves ""Guy Brush and the Dairy Pirates"" who believed they had been underpaid, they said. More stories from Lincolnshire The court heard Morven Smith was feeding her 10-month-old son a jar of Heinz sweet and sour chicken baby food in December 2019 when she noticed the shards of a craft knife blade. Tesco then issued a national recall of all jars of the product, prompting Harpeet Kaur Singh to say she too had discovered fragments of metal when she was feeding her nine-month-old daughter. Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC told the jury: ""The defendant hoped to make himself rich by means of blackmail."" The two customers had found the slivers of metal in November and December 2019, in Rochdale and Lockerbie. There is no evidence any other products were actually contaminated, the court was told. Mr Wright also claimed salmonella and chemicals had been injected into cans and threatened to continue poisoning Tesco products if payment was not made, Mr Christopher said. In a separate charge of blackmail he is accused of demanding Â£150,000 worth of bitcoin from a driver with whom he had had a road rage altercation. A draft of messages sent to Tesco was found on his laptop along with photos of food tins, jars of baby food and slivers of metal, the court heard. Mr Wright admits various elements of the campaign but claims he was forced to do so by travellers who had demanded he give them Â£1m and he was acting in fear of his life. The trial continues.

Doreen Lawrence: Police have given up but I never will,"Racist murder victim Stephen Lawrence's mother has vowed she will never give up on her son despite the Met Police declaring investigations ""inactive"". Detectives have said all ""identified lines of inquiry have been completed"" into the 1993 killing. But Baroness Doreen Lawrence said: ""Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will. ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible... may not be brought to justice."" Stephen, 18, was killed in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of his murder in 2012. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said Mr Lawrence's family had been told about the latest operational developments. Duwayne Brooks, who was with Mr Lawrence on the night he was murdered, has also been told about the Met's decision, the force said. Ms Dick said she was sad that the Met had been ""unable to secure any further convictions for Stephen, his family and friends"". She added: ""The investigation has now moved to an 'inactive' phase, but I have given Stephen's family the assurance that we will continue to deal with any new information that comes to light."" Reacting to the announcement, Stephen's father, Neville, said he was disappointed but not surprised that it had been shelved by police. He said that he ""will always live with the hope that someone might come forward with evidence which will allow us to achieve full justice for Stephen"". Stephen's mother, Doreen, entered the House of Lords in 2013 after being made a peer by Labour Baroness Lawrence said: ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible for my son's racist killing may not be brought to justice. ""It is never too late to give a mother justice for the murder of her son. Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will."" She thanked senior investigating officer Clive Driscoll, who secured the convictions of Dobson and Norris after she had campaigned for nearly 20 years. ""Having Clive Driscoll on Stephen's case made all the difference to me and had he had the opportunity of continuing to investigate the murder there may have been more convictions,"" she said. The latest phase of the investigation into Stephen's murder began in January 2014, with Det Ch Insp Chris Le Pere taking over as the lead officer. Since then more than 240 new witness statements have been taken. Gary Dobson (left) and David Norris were convicted of murder in 2012 Another development in the case came from a woman's DNA profile obtained from a bag strap discarded at the scene of the murder. Despite a significant appeal for information and other investigations, that woman has not been identified. Officers also sought to identify a man who had been near the murder scene wearing a jacket with a distinctive V-shaped emblem. Police appealed for a man in a distinctive jacket, seen in an off-licence near to the murder scene, to come forward A third line of inquiry had been to track down a man who had called the BBC's Crimewatch in 2013 to say he had information about the attack. ""The appeal generated more than 40 lines of enquiry for the investigation team to work through,"" the Met said. ""Despite exhaustive efforts, officers were unable to trace the individuals."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Knife crime plans 'criminalise' children Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually Initial attempts to catch Mr Lawrence's killers were found to have been hampered by incompetence and institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police. No arrests were made for two weeks after his death, despite five suspects being named by anonymous informants. A bag strap was left on the road near to where Stephen Lawrence was attacked Dobson and Norris were among a group of up to six men accused of attacking Mr Lawrence and Mr Brooks. Critics of the case say others evaded justice. The Macpherson Report into the investigation into Mr Lawrence's death found that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police.

Putin: Russia's Covid-19 vaccine approved for use,"President Putin said one of his daughters had been vaccinated against the virus Russian President Vladimir Putin has said a locally developed vaccine for Covid-19 has been given regulatory approval after less than two months of testing on humans. Mr Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checks, adding that his daughter had already been given it. Officials have said they plan to start mass vaccination in October. Experts have raised concerns about the speed of Russia's work, suggesting that researchers might be cutting corners. Amid fears that safety could have been compromised, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged Russia last week to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. On Tuesday, the WHO said it had been in talks with Russian authorities about undertaking a review of the vaccine, which has been named Sputnik-V. Currently, the Russian vaccine is not among the WHO's list of six vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials, which involve more widespread testing in humans. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? Encouraging results in vaccine trials Russian spies target Covid-19 vaccine research More than 100 vaccines around the world are in early development, with some of those being tested on people in clinical trials. Despite rapid progress, most experts think any vaccine would not become widely available until mid-2021. Calling it a world first, President Putin said the vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, offered ""sustainable immunity"" against the coronavirus. He said he knew the vaccine was ""quite effective"", without giving further details, and stressed that it had passed ""all needed checks"". This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Mr Putin also said the vaccine had been given to one of his daughters, who was feeling fine despite a brief temperature increase. ""I think in this sense she took part in the experiment,"" Mr Putin said, without specifying which of his two daughters had received the vaccine. ""After the first injection her temperature was 38 degrees, the next day 37.5, and that was it. After the second injection her temperature went up slightly, then back to normal."" It is rare for President Putin to talk publicly about his daughters - named Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova in media reports - and their lives have been shrouded in secrecy. Russian scientists said early-stage trials of the vaccine had been completedand the results were a success. The Russian vaccine uses adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that usually causes the common cold, to trigger an immune response. In July Russian scientists announced that early-stage trials of a vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute had been completed But the vaccine's approval by Russian regulators comes before the completion of a larger study involving thousands of people, known as a phase-three trial. Experts consider these trials an essential part of the testing process. Despite this, Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Tuesday the vaccine had ""proven to be highly effective and safe"", hailing it as a big step towards ""humankind's victory"" over Covid-19. Russian officials said the vaccine had been named Sputnik-V, in honour of the world's first satellite. Sputnik is the Russian word for satellite. They have likened the search for a vaccine to the space race contested by the Soviet Union and the US during the Cold War. Russia has previously been accused by the UK, US and Canada of seeking to steal research related to Covid-19. Russia is fast-tracking its Covid-19 vaccine at an extraordinary pace. It began the first clinical trials on 17 June, months after teams in China, the US and Europe. Unlike other groups, the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow has not released any safety or immunity data from its studies. This makes it impossible for independent scientists to make an assessment. President Putin is keen to send a clear message to the world regarding the prowess of Russian science.  But simply being first is not enough. No Covid-19 vaccine being developed has yet been shown to offer protection against coronavirus. That central question remains unanswered. The progress Russia says it has made on a coronavirus vaccine has been met with scepticism by health officials and media outlets in the US and Europe. Last month, America's leading infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci expressed doubts about the rigour of the testing process in fast-track vaccine efforts in Russia and China. WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier has echoed those sentiments, telling reporters on 4 August: ""Sometimes individual researchers claim they have found something, which is of course, as such, great news. ""But between finding or having a clue of maybe having a vaccine that works, and having gone through all the stages, is a big difference."" Meanwhile the Moscow-based Association of Clinical Trials Organizations (Acto), which represents the world's top drug companies in Russia, urged the health ministry to postpone approval until after phase-three trials. Acto executive director Svetlana Zavidova told the Russian MedPortal site that a decision on mass vaccination had been carried out after a combined first- and second-phase tests on 76 people, and that it was impossible to confirm the efficacy of a drug on this basis.

LiveUS reacts to Biden's choice,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden named Kamala Harris as his running mate The California senator is the first black woman and first Asian-American to be chosen as a vice-presidential candidate Ms Harris was also the first woman to serve as California's attorney general Joe Biden will face Donald Trump in the US election on 3 November Mr Biden previously served as vice-president under Barack Obama Max Matza, Ritu Prasad, Ashitha Nagesh, Boer Deng and Holly Honderich That concludes our coverage of this history-making vice-presidential pick - thanks for joining us. California Senator Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden, a former vice-president himself, on the 2020 ticket for the Democrats. She's the first black woman and Asian-American woman to become a presidential running mate for a major US political party. Her selection has been met with praise from top Democrats, though some left-leaning members of the party have expressed concerns over her past as a prosecutor. We're expecting to hear from Biden and Harris at an event tomorrow. The Biden-Harris team will face President Donald Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, on 3 November. You can follow updates to the story of the Biden-Harris tickethere. Want more?Check out these features on Kamala Harris and the US election. Sarah Palin - the former Republican Alaska governor picked as John McCain's running mate in 2008 - has offered some words of advice to Kamala Harris. ""Climb upon Geraldine Ferraro's and my shoulders,"" Palin wrote on Instagram - referring to Geraldine Ferraro, America's first female vice-presidential nominee back in 1984. Harris now joins Ferraro and Palin as member's of a three-person club: the only female vice-presidential nominees of a major American political party. ""Out of the chute trust no one new,"" Palin wrote. ""Don't get muzzled - connect with media and voters in your own unique way. Some yahoos running campaigns will suffocate you with their own self-centred agenda so remember YOU were chosen for who YOU are."" And ""don't forget the women who came before you"".

On a day like today, many may ask how the two presidential candidates are doing as we inch closer to election day, 3 November 2020. National polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, but they're not necessarily a good way to predict the result of the election. In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton led in the polls and won nearly three million more votes than Donald Trump, but she still lost. That's because the US uses an electoral college system, so winning the most votes doesn't always win you the election. With that caveat aside, Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in national polls for most of the year. Biden has hovered around 50% in recent weeks and has had a 10-point lead on occasions. The BBC is keeping track of those polls hereand trying to work out what they can and can't tell us about who will win the election. Maya Harris, Kamala Harris's younger sister, said she was ""incredibly proud"" - and shared a photo from Kamala's (much) younger days. The Harris sisters are close, and the elder wrote in her autobiography that both of them were immersed in Oakland's black culture. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she said. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" Allow Twitter content?

Many former Biden and Harris rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have weighed in to offer their praise and congratulations on Twitter. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warrenwrote that she's known Harris a long time and that she's always been ""unafraid and an inspiration to millions of women who see themselves in her"". New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, another rising party star and black American, wrote: ""I'm proud to call Kamala Harris my dear friend and sister - and next year, I'll be even more proud to call her our vice-president.

This is history."" Amy Klobuchar, US Senator from Minnesota, said she was ""filled with joy"" that Harris is the nominee. ""This is a historic moment, and I know that her leadership, experience, and character will help move our country forward when she and Joe Biden take back the White House!"" Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigiegsaid Harris has fought ""tirelessly for justice, dignity and equality for All Americans"" and that he ""can't wait"" to call her vice-president. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg, former New York City mayor, said Harris was a ""smart choice who will be a strong partner in the White House"" while offering a criticism of President Trump, saying: ""The best executives know that you're only as good as the team you build. It's a lesson that clearly escaped our current president."" Asked again to react to Biden's vice-presidential announcement, Trump responds: ""Well I like Vice-President Mike Pence much better. He is solid as a rock."" ""I will take him over Kamala and the horrible way she treated Justice Kavanaugh,"" he says, referring to her grilling of the then-Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct as a teenager. ""I thought she was the meanest and most horrible and most disrespectful of anyone in the US senate,"" Trump continues. ""She's also known, from what I understand, the most liberal person in the US senate,"" he claims, saying that her progressive credentials will not serve to aid Biden's campaign for president.  Trump is now laying into Harris during his White House briefing. ""She is a person that has told many many stories that werenât true. Sheâs very big into raising taxes."" ""She wants to slash funds for our military at a level which nobody can even believe,"" he says. ""Sheâs against fracking. Sheâs against petroleum products,"" he continues, saying that her anti-fossil fuel believes could cost her in some states such as Pennsylvania. ""She's in favour of socialised medicine,"" he says, claiming that she wants to strip health insurance from 180m Americans. Trump claimed Harris was his ""number one draft pick"" to be named as Biden's running-mate. ""And we'll see how she works out. She did very very poorly in the primaries as you know,"" he says. He also said he would not forget Harris's assertive questioning of Brett Kavanaugh, one of Trump's picks for the Supreme Court who was accused of sexual misconduct, during the judge's confirmation hearing. Trump claimed the senator was ""extraordinarily nasty"" towards Kavanaugh, who was later confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.  Peyton Forte, 21, is a recent graduate at North Carolina
A&T State University. She tells the BBC what she thinks of Kamala Harris as
the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee. âTo have the first black woman vice-president in American
history â it looks good, it sounds good, but what can you do, sheâs not my
pick. I would have liked for Joe Biden to go for more of a
progressive, like Elizabeth Warren. Kamala doesnât shake the table enough for me in terms of her
demands for things that I hold dear, such as universal health care, the total
elimination of student debt and raising the minimum wage. I think that we kind of get carried away, especially as black
people, by the âfirst thisâ and âfirst thatâ, itâs just seen as a gigantic
milestone. But are you fighting for some of the values that the black community
holds dear? Are you actually speaking to fellow black folks about what theyâd
like to see? Iâm not thrilled, but it was a safe choice. Maybe in 2024, things
will be different.â Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington LaNitra Walker teaches African Americans studies As a presidential candidate, Kamala Harris went after Joe Biden during a debate, calling him out for his opposition to school busing in the 1970s and telling her own personal story about desegregation. ""Thatâs why sheâs a good choice,"" says George Mason Universityâs LaNitra Walker, a member of the affiliate faculty on African Americans studies. Ms Walker believes Harris would challenge Biden on issues and would bring an important perspective to the executive branch. The California senator attended Howard University, a historically black college and is âa voice for racial justice and the Black Lives Matter movementâ, says Ms Walker. On a personal level, she says she was thrilled to hear the announcement. She ran and told her eight-year-old son, Nathan, (pictured with her) explaining âhow historical it wasâ. She adds: âHe was just really excited to hear that thereâs a black leader on the presidential ticket.â President Donald Trump announced a last minute press conference after news emerged of the Democratic vice-presidential pick. He is speaking live from the White House briefing room now. âThe Democrats are being taken over by the radical leftâ the president claims, denouncing âlooting and riotingâ that has happened in cities run by majority Democrat government. He has yet to directly address Biden's choice for running mate, but is continuing to criticise Democrats, who he accuses of appointing prosecutors ""who side with the criminals"". Sanders and Harris in the first Democratic primary debate, which was 14 months ago Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who campaigned against both Biden and Harris to be the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has just tweeted his approval. ""Congratulations to@KamalaHarris,external, who will make history as our next Vice-President,"" says the self-described Democratic Socialist. ""She understands what it takes to stand up for working people, fight for health care for all, and take down the most corrupt administration in history,"" he continues. ""Letâs get to work and win."" However, not all of Sanders supports feel the same way, as indicated in the reactions to his tweet. Many view Harris as a ""cop"" who is far too cozy with law enforcement. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America's largest grassroots civil rights organisation, called Harris's selection as vice-presidential candidate a ""defining moment in US history"". ""Throughout the history of this nation, black women have been at the forefront of moving us toward a more representative and unified society,""says NAACP president Derrick Johnson,external. ""But their representation in the highest levels of government has never matched their unwavering participation in our democracy. Todayâs announcement of a black woman, Senator Kamala Harris, as the first vice-presidential candidate of a major political party, breaks down one of these barriers in historic proportions. ""That it comes at a time in which black Americans face dueling threats from a global health crisis and ingrained racism is all the more powerful."" Johnson said the moment - a ""culmination of the tireless work"" of other black women activists and lawmakers like Shirley Chisholm and Rosa Parks, was ""long overdue"", and every American, regardless of party, should be proud of this milestone. The NAACP also cautioned that coverage of Harris's candidacy should not ""decline into ugly racist and sexist stereotypes and attacks"". Aâkayla Sellers, 21, is a Democrat from South Carolina. She is about to attend her final year at the College of Charleston, and is part of the historically African American sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha - of which Kamala Harris was also a member. ""Iâm very impressed that not only did he choose a woman but an African-American woman - thatâs exciting. I was going for Kamala at the beginning. What attracted me to Kamala earlier on was that she was an African-American woman that worked from the ground up. I know a lot of African Americans werenât fans of Harris. Her prison reform stance. A big thing for her is that she really wanted to go for the African-American community and act like her policies were going to benefit us, but her track record didnât line up with her policy stances so it made a lot of people wary. Still, she can bring awareness to black issues, she can bring awareness to needs of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and awareness to the needs of minority students at predominately white institutions. She can bring awareness to the needs of affordable education. I can see a lot of great things coming from this."" Not everyone is as thrilled as high profile party members over having Kamala Harris on the ticket. Some more left-leaning Democrats have expressed concerns over picking the former prosecutor. Former Bernie Sanders campaign National Press Secretary Briahna Joy Gray echoed some of the early criticisms of Harris' presidential bid on Twitter, saying: ""We are in the midst of the largest protest movement in American history, the subject of which is excessive policing, and the Democratic party chose a 'top cop' and the author of the Joe Biden crime bill to save us from Trump."" It's a similar story in the replies to Senator Sanders' tweet congratulating Harris, with progressive Democrats criticising the party's pick of a ""cop"". Micah Uetricht, an author and deputy editor of the socialist Jacobin magazine, wrote: ""The largest uprising of any kind in American history just took place against exactly the kind of policies Kamala Harris has instituted throughout her political career - and that uprising made zero impact on Biden's decision-making for his VP pick. Pretty amazing."" Obama and Biden pictured in 2005, when both men were still US senators ""Choosing a vice-president is the first important decision a president makes,"" says former President Barack Obama in a statement. ""Joe Biden nailed this decision. By choosing Senator Kamala Harris as Americaâs next vice-president, heâs underscored his own judgment and character,"" he says. To remind you, Obama picked Biden to be his running mate in 2008 and Biden served under him for eight years as vice-president. ""Iâve known Senator Harris for a long time. She is more than prepared for the job,"" Obama continues. ""Sheâs spent her career defending our constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. Her own life story is one that I and so many others can see ourselves in: a story that says that no matter where you come from, what you look like, how you worship, or who you love, thereâs a place for you here."" He concludes: ""This is a good day for our country. Now letâs go win this thing."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington ""Joe Biden gets something right."" Thatâs what Georgetown Universityâs Marcia Chatelain, the author of South Side Girls: Growing Up in the Great Migration, and others say. Biden decision to pick Kamala Harris as a running mate, says Ms Chatelain, is a ârecognition of the moment of racial reckoning that the country is on nowâ. Ms Chatelain acknowledges that some progressives are unhappy with her work as a district attorney in California, pointing to âdraconianâ policies that she supported in the criminal justice system. But since then, Harris has changed, says Ms Chatelain. An experienced campaigner, Harris is now âpractised at defending her record and revising her positionsâ - skills that will serve her well during the final weeks of the campaign. Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, says she's ""thrilled"" to see Harris on the ticket - and knows ""she'll be a strong partner to Joe Biden"".

Harris began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. She became San Francisco's top prosecutor in 2003 and rose to become the first woman and first African American to serve as California's attorney general. In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, and used the momentum to propel her election victory as California's junior US senator in 2017. A self-described ""progressive prosecutor"", Harris has tried to emphasise more left-leaning parts of her legacy - requiring body cameras for some special agents at the California Department of Justice, the first state agency to adopt them, and launching a database that provided public access to crime statistics. However, some have questioned her commitment to left-wing policies. While her law enforcement background may have hindered her early 2020 campaign efforts, those same credentials could prove beneficial in the general election when Democrats need to win over more moderate voters and independents.

The 37-year-old environmental justice advocate tells the BBC what he thinks of Harris as the VP pick. ""I understand black women in particular those who are labeled ambitious tend to only have negative things brought up about them. With Kamala as a vice-presidential nominee, it's 100% going to make the race more racially polarised. When Obama was campaigning they attacked Michelle and she wasnât even campaigning. I canât imagine what itâs going to be like for Senator Harris. Theyâre going to find reasons to attack her but I think itâs the job of those of us who are supportive to be very vocal on the other side and be a champion for her. As a black person, I'm happy because I feel like we will finally have someone center the issues that matter to me.

'My medical dream is alive again',"Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended A Motherwell student whose dream of becoming a doctor was shattered by downgraded Higher results, is ""over the moon"" she will now get her five As. Olivia Biggart believed she was downgradedbecause her school is in a deprived area. The 16-year-old told BBC Scotland she cheered atJohn Swinney's announcementthat candidates' estimated grades would replace those awarded last week. She will now be able to apply for medical school in October. ""I am over the moon because finally there is justice and I can pursue my career,"" she said. ""I am happy with what he said - and glad he apologised to us."" She added: ""The only thing I didn't like is that students who were over-graded will keep their results but that will all even out over time. But overall I am happy."" ""I don't think he had many options. They couldn't reassess every single candidate's results. ""My dream to become a doctor is still alive."" Education Secretary John Swinney said pupils had shown ""tremendous resilience"" and apologised for the failed grading system The government U-turn follows an outcry from pupils after moderation by the SQA led to 125,000 estimated results being downgraded. All results that were downgraded will now be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates made by teachers. The move affects about 75,000 pupils across Scotland. Olivia achieved five As in her Higher prelims and was predicted by her teachers to be awarded the same. But despite having spent the summer studying for the University Clinical Aptitude Test (Ucat), she was awarded two As and three Bs. Without five As, she would have been unable to apply to medical school and would have to choose a completely different path. She is now looking forward to getting her head down and working towards entry exams. David Biggart believes his daughter would have been awarded different grades if her school was in an affluent area Despite it being what she described as ""the most stressful week of her life"" she still attended her medic preparation course on Friday. She said: ""So many people on the course were in exactly the same position as me and now they will all be able to continue."" John Swinney said in his speech that the Scottish government ""did not get it right"" and he apologised to the pupils involved. He said he had noted the anger and frustration as well as the impressive arguments made by young people like Olivia. Olivia's father David Biggart said: ""I think he has listened. I felt sorry for him because it takes a lot to stand up in parliament, in front of the kids he has let down, and say he got it wrong. ""It was quite humiliating. But show me a man that has never made a mistake and I will show you a man that's never worked. ""He is human and I take my hat off to him for saying he was wrong.

Joe Biden VP pick: Who is Kamala Harris?,"Kamala Harris savoured the moment she became the first woman, and the first black and Asian American, to be vice-president-elect, with a very hearty laugh. In a video posted to her social media she shares the news with President-elect Joe Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" Her words are about him but the history of the moment is hers. Just over a year ago, as the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency, she launched a potent attack on Joe Biden over race during a debate. Many thought it inflicted a serious blow on his ambitions. But by the end of the year her campaign was dead and it was Mr Biden who returned the 56-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. What happens now? What Biden's victory means for rest of world US election results in maps and charts Election results in full ""It is a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris,"" says Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 and who has critiqued her run for the presidential nomination. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent."" What she has demonstrated from the moment she took the national stage with her pitch for the presidency - is grit. Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. Kamala as child with her mother and younger sister Maya She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Americast: Kamala Harris makes history Profile: Kamala Harris (audio) Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation."" They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa"" and the Martin Luther King  holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson says. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explains - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. She returned to address students at Howard in 2017 and  took them on a journey from the Ferguson race protests of 2014 to the halls of Capitol Hill in just one sentence: ""You students have joined the fight for justice - you protested. From the streets of Ferguson to the halls of the United States Congress, you have lived the words of James Baldwin, 'There is never a time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment, the time is always now.'"" But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". Shetold the Washington Post,externalin 2019, that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. In 2014, Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff - now a fixture at her campaign stops - and became stepmother to his two children. Last year shewrote an article for Elle magazine,externalabout the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. On becoming vice-president-elect, she is unlikely to lose this nickname but many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,"" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. ""Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible."" But from the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness."" Wit and humour is part of that armoury. The laugh she greeted the president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate -  to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.  She wasn't afraid of confrontation as in this Twitter exchange with Donald Trump Jr last October. ""Why is @KamalaHarris the only person that laughs at her jokes... always way to long and way too hard?"" Mr Trump's son asked. ""You wouldn't know a joke if one raised you,"" she wrote back. A simple burn on social media, but a popular shorthand for the kind of skills that meant a career in law and politics was a natural fit. Although her career as a prosecutor is what made her a politician, it brought with it political benefits and risks. She began work in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her election as California's junior US senator in 2017. Harris began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office in Oakland, California. But straddling the line between pleasing left-leaning California Democrats and being a politician for a nation where the left does not decide who gets to be president has been hard. She gained favour among progressives for her acerbic questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but as a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris? When Harris could draw a crowd of 20,000 Walking the fine line between the progressive and moderate wings of her party, she ended up appealing to neither. Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not really being progressive enough. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""Kamala is a cop"" became a common refrain on the campaign trail. But those same law enforcement credentials proved beneficial on the national stage when Democrats needed to win over more moderate voters and independents. She was ""someone with a law enforcement background, and perceived in her own state as being insufficiently progressive... and trying to project an inauthentic self"", Mr Duran says, but adds ""that looks very different in a vice-presidential slot"". As the US grapples with an ongoing racial reckoning and there is scrutiny over police brutality, Ms Harris has taken a front row seat, using her sizable microphone. Kamala Harris endorsed Joe Biden two months after quitting the race Majority of Americans don't support 'defunding' the police On talk shows she calls for changes to police practices across the US, on Twitter she calls for the arrests of the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American woman from Kentucky, and she speaks frequently about the need to dismantle systemic racism. She has the law enforcement background but she has often said that her identity makes her uniquely suited to represent those on the margins. Now she has the chance to do just that and from inside the White House. The US state looking to take down Trump Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris?

Challenger fled Belarus 'for sake of her children',"This video can not be played Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: ""Not one life is worth what is happening now"" Belarus's main opposition leader says she took a ""very difficult decision"" to leave the country, after disputing an election result she claimed was rigged. On YouTube, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she did it for her children. A second video, apparently filmed when she was held in Minsk, was released. She was ""safe"" now in Lithuania, the country's foreign minister said. Clashes between protesters and police continued in Belarus for a third night. One demonstrator died the night before. There have been numerous reports of police brutality. On Tuesday evening, three BBC journalists, part of a filming crew in the capital Minsk, said they were attacked by law enforcement officials in black uniforms without insignia. They say two of the officials beat up the cameraman and tried to break the equipment. The reporters were not detained. President Alexander Lukashenko secured 80% of the vote in Sunday's poll, the electoral commission says, but there have been numerous claims of fraud. Mr Lukashenko, 65, who has ruled the former Soviet country since 1994, has described opposition supporters as ""sheep"" controlled from abroad. Five things you might not know about Belarus How protests shook up the election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure But Ms Tikhanovskaya has galvanised the opposition, which presented a stronger than ever challenge to the autocratic leader. The 37-year-old is a former teacher who was a stay-at-home mother until she entered the race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. When she attempted to register a complaint about the results - which gave her just 9.9% of the vote - on Monday, she was detained for seven hours. Allow Twitter content?

Profile: Svetlana Tikhanovskaya She said her decision to leave was taken ""completely independently"" and not influenced by anyone around her, even though many people would ""condemn"" or ""hate"" her for it. ""Not one life is worth what is happening now,"" she added. ""Children are the most important things in our lives."" Ms Tikhanovskaya sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the election. Earlier Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted about Ms Tikhanovskaya's whereabouts after rumours that she had disappeared. Allow Twitter content?

There had been concern for her on Monday but her campaign later said she was ""safe"", without saying where. Mr Linkevicius told the BBC: ""The option to leave the country was found as the only rational [one], I understand."" He added: ""It appears she visited the electoral committee, submitted a complaint... but she stayed. To [say] that she was visiting the electoral committee with a friendly visit would be too good. She was detained."" He later told a news conference that she had been given a one-year visa and a place to stay in Lithuania. An associate of the opposition leader said she had been escorted from the country by the authorities as part of a deal to allow the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz, who was arrested on Friday evening. Mr Linkevicius confirmed that the two women left the country together. A second video has now emerged which appears to have been taken during her detention. The images show her, head lowered, reading nervously from a script as she urges her supporters to ""obey the law"" and stay away from street protests. Ms Tikhanovskaya's allies said the video - which has been published by state media - had been recorded under pressure. This video can not be played A BBC team in Minsk encountered violent scenes on Monday night Analysis by Tatsiana Melnichuk, BBC Russian, Minsk Svetlana Tikhanovksaya is ""a hero"", according to opposition campaign partner Maria Kolesnikova, who says her departure does not diminish her achievements. Activists and many others here are convinced she left under pressure from Belarus authorities. They all think Ms Tikhanovskaya was given a text to read under pressure. After the 2010 election, state TV ran ""confessions"" from detained opposition activists that looked similar to what we saw on Tuesday. Many people I have spoken to in Minsk back Ms Tikhanovskaya all the way, saying she had no choice but to flee in order to protect her children, as her husband is in prison. But others believe she should have realised what she was getting into and how dangerous this could be. No-one doubts her good intentions or her sincerity. Protesters clashed with riot police in Minsk Protests in Minsk and other Belarusian cities broke out after the polls closed late on Sunday and continued on a large-scale for three consecutive nights. Riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse thousands of demonstrators rallying in the capital. The brutality of the crackdown has shocked observers as many of these weapons had not been used in Belarus before the weekend. Reports say some of the demonstrators fought back, throwing petrol bombs. Protesters also tried to build barricades. Officials say one demonstrator died on Monday when an explosive device went off in his hands - the first confirmed fatality since the clashes began. The internet has been ""significantly disrupted"" since the polls closed on Sunday, according to online monitor NetBlocks. In the last presidential election in 2015, Mr Lukashenko was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. Mr Lukashenko cast his ballot at a polling station in Minsk Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government this time has been in part fuelled by its response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease. Belarus, which has a population of 9.5 million, has reported nearly 70,000 cases and almost 600 deaths. Belarus in surprising presidential election battle.

Stilton drives wedge between UK-Japan Brexit deal,"A post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and Japan may have met an unlikely obstacle - stilton cheese. On Friday, the two sides said they hoped to agree the details of a post-Brexit trade agreement by the end of the month. The Department for International Trade said talks are ongoing. But progress has reportedly been blown off course after International Trade Secretary Liz Truss requested better terms for British blue cheeses. The Financial Times,which first reported that talks had hit a snag,external, said Ms Truss may be looking for a symbolic victory, as sales of blue cheese to Japan from the UK were only Â£102,000 last year. A better deal for the products may mean her department could claim a slightly more favourable deal than the one the EU secured with Japan last year, when the two sides secured a cut of â¬1bn of tariffs on food. Dairy and other food products are among the EU's biggest exports to Japan. Ms Truss is a long-term fan of UK produce. In 2014, when she was environment secretary she told the Conservative Party conference  it was a ""disgrace"" that ""we import two-thirds of our apples, nine-tenths of our pears, and two-thirds of our cheese"". The Department for International Trade declined to say more about the report, other than that talks are ongoing and point to Ms Truss's comments from Friday, when she said a consensus had been reached between the UK and Japan and said a deal was expected by the end of the month. ""Negotiations have been positive and productive, and we have reached consensus on the major elements of a deal - including ambitious provisions in areas like digital, data and financial services that go significantly beyond the EU-Japan deal,"" she said in a statement at the time. ""Our shared aim is to reach a formal agreement in principle by the end of August.""

Hit-and-run driver damages UK's Dutch roundabout,"The crossing where the beacon was hit has been blocked off The UK's first Dutch-style roundabout has had to close for three nights after it was damaged by a hit-and-run driver. The Â£2.3m roundabout on Fendon Road, Cambridge, which gives priority to cyclists and pedestrians, was damaged the day before it officially opened on 31 July. Cambridgeshire County Council said a driver hit a zebra crossing beacon and repairs began on Monday night. It is expected to fully reopen on Thursday. Work on the roundabout at the junction of Queen Edith's Way, one of the main routes to Addenbrooke's Hospital, began in September. Thecost of the project rose from an estimated Â£800,000 to Â£2.3m, which the council blamed on""unexpected utility work""and Covid-19. The Dutch-style designgives priority to cyclists and pedestrians,externalwith an inner ring for cars and an outer one for cyclists. The evening before it officially opened, while it was operating on temporary traffic lights, a car driver ""collided with a Belisha beacon column, causing it to lean slightly - the driver failed to stop at the scene"", a council spokesman said. He added: ""There have been no accidents at the new roundabout since it opened on July 31."" The roundabout will be closed between 20:00 BST and 06:00 BST with diversions signposted. The Dutch-style roundabout has narrow lanes and priority cycle lanes and pedestrian crossings The design is prolific in The Netherlands, which isrenowned for its investmentin cycling infrastructure. The idea is to ""influence slower approach and departure speeds"". There are zebra crossings for pedestrians on each of the four roundabout arms. Cyclists have their own outer-ring cycle path in contrasting red to give them equal priority with pedestrians.

"Patel takes on Ben and Jerry's over migrant boatsA Home Office source brands the ice cream ""overpriced junk food"" after comments on Channel crossings.UK Politics","Not a vanilla response: A source defended Priti Patel and hit out at the firm A source close to Home Secretary Priti Patel has branded Ben and Jerry's ice cream ""overpriced junk food"" after the company criticised her stance on cross-channel migrant crossings. In aseries of tweets,,externalthe firm urged her and others to show more ""humanity"", adding that ""people cannot be illegal"". The government earlier said the UK must consider changing asylum laws to deter migrants from crossing the Channel. More than 4,000 people have made the journey successfully this year. On Saturday, the Home Office asked defence chiefs to help make crossings of the dangerous route in small boats ""unviable"". PM considers law change for migrant removals Use of navy ships to stop migrants 'dangerous' What and where Channel migrants are escaping from Did Ben & Jerry's change Unilever? On Tuesday, the official Ben and Jerry's UK Twitter account posted several tweets tagging the home secretary, which began: ""Hey @PritiPatel, we think the real crisis is our lack of humanity for people fleeing war, climate change and torture."" It added: ""People wouldn't make dangerous journeys if they had any other choice."" The account also tweeted: ""People cannot be illegal."" It's not long ago that corporate statements on anything even tangentially political were anodyne to the point of being crashingly boring. And that's if they said anything at all. Well, things have changed. Brands, big and small, feel increasingly confident about getting stuck in on social media. The risks are obvious: in a space that revels in the pithy, binary and divisive, to proclaim is to pick a side - and so potentially irritate a sizeable chunk of your customers. So why do it? To stand up for something you believe in, sure - but also to act as a brand multiplier, to get people talking about you and your stuff. To catch the public mood, or at least a majority of it. The curious thing with this intervention, directly targeting the home secretary, is that Priti Patel has said very little publicly about what's been happening. But a Home Office source replied: ""Priti is working day and night to bring an end to these small boat crossings, which are facilitated by international criminal gangs and are rightly of serious concern to the British people. ""If that means upsetting the social media team for a brand of overpriced junk food, then so be it."" AndForeign Office minister James Cleverly tweeted:,external""Can I have a large scoop of statistically inaccurate virtue signalling with my grossly overpriced ice cream, please?"" Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield set up the company in 1978 Ben and Jerry's - founded in 1978 by best friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield - was purchased by the multinational company Unilever in 2000 for around $326m (Â£246m). Last week it announced it was extending a halt to paid advertising on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram until the end of this year, accusing the social media giants ofdoing too little to remove hateful content misinformation.,external Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was currently ""very, very difficult"" to legally return people who arrive in the UK from France using small boats.

We'll be back again tomorrow with all the latest coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. Today's live page was edited by Helier Cheung and Sarah Collerton and written by Doug Faulkner, David Walker, Gareth Evans, George Wright, Hazel Shearing and Georgina Rannard. Restrictions had been lifted in New Zealand after the country appeared to eliminate the virus Here's what you need to know this evening: Palestinians have been preparing to leave as the border crossing with Egypt opened for 72 hours Palestinians have been able to leave densely populated Gaza for the first time since March as its border crossing with Egypt opened on Tuesday. The Rafah crossing was closed in March when Hamas, who govern the Gaza strip, worried about the spread of the virus in the enclave with a poor health system. The crossing, which is the only one into Gaza that bypasses Israel, has opened for 72 days for two-way movement. Hundreds of people gathered at a waiting room before dawn, AFP reports. The PM said there are going to be ""bumpy months ahead"" It's almost the end of the day for the live page team. If you're just catching up, here's what you might have missed: Many universities closed during the pandemic, including the University of Delhi, India The disruption to young people's education caused by coronavirus is threatening their job prospects and heightening inequalities, a new report on the impact of the pandemic suggests. The International Labour Organization (ILO) report says 73% of young people in school, university or vocational training worldwide have had their education disrupted. Of the 73% whose education has been disrupted, 65% say they have learnt less during lockdown. Half now believe their studies will be delayed while 9% fear they may fail their exams or degree courses altogether. And, as ever, money plays a role: in wealthier countries, 65% of young people were taught in video lectures, whereas in poorer nations just 18% could continue to study online. Depression and anxiety among young people also appears to be increasing as job prospects decline, it suggested. âThe pandemic is inflicting multiple shocks on young people. It is not only destroying their jobs and employment prospects, but also disrupting their education and training and having serious impacts on their mental well-being. We cannot let this happen,â says ILO director-general Guy Ryder. Read stories of young people affected by anxiety and tips on how to cope. A further 102 people have died after contracting coronavirus in the UK, meaning the death toll now stands at 46,628, Public Health England says. And 1,148 new positive cases have been recorded, bringing the total number to 312,789. Steve Smith came up with the idea and was the first trader to pitch up in the pub car park A weekly market at a village pub in the English Midlands has been told to stop trading because it breaches an 800-year-old charter. Traders started selling vegetables, bread and flowers in the car park of The Free Trade Inn in Sileby, Leicestershire, during lockdown. But a charter signed by King Henry III in 1227 prohibits any market ""within six and two-thirds miles"" (10.8km) of nearby Loughborough. Charnwood Borough Council said it had to protect the town's market. Read the full story here. Sonia OxleyBBC Sport No job = no sport. A simple sum that may have far-reaching consequences at the top of women's sport. Most elite sportswomen (60%) earn less than Â£10,000 from their sport and have to work ""normal"" jobs to support themselves financially, according to aBBC survey. Some, like darts player Kirsty Chubb, have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving them with difficult choices to make about their future - with sport dropping lower in their priorities. For others, like weightlifter Olivia Blatch, the enforced break and lack of training has left them wondering if they can ever get back to the level they were at before. While the Premier League season ended behind closed doors and England's Test Cricket team have won a series of dramatic victories, much of women's sport is yet to restart. Athletes responding to theBBC Sport survey of elite British sportswomenfound that many felt women's sport had taken a backseat during the pandemic. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said supporting its return was a ""priority"" of his. Read Sonia Oxley's full report here. Russia claims it has developed the world's first coronavirus vaccine We've been reporting today thatRussia says it has developed a coronavirus vaccineand it has been approved for use after less than two months of testing on humans. In the past couple of hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has not received enough information about the vaccine to evaluate it. It had been suggested that Brazil would begin producing the vaccine, but that should not be done until more trials are completed, said Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of WHO. ""Any vaccine producer has to follow this procedure that guarantees it is safe and has the WHO's recommendation,"" he said in a briefing. Last week the WHO urged Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. We reported earlier that France's prime minister said the country has been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks, as he introduced stricter advice on wearing face masks and limits on large public gatherings. The French health ministry has released its daily figures. It reports 1,397 new infections in the past 24 hours - almost twice Monday's tally of 785, according to Reuters news agency. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent The decision toupgrade the exam results of tens of thousands of studentsin Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK, where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotlandâs students are given higher grades based on teachersâ predictions, how will it be fair if theyâre competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupilsâ results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. It raises the question of which is more important: fairness for individuals, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotlandâs change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK. But, like turning an ethical Rubik's cube, any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England, using teachersâ predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average some teachers will have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities. Until now, Englandâs Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised.

Brazil, which has been badly hit by the virus, is also developing its own vaccine Russia has given regulatory approval to a nationally-produced coronavirus vaccine after less than two months of testing on humans - although scientists in the West have raised concerns about the speed of its programme. Although Russia's claims are in the headlines today, it's not the only country working on vaccines.More than 100 vaccines are in early development,and more than 20 are being tested on people in clinical trials. The US has six vaccines in development and the country's leading infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said they could have a ""safe and effective"" treatment by the end of the year. The UK government has signed four coronavirus vaccine deals. They include 100 million doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and scientists at Oxford University and an experimental treatment being developed by drug giants GSK and Sanofi. On Tuesday, Indonesia and Mexico both announced late stage clinical trials for possible vaccines. Just catching up? Here's what you need to know about virus-related news in the UK: Around 10,000 people in southern France gathered for an illegal rave over the weekend France's Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country had been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks now as cases of coronavirus rise. Some 10,800 new cases have been identified there in the past week, according to the health ministry. Local authorities will be told to instruct citizens to wear masks in public spaces ""as far as possible"", Castex said in a press conference on Tuesday. Mask are currently obligatory on public transport, enclosed spaces such as shops and government offices, and Paris's main tourist sites. Castex also extended a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people until 30 October. The ban was originally scheduled to lift at the end of this month. At the weekend around 10,000 people gathered for an illegal rave on a mountain plateau in Lozere in the south of the country. The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) has announced an ""urgent package of measures"" following thepostponement of Celtic and Aberdeen matchesbecause players broke lockdown rules. Celtic defender Boli Bolingoliflew to Spain without the club's knowledge, failed to quarantine, then played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock. The previous weekendeight Aberdeen players broke lockdown regulationsby visiting a bar together. The new SPFL measures include plans to punish players who break the rules, an ""immediate"" player education programme and an agreement to take part in promotional activity for the Scottish government's coronavirus public awareness campaign FACTS. Sport Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ""This latest example indicates that the current arrangements are not working as intended, and so clearly additional steps now need to be taken to ensure that the necessity of strict compliance with the rules is fully and properly understood."" In the meantime Celtic and Aberdeen can train as usual, but training and friendly matches will not be allowed. Read the full story here. Reality Check Bangladesh says
it will stop providing daily updates on coronavirus infections and deaths in the
country from 12 August. Health Minister Zahid Maleque says this is because âwe believe
the infection rate is decreasing and the situation is getting under control.â In its latest weekly report, the World
Health Organization (WHO) says new cases in the country have dropped by 2.5% from the
previous week. But the headline figure masks a more complicated reality - reported cases are fluctuating widely, with daily tallies ranging
between 900 and 3,000 since the start of August, according to WHO data. This may well be to do with the amount of
testing being carried out, which has also fluctuated widely â from around
12,000 a day in July, then down to less than 4,000 in early August and back up
to 12,000 again. The
authorities attributed the drop in testing to severe flooding in July as well
as what they say is the unwillingness of people to get tested due to a lack of
trust in medical facilities. And
Bangladesh still has a high rate of positive tests - at the end of last week it
was nearly a quarter of all testswhich suggests that only a small proportion of the true number of infections is being picked up.,external  We know all about washing our hands, what to do when out in public and on public transport but one area which hasn't been discussed much is in the bedroom. Sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust has published advice on how people can lower their risk of catching Covid-19 while enjoying a healthy sex life. Some of the tips include wearing a mask and choosing positions which are not face-to-face during sex. It may sound tough, but people need to find a way ""to balance our need for sex and intimacy with the risks of the spread of Covid-19"", the Trust says. For more tips you can readthis story. Disney World in Florida will reduce its opening hours after receiving fewer visitors than expected Here's a round-up of top stories from the US, which remains the country with the highest number of cases in the world: Here is some more fromthat announcement in Holyrood. Scottish students who had their grades moderated up will not have their results downgraded and Education Secretary John Swinney says the government will work with universities to ensure that pupils are not ""crowded out"" of places they have been promised. It comes after the government had faced criticism over its grading of pupils after exams were cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Results were given based on teachers' estimations but also on the past performance of the school - leading to criticism that bright students in poorer schools could be unfairly penalised. More than 124,000 results were downgraded, with the pass rate for higher pupils from the most deprived areas of Scotland being reduced by 15.2%, compared with 6.9% in the most affluent parts of the country. Mr Swinney has faced calls to resign amid criticism from political opponents, parents, teachers and pupils. Nicola Sturgeon apologised to pupils yesterday and Mr Swinney, her deputy, followed suit today. He said: ""Perhaps our approach to maintaining standards for the 2020 cohort alongside every other year - even though 2020 is so unique - did not fully understand the trauma of Covid-19 for this year group and did not appreciate that a different approach might actually help to even things out.""

"Farmer 'blackmailed Tesco over contaminated food'Nigel Wright demanded Â£1.4m from the supermarket to reveal where the baby food was, a court hears.Lincolnshire","Mr Wright claimed to be part of a group of disgruntled dairy farmers who had been underpaid by Tesco, the Old Bailey heard Two mothers came close to feeding their babies food laced with metal fragments after a sheep farmer tried to blackmail Tesco, a court heard. They found the metal in the jars of Heinz food, after Nigel Wright allegedly contaminated them in a Â£1.4m bitcoin plot, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Wright, 45 and of Lincolnshire, claimed he was a dairy farmer underpaid by Tesco, the jury heard. He denies two counts of contaminating goods and three counts of blackmail. Mr Wright, from Market Rasen, told Tesco he would reveal which stores he had planted the contaminated jars in, between May 2018 and February 2020, if they paid him in bitcoin, prosecutors said. He claimed to be one of a number of dairy farmers calling themselves ""Guy Brush and the Dairy Pirates"" who believed they had been underpaid, they said. More stories from Lincolnshire The court heard Morven Smith was feeding her 10-month-old son a jar of Heinz sweet and sour chicken baby food in December 2019 when she noticed the shards of a craft knife blade. Tesco then issued a national recall of all jars of the product, prompting Harpeet Kaur Singh to say she too had discovered fragments of metal when she was feeding her nine-month-old daughter. Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC told the jury: ""The defendant hoped to make himself rich by means of blackmail."" The two customers had found the slivers of metal in November and December 2019, in Rochdale and Lockerbie. There is no evidence any other products were actually contaminated, the court was told. Mr Wright also claimed salmonella and chemicals had been injected into cans and threatened to continue poisoning Tesco products if payment was not made, Mr Christopher said. In a separate charge of blackmail he is accused of demanding Â£150,000 worth of bitcoin from a driver with whom he had had a road rage altercation. A draft of messages sent to Tesco was found on his laptop along with photos of food tins, jars of baby food and slivers of metal, the court heard. Mr Wright admits various elements of the campaign but claims he was forced to do so by travellers who had demanded he give them Â£1m and he was acting in fear of his life. The trial continues.

Challenger fled Belarus 'for sake of her children'Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is in Lithuania after disputing election results she says were rigged.Europe,"This video can not be played Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: ""Not one life is worth what is happening now"" Belarus's main opposition leader says she took a ""very difficult decision"" to leave the country, after disputing an election result she claimed was rigged. On YouTube, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she did it for her children. A second video, apparently filmed when she was held in Minsk, was released. She was ""safe"" now in Lithuania, the country's foreign minister said. Clashes between protesters and police continued in Belarus for a third night. One demonstrator died the night before. There have been numerous reports of police brutality. On Tuesday evening, three BBC journalists, part of a filming crew in the capital Minsk, said they were attacked by law enforcement officials in black uniforms without insignia. They say two of the officials beat up the cameraman and tried to break the equipment. The reporters were not detained. President Alexander Lukashenko secured 80% of the vote in Sunday's poll, the electoral commission says, but there have been numerous claims of fraud. Mr Lukashenko, 65, who has ruled the former Soviet country since 1994, has described opposition supporters as ""sheep"" controlled from abroad. Five things you might not know about Belarus How protests shook up the election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure But Ms Tikhanovskaya has galvanised the opposition, which presented a stronger than ever challenge to the autocratic leader. The 37-year-old is a former teacher who was a stay-at-home mother until she entered the race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. When she attempted to register a complaint about the results - which gave her just 9.9% of the vote - on Monday, she was detained for seven hours. Allow Twitter content?

In anemotional video address to supporters (in Russian),external, Ms Tikhanovskaya said she had overestimated her own strength. ""I thought that this campaign had really steeled me and given me so much strength that I could cope with anything,"" she said. ""But I guess I'm still the same weak woman that I was."" Profile: Svetlana Tikhanovskaya She said her decision to leave was taken ""completely independently"" and not influenced by anyone around her, even though many people would ""condemn"" or ""hate"" her for it. ""Not one life is worth what is happening now,"" she added. ""Children are the most important things in our lives."" Ms Tikhanovskaya sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the election. Earlier Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted about Ms Tikhanovskaya's whereabouts after rumours that she had disappeared. Allow Twitter content?

There had been concern for her on Monday but her campaign later said she was ""safe"", without saying where. Mr Linkevicius told the BBC: ""The option to leave the country was found as the only rational [one], I understand."" He added: ""It appears she visited the electoral committee, submitted a complaint... but she stayed. To [say] that she was visiting the electoral committee with a friendly visit would be too good. She was detained."" He later told a news conference that she had been given a one-year visa and a place to stay in Lithuania. An associate of the opposition leader said she had been escorted from the country by the authorities as part of a deal to allow the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz, who was arrested on Friday evening. Mr Linkevicius confirmed that the two women left the country together. A second video has now emerged which appears to have been taken during her detention. The images show her, head lowered, reading nervously from a script as she urges her supporters to ""obey the law"" and stay away from street protests. Ms Tikhanovskaya's allies said the video - which has been published by state media - had been recorded under pressure. This video can not be played A BBC team in Minsk encountered violent scenes on Monday night Analysis by Tatsiana Melnichuk, BBC Russian, Minsk Svetlana Tikhanovksaya is ""a hero"", according to opposition campaign partner Maria Kolesnikova, who says her departure does not diminish her achievements. Activists and many others here are convinced she left under pressure from Belarus authorities. They all think Ms Tikhanovskaya was given a text to read under pressure. After the 2010 election, state TV ran ""confessions"" from detained opposition activists that looked similar to what we saw on Tuesday. Many people I have spoken to in Minsk back Ms Tikhanovskaya all the way, saying she had no choice but to flee in order to protect her children, as her husband is in prison. But others believe she should have realised what she was getting into and how dangerous this could be. No-one doubts her good intentions or her sincerity. Protesters clashed with riot police in Minsk Protests in Minsk and other Belarusian cities broke out after the polls closed late on Sunday and continued on a large-scale for three consecutive nights. Riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse thousands of demonstrators rallying in the capital. The brutality of the crackdown has shocked observers as many of these weapons had not been used in Belarus before the weekend. Reports say some of the demonstrators fought back, throwing petrol bombs. Protesters also tried to build barricades. Officials say one demonstrator died on Monday when an explosive device went off in his hands - the first confirmed fatality since the clashes began. The internet has been ""significantly disrupted"" since the polls closed on Sunday, according to online monitor NetBlocks. In the last presidential election in 2015, Mr Lukashenko was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. Mr Lukashenko cast his ballot at a polling station in Minsk Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government this time has been in part fuelled by its response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease. Belarus, which has a population of 9.5 million, has reported nearly 70,000 cases and almost 600 deaths. Belarus in surprising presidential election battle.

"New Zealand records first virus cases in 102 daysFour family members test positive for Covid-19 in Auckland, where a lockdown has now been imposed.","Restrictions had been lifted in New Zealand after the country declared it had eliminated the virus New Zealand has put its largest city back into lockdown after recording four new Covid-19 cases, ending a 102-day streak without a local infection. A three-day lockdown was swiftly imposed in Auckland after the cases were confirmed. The four new cases are all members of a single family.Â None had travelled recently. The restrictions will come into effect on Wednesday, as authorities scramble to trace contacts of the family. Auckland residents will be asked to stay at home, large gatherings will be banned, non-essential businesses will be shut, and some social-distancing restrictions will be reintroduced in the rest of the country. The country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also on Wednesday deferred the dissolution of parliament, following the latest Covid-19 cases. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has delayed the dissolution of parliament The dissolution of parliament, which is required to make way for a general election, has now been deferred until Monday. Ms Ardern said no decision had yet been made on postponing the election - originally scheduled for 19 September. ""We have some time to work through that,"" she said, according to a TVNZ report. New Zealand has fared better than other countries, recording 1,220 confirmed cases and 22 deaths since the virus arrived in late February. New Zealand gets its coffee back How NZ's 'team of five million' took on Covid-19 New Zealand went 'hard and early' to beat Covid-19 Before Tuesday, New Zealand had gone 102 days without recording a locally transmitted case of Covid-19, one of the few countries to reach such a milestone. All 22 active cases of the virus before Tuesday's announcement were among returning travellers quarantined in isolation facilities. Praised internationally for its handling of the pandemic, the country's government had lifted almost all of its lockdown restrictions, first imposed in March. An early lockdown, tough border restrictions, effective health messaging and an aggressive test-and-trace programme have all been credited with virtually eliminating the virus in the country. But as infections continue to rise across the world, surpassing 20 million globally on Tuesday, New Zealand officials have warned against complacency. This video can not be played Epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker: ""New Zealand will get rid of the virus again"" Announcing the lockdown, Ms Ardern said it was necessary to go hard and go early to stamp out the virus. Auckland - a city of around 1.6 million people - would move to level three restrictions from 12:00 local time (01:00 BST) on Wednesday as a ""precautionary approach"", she said. The prime minister said the rest of the country would move to level two ofNew Zealand's 4-tier alert system of measures against Covid-19,external. ""This is something we have prepared for,"" Ms Ardern said at a news conference. ""We have had 102 days and it was easy to feel New Zealand was out of the woods. No country has gone as far as we did without having a resurgence. And because we were the only ones, we had to plan. And we have planned,"" she said. Director-General of Health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said at least three days of lockdown were needed in Auckland to trace the source of the new cases. ""We're expecting to see other cases,"" Dr Bloomfield said. ""We want to find those other cases as soon as possible and identify or isolate any contacts."" Shoppers were seen queuing at supermarkets after the lockdown was announced Michael Baker, professor of Public Health at the University of Otago, told BBC's Newsnight programme that even with the most successful strategies in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak ""one thing you have to plan for is setbacks"". ""I think New Zealand will succeed and get rid of the virus,"" he added. In anticipation of a pre-lockdown rush to supermarkets, Ms Ardern and the mayor of Auckland, Phil Goff, called for calm, saying there was no need to panic-buy. Despite their pleas, large crowds of shoppers were seen queuing at supermarkets on Tuesday night, as they attempted to stock up before lockdown. One video posted to social media shows customers streaming through the door of a supermarket as a security guard tries to prevent them from entering. Allow Twitter content?

The World Health Organization (WHO) had hailed New Zealand as an example to others for having ""successfully eliminated community transmission"". But other countries have had early success in suppressing the virus, only to see infections rise again after lifting lockdown restrictions that damaged the economy. Vietnam went 99 days with no community transmission until July, when a 57-year-old man in Da Nang tested positive for the virus. By the end of July, Da Nang was the epicentre of a new coronavirus outbreak, leading to the country's first coronavirus death since the pandemic began.

If you're just catching up, here's what you might have missed: Many universities closed during the pandemic, including the University of Delhi, India The disruption to young people's education caused by coronavirus is threatening their job prospects and heightening inequalities, a new report on the impact of the pandemic suggests. The International Labour Organization (ILO) report says 73% of young people in school, university or vocational training worldwide have had their education disrupted. Of the 73% whose education has been disrupted, 65% say they have learnt less during lockdown. Half now believe their studies will be delayed while 9% fear they may fail their exams or degree courses altogether. And, as ever, money plays a role: in wealthier countries, 65% of young people were taught in video lectures, whereas in poorer nations just 18% could continue to study online. Depression and anxiety among young people also appears to be increasing as job prospects decline, it suggested. âThe pandemic is inflicting multiple shocks on young people. It is not only destroying their jobs and employment prospects, but also disrupting their education and training and having serious impacts on their mental well-being.

And 1,148 new positive cases have been recorded, bringing the total number to 312,789. Steve Smith came up with the idea and was the first trader to pitch up in the pub car park A weekly market at a village pub in the English Midlands has been told to stop trading because it breaches an 800-year-old charter. Traders started selling vegetables, bread and flowers in the car park of The Free Trade Inn in Sileby, Leicestershire, during lockdown. But a charter signed by King Henry III in 1227 prohibits any market ""within six and two-thirds miles"" (10.8km) of nearby Loughborough.

A simple sum that may have far-reaching consequences at the top of women's sport. Most elite sportswomen (60%) earn less than Â£10,000 from their sport and have to work ""normal"" jobs to support themselves financially, according to aBBC survey. Some, like darts player Kirsty Chubb, have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving them with difficult choices to make about their future - with sport dropping lower in their priorities. For others, like weightlifter Olivia Blatch, the enforced break and lack of training has left them wondering if they can ever get back to the level they were at before. While the Premier League season ended behind closed doors and England's Test Cricket team have won a series of dramatic victories, much of women's sport is yet to restart. Athletes responding to theBBC Sport survey of elite British sportswomenfound that many felt women's sport had taken a backseat during the pandemic. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said supporting its return was a ""priority"" of his. Read Sonia Oxley's full report here. Russia claims it has developed the world's first coronavirus vaccine We've been reporting today thatRussia says it has developed a coronavirus vaccineand it has been approved for use after less than two months of testing on humans. In the past couple of hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has not received enough information about the vaccine to evaluate it. It had been suggested that Brazil would begin producing the vaccine, but that should not be done until more trials are completed, said Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of WHO. ""Any vaccine producer has to follow this procedure that guarantees it is safe and has the WHO's recommendation,"" he said in a briefing. Last week the WHO urged Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. We reported earlier that France's prime minister said the country has been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks, as he introduced stricter advice on wearing face masks and limits on large public gatherings. The French health ministry has released its daily figures. It reports 1,397 new infections in the past 24 hours - almost twice Monday's tally of 785, according to Reuters news agency. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent The decision toupgrade the exam results of tens of thousands of studentsin Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK, where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotlandâs students are given higher grades based on teachersâ predictions, how will it be fair if theyâre competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupilsâ results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. It raises the question of which is more important: fairness for individuals, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotlandâs change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK. But, like turning an ethical Rubik's cube, any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England, using teachersâ predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average some teachers will have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities. Until now, Englandâs Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised.

Brazil, which has been badly hit by the virus, is also developing its own vaccine Russia has given regulatory approval to a nationally-produced coronavirus vaccine after less than two months of testing on humans - although scientists in the West have raised concerns about the speed of its programme. Although Russia's claims are in the headlines today, it's not the only country working on vaccines.More than 100 vaccines are in early development,and more than 20 are being tested on people in clinical trials. The US has six vaccines in development and the country's leading infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said they could have a ""safe and effective"" treatment by the end of the year. The UK government has signed four coronavirus vaccine deals. They include 100 million doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and scientists at Oxford University and an experimental treatment being developed by drug giants GSK and Sanofi. On Tuesday, Indonesia and Mexico both announced late stage clinical trials for possible vaccines. Just catching up? Here's what you need to know about virus-related news in the UK: Around 10,000 people in southern France gathered for an illegal rave over the weekend France's Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country had been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks now as cases of coronavirus rise. Some 10,800 new cases have been identified there in the past week, according to the health ministry. Local authorities will be told to instruct citizens to wear masks in public spaces ""as far as possible"", Castex said in a press conference on Tuesday. Mask are currently obligatory on public transport, enclosed spaces such as shops and government offices, and Paris's main tourist sites. Castex also extended a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people until 30 October. The ban was originally scheduled to lift at the end of this month. At the weekend around 10,000 people gathered for an illegal rave on a mountain plateau in Lozere in the south of the country.

In the meantime Celtic and Aberdeen can train as usual, but training and friendly matches will not be allowed. Read the full story here. Reality Check Bangladesh says
it will stop providing daily updates on coronavirus infections and deaths in the
country from 12 August. Health Minister Zahid Maleque says this is because âwe believe
the infection rate is decreasing and the situation is getting under control.â In its latest weekly report, the World
Health Organization (WHO) says new cases in the country have dropped by 2.5% from the
previous week. But the headline figure masks a more complicated reality - reported cases are fluctuating widely, with daily tallies ranging
between 900 and 3,000 since the start of August, according to WHO data. This may well be to do with the amount of
testing being carried out, which has also fluctuated widely â from around
12,000 a day in July, then down to less than 4,000 in early August and back up
to 12,000 again. The
authorities attributed the drop in testing to severe flooding in July as well
as what they say is the unwillingness of people to get tested due to a lack of
trust in medical facilities. And
Bangladesh still has a high rate of positive tests - at the end of last week it
was nearly a quarter of all testswhich suggests that only a small proportion of the true number of infections is being picked up.,external  We know all about washing our hands, what to do when out in public and on public transport but one area which hasn't been discussed much is in the bedroom. Sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust has published advice on how people can lower their risk of catching Covid-19 while enjoying a healthy sex life.

Disney World in Florida will reduce its opening hours after receiving fewer visitors than expected Here's a round-up of top stories from the US, which remains the country with the highest number of cases in the world: Here is some more fromthat announcement in Holyrood. Scottish students who had their grades moderated up will not have their results downgraded and Education Secretary John Swinney says the government will work with universities to ensure that pupils are not ""crowded out"" of places they have been promised. It comes after the government had faced criticism over its grading of pupils after exams were cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Results were given based on teachers' estimations but also on the past performance of the school - leading to criticism that bright students in poorer schools could be unfairly penalised. More than 124,000 results were downgraded, with the pass rate for higher pupils from the most deprived areas of Scotland being reduced by 15.2%, compared with 6.9% in the most affluent parts of the country. Mr Swinney has faced calls to resign amid criticism from political opponents, parents, teachers and pupils. Nicola Sturgeon apologised to pupils yesterday and Mr Swinney, her deputy, followed suit today. He said: ""Perhaps our approach to maintaining standards for the 2020 cohort alongside every other year - even though 2020 is so unique - did not fully understand the trauma of Covid-19 for this year group and did not appreciate that a different approach might actually help to even things out.""

Students want exam results upgrade across UKNational Union of Students says Scotland's exam changes must be applied to A-levels for fairness.Family & Education,"Protests have changed exam grades in Scotland - now students want the same for the rest of the UK Students are calling for exam results across the UK to follow Scotland in ditching the moderation process that has lowered grades. The National Union of Students wants teachers' predicted grades to be used. A-level results are being published on Thursday - linked to how schools performed in previous years, in a way rejected as unfair in Scotland. England's exam watchdog said using teachers' predictions would mean inflated numbers of top grades. England's Department for Education has so far rejected changes to how replacement grades are calculated for exams cancelled by the pandemic. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has defended the system as ""fundamentally a fair one"".

Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union said the decision in Scotland created ""huge problems"" for the government in England.

""This will only increase the worries that students in England have about the fairness of the grades they will receive on Thursday,"" said Dr Bousted. England's exam watchdog Ofqual has warned that using teachers' predictions would push up grades to an extent that it would make it unfair for those with A-levels from previous years. The watchdog says that using teachers' predictions the proportion getting top grades would have risen by over 12 percentage points, so that about 38% of entries would have got A* or A grades, much higher than any previous year. Instead the watchdog has used a system of moderation with the biggest factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous results in a school.

Beach party organiser pays Â£750 to cleanup charity,"People criticised the gathering at Greatstone beach on social media Organisers of a beach party that ended in violence and left waste strewn across a Kent beach have pledged Â£750 towards a litter-picking charity. A row has continued on social media about events at the Greatstone beach ""cookout"" on Sunday. Four police officers were injured and a man was arrested after the party. Eric Brown, from Litter Picking Watch Romney Marsh, said organisers had contacted the group and he urged people to ""move on"". On Twitter, a video has been posted of what has been described as ""road rage madness"" showing a car reversing and a police officer ending up on the ground. Some have hit out at the lack of social distancing, the rubbish on the beach, and questionedclaims by the organiser the event was for under-privileged youth from London. Others have pointed to the public apology given by Wayne Williams, director of Flavour Boss restaurant in Croydon, who organised the event. Organiser Wayne Williams claimed many more people turned up to the party than were expected Mr Brown wrote onFacebook,external: ""A member of our group has been in contact with the organisers of yesterday's beach party. ""Firstly they would like to say that this wasn't what they intended to happen or planned and would like to apologise to everyone who was affected by what went on. ""They have promised a very generous donation of Â£750 to our charitable group 'Litter Picking Watch Romney Marsh' to help fund this and any further organised litter picks the group may have."" He said the event had left local people feeling intimidated and threatened, but he added: ""Nobody's perfect, mistakes were made, good intentions and all that."" Mr Brown wrote that the restaurant, a family business, had received threats against them and had apologised profusely. He thanked everyone who took part in the beach cleanup and said: ""We need to bury the hatchet and move on."" Susan Pilcher posted on Twitter that a lively afternoon turned into an ""ugly evening"" Kent Police said it was continuing to investigate the disturbance. One officer was injured in a collision with a car, and the other three were hurt during an arrest, when it is alleged that bottles were thrown, a police spokeswoman said. All four were treated at the scene by paramedics. The 29-year-old London man who was arrested received hospital treatment for an eye injury and remains in custody, she added.

Lawrence murder investigation declared 'inactive',"Racist murder victim Stephen Lawrence's mother has vowed she will never give up on her son despite the Met Police declaring investigations ""inactive"". Detectives have said all ""identified lines of inquiry have been completed"" into the 1993 killing. But Baroness Doreen Lawrence said: ""Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will. ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible... may not be brought to justice."" Stephen, 18, was killed in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.

Duwayne Brooks, who was with Mr Lawrence on the night he was murdered, has also been told about the Met's decision, the force said. Ms Dick said she was sad that the Met had been ""unable to secure any further convictions for Stephen, his family and friends"". She added: ""The investigation has now moved to an 'inactive' phase, but I have given Stephen's family the assurance that we will continue to deal with any new information that comes to light.""

Meet the man who took on a police force and won,"Ed Bridges has had his image captured twice by AFR technology, which he said breached his human rights What leads a man to take a police force to the High Court? Father-of-two Ed Bridges decided to contact civil rights group Liberty after twice being caught on camera by South Wales Police's automatic facial recognition (AFR) van. ""I didn't wake up one morning and think, you know what I really want to take my local police force to court,"" he said. ""It wasn't the case that I had planned to get particularly involved in, but it developed organically."" On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal ruled the use ofautomatic facial recognition (AFR) technology by South Wales Police was unlawful. Mr Bridges, a former Liberal Democrat councillor for Gabalfa in Cardiff says his image was first captured while he was on his lunch break in Cardiff city centre in 2017. But it was after it happened for a second time, a few months later while he was on a peaceful protest at an arms' fayre at Cardiff International Arena, that he decided to take action. ""On that occasion the facial recognition van was parked across the street from us,"" he said. Mr Bridges is a former Liberal Democrat councillor for Gabalfa in Cardiff ""We felt it was done to try and deter us from using our rights to peaceful protest. ""I take the view that in this country we have policing by consent and the police should be supporting our right to free protest, rather than trying to intimidate protesters. ""And so it was at that point that I got in touch with Liberty."" The technology does not capture and store the images of those who are not on a watchlist - something Mr Bridges, who works in public affairs, feels the force had not communicated effectively to the public. ""I certainly think South Wales Police might have made life a lot easier for themselves if they had done a proper public consultation,"" he said. ""I would rather not have to bring this case. But we brought it because there was no other route for us to challenge the way that this technology is being used,"" he said. ""As a law abiding member of the public who just wants to have their privacy respected, I feel that this is oppressive mass surveillance being deployed on our streets."" The 37-year-old, who crowd funded towards the costs of the legal action, said he wanted the UK government to act to ensure ""discriminatory technology like this is banned for good"". ""We have policing by consent in this country,"" he said. A facial recognition camera on a police van Police demonstrated the technology when it was first introduced ""The police need to have the support of the public in what they do and my concern is that by using a technology that is discriminatory and not being used in accordance with the law, that actually the police then lose the support of the public. And that's not in anyone's interest."" He is sympathetic to the task facing UK police forces: ""Our argument has always been that we recognise the police are doing a difficult job with dwindling resources, but there is a balance to be struck between their need to fight crime and the public's need to feel reassured, and that their rights are being respected. ""The court of appeal was really clear that that balance has not been struck properly at the moment."" But could he ever have imagined that a decision made at a protest would lead to a landmark ruling? ""I'm not sure at the start I realised just how significant that the case was going to be,"" he said. ""But what matters, really, is that the point of legal principle that we helped to demonstrate. ""I'm very pleased to have brought it and to have made a small mark on our legal history, but it's the legacy of the case that I hope will matter.""

"Debenhams to cut 2,500 more jobs amid pandemic","Struggling department store group Debenhams says it will cut 2,500 more jobs as it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. This is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its workforce. The cuts will be mainly across its UK stores and distribution centre, but it said no new shops were slated to shut. Shop workers' union Usdaw reacted angrily to the news, saying legal procedures had not been followed. By law, mass redundancies have to be subject to a consultation period. Usdaw said it was preparing a legal challenge on behalf of members affected. ""We have been contacted by members who say they are being made redundant by conference call, with no meaningful consultation or proper notice period, as required by law,"" said union national officer Dave Gill. ""That is an appalling way to treat staff."" Debenhams, which is currently in administration, declined to comment but its administrators, FRP, said consultation had not been possible as the retailer was insolvent and had ""limited"" options. A spokesman said: ""Those affected by redundancy will take no particular comfort from this, but the steps taken are in response to an unpredictable and challenging trading environment and aim to ensure the future viability of the business, while also meeting wider statutory obligations."" In April, Debenhams fell into administration for the second time in a year as coronavirus heaped pressure on the business. The firm said the current trading environment for retailers was still ""a long way from returning to normal"". How have you been affected by job losses at Debenhams? Tell us about your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Earlier this year, it said 20 of its stores would remain permanently closed because of the impact of the pandemic. Debenhams said on Tuesday: ""Such difficult decisions are being taken by many retailers right now, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to give Debenhams every chance of a viable future. ""We have to ensure our store costs are aligned with realistic expectations,"" it added. The chain said that people affected had been informed and thanked them for their ""service and commitment"". ""We have successfully reopened 124 stores post-lockdown, and these are currently trading ahead of management expectations,"" it said. Debenhams could remain in administration for the rest of this year, as lenders wait to see how it performs post-lockdown and in the crucial Christmas trading period. Like many of its competitors, the retailer was already ailing before the pandemic forced it to suspend trading at its department stores. The news of the latest job cuts came after the British Retail Consortium saidthe number of visits to High Streets was still down significantlyas people shopped online instead. The BRC said some retailers were continuing to struggle because of the coronavirus crisis. It made a fresh call for government help with rents. Other High Street names have also announced job losses as they fight to stay afloat. Last week,WH Smith said it was cutting 1,500 jobs- 11% of its workforce - after the lockdown caused sales to plummet. DW Sports, John Lewis, Marks and Spencer, Boots and Selfridges are among other big names to announce redundancies.

Beirut holds vigil to mourn explosion victims,"This video can not be played Crowds in Beirut hold a minute of silence, exactly one week after a huge blast in the port area of the city People in Beirut have attended a vigil for the more than 200 victims of the huge explosion that devastated the Lebanese capital a week ago. A crowd stood in silence near the ruins of the city's port as a Muslim call to prayer was broadcast and church bells tolled at 18:08 (15:08 GMT). That was the exact time when 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a port warehouse detonated. There has been outrage that so much hazardous material was kept there. The Lebanese government's resignation on Monday failed to pacify protesters, who clashed with police in central Beirut for a third consecutive night. This video can not be played Starting with the epicentre, we follow how the 4 August blast ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt Lebanon was already struggling with an unprecedented economic crisis before the disaster, with families pushed into poverty and hunger. Since October, protesters have been demanding the complete overhaul of the political system, which they blame for government corruption and mismanagement. This video can not be played The BBC's Quentin Sommerville speaks to the fiancÃ© of Sahar Fares, a firefighter medic who died in the blast Prime Minister Hassan Diab, a university professor who took office in January with the support of the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and its allies following the resignation of the previous government, announced his cabinet's resignation in a televised address on Monday night. He avoided taking responsibility for last week's blast, blaming it on the entrenched political elite. ""Their corruption created this tragedy,"" he said. ""Between us and change stands a thick wall protected by their dirty tactics."" Mr Diab said that his caretaker administration would ""follow the will of the people in their demand to hold accountable those responsible for the disaster"". Anti-government protesters launched fireworks at riot police The BBC's Tom Bateman in Beirut says it is unlikely the mass resignation of the government will remove much heat from the protests, as Lebanon's problems are only deepening. A new prime minister will have to be chosen using the same system of sectarian politics at the root of many people's complaints, our correspondent adds. The inferno and the mystery ship Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images 'We don't have dreams any more' What we know about the blast Meanwhile, the recovery operation is continuing on the ground in Beirut. The UN said on Tuesday that the World Food Programme would be sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat flour to Beirut to ""stabilise the national supply and ensure there is no food shortage in the country"", with17,500 tonnes arriving within two weeks,external. The head of the agency, David Beasley, warned on Monday that he was very concerned that Lebanon could run out of bread in about two-and-a-half weeks because 85% of the country's grain was usually delivered through Beirut's port. Mr Beasley said it was urgent to get the port up and running, and that he believed it could be temporarily operational in two to three weeks. A port official noted that the container terminal suffered ""minimal damage"",externaland that on Monday night a ship docked there for the first time since the explosion. Makeshift clinics have been set up to help treat the 6,000 injured by the explosion At least 15 medical facilities, including three major hospitals, also sustained partial or heavy structural damage last Tuesday. The UN has called for additional support to ensure those still functioning can continue to treat the estimated 6,000 people injured by the blast, and also manage the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. On Sunday, a total of 294 new Covid-19 cases were recorded, a new record for Lebanon.

Stephen Lawrence murder investigation 'inactive',"Racist murder victim Stephen Lawrence's mother has vowed she will never give up on her son despite the Met Police declaring investigations ""inactive"". Detectives have said all ""identified lines of inquiry have been completed"" into the 1993 killing. But Baroness Doreen Lawrence said: ""Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will. ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible... may not be brought to justice."" Stephen, 18, was killed in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of his murder in 2012. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said Mr Lawrence's family had been told about the latest operational developments. Duwayne Brooks, who was with Mr Lawrence on the night he was murdered, has also been told about the Met's decision, the force said. Ms Dick said she was sad that the Met had been ""unable to secure any further convictions for Stephen, his family and friends"". She added: ""The investigation has now moved to an 'inactive' phase, but I have given Stephen's family the assurance that we will continue to deal with any new information that comes to light."" Reacting to the announcement, Stephen's father, Neville, said he was disappointed but not surprised that it had been shelved by police. He said that he ""will always live with the hope that someone might come forward with evidence which will allow us to achieve full justice for Stephen"". Stephen's mother, Doreen, entered the House of Lords in 2013 after being made a peer by Labour Baroness Lawrence said: ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible for my son's racist killing may not be brought to justice. ""It is never too late to give a mother justice for the murder of her son. Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will."" She thanked senior investigating officer Clive Driscoll, who secured the convictions of Dobson and Norris after she had campaigned for nearly 20 years. ""Having Clive Driscoll on Stephen's case made all the difference to me and had he had the opportunity of continuing to investigate the murder there may have been more convictions,"" she said. The latest phase of the investigation into Stephen's murder began in January 2014, with Det Ch Insp Chris Le Pere taking over as the lead officer. Since then more than 240 new witness statements have been taken. Gary Dobson (left) and David Norris were convicted of murder in 2012 Another development in the case came from a woman's DNA profile obtained from a bag strap discarded at the scene of the murder. Despite a significant appeal for information and other investigations, that woman has not been identified. Officers also sought to identify a man who had been near the murder scene wearing a jacket with a distinctive V-shaped emblem. Police appealed for a man in a distinctive jacket, seen in an off-licence near to the murder scene, to come forward A third line of inquiry had been to track down a man who had called the BBC's Crimewatch in 2013 to say he had information about the attack. ""The appeal generated more than 40 lines of enquiry for the investigation team to work through,"" the Met said. ""Despite exhaustive efforts, officers were unable to trace the individuals."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Knife crime plans 'criminalise' children Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually Initial attempts to catch Mr Lawrence's killers were found to have been hampered by incompetence and institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police. No arrests were made for two weeks after his death, despite five suspects being named by anonymous informants. A bag strap was left on the road near to where Stephen Lawrence was attacked Dobson and Norris were among a group of up to six men accused of attacking Mr Lawrence and Mr Brooks. Critics of the case say others evaded justice. The Macpherson Report into the investigation into Mr Lawrence's death found that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police.

Coronavirus: Loans announced for pandemic rent arrearsA round-up of developments from the Welsh Government's weekly briefing.,"Loans are to be made available to private tenants who have built up rent arrears during the pandemic Housing Minister Julie James says the money will be paid directly to the landlord or agent and tenants will be able to pay back the amount over five years with an APR rate of 1% Two more people have died with coronavirus, according to Public Health Wales Face coverings will be made mandatory in more places if coronavirus ""starts to spread"", Wales' first minister says Latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of the coronavirus lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent About 80 jobs at the National Trust in Wales could be lost due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic Some brass bands may die out unless they can rehearse in person again, musicians have warned Catherine Evans and Richard Porter That's all from our live updates from the Welsh Government's weekly briefing. This afternoon's updates are:  There are fears brass bands will not be able to survive lockdown without being able to rehearse in person again. But in recent months, bands across Wales have been creative, practising and putting on concerts online. When Brecon Town Concert Band met for their first rehearsal after lockdown they were not able to meet inside - but they did the next best thing. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Brecon band plays again, but outdoors Coronavirus has exposed the ""grim truth"" of homelessness, says Plaid Cymru's health spokeswoman Delyth Jewell. Welcoming the announcement of loans for private tenants in arrears due to the pandemic, she added the commitment to tackling homelessness and the housing crisis was ""long overdue"". âTo truly address these long terms problems we need a housing first model, more affordable homes being built and ending no-fault evictions for good,"" she said. âHomelessness is and remains a political choice that should have been tackled long ago. Access to housing should be a human right."" Department store group Debenhams says itwill cut 2,500 more jobsas it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. This is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its workforce. The cuts will be mainly across its UK stores and distribution centre, but it said no more shops were planned to shut. During lockdown just four gardeners have been responsible for the upkeep of Bodnant Gardens About 80 jobs at the National Trust in Wales could be lost due to the coronavirus pandemic. Houses, gardens and shops managed by the charity were closed in March as lockdown began. Now despite being able to reopen some sites to visitors, the trust has warnedmany historical properties may have to remain closed for years. Assistant director Rebecca Williams said the lack of income meant the trust had to make ""very difficult decisions"". The UK's largest conservation charity, the National Trust looks after historic houses, gardens and hundreds of miles of coastline in Wales. It had previously announced about1,200 jobs would be cut acrossthe charity as a result of anticipated losses of Â£200m. The latest two people to die with coronavirus in Wales were both in the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board region, covering the whole of north Wales. It has recorded 407 deaths, the highest number of any health board in Wales. Two more deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales takes the total to 1,581, according to Public Health Wales.  There have been two more  deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales (PHW). It takes the number of pandemic deaths across Wales to 1,581. A further 13 cases of Covid-19 have also been recorded by PHW. It means there have now been 17,476 positive cases of Covid-19 in Wales since the start of the pandemic.  The latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of
lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. The
rate of unemployment in Wales between April and June was down, at 2.7%, with
8,000 fewer people unemployed than between January and March, Office for
National Statistics (ONS) figures show. That
is 20,000 fewer than the same period a year ago. The
rate of unemployment across the UK was higher at 3.9%. Gerwyn Davies from the
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the professional body
for human resources, said: ""The jobs market appears resilient on
the surface, partly because the official statistics lag events by a couple of
months. ""And
with a spike in redundancies over the coming months now almost inevitable due
to the unwinding of the Job Retention Scheme, we can expect to see unemployment
rise sharply too."" Read more here. Citizens Advice has welcomed a scheme to help people who have fallen into rental arrears during lockdown. It follows an announcement during the Welsh Government's weekly coronavirus briefing that tenants will be able to pay back arrears using a Tenancy Saver Loan. Rebecca Woolley, Citizens Advice Wales director, said: 

""Research has shown that renters have been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus crisis. ""We're pleased that the Welsh Government is taking steps to help people who have built up rent arrears during the crisis through no fault of their own."" She said to ensure the scheme is effective, it was essential users were not pushed further into financial difficulty with interest charges, which would mean additional costs. Julie James says
it is âtoo early to sayâ what the level of appeals might look like after A-level
results are announced on Thursday. The housing minister's comments comes after theScottish Government apologised over the way exams in Scotland were marked. Ms James was asked during the Welsh Government's weekly news conference whether exam appeals in Wales would be made free. She said: âThe
appeals process in Wales will be in place. ""The schools will be able to appeal
if they need to do so; we'll wait to see what the results are. ""It's too early to
say at the moment what the level of appeal might look like or what the results
might be. ""Weâre a couple of days in advance of the results coming out.â The latest unemployment figures for Wales âdonât tell the whole storyâ, the housing minister has said. The figures suggest thefull force of lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. The rate of unemployment in Wales between April and June was 2.7%, with 8,000 fewer people unemployed than between January and March, official figures showed. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Julie James said: âWe don't think these figures tell the whole story. âWe definitely think that the picture will become clearer over the coming months as the furlough scheme winds down, and as companies take stock of where that leaves them. âWe're still in the easing process so people are still trying to gauge whether their companies are still viable and what that means for income and so on, so it's very difficult to say right now exactly where we are.â ""We absolutely rely on the good faith and good conscience"" of Welsh people to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, Julie James has said. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs weekly coronavirus
briefing, the housing minister said people needed to comply with regulations to keep cases down. She said: âWe want people to continue to be cautious and to continue
to obey the rules and in that way we have the best chance of stopping a second
wave. âOf course weâve got preparations in place with our local
authorities and other public services in order to prepare. Itâs only sensible
that any government would do that."" Julie James says local authorities should only âenforceâ social distancing measures for pubs, bars and restaurants as a âlast resortâ if they flout the rules. Speaking during the coronavirus press conference, the minister said the Welsh Government had given further powers to councils to enforce rules, but it was important they worked with local businesses in an âengaged"" and ""educatedâ way. She said: âLocal authorities are working with their local businesses to ensure that they understand the rules, that theyâre able to apply those rules, and then only enforce when itâs obvious that somebody is deliberately flouting those rules.â The Minister for Housing
and Local Government has said the Welsh Government is ""very reliant on
people doing the right thing"" by wearing face masks on public transport. Julie James told the weekly news conference the government had given local
authorities the power to enforce this rule. But she said authorities should
""engage, educate and only enforce right at the end of that process"". She added that the Welsh Government is
""expecting people to just behave reasonably"". And she reiterated: ""They are mandatory
on public transport in Wales."" In response to questions about reassurance for Welsh students who are expecting exam results next week, Julie James said: âI am really happy to reassure every learner in Wales that
the model here is very different.â It followsconcerns about the way grades are being awarded in England and Scotland. She said the system âtakes into account work that
has been completed by the students"". ""For example, here in Wales weâve never let
go of AS-Levels so if you took A-Levels this year then you would have had your
AS-Levels last year and they would have contributed 40% to your A-Level
grade.â âWe are very keen that our learners are given the accolades
they need for the hard work that theyâve done but also that they get the grades
they deserve and those grades are robust.â The housing minister says âit's hard to put actual numbersâ on
how many people may look to benefit from a new scheme to help them with rent
arrears. Earlier Julie James said the Welsh Government was making Â£8m
available to help those who have fallen behind with their rent payments as a
result of the pandemic. Speaking at the weekly Welsh Government press conference,
Ms James said: âWeâre expecting a particular cohort of people to benefit from
this. âAnyone who's entitled to benefit or is in socially
rented housing has a different route to help themâ¦ So we're encouraging people
who have recourse to any of the other public funds to use that public fund. âThis is for a particular cohort of people who weren't in
any rent arrears before and this rent is as a result of Covid-19, so
they won't have had substantial rent arrears before March of this year and have
now found themselves through no fault of their own in this particular
circumstance. âIt's hard to put actual numbers on that, we know the
cohort exists, it's very difficult to track them exactly. âWe think Â£8m is sufficient.â The housing and local government
minister also announced a new loan scheme for tenants who have built up rent
arrears during the pandemic. Julie James told the Welsh Government's news
conference she hoped the Â£8m scheme would ""stop many thousands of people
from eviction and even homelessness"". The scheme is for private sector
tenants who are not on benefits. It will not apply to people who
were in significant rental arrears before March - when lockdown began. The Welsh Government says once the loan is accepted the money will be paid directly to the landlord or
agent and tenants will be able to pay back the amount over five years with an
APR rate of 1%. There is no maximum amount for
the loan but it will be limited to covering rent arrears only. Welsh Housing and Local Government
Minister Julie James has told the Welsh Government's weekly news conference that since lockdown
started more than 2,000 people who were homeless or in unsuitable accommodation
had now been given somewhere to live. She confirmed Â£50m would be spent
on projects to ensure no-one would need to âreturn to life on the streetsâ. Ms James said all 22 local councils
across Wales had come up with innovative projects but there remained ""some
big and complex issues which we're not going to solve overnight"". ""Long-lasting and
transformative solutions"" were needed ""if we're going to end
homelessness for good"", she said. A man who lost his job
at the beginning of the pandemic has said it is harder for older people to find
work. Myke Jones, from
Cwmbran, was working in IT project management. He is now trying to apply for
new jobs at the age of 58. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""It's a big competition, I've noticed a huge
difference in the past couple of months in the fact that jobs are few and far
between. âYou're
looking at 200-plus people applying for those jobs. ""I've spent ages
on my CV trying to make it look flashy and say the right things, but the video
interview comes along and the moment they see you, you can tell they see
straight away 'you're quite old' and they tend to shy away. ""I
struggle to pay our bills, we've got mortgages to pay, I can't see my pension
covering it all so I'm going to be working for a long time yet. I can see a lot
of travelling and staying away from home."" Mr
Jones has also been recovering from cancer during lockdown. ""We
live in a flat, we haven't got a garden, I need to be a bit more careful so I
don't go out as much as most people and that worry I've got about cancer
returning just adds to the mix of 'I'm struggling to find a job, how will I pay
the bills next month'."" It comes as the latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of lockdown has not yet hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Government defends England's test and trace system,"The government has defended its test and trace programme in England amid plans to cut 6,000 contact tracers. Health minister Edward Argar insisted it was a ""successful system"" and would be strengthened by giving more powers to local public health teams. The plans mean people who have been in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases may get a knock on their door if tracers cannot reach them on the phone. Labour said it came nowhere near the PM's pledge to be ""world-beating"". But Mr Agar dismissed that suggestion, saying: ""We've always said that this system would evolve, and what it's doing here is exactly that: evolving and flexing."" ""We have reached in the past 10 weeks, since this was set up pretty much from scratch, around a quarter of a million people - that's a quarter of a million chains of transmission that have been broken by this."" Serco defends Test & Trace despite low contact rate Local Covid-19 tracing 'needs more resources' Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 How does test and trace work? He said the new plan would use the ""scalability"" of a national system as well as the expertise and local knowledge of local public health officials. Meanwhile, the UK reported a further 102 deaths of people who have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 46,628. A further 1,148 cases of coronavirus were recorded in the last 24 hours. The shift towards local public health teams follows criticism that the national system is not tapping into regional knowledge. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said experts had warned that the system would only work well if it was ""done close to the population"". He said the UK had ""many years of very successful, very effective infectious disease surveillance"" for diseases like tuberculosis and meningitis - but this skill and experience had not been used. ""I think it was very clear this was not going to be as effective as it could have been,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. One contact tracer, who wanted to remain anonymous, tells the BBC about their experience of the job. I began contact tracing at the end of May. I've had a grand total of four calls - only one of which was successful. The others went through to voicemail or they didn't pick up. So the rest of the time I've been literally doing nothing - sat in front of my computer, refreshing [my screen] every ten minutes, waiting for the calls to come in and twiddling my thumbs. It's an eight hour day. We have to log on and log off at exactly the right times. We get told off if we're even two minutes late logging in for a shift. When we're actually on shift all we're told to do is just keep refreshing the screen every 10 minutes and wait for the calls to come in. Many of us are business owners, who have had long careers. We know how to work. We're not being told anything. All we're being told is how successful this is, how world-beating this system is, when it's clearly not a world-beating system. Asked if money being given to private companies to run NHS Test and Trace needed to be diverted to local councils, Prof Hunter said: ""Absolutely. The local councils are already - in terms of the investigation of local outbreaks - showing a very effective system. It has to be run locally."" When this same suggestion was put to the health minister, Mr Argar said: ""We've made clear that we believe we still need that national resource, so we're reducing the size of that contract from 18,000 to 12,000, but we still think that is a vital part of our test and trace system, but we have already given billions of pounds nationally to local councils to support them in their response."" Serco, one of the outsourcing firms who have been awarded multi-million pound test and trace contracts, last weekdefended its record- despite figures suggesting that only around 50% of people from the same household as a person infected with Covid-19 were being contacted. Labour said there were ""growing concerns"" about Serco's role in the programme amid reports call centre contact tracerswere being ""paid to watch Netflix"". Shadow health minister Justin Madders welcomed a more locally-led contact tracing operation, but added: ""It's clear Boris Johnson's Â£10bn centralised contact tracing system is nowhere near 'world-beating' as he claims, and the system is unable to fight local outbreaks successfully."" WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?The rules on sick pay, wages and time off JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? SCHOOLS:Which are reopening, when? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? As part of NHS Test and Trace, public health teams dealing with outbreaks in factories or care homes have consistently reached more than 90% of the contacts on their lists. Outside of those very localised outbreaks, it is call centres who trace contacts. But they do not reach as many contacts - their success rate for reaching contacts who don't live together peaked at just over 70% in the middle of July, but has fallen since then.

Restrictions had been lifted in New Zealand after the country appeared to eliminate the virus Here's what you need to know this evening: Palestinians have been preparing to leave as the border crossing with Egypt opened for 72 hours Palestinians have been able to leave densely populated Gaza for the first time since March as its border crossing with Egypt opened on Tuesday. The Rafah crossing was closed in March when Hamas, who govern the Gaza strip, worried about the spread of the virus in the enclave with a poor health system. The crossing, which is the only one into Gaza that bypasses Israel, has opened for 72 days for two-way movement. Hundreds of people gathered at a waiting room before dawn, AFP reports. The PM said there are going to be ""bumpy months ahead"" It's almost the end of the day for the live page team. If you're just catching up, here's what you might have missed: Many universities closed during the pandemic, including the University of Delhi, India The disruption to young people's education caused by coronavirus is threatening their job prospects and heightening inequalities, a new report on the impact of the pandemic suggests. The International Labour Organization (ILO) report says 73% of young people in school, university or vocational training worldwide have had their education disrupted. Of the 73% whose education has been disrupted, 65% say they have learnt less during lockdown. Half now believe their studies will be delayed while 9% fear they may fail their exams or degree courses altogether. And, as ever, money plays a role: in wealthier countries, 65% of young people were taught in video lectures, whereas in poorer nations just 18% could continue to study online. Depression and anxiety among young people also appears to be increasing as job prospects decline, it suggested. âThe pandemic is inflicting multiple shocks on young people. It is not only destroying their jobs and employment prospects, but also disrupting their education and training and having serious impacts on their mental well-being. We cannot let this happen,â says ILO director-general Guy Ryder. Read stories of young people affected by anxiety and tips on how to cope. A further 102 people have died after contracting coronavirus in the UK, meaning the death toll now stands at 46,628, Public Health England says. And 1,148 new positive cases have been recorded, bringing the total number to 312,789. Steve Smith came up with the idea and was the first trader to pitch up in the pub car park A weekly market at a village pub in the English Midlands has been told to stop trading because it breaches an 800-year-old charter. Traders started selling vegetables, bread and flowers in the car park of The Free Trade Inn in Sileby, Leicestershire, during lockdown. But a charter signed by King Henry III in 1227 prohibits any market ""within six and two-thirds miles"" (10.8km) of nearby Loughborough. Charnwood Borough Council said it had to protect the town's market. Read the full story here. Sonia OxleyBBC Sport No job = no sport. A simple sum that may have far-reaching consequences at the top of women's sport. Most elite sportswomen (60%) earn less than Â£10,000 from their sport and have to work ""normal"" jobs to support themselves financially, according to aBBC survey. Some, like darts player Kirsty Chubb, have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving them with difficult choices to make about their future - with sport dropping lower in their priorities. For others, like weightlifter Olivia Blatch, the enforced break and lack of training has left them wondering if they can ever get back to the level they were at before. While the Premier League season ended behind closed doors and England's Test Cricket team have won a series of dramatic victories, much of women's sport is yet to restart. Athletes responding to theBBC Sport survey of elite British sportswomenfound that many felt women's sport had taken a backseat during the pandemic. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said supporting its return was a ""priority"" of his. Read Sonia Oxley's full report here. Russia claims it has developed the world's first coronavirus vaccine We've been reporting today thatRussia says it has developed a coronavirus vaccineand it has been approved for use after less than two months of testing on humans. In the past couple of hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has not received enough information about the vaccine to evaluate it. It had been suggested that Brazil would begin producing the vaccine, but that should not be done until more trials are completed, said Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of WHO. ""Any vaccine producer has to follow this procedure that guarantees it is safe and has the WHO's recommendation,"" he said in a briefing. Last week the WHO urged Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. We reported earlier that France's prime minister said the country has been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks, as he introduced stricter advice on wearing face masks and limits on large public gatherings. The French health ministry has released its daily figures. It reports 1,397 new infections in the past 24 hours - almost twice Monday's tally of 785, according to Reuters news agency. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent The decision toupgrade the exam results of tens of thousands of studentsin Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK, where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotlandâs students are given higher grades based on teachersâ predictions, how will it be fair if theyâre competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupilsâ results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. It raises the question of which is more important: fairness for individuals, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotlandâs change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK. But, like turning an ethical Rubik's cube, any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England, using teachersâ predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average some teachers will have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities. Until now, Englandâs Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised.

Voluntary Service Overseas' Sisters for Sisters' Education project,externalhas provided guidance and distributed hygiene packs to nearly 3,000 girls in Surkhet, Lamjung, Dhading and Parsa districts of Nepal. The kits include basic items such as soap, a towel, toothbrush, reusable sanitary pads and underwear. Read more on this story here. Brazil, which has been badly hit by the virus, is also developing its own vaccine Russia has given regulatory approval to a nationally-produced coronavirus vaccine after less than two months of testing on humans - although scientists in the West have raised concerns about the speed of its programme. Although Russia's claims are in the headlines today, it's not the only country working on vaccines.More than 100 vaccines are in early development,and more than 20 are being tested on people in clinical trials. The US has six vaccines in development and the country's leading infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said they could have a ""safe and effective"" treatment by the end of the year. The UK government has signed four coronavirus vaccine deals. They include 100 million doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and scientists at Oxford University and an experimental treatment being developed by drug giants GSK and Sanofi. On Tuesday, Indonesia and Mexico both announced late stage clinical trials for possible vaccines. Just catching up? Here's what you need to know about virus-related news in the UK: Around 10,000 people in southern France gathered for an illegal rave over the weekend France's Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country had been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks now as cases of coronavirus rise. Some 10,800 new cases have been identified there in the past week, according to the health ministry. Local authorities will be told to instruct citizens to wear masks in public spaces ""as far as possible"", Castex said in a press conference on Tuesday. Mask are currently obligatory on public transport, enclosed spaces such as shops and government offices, and Paris's main tourist sites. Castex also extended a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people until 30 October. The ban was originally scheduled to lift at the end of this month. At the weekend around 10,000 people gathered for an illegal rave on a mountain plateau in Lozere in the south of the country. The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) has announced an ""urgent package of measures"" following thepostponement of Celtic and Aberdeen matchesbecause players broke lockdown rules. Celtic defender Boli Bolingoliflew to Spain without the club's knowledge, failed to quarantine, then played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock. The previous weekendeight Aberdeen players broke lockdown regulationsby visiting a bar together. The new SPFL measures include plans to punish players who break the rules, an ""immediate"" player education programme and an agreement to take part in promotional activity for the Scottish government's coronavirus public awareness campaign FACTS. Sport Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ""This latest example indicates that the current arrangements are not working as intended, and so clearly additional steps now need to be taken to ensure that the necessity of strict compliance with the rules is fully and properly understood."" In the meantime Celtic and Aberdeen can train as usual, but training and friendly matches will not be allowed. Read the full story here. Reality Check Bangladesh says
it will stop providing daily updates on coronavirus infections and deaths in the
country from 12 August. Health Minister Zahid Maleque says this is because âwe believe
the infection rate is decreasing and the situation is getting under control.â In its latest weekly report, the World
Health Organization (WHO) says new cases in the country have dropped by 2.5% from the
previous week. But the headline figure masks a more complicated reality - reported cases are fluctuating widely, with daily tallies ranging
between 900 and 3,000 since the start of August, according to WHO data. This may well be to do with the amount of
testing being carried out, which has also fluctuated widely â from around
12,000 a day in July, then down to less than 4,000 in early August and back up
to 12,000 again. The
authorities attributed the drop in testing to severe flooding in July as well
as what they say is the unwillingness of people to get tested due to a lack of
trust in medical facilities. And
Bangladesh still has a high rate of positive tests - at the end of last week it
was nearly a quarter of all testswhich suggests that only a small proportion of the true number of infections is being picked up.,external  We know all about washing our hands, what to do when out in public and on public transport but one area which hasn't been discussed much is in the bedroom. Sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust has published advice on how people can lower their risk of catching Covid-19 while enjoying a healthy sex life. Some of the tips include wearing a mask and choosing positions which are not face-to-face during sex. It may sound tough, but people need to find a way ""to balance our need for sex and intimacy with the risks of the spread of Covid-19"", the Trust says. For more tips you can readthis story. Disney World in Florida will reduce its opening hours after receiving fewer visitors than expected Here's a round-up of top stories from the US, which remains the country with the highest number of cases in the world: Here is some more fromthat announcement in Holyrood. Scottish students who had their grades moderated up will not have their results downgraded and Education Secretary John Swinney says the government will work with universities to ensure that pupils are not ""crowded out"" of places they have been promised. It comes after the government had faced criticism over its grading of pupils after exams were cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Results were given based on teachers' estimations but also on the past performance of the school - leading to criticism that bright students in poorer schools could be unfairly penalised. More than 124,000 results were downgraded, with the pass rate for higher pupils from the most deprived areas of Scotland being reduced by 15.2%, compared with 6.9% in the most affluent parts of the country. Mr Swinney has faced calls to resign amid criticism from political opponents, parents, teachers and pupils. Nicola Sturgeon apologised to pupils yesterday and Mr Swinney, her deputy, followed suit today. He said: ""Perhaps our approach to maintaining standards for the 2020 cohort alongside every other year - even though 2020 is so unique - did not fully understand the trauma of Covid-19 for this year group and did not appreciate that a different approach might actually help to even things out.""

Most elite sportswomen (60%) earn less than Â£10,000 from their sport and have to work ""normal"" jobs to support themselves financially, according to aBBC survey. Some, like darts player Kirsty Chubb, have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving them with difficult choices to make about their future - with sport dropping lower in their priorities. For others, like weightlifter Olivia Blatch, the enforced break and lack of training has left them wondering if they can ever get back to the level they were at before. While the Premier League season ended behind closed doors and England's Test Cricket team have won a series of dramatic victories, much of women's sport is yet to restart. Athletes responding to theBBC Sport survey of elite British sportswomenfound that many felt women's sport had taken a backseat during the pandemic. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said supporting its return was a ""priority"" of his. Read Sonia Oxley's full report here. Russia claims it has developed the world's first coronavirus vaccine We've been reporting today thatRussia says it has developed a coronavirus vaccineand it has been approved for use after less than two months of testing on humans. In the past couple of hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has not received enough information about the vaccine to evaluate it. It had been suggested that Brazil would begin producing the vaccine, but that should not be done until more trials are completed, said Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of WHO. ""Any vaccine producer has to follow this procedure that guarantees it is safe and has the WHO's recommendation,"" he said in a briefing. Last week the WHO urged Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. We reported earlier that France's prime minister said the country has been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks, as he introduced stricter advice on wearing face masks and limits on large public gatherings. The French health ministry has released its daily figures. It reports 1,397 new infections in the past 24 hours - almost twice Monday's tally of 785, according to Reuters news agency. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent The decision toupgrade the exam results of tens of thousands of studentsin Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK, where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotlandâs students are given higher grades based on teachersâ predictions, how will it be fair if theyâre competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupilsâ results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. It raises the question of which is more important: fairness for individuals, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotlandâs change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK. But, like turning an ethical Rubik's cube, any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England, using teachersâ predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average some teachers will have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities. Until now, Englandâs Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised.

Brazil, which has been badly hit by the virus, is also developing its own vaccine Russia has given regulatory approval to a nationally-produced coronavirus vaccine after less than two months of testing on humans - although scientists in the West have raised concerns about the speed of its programme. Although Russia's claims are in the headlines today, it's not the only country working on vaccines.More than 100 vaccines are in early development,and more than 20 are being tested on people in clinical trials. The US has six vaccines in development and the country's leading infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said they could have a ""safe and effective"" treatment by the end of the year. The UK government has signed four coronavirus vaccine deals. They include 100 million doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and scientists at Oxford University and an experimental treatment being developed by drug giants GSK and Sanofi. On Tuesday, Indonesia and Mexico both announced late stage clinical trials for possible vaccines. Just catching up? Here's what you need to know about virus-related news in the UK: Around 10,000 people in southern France gathered for an illegal rave over the weekend France's Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country had been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks now as cases of coronavirus rise. Some 10,800 new cases have been identified there in the past week, according to the health ministry. Local authorities will be told to instruct citizens to wear masks in public spaces ""as far as possible"", Castex said in a press conference on Tuesday. Mask are currently obligatory on public transport, enclosed spaces such as shops and government offices, and Paris's main tourist sites. Castex also extended a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people until 30 October. The ban was originally scheduled to lift at the end of this month.

The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) has announced an ""urgent package of measures"" following thepostponement of Celtic and Aberdeen matchesbecause players broke lockdown rules. Celtic defender Boli Bolingoliflew to Spain without the club's knowledge, failed to quarantine, then played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock. The previous weekendeight Aberdeen players broke lockdown regulationsby visiting a bar together. The new SPFL measures include plans to punish players who break the rules, an ""immediate"" player education programme and an agreement to take part in promotional activity for the Scottish government's coronavirus public awareness campaign FACTS. Sport Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ""This latest example indicates that the current arrangements are not working as intended, and so clearly additional steps now need to be taken to ensure that the necessity of strict compliance with the rules is fully and properly understood."" In the meantime Celtic and Aberdeen can train as usual, but training and friendly matches will not be allowed. Read the full story here. Reality Check Bangladesh says
it will stop providing daily updates on coronavirus infections and deaths in the
country from 12 August. Health Minister Zahid Maleque says this is because âwe believe
the infection rate is decreasing and the situation is getting under control.â In its latest weekly report, the World
Health Organization (WHO) says new cases in the country have dropped by 2.5% from the
previous week. But the headline figure masks a more complicated reality - reported cases are fluctuating widely, with daily tallies ranging
between 900 and 3,000 since the start of August, according to WHO data. This may well be to do with the amount of
testing being carried out, which has also fluctuated widely â from around
12,000 a day in July, then down to less than 4,000 in early August and back up
to 12,000 again. The
authorities attributed the drop in testing to severe flooding in July as well
as what they say is the unwillingness of people to get tested due to a lack of
trust in medical facilities. And
Bangladesh still has a high rate of positive tests - at the end of last week it
was nearly a quarter of all testswhich suggests that only a small proportion of the true number of infections is being picked up.,external  We know all about washing our hands, what to do when out in public and on public transport but one area which hasn't been discussed much is in the bedroom. Sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust has published advice on how people can lower their risk of catching Covid-19 while enjoying a healthy sex life. Some of the tips include wearing a mask and choosing positions which are not face-to-face during sex.

Disney World in Florida will reduce its opening hours after receiving fewer visitors than expected Here's a round-up of top stories from the US, which remains the country with the highest number of cases in the world: Here is some more fromthat announcement in Holyrood. Scottish students who had their grades moderated up will not have their results downgraded and Education Secretary John Swinney says the government will work with universities to ensure that pupils are not ""crowded out"" of places they have been promised. It comes after the government had faced criticism over its grading of pupils after exams were cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Results were given based on teachers' estimations but also on the past performance of the school - leading to criticism that bright students in poorer schools could be unfairly penalised. More than 124,000 results were downgraded, with the pass rate for higher pupils from the most deprived areas of Scotland being reduced by 15.2%, compared with 6.9% in the most affluent parts of the country. Mr Swinney has faced calls to resign amid criticism from political opponents, parents, teachers and pupils. Nicola Sturgeon apologised to pupils yesterday and Mr Swinney, her deputy, followed suit today. He said: ""Perhaps our approach to maintaining standards for the 2020 cohort alongside every other year - even though 2020 is so unique - did not fully understand the trauma of Covid-19 for this year group and did not appreciate that a different approach might actually help to even things out.""

The Rafah crossing was closed in March when Hamas, who govern the Gaza strip, worried about the spread of the virus in the enclave with a poor health system.

If you're just catching up, here's what you might have missed: Many universities closed during the pandemic, including the University of Delhi, India The disruption to young people's education caused by coronavirus is threatening their job prospects and heightening inequalities, a new report on the impact of the pandemic suggests. The International Labour Organization (ILO) report says 73% of young people in school, university or vocational training worldwide have had their education disrupted. Of the 73% whose education has been disrupted, 65% say they have learnt less during lockdown. Half now believe their studies will be delayed while 9% fear they may fail their exams or degree courses altogether. And, as ever, money plays a role: in wealthier countries, 65% of young people were taught in video lectures, whereas in poorer nations just 18% could continue to study online. Depression and anxiety among young people also appears to be increasing as job prospects decline, it suggested. âThe pandemic is inflicting multiple shocks on young people. It is not only destroying their jobs and employment prospects, but also disrupting their education and training and having serious impacts on their mental well-being. We cannot let this happen,â says ILO director-general Guy Ryder. Read stories of young people affected by anxiety and tips on how to cope.

Steve Smith came up with the idea and was the first trader to pitch up in the pub car park A weekly market at a village pub in the English Midlands has been told to stop trading because it breaches an 800-year-old charter. Traders started selling vegetables, bread and flowers in the car park of The Free Trade Inn in Sileby, Leicestershire, during lockdown. But a charter signed by King Henry III in 1227 prohibits any market ""within six and two-thirds miles"" (10.8km) of nearby Loughborough.

"Debenhams to cut 2,500 more jobs amid pandemicThis is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its staff.BusinessCommentsFace mask law extended if virus 'starts to spread'Mark Drakeford says face coverings will be required in more settings if Covid-19 starts to circulate.Wales politics","Struggling department store group Debenhams says it will cut 2,500 more jobs as it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. This is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its workforce. The cuts will be mainly across its UK stores and distribution centre, but it said no new shops were slated to shut. Shop workers' union Usdaw reacted angrily to the news, saying legal procedures had not been followed. By law, mass redundancies have to be subject to a consultation period. Usdaw said it was preparing a legal challenge on behalf of members affected. ""We have been contacted by members who say they are being made redundant by conference call, with no meaningful consultation or proper notice period, as required by law,"" said union national officer Dave Gill. ""That is an appalling way to treat staff."" Debenhams, which is currently in administration, declined to comment but its administrators, FRP, said consultation had not been possible as the retailer was insolvent and had ""limited"" options. A spokesman said: ""Those affected by redundancy will take no particular comfort from this, but the steps taken are in response to an unpredictable and challenging trading environment and aim to ensure the future viability of the business, while also meeting wider statutory obligations."" In April, Debenhams fell into administration for the second time in a year as coronavirus heaped pressure on the business. The firm said the current trading environment for retailers was still ""a long way from returning to normal"". How have you been affected by job losses at Debenhams? Tell us about your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Earlier this year, it said 20 of its stores would remain permanently closed because of the impact of the pandemic. Debenhams said on Tuesday: ""Such difficult decisions are being taken by many retailers right now, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to give Debenhams every chance of a viable future. ""We have to ensure our store costs are aligned with realistic expectations,"" it added. The chain said that people affected had been informed and thanked them for their ""service and commitment"". ""We have successfully reopened 124 stores post-lockdown, and these are currently trading ahead of management expectations,"" it said. Debenhams could remain in administration for the rest of this year, as lenders wait to see how it performs post-lockdown and in the crucial Christmas trading period. Like many of its competitors, the retailer was already ailing before the pandemic forced it to suspend trading at its department stores. The news of the latest job cuts came after the British Retail Consortium saidthe number of visits to High Streets was still down significantlyas people shopped online instead. The BRC said some retailers were continuing to struggle because of the coronavirus crisis. It made a fresh call for government help with rents. Other High Street names have also announced job losses as they fight to stay afloat. Last week,WH Smith said it was cutting 1,500 jobs- 11% of its workforce - after the lockdown caused sales to plummet. DW Sports, John Lewis, Marks and Spencer, Boots and Selfridges are among other big names to announce redundancies. It's less than two weeks into August and at least another 10,000 jobs have been lost as the furlough scheme starts to wind down.

UK employment falls by biggest amount in a decade,"Boris Johnson has warned the UK has a ""long, long way to go"" before the economy improves, after official figures showed the largest drop in employment in over a decade. ""Clearly there are going to be bumpy months ahead and a long, long way to go,"" the Prime Minister said. However, he said parts of the economy were ""showing great resilience"". Between April and June, the number of people in work fell by 220,000, the Office for National Statistics said. The drop in the number of people employed was the largest quarterly decrease since May to July 2009, the depths of the financial crisis. Mr Johnson said he had ""absolutely no doubt"" that government schemes would ""help this country get through it"", adding: ""it will get through it stronger than ever before"". The youngest workers, oldest workers and those in manual occupations were the worst hit during the pandemic, the ONS added. The figures do not include the millions of people who are furloughed, those on zero-hours contracts but not getting shifts, or people on temporary unpaid leave from a job, as they still count as employed. As such, they do not capture the full impact of the pandemic. Similarly, the UK unemployment rate was estimated at 3.9%, largely unchanged on the year and the previous quarter. What is redundancy and what are my rights? How many people are looking for work? What jobs are available post-lockdown? Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""The groups of people most affected are younger workers, 24 and under, or older workers and those in more routine or less skilled jobs. ""This is concerning, as it's harder for these groups to find a new job or get into a job as easily as other workers."" The UK economy has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic, but unemployment has not surged as much as feared because large numbers of firms have furloughed staff. However, analysts said unemployment was set to worsen in coming months as the scheme wound down, warning of a looming ""cliff-edge"" and a ""lull before the storm"". From restaurants to retailers, many UK businesses are already planning job cutswith 140,000 redundancies announced in June alone. According to the ONS, the number of average hours worked continued to fall in April-June, reaching record lows both on the year and on the quarter. The number of people claiming universal credit - a benefit for those on low pay as well as unemployed people - rose to 2.7 million in July, up by 117% since March. Theatre technician Charlotte Baker, 29, is out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She started a new job at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon in September last year and was furloughed in March. In June, she was made redundant, even though she could have been kept on furlough. Now management at the Fairfield Halls has said the venue will not reopen until April next year, forcing her to contemplate a possible career change. ""It's definitely an uphill struggle and it's proving harder than previous ones,"" she told the BBC. ""It's hard to have a positive outlook."" Charlotte has been looking into doing a carpentry course, but to obtain the necessary City and Guilds qualification would require her to spend Â£5,000 on training. ""It's a mountain to climb. I wouldn't mind climbing that mountain if it's something that I'm passionate about, but I'm not sure,"" she says. ""I'm hoping to make a decision by the end of August."" Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive' This video can not be played Julie Morris explains what it is like to be job hunting in your late 50s during coronavirus Between April and June there were falls in pay for those still working, with regular pay levels down 0.2% compared with a year earlier - the first negative pay growth since records began in 2001. The number of people on zero-hours contracts also increased to more than one million. ""Early indicators for July 2020 suggest that the number of employees in the UK on payrolls is down around 730,000 compared with March 2020,"" said the ONS. It believes the main reason this is more extreme than the fall in employment is because of workers who have a job but are not doing any paid work at the moment. Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' Which sectors are hiring and which are cutting back? It added that a large number of people were estimated to be temporarily away from work, including furloughed workers - approximately 7.5 million in June 2020, with more than three million of these being away for three months or more. The number of workers covered by the furlough scheme has since risen to 9.6 million by 9 August, and has yet to record a fall in any week since it began,separate statistics published on Tuesday by HM Revenue and Customs show.,external The ONS said there had also been a sharp fall in the number of self-employed people between April and June. It said there were 4.76 million self-employed people, 14.5% of all people in employment, a record 238,000 fewer than the previous quarter. If you're a glass-half-full sort of person, there is some less than awful news in the latest labour market figures. The number of vacancies, for example, rose from its record low by 10% in May to July as lockdown restrictions were eased. The number of hours worked saw a record drop in the second quarter from April to June, but in July it was down by only 3%, less than half the fall in May and June. However, there are some less jolly signs. The number on employer payrolls had only dropped marginally in the previous two months, but saw a much bigger drop in July, down 114,000, in spite of the reopening of many shops, restaurants and pubs. And employers are increasingly making employees bear the risk that there isn't enough work for them to do, with the number of zero-hours contracts rising above one million for the first time. And then there's the record drop in self-employment. And all this in spite of the government spending more than Â£40bn trying to protect employment through furlough and self-employed income support. Unemployment tends to peak well after economic shocks have been and gone: this time will be no different. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest employment figures were ""the lull before the storm"". She added: ""The cracks evident in the latest batch of labour market data are likely to soon turn into a chasm, with the unemployment rate rising from 3.9% to around 7% by mid-2021."" She said further rises in unemployment in the coming months were ""all but inevitable as the furlough scheme unwinds"". Capital Economics forecasts that the unemployment rate will peak at 7% in mid-2021 and remain above its pre-pandemic level of 4% until the end of 2022. Ms Gregory said this suggested that the economic recovery would be ""slow going"". UK employment falls by biggest amount in a decade Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at Equals Money, said the figures showed the true level of those out of work had been ""very effectively lowered by the government's furlough scheme"" and that the worst lay ahead. ""Unfortunately, the end of the furlough scheme will present a cliff-edge, statistically and economically, for those currently relying on government support to make up their wages."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed that the government's ""unprecedented support measures"" were working to ""safeguard millions of jobs and livelihoods that could otherwise have been lost"". Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was ""extremely worrying"" that older workers, the self-employed and part-time workers had been hit hardest. ""Labour has repeatedly warned the government their one-size-fits-all approach will lead to job losses. These figures confirm what we feared - Britain is in the midst of a jobs crisis.""

Jobless in the time of pandemic,"Many people currently working from home are fearful of ultimately losing their jobs Latest UK unemployment figures show that the much-feared coronavirus ""cliff-edge"" has not yet taken its toll on the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate has remained at 3.9% since the lockdown was introduced. UK employment falls by biggest amount in over a decade Joblessness has not surged, as many feared, because large numbers of firms have put employees on the government-backed furlough scheme. But in recent weeks, growing numbers of employees have found themselves being made redundant after having initially been furloughed. And while some have immediately thrown themselves into the search for another job, others have been left reeling from the impact. Theatre technician Charlotte Baker, 29, is out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She started a new job at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon in September last year and was furloughed in March. In June, she was made redundant, even though she could have been kept on furlough. Now management at the Fairfield Halls has said the venue will not reopen until April next year, forcing her to contemplate a possible career change.

I wouldn't mind climbing that mountain if it's something that I'm passionate about, but I'm not sure,"" she says. ""I'm hoping to make a decision by the end of August."" Jon Ellis-Fleming, 31, of Keighley in West Yorkshire, lost his job in recruitment shortly before lockdown began. ""I'd been working in HR about five years and the redundancy came quite out of the blue,"" he told the BBC. His problems were made all the more acute because his partner Julia Paterson, who worked in the same department, was on maternity leave at the time, having given birth to their daughter Daisy. ""It was a lot of stress, to say the least,"" he says. ""We had a lot of help from family, but without that, I don't know what we would have done."" That made him all the more determined to find work again - but it meant a complete change of direction for him. ""I was unemployed until June, then I ended up becoming a self-employed contract driver for a logistics firm,"" he says. ""It was the only option I had to bring money in. ""I'm working in an industry I never expected to work in and I'm not entirely comfortable in it. But you do what you can to make ends meet."" Kate Treglown, 44, of Walthamstow in east London, was made redundant from her advertising job at the end of July after being on furlough. ""I worked for 16-and-a-half years for an advertising agency that promoted live events. The work totally dried up in May,"" she told the BBC. Kate says she has spent the past four months trying to home-school her children, while her husband, a cabinet maker, has carried on working as usual the whole time. Now she feels ""stuck in limbo"" - keen to try something new, but unsure of when her children will return to school. ""I would like to take the opportunity to do something different,"" she says. ""I was in my old job for so long and I talked about leaving, but never did. ""But it would be a very challenging time for me to start a new job."" Kate adds: ""I've been keeping an eye on the market. There is work. There are jobs available. But when I look on LinkedIn, every single job has hundreds of applications, so competition is very stiff. ""I feel women are really carrying the burden of this pandemic with regards to the childcare, whether working or not. It's made me feel quite depressed at times. ""My redundancy money is only going to last so long and I'm scared of what the future holds for us at the moment."" Sue Hudson, 59, of New Milton in Hampshire, lost her job as a legal secretary two weeks into lockdown. ""I was working from home late on Friday afternoon and I got a telephone call saying, 'We're making you redundant,'"" she told the BBC. ""Because I had been there under two years, they didn't have to pay me any redundancy allowance. They gave me a week's notice, a month's pay and the accrued holiday."" While working from home, she had been using a foot pedal belonging to the company. ""They said, 'Can we have our foot pedal back?'"" Sue adds: ""I had a drawer full of shoes at work and they said I could come in and collect them. I asked them to post them to me, saying I couldn't afford the train fare."" Sue is on Jobseeker's Allowance at the moment, but says that from the end of this month, she will be reliant on her partner Ian, who works as a groundsman for New Milton town council. Sue has had several interviews for other jobs and says that fortunately, her age doesn't appear to be a factor for prospective employers. However, she remains hurt by the ""appalling"" way she was treated. ""They could have put me on furlough for a couple of months, then I would have been able to look for other jobs in comfort,"" she says. Have you lost your job because of the pandemic?

"Scottish school pupils have results upgradedThe Scottish government u-turn follows an outcry over the downgrading of 125,000 results.Scotland","Some pupils held protests against the downgrading Tens of thousands of school pupils are to have their exam results upgraded after the Scottish government agreed to accept teacher estimates of scores. The government U-turn follows an outcry from pupils after a moderation system saw 125,000 estimated results being downgraded. All results that were downgraded will now be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates. The move affects about 75,000 pupils across Scotland. There had been claims that the moderation system unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed as well. And many pupils said they had been given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams at the start of the year. Sturgeon 'sorry' over Scottish exam results Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland How grades were worked out for Scottish pupils Education Secretary John Swinney said he was sorry for the ""feeling of unfairness"" caused by the downgrading, adding that it was ""deeply regrettable we got this wrong"". Mr Swinney and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had both previously argued that basing grades on teacher estimates alone would damage the credibility of this year's results compared to previous years. Opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament are pushing for a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney, with Labour and the Conservatives calling for him to quit. This video can not be played Mr Swinney said 'all downgraded results will be withdrawn' The coronavirus lockdown saw all of Scotland's school exams cancelled for the first time ever, with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) drawing up a new system to calculate results. This was to be based on teacher estimates for each of their individual pupils, based on their work during the school year. But these estimates were then fed through an SQA moderation system, which downgraded the marks handed out by teachers to bring them closer in line with previous years. This sparked an outcry from students, particularly when it emerged that the Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds wasreduced by 15.2 percentage points,external, but only by 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Swinney both insisted last week that it would not be credible to base the results on teacher estimates alone Mr Swinney accepted there was ""clear anger and frustration from young people and their families"" about this, saying it had ""left many young people feeling their future had been determined by statistical modelling rather than their own ability"". He said he would now direct the SQA to reissue grades ""based solely on teacher or lecturer judgement"". Fresh certificates will be issued and the university admissions body informed of the changes so applications can be processed. A review of what has gone wrong will also be held, as well as a longer-term study of how future qualifications should balance exams and teacher assessments. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously said that accepting teacher estimates without moderation would lead to an exceptionally high pass rate compared to previous years, which she said would not be ""credible"". And Mr Swinney said last week that he believed teachers were often ""optimistic and aspirational"" about their pupils' abilities, while an exam system ""does something different"". This year's Higher pass rate will now sit at 89.2%, up 14.4 percentage points on 2019, while the Advanced Higher pass rate is at 93.1%, up 13.7 points from the previous year. At Ms Sturgeon's coronavirus briefing on Tuesday, she said she now believed concerns about the credibility of the unusually high pass rate were outweighed by the risk of students thinking the system was ""stacked against them"". Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended A Motherwell pupil whose dream of becoming a doctor appeared to have been shattered by downgraded Higher results will now get the five As that she needed. Olivia Biggartbelieved she was downgradedto two As and three Bs because her school is in a deprived area. The 16-year-old said she cheered atJohn Swinney's announcementthat she would now get her original estimated grades. She will now be able to apply for medical school in October. ""I am over the moon because finally there is justice and I can pursue my career,"" she said. ""I am happy with what he said - and glad he apologised to us."" Read more here Labour are pushing for a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney, likely to be held at Holyrood later in the week. The party's education spokesman Iain Gray said Mr Swinney had left students ""twisting in the wind for a week"", and urged him to ""take full responsibility for it happening in the first place and resign"". Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene said Mr Swinney's statement had been ""the longest resignation speech in history, minus the resignation"", and Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the education secretary was ""part of the problem, not the solution"". The Scottish Greens said Mr Swinney had ""refused to listen"" to earlier concerns, but welcomed that he had met the conditions the party had set for backing him in any confidence vote - likely securing his future. This decision in Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK - where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotland's students are given higher grades based on teachers' predictions, how will it be fair if they're competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly-boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupils' results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. And it raises the question which is more important, fairness for the individual, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotland's change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK - but like turning an ethical Rubik cube - any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England using teachers' predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average there will be some teachers who have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities that could fill court rooms for years. Until now England's Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised.

"Government defends England's test and trace systemHealth minister Edward Argar says it is ""evolving and flexing"", amid plans to cut 6,000 contact tracers.UK","The government has defended its test and trace programme in England amid plans to cut 6,000 contact tracers. Health minister Edward Argar insisted it was a ""successful system"" and would be strengthened by giving more powers to local public health teams. The plans mean people who have been in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases may get a knock on their door if tracers cannot reach them on the phone. Labour said it came nowhere near the PM's pledge to be ""world-beating"". But Mr Agar dismissed that suggestion, saying: ""We've always said that this system would evolve, and what it's doing here is exactly that: evolving and flexing."" ""We have reached in the past 10 weeks, since this was set up pretty much from scratch, around a quarter of a million people - that's a quarter of a million chains of transmission that have been broken by this."" Serco defends Test & Trace despite low contact rate Local Covid-19 tracing 'needs more resources' Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 How does test and trace work? He said the new plan would use the ""scalability"" of a national system as well as the expertise and local knowledge of local public health officials. Meanwhile, the UK reported a further 102 deaths of people who have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 46,628. A further 1,148 cases of coronavirus were recorded in the last 24 hours. The shift towards local public health teams follows criticism that the national system is not tapping into regional knowledge. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said experts had warned that the system would only work well if it was ""done close to the population"". He said the UK had ""many years of very successful, very effective infectious disease surveillance"" for diseases like tuberculosis and meningitis - but this skill and experience had not been used. ""I think it was very clear this was not going to be as effective as it could have been,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. One contact tracer, who wanted to remain anonymous, tells the BBC about their experience of the job. I began contact tracing at the end of May. I've had a grand total of four calls - only one of which was successful. The others went through to voicemail or they didn't pick up. So the rest of the time I've been literally doing nothing - sat in front of my computer, refreshing [my screen] every ten minutes, waiting for the calls to come in and twiddling my thumbs. It's an eight hour day. We have to log on and log off at exactly the right times. We get told off if we're even two minutes late logging in for a shift. When we're actually on shift all we're told to do is just keep refreshing the screen every 10 minutes and wait for the calls to come in. Many of us are business owners, who have had long careers. We know how to work. We're not being told anything. All we're being told is how successful this is, how world-beating this system is, when it's clearly not a world-beating system. Asked if money being given to private companies to run NHS Test and Trace needed to be diverted to local councils, Prof Hunter said: ""Absolutely. The local councils are already - in terms of the investigation of local outbreaks - showing a very effective system. It has to be run locally."" When this same suggestion was put to the health minister, Mr Argar said: ""We've made clear that we believe we still need that national resource, so we're reducing the size of that contract from 18,000 to 12,000, but we still think that is a vital part of our test and trace system, but we have already given billions of pounds nationally to local councils to support them in their response."" Serco, one of the outsourcing firms who have been awarded multi-million pound test and trace contracts, last weekdefended its record- despite figures suggesting that only around 50% of people from the same household as a person infected with Covid-19 were being contacted. Labour said there were ""growing concerns"" about Serco's role in the programme amid reports call centre contact tracerswere being ""paid to watch Netflix"". Shadow health minister Justin Madders welcomed a more locally-led contact tracing operation, but added: ""It's clear Boris Johnson's Â£10bn centralised contact tracing system is nowhere near 'world-beating' as he claims, and the system is unable to fight local outbreaks successfully."" WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?The rules on sick pay, wages and time off JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? SCHOOLS:Which are reopening, when? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? As part of NHS Test and Trace, public health teams dealing with outbreaks in factories or care homes have consistently reached more than 90% of the contacts on their lists. Outside of those very localised outbreaks, it is call centres who trace contacts. But they do not reach as many contacts - their success rate for reaching contacts who don't live together peaked at just over 70% in the middle of July, but has fallen since then.

Police force facial recognition use ruled unlawful,"Ed Bridges has had his image captured twice by AFR technology, which he said breached his human rights The use of automatic facial recognition (AFR) technology by South Wales Police is unlawful, the Court of Appeal has ruled. It follows a legal challenge brought by civil rights group Liberty and Ed Bridges, 37, from Cardiff. But the court also found its use was proportionate interference with human rights as the benefits outweighed the impact on Mr Bridges. South Wales Police said it would not be appealing the findings. Mr Bridges had said being identified by AFR caused him distress. Meet the man who took on a police force and won The South Wales force has previously demonstrated the technology with a member of staff standing in The court upheld three of the five points raised in the appeal. It said there was no clear guidance on where AFR Locate could be used and who could be put on a watchlist, a data protection impact assessment was deficient and the force did not take reasonable steps to find out if the software had a racial or gender bias. Facial scans to identify bad Elvises at Porthcawl festival South Wales Police to use facial recognition app on phones Facial recognition fails on race, government study says The appeal followed the dismissal of Mr Bridges' case at London's High Court in September by two senior judges, who had concluded use of the technology was not unlawful. Responding to Tuesday's ruling, South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes said: ""The test of our ground-breaking use of this technology by the courts has been a welcome and important step in its development. I am confident this is a judgment that we can work with."" Mr Bridges said: ""I'm delighted that the court has agreed that facial recognition clearly threatens our rights. ""This technology is an intrusive and discriminatory mass surveillance tool. ""For three years now, South Wales Police has been using it against hundreds of thousands of us, without our consent and often without our knowledge. ""We should all be able to use our public spaces without being subjected to oppressive surveillance."" Mr Bridges' face was scanned while he was Christmas shopping in Cardiff in 2017 and at a peaceful anti-arms protest outside the city's Motorpoint Arena in 2018. He had argued it breached his human rights when his biometric data was analysed without his knowledge or consent. Liberty lawyer Megan Goulding described the judgment as a ""major victory in the fight against discriminatory and oppressive facial recognition"". She added: ""It is time for the government to recognise the serious dangers of this intrusive technology. Facial recognition is a threat to our freedom - it has no place on our streets."" The technology maps faces in a crowd by measuring the distance between features, then compares results with a ""watch list"" of images - which can include suspects, missing people and persons of interest. South Wales Police has been trialling this form of AFR since 2017, predominantly at big sporting fixtures, concerts and other large events across the force area. The force had confirmed Mr Bridges was not a person of interest and had never been on a watch list. Responding to the ruling, the force said its use of the technology had resulted in 61 people being arrested for offences including robbery and violence, theft and court warrants. It said it remained ""completely committed to its careful development and deployment"" and was ""proud of the fact there has never been an unlawful arrest as a result of using the technology in south Wales"". During the remote hearing last month, Liberty's barrister Dan Squires QC argued that if everyone was stopped and asked for their personal data on the way into a stadium, people would feel uncomfortable. ""If they were to do this with fingerprints, it would be unlawful, but by doing this with AFR there are no legal constraints,"" he said, as there are clear laws and guidance on taking fingerprints. Mr Squires said it was the potential use of the power, not its actual use to date, that was the issue. ""It's not enough that it has been done in a proportionate manner so far,"" he said. He argued there were insufficient safeguards within the current laws to protect people from an arbitrary use of the technology, or to ensure its use is proportional. The impact of the ruling will extend to other police forces. But what it has not done is create an insurmountable barrier to them using live facial recognition in the future. In fact, the judgesstate that the benefits of the tech,externalare ""potentially great"" and the intrusion into innocent people's privacy ""minor"". But their determination expresses a need for more care. Police forces - including London's Met, which has trialled a similar system - need clearer guidance. Specifically, the ruling indicates officers will have to clearly document who they are looking for and what evidence they have that those targets are likely to be in the monitored area. They will also need to check that the software doesn't exhibit racial or sexual bias as to who it flags. Tony Porter - England and Wales' Surveillance Camera Commissioner -has said he hopes the Home Office will take this opportunity,externalto update a ""woefully"" out-of-date code of practice used to regulate facial recognition and other surveillance efforts. That echoes a call by the House of Commons' Science and Technology committee last year, which called for all use of automatic facial recognition to be suspended until relevant regulations had been put in place. Elsewhere, a committee of MSPs have made it clear they think it would be premature for the police in Scotland to use the tech in its current state, and Northern Ireland has long-standing plans to create its own Biometrics Commissioner, who might eventually examine the issue.

"Debenhams to cut 2,500 more jobs amid pandemicThis is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its staff.BusinessComments","Struggling department store group Debenhams says it will cut 2,500 more jobs as it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. This is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its workforce. The cuts will be mainly across its UK stores and distribution centre, but it said no new shops were slated to shut. Shop workers' union Usdaw reacted angrily to the news, saying legal procedures had not been followed. By law, mass redundancies have to be subject to a consultation period. Usdaw said it was preparing a legal challenge on behalf of members affected. ""We have been contacted by members who say they are being made redundant by conference call, with no meaningful consultation or proper notice period, as required by law,"" said union national officer Dave Gill. ""That is an appalling way to treat staff."" Debenhams, which is currently in administration, declined to comment but its administrators, FRP, said consultation had not been possible as the retailer was insolvent and had ""limited"" options. A spokesman said: ""Those affected by redundancy will take no particular comfort from this, but the steps taken are in response to an unpredictable and challenging trading environment and aim to ensure the future viability of the business, while also meeting wider statutory obligations."" In April, Debenhams fell into administration for the second time in a year as coronavirus heaped pressure on the business. The firm said the current trading environment for retailers was still ""a long way from returning to normal"". How have you been affected by job losses at Debenhams? Tell us about your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Earlier this year, it said 20 of its stores would remain permanently closed because of the impact of the pandemic. Debenhams said on Tuesday: ""Such difficult decisions are being taken by many retailers right now, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to give Debenhams every chance of a viable future. ""We have to ensure our store costs are aligned with realistic expectations,"" it added. The chain said that people affected had been informed and thanked them for their ""service and commitment"". ""We have successfully reopened 124 stores post-lockdown, and these are currently trading ahead of management expectations,"" it said. Debenhams could remain in administration for the rest of this year, as lenders wait to see how it performs post-lockdown and in the crucial Christmas trading period. Like many of its competitors, the retailer was already ailing before the pandemic forced it to suspend trading at its department stores. The news of the latest job cuts came after the British Retail Consortium saidthe number of visits to High Streets was still down significantlyas people shopped online instead. The BRC said some retailers were continuing to struggle because of the coronavirus crisis. It made a fresh call for government help with rents. Other High Street names have also announced job losses as they fight to stay afloat. Last week,WH Smith said it was cutting 1,500 jobs- 11% of its workforce - after the lockdown caused sales to plummet. DW Sports, John Lewis, Marks and Spencer, Boots and Selfridges are among other big names to announce redundancies. It's less than two weeks into August and at least another 10,000 jobs have been lost as the furlough scheme starts to wind down.

Restrictions had been lifted in New Zealand after the country appeared to eliminate the virus Here's what you need to know this evening: Palestinians have been preparing to leave as the border crossing with Egypt opened for 72 hours Palestinians have been able to leave densely populated Gaza for the first time since March as its border crossing with Egypt opened on Tuesday. The Rafah crossing was closed in March when Hamas, who govern the Gaza strip, worried about the spread of the virus in the enclave with a poor health system. The crossing, which is the only one into Gaza that bypasses Israel, has opened for 72 days for two-way movement. Hundreds of people gathered at a waiting room before dawn, AFP reports.

If you're just catching up, here's what you might have missed: Many universities closed during the pandemic, including the University of Delhi, India The disruption to young people's education caused by coronavirus is threatening their job prospects and heightening inequalities, a new report on the impact of the pandemic suggests. The International Labour Organization (ILO) report says 73% of young people in school, university or vocational training worldwide have had their education disrupted. Of the 73% whose education has been disrupted, 65% say they have learnt less during lockdown. Half now believe their studies will be delayed while 9% fear they may fail their exams or degree courses altogether. And, as ever, money plays a role: in wealthier countries, 65% of young people were taught in video lectures, whereas in poorer nations just 18% could continue to study online. Depression and anxiety among young people also appears to be increasing as job prospects decline, it suggested. âThe pandemic is inflicting multiple shocks on young people. It is not only destroying their jobs and employment prospects, but also disrupting their education and training and having serious impacts on their mental well-being. We cannot let this happen,â says ILO director-general Guy Ryder. Read stories of young people affected by anxiety and tips on how to cope. A further 102 people have died after contracting coronavirus in the UK, meaning the death toll now stands at 46,628, Public Health England says. And 1,148 new positive cases have been recorded, bringing the total number to 312,789. Steve Smith came up with the idea and was the first trader to pitch up in the pub car park A weekly market at a village pub in the English Midlands has been told to stop trading because it breaches an 800-year-old charter. Traders started selling vegetables, bread and flowers in the car park of The Free Trade Inn in Sileby, Leicestershire, during lockdown. But a charter signed by King Henry III in 1227 prohibits any market ""within six and two-thirds miles"" (10.8km) of nearby Loughborough. Charnwood Borough Council said it had to protect the town's market. Read the full story here. Sonia OxleyBBC Sport No job = no sport. A simple sum that may have far-reaching consequences at the top of women's sport. Most elite sportswomen (60%) earn less than Â£10,000 from their sport and have to work ""normal"" jobs to support themselves financially, according to aBBC survey. Some, like darts player Kirsty Chubb, have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving them with difficult choices to make about their future - with sport dropping lower in their priorities. For others, like weightlifter Olivia Blatch, the enforced break and lack of training has left them wondering if they can ever get back to the level they were at before. While the Premier League season ended behind closed doors and England's Test Cricket team have won a series of dramatic victories, much of women's sport is yet to restart. Athletes responding to theBBC Sport survey of elite British sportswomenfound that many felt women's sport had taken a backseat during the pandemic. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said supporting its return was a ""priority"" of his. Read Sonia Oxley's full report here. Russia claims it has developed the world's first coronavirus vaccine We've been reporting today thatRussia says it has developed a coronavirus vaccineand it has been approved for use after less than two months of testing on humans. In the past couple of hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has not received enough information about the vaccine to evaluate it. It had been suggested that Brazil would begin producing the vaccine, but that should not be done until more trials are completed, said Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of WHO. ""Any vaccine producer has to follow this procedure that guarantees it is safe and has the WHO's recommendation,"" he said in a briefing. Last week the WHO urged Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. We reported earlier that France's prime minister said the country has been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks, as he introduced stricter advice on wearing face masks and limits on large public gatherings. The French health ministry has released its daily figures. It reports 1,397 new infections in the past 24 hours - almost twice Monday's tally of 785, according to Reuters news agency. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent The decision toupgrade the exam results of tens of thousands of studentsin Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK, where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotlandâs students are given higher grades based on teachersâ predictions, how will it be fair if theyâre competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupilsâ results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. It raises the question of which is more important: fairness for individuals, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotlandâs change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK. But, like turning an ethical Rubik's cube, any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England, using teachersâ predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average some teachers will have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities. Until now, Englandâs Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised.

The kits include basic items such as soap, a towel, toothbrush, reusable sanitary pads and underwear. Read more on this story here. Brazil, which has been badly hit by the virus, is also developing its own vaccine Russia has given regulatory approval to a nationally-produced coronavirus vaccine after less than two months of testing on humans - although scientists in the West have raised concerns about the speed of its programme. Although Russia's claims are in the headlines today, it's not the only country working on vaccines.More than 100 vaccines are in early development,and more than 20 are being tested on people in clinical trials. The US has six vaccines in development and the country's leading infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said they could have a ""safe and effective"" treatment by the end of the year. The UK government has signed four coronavirus vaccine deals. They include 100 million doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and scientists at Oxford University and an experimental treatment being developed by drug giants GSK and Sanofi. On Tuesday, Indonesia and Mexico both announced late stage clinical trials for possible vaccines. Just catching up? Here's what you need to know about virus-related news in the UK: Around 10,000 people in southern France gathered for an illegal rave over the weekend France's Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country had been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks now as cases of coronavirus rise. Some 10,800 new cases have been identified there in the past week, according to the health ministry. Local authorities will be told to instruct citizens to wear masks in public spaces ""as far as possible"", Castex said in a press conference on Tuesday. Mask are currently obligatory on public transport, enclosed spaces such as shops and government offices, and Paris's main tourist sites. Castex also extended a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people until 30 October. The ban was originally scheduled to lift at the end of this month. At the weekend around 10,000 people gathered for an illegal rave on a mountain plateau in Lozere in the south of the country. The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) has announced an ""urgent package of measures"" following thepostponement of Celtic and Aberdeen matchesbecause players broke lockdown rules. Celtic defender Boli Bolingoliflew to Spain without the club's knowledge, failed to quarantine, then played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock. The previous weekendeight Aberdeen players broke lockdown regulationsby visiting a bar together. The new SPFL measures include plans to punish players who break the rules, an ""immediate"" player education programme and an agreement to take part in promotional activity for the Scottish government's coronavirus public awareness campaign FACTS. Sport Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ""This latest example indicates that the current arrangements are not working as intended, and so clearly additional steps now need to be taken to ensure that the necessity of strict compliance with the rules is fully and properly understood."" In the meantime Celtic and Aberdeen can train as usual, but training and friendly matches will not be allowed. Read the full story here. Reality Check Bangladesh says
it will stop providing daily updates on coronavirus infections and deaths in the
country from 12 August. Health Minister Zahid Maleque says this is because âwe believe
the infection rate is decreasing and the situation is getting under control.â In its latest weekly report, the World
Health Organization (WHO) says new cases in the country have dropped by 2.5% from the
previous week. But the headline figure masks a more complicated reality - reported cases are fluctuating widely, with daily tallies ranging
between 900 and 3,000 since the start of August, according to WHO data. This may well be to do with the amount of
testing being carried out, which has also fluctuated widely â from around
12,000 a day in July, then down to less than 4,000 in early August and back up
to 12,000 again. The
authorities attributed the drop in testing to severe flooding in July as well
as what they say is the unwillingness of people to get tested due to a lack of
trust in medical facilities. And
Bangladesh still has a high rate of positive tests - at the end of last week it
was nearly a quarter of all testswhich suggests that only a small proportion of the true number of infections is being picked up.,external  We know all about washing our hands, what to do when out in public and on public transport but one area which hasn't been discussed much is in the bedroom. Sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust has published advice on how people can lower their risk of catching Covid-19 while enjoying a healthy sex life. Some of the tips include wearing a mask and choosing positions which are not face-to-face during sex. It may sound tough, but people need to find a way ""to balance our need for sex and intimacy with the risks of the spread of Covid-19"", the Trust says. For more tips you can readthis story. Disney World in Florida will reduce its opening hours after receiving fewer visitors than expected Here's a round-up of top stories from the US, which remains the country with the highest number of cases in the world: Here is some more fromthat announcement in Holyrood. Scottish students who had their grades moderated up will not have their results downgraded and Education Secretary John Swinney says the government will work with universities to ensure that pupils are not ""crowded out"" of places they have been promised. It comes after the government had faced criticism over its grading of pupils after exams were cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Results were given based on teachers' estimations but also on the past performance of the school - leading to criticism that bright students in poorer schools could be unfairly penalised. More than 124,000 results were downgraded, with the pass rate for higher pupils from the most deprived areas of Scotland being reduced by 15.2%, compared with 6.9% in the most affluent parts of the country. Mr Swinney has faced calls to resign amid criticism from political opponents, parents, teachers and pupils. Nicola Sturgeon apologised to pupils yesterday and Mr Swinney, her deputy, followed suit today. He said: ""Perhaps our approach to maintaining standards for the 2020 cohort alongside every other year - even though 2020 is so unique - did not fully understand the trauma of Covid-19 for this year group and did not appreciate that a different approach might actually help to even things out.""

Boy's gut partly removed after swallowing magnets,"The tiny magnets can cause erosions and holes in the bowel The mother of a three-year-old boy who had part of his intestine removed after swallowing magnets has said he is lucky not to have permanent damage. TomÃ¡s Quinn, from Newry, had to have emergency surgery in April to remove 29 of the tiny magnetic balls he ingested. Magdalena Quinn said: ""He is a really lucky boy. But the damage that they did is absolutely unreal."" A Belfast hospital said 19 children between two and 14-years-old needed treatment for magnet ingestion in 2019. Three of them had to have major surgery at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RBHSC): A three-year-old who had 49 magnets removed from his stomach A 13-year-old girl who had a section of her gut cut away and will have a risk of adhesions for life A five-year-old who required a laparotomy to remove three magnets Surgeons patched up 14 holes in little TomÃ¡s Quinn's intestines Ms Suzanne Lawther, a consultant in paediatric surgery at RBHSC, said: ""They (the magnetic ball toys) are about 10 times stronger than traditional magnets and if the magnets end up on either side of a piece of the digestive tract, the magnetic force is so strong that it actually interferes with the blood supply. ""They can cause that bit of bowel to die and ultimately to develop a hole or sometimes abnormal connections between different parts of the bowel which left untreated can make children and adults very unwell and be potentially life-threatening."" Of those 19 children who attended RBHC emergency department last year having swallowed magnets, just under half (42%) were aged under five and had swallowed magnetic ball toys. The other 58% were aged 10 or older and had accidentally swallowed fake piercings made from magnets. The RBHSC surgical team also saw and operated on children from all over Northern Ireland referred for specialist surgery. Magnetic toys like this are typically swallowed by under-fives If more than one magnet is ingested, they can cause erosions and holes in the bowel which can cause sepsis and death if not recognised and operated on in time. TomÃ¡s Quinn was referred from Craigavon Area Hospital. His mother added: ""When I saw the X-ray for the first time I was thinking: 'Oh my goodness how did that happen?' ""The magnets were trapped in between different parts of TomÃ¡s' intestines. ""Two of them were too close together so they had to remove part of his intestines and patch up 14 holes. So he has loads of scar tissue in his intestines now. ""They burned holes in the intestines. Whenever they opened him up some of his intestines already leaked out. ""The surgeons told me they found 28 balls. TomÃ¡s' scar has healed but his parents say they will have to be vigilant for the the rest of his life ""(When) they put him together they sent him for an X-ray and one of the wee ones was hiding somewhere so they had to take all the intestines back out again and search bit by bit through it to find that wee grain. ""I was beating myself up something crazy - I still feel guilt. He is grand now but we have to look out, after the type of surgery he had, we have to look out for the rest of his life."" Mrs Quinn said she wanted to speak out to warn other parents of the dangers posed by the magnetic ball toys, which had been bought online for her older son. ""My message is please stay away from the magnets - no matter how clever you think your children are, accidents can happen.""

Celtic apologise for player's quarantine breach,"Celtic have apologised for a player's breach of coronavirus rules and described it as ""beyond explanation"". Boli Bolingoli admitted he played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock despite having recently returned from Spain without quarantining. The defender said he was ""guilty of an error of judgement"" and apologised. The club later confirmed all players and backroom staff have since been tested twice and returned negative results. Police Scotland confirmed Bolingoli had been issued with a fixed penalty notice for breaching quarantine regulations. Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the player's actions were ""utterly unacceptable."" The breach comes after eightAberdeen players apologised for visiting a bar at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak. Two of the players later tested positive for the virus, while six are currently self-isolating. Celtic said it ""unreservedly condemns and apologises"" for the behaviour of Bolingoli, who travelled to Spain without informing the club and then failed to observe quarantine restrictions."" Aclub statement,externaladded: ""It is difficult to imagine a more irresponsible action in current circumstances and we find it beyond explanation. ""The club will take immediate action through our own disciplinary procedures."" The Scottish champions said they have been in touch with every SPFL club and all relevant authorities to apologise ""for the fact that one of our employees has created so much additional difficulty through his actions."" In an earlier statement,Bolingoli, 25, said he wanted to apologise to his manager, team mates, supporters,external, ""and so many others for letting them down so badly"". He added: ""I am guilty of a major error of judgement. I know what I did was wrong and I know that I must now deal with the consequences."" Mr Yousaf said the player's actions could have major consequences for top flight football, which only resumed in Scotland on 1 August. He tweeted: ""Utterly unacceptable from Bolingoli. With a number of incidents, Scot Govt left with little choice but to consider whether pause is now needed in resumption of the game. ""Operational matter for Border Force & Police Scot, I support whatever enforcement action they deem necessary."" The Scottish government said it was in discussion with the club and football governing bodies to establish the facts. ""If confirmed as another serious incident within Scottish football, where protocols have been breached at the risk of wider public health, then the Scottish government will have little choice but to consider whether a pause is now needed in the resumption of the game in Scotland,"" they added.

Scottish pupils return to classrooms after lockdown,"Pupils at Kelso High School are among the first in the UK to begin the new 2020/21 academic year Scotland's pupils have returned to classes for the first time since lockdown began nearly five months ago. Borders and Shetland schools are the first to reopen with most others following on Wednesday. Physical distancing among students will not generally be required but hygiene and safety measures such as one-way systems have been put in place. Except for children of key workers, most of the country's 700,000 pupils have not been in class since 20 March. Is it safe for Scotland's schools to reopen? What's your council's plan for the return to school? Has your child returned to school? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external While councils have been given some flexibility over the back to school timetable, the Scottish government wants all schools fully open by 18 August. All age groups returned in the Scottish Borders on Tuesday - a week earlier than the normal start of term - but most councils have opted for a phased approach, for instance by having youngest pupils return first. Signs have been put up in classrooms at Cullivoe Primary School in Shetland in a bid to limit contact While there is no requirement for physical distancing between pupils, teachers should remain 2m apart from students or other adults. Older secondary pupils are also being encouraged to maintain distancing where possible if this does not hinder the return to full-time learning. There is no general requirement to wear face coverings although staff and pupils can do so voluntarily. School buses are treated as part of the school building, so normal distancing or face covering rules do not apply to pupils, but they will have to sanitise their hands prior to boarding. At her coronavirus briefing on Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that some teachers, parents and pupils would feel anxious, but said the guidance was carefully worked through and informed by scientific advice. ""Schools have worked really hard to support pupils through lockdown but we know the impact on education, on wellbeing, on happiness has been negative for young people so to get them back into full-time education has to be a priority,"" she said. Kelso High head teacher Jill Lothian says it's the new procedures that represent the biggest change Kelso High School in the Scottish Borders is one of the first in the country to welcome pupils back to full-time learning. Head teacher Jill Lothian says for young people, it's the procedures rather than the building itself that have changed most. She said there were different entry and exit points and the school is trying to limit the amount of time pupils are moving around the building. It is also attempting to keep them apart as much as possible. ""There's a bit of anxiety but that's what we're here for, to ensure that they get into the routines that are expected as we get them round the school,"" she said. Hand sanitiser stations have been set up in schools, including this one at Cullivoe Primary in Shetland Every classroom is equipped with sanitiser and a cleaning station for pupils to wipe down their desks and chairs. One-way systems are in place and pupils will be encouraged to spend break times outdoors, with controls to ensure they do not all leave the building at the same time. Shona Haslam, leader of Scottish Borders Council, believes the council has done everything it can to make the return to school as safe as possible ""Additional cleaning, additional ventilation, children not walking around the school quite so much, one-way systems in place, school transport being an extension of the school estate - we've done all of those measures that are in the Scottish government guidance and we are as confident as we can be,"" she said. Scottish Borders Council leader Shona Haslam says it has implemented the Scottish government's guidance in full At Inverclyde Academy in Greenock, the school's fresh cohort of S1 pupils will be the first to encounter the new normal of schooling when they arrive on Wednesday, with other year groups returning in the following days. There will be no sharing of equipment such as stationery or headphones. They can bring equipment from home but there is no need as individual stationery packs and calculators will be issued. Desks and seating have been arranged so that pupils are facing the front of the classroom and not each other. They can sit in pairs with a ""shoulder partner"" but there is a strict seating plan to keep students in ""bubbles"", limiting the number of close contacts. Head teacher Denise Crawford said there would be designated areas outside and in the cafeteria so year groups stay within their groups. The teacher's workstation is a measured 2m distance from the desks. A teacher is allowed to approach a child to give them individual help, but such contact must be kept to a minimum and for a maximum of 15 minutes. Inverclyde pupils Layla, Eddy, Rachel, Andrew and Emily spoke of their hopes and concerns over the return to school New Inverclyde Academy first year Emily,12, said she can't wait to see her friends again when she starts back at on Wednesday. ""We've not seen each other for so long, we'll be so happy to see each other,"" she said. ""It will just be great."" Layla, 11, thinks there will be some catching up to do. She said: ""I'm quite good at English and things and I don't think I've missed too much on that because I'm quite confident but definitely maths, I'll need to revise some things."" S5 pupil Eddy has found it difficult to motivate himself during lockdown but has some concerns about the return to school and the possible spread of Covid-19. ""I've got my gran who is in shielding. I need to keep her safe,"" he said ""That's what I'm worried about."" Rachel, 15, is concerned she will not be fully prepared for her higher exams next year. ""I think because we haven't sat the exams in fourth year, that going into fifth year and then sitting highers will be a bit of a shock,"" she said. ""I don't know how I'm going to cope with it."" Andrew, 12, is looking forward to some much-missed social interaction. ""During lockdown we were communicating but eventually there was just nothing to talk about because nothing was happening,"" he said. ""I hope we'll be able to talk about something other than Covid once we get back into school."" SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? RULES:Which lockdown rules will change next - and when?

Sturgeon: Aberdeen and Celtic games should be off,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Consider this the yellow card' Nicola Sturgeon has issued a warning to Scottish football asCeltic and Aberdeen matches were called offafter their players broke lockdown rules. The first minister had said the two clubs should not play this week. She said she did not want rule-abiding clubs and players, or fans, to be punished for the individual breaches. But she warned: ""Consider today the yellow card. The next time it will be the red card because you will leave us with absolutely no choice."" Celtic defender Boli Bolingoliflew to Spain without the club's knowledge, failed to quarantine, then played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock. Police Scotland confirmed Bolingoli had been issued with a fixed penalty notice for breaching quarantine regulations. The previous weekendeight Aberdeen players broke lockdown regulationsby visiting a bar together. Follow the latest news on coronavirus in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said news of Bolingoli's ""flagrant breach"" of the guidelines came through while the national clinical director, Professor Jason Leitch, was holding a meeting with the managers and captains of Scotland's top flight clubs to reinforce the importance of the guidance. St Mirren vCeltic- Wednesday, 12 August at 18:00 Aberdeenv Hamilton - Wednesday, 12 August at 19:45 CelticvAberdeen- Saturday, 15 August at 15:00 She said: ""This is just not acceptable. ""Every day I stand here and ask members of the public to make huge sacrifices on how they live their lives. The vast majority are doing that and it's not easy. ""We can't have privileged football players just deciding that they are not going to bother. This can't go on."" The SPFL later agreed to the call-offs and announced an ""urgent package of measures"" to prevent a repeat. These include plans to punish players who break the rules, an ""immediate"" player education programme and an agreement to take part in promotional activity for the Scottish government's FACT campaign. Sport Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ""This latest example indicates that the current arrangements are not working as intended, and so clearly additional steps now need to be taken to ensure that the necessity of strict compliance with the rules is fully and properly understood."" In the meantime, Celtic and Aberdeen can train as usual but friendly matches will not be allowed. Boli Bolingoli said he was ""guilty of an error of judgement"" Celtic managerNeil Lennon said it would be ""very difficult""for Bolingoli to be accepted back into the dressing room. He added: ""I am livid, it was a total betrayal of trust."" Ms Sturgeon earlier indicated ""very clear penalties"" will be in place for players and clubs when the rules are breached. The first minister said footballers are ""talented, skilled, hard-working professionals"" and ""well-rewarded"" role models. But she added: ""I don't think it is too much to ask them to live up to that, and that is all we are asking."" Prof Leitch said footballers who flout the regulations pose a risk to public health and endanger the return of all elite sport. He said Bolingoli had travelled to a ""high risk country"" then went to work and ""put both his team and the opposing team at risk of catching coronavirus. ""There has to be an implication of that in public health terms for those he was in contact with and their contact with others."" Eight Aberdeen players are self-isolating Bolingoli played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock even though he should have been self-isolating. The defender said he was ""guilty of an error of judgement"" and apologised. Celtic apologised and said his actions were ""beyond explanation"". All players and backroom staff have since been tested twice and returned negative results. Eight Aberdeen players have apologised for visiting a bar at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak in the city. Two of the players later tested positive for the virus, while six are currently self-isolating. A total of 165 positive cases of coronavirus are now linked to the outbreak in Aberdeen. Dr Emmanuel Okpo, consultant in Public Health Medicine, said a lack of physical distancing had been ""the significant factor in the spread of these cases"". He said it was now likely that all licensed premises in the city had been affected. ""This is because physical distancing - or the lack of it - has come up repeatedly in our investigation,"" he said. ""I would stress again that we must all take personal responsibility for physical distancing."" SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? RULES:Which lockdown rules will change next - and when?

Wales jobs not yet hit by full force of lockdown,"Across the UK employment fell by the largest amount in more than a decade The latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. The rate of unemployment in Wales between April and June was down at 2.7% with 8,000 fewer people unemployed than between January and March, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show. That is 20,000 fewer than the same period a year ago. The rate of unemployment across the UK was higher at 3.9%. The figures do not include the millions of people who are furloughed, those on zero-hours contracts but not getting shifts, or people on temporary unpaid leave from a job, as they still count as employed. In June,316,500 employees in Wales were paid 80% of their salariesunder the UK government's furlough scheme, figures from the Treasury showed. As such, today's figures do not capture the full impact of the pandemic. The number of people on the payroll across the UK in July was down by 730,000 compared with March as coronavirus hit, thelargest quarterly decrease in more than a decade. This could act as an indication that many more job losses are to come in Wales. The level of economic inactivity - the number of people in Wales who were not working and not available to work - between April and June was 432,000, which is 11,000 fewer than between January and March this year but 15,000 more than April to June last year. Those are the people who cannot work because they are ill, caring for someone or in full-time education. There were 41,000 people unemployed but able to work between April and June. Vic Phillips, from Brecon, said he been using the time to consider different career options For Vic Phillips the last few months have been a whirlwind of emotions. Since the end of July, the father-of-one, from Brecon, Powys, has been furloughed, under the UK Treasury scheme, after theWales Millennium Centre, in Cardiff Bay, closed due to lockdown. With shows cancelled until at least January, the deputy tech manager, who has worked in theatre for 15 years, has now been made redundant. With no date for when performances might resume, Mr Phillips said he had felt anxious about being able to pay bills and provide for his family and knew he needed to change career. ""It doesn't feel like the normality of changing jobs, where taking someone out of position leaves a hole that's filled,"" he said. ""There are people that are trying to find work and there aren't extra jobs, if anything there's less. ""That feels very challenging and at times it can feel a little bit bleak."" But having fallen in love with gardening and enjoying spending more time with his family during lockdown, he is now using it as an opportunity to ""embrace"" other options outside the world of theatre. Many more job losses could still come in Wales Myke Jones, from Cwmbran, was working in IT but lost his job at the beginning of the pandemic. He is now trying to apply for new jobs at the age of 58. Speaking to theBBC Radio Wales' Breakfastprogramme, he said he had already applied for two jobs before 08:00 BST on Tuesday. ""It's a big competition, I've noticed a huge difference in the past couple of months in the fact that jobs are few and far between. You're looking at 200-plus people applying for those jobs. ""I've spent ages on my CV trying to make it look flashy and say the right things, but the video interview comes along and the moment they see you, you can tell they see straight away 'you're quite old' and they tend to shy away. ""I struggle to pay our bills, we've got mortgages to pay, I can't see my pension covering it all so I'm going to be working for a long time yet. I can see a lot of travelling and staying away from home."" Mr Jones has also been recovering from cancer during lockdown. ""We live in a flat, we haven't got a garden, I need to be a bit more careful so I don't go out as much as most people and that worry I've got about cancer returning just adds to the mix of 'I'm struggling to find a job, how will I pay the bills next month'."" Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' One in three firms 'expect to make redundancies' University students 'selling clothes to pay rent' Creative industries 'face thousands of job losses' Jonathan Athow from the ONS said: ""The labour market continues recent trends, with a fall in employment and significantly reduced hours of work as many people are furloughed. ""Figures from our main survey show there has been a rise in people without a job and not looking for one, though wanting to work. ""In addition, there are still a large number of people who say they are working no hours and getting zero pay. ""The falls in employment are greatest among the youngest and oldest workers, along with those in lower-skilled jobs."" He said the number of vacancies began to recover in July, especially in small businesses and sectors such as hospitality, though demand for workers remains depressed. Gerwyn Davies says a spike in redundancies over the next few months was ""almost inevitable"" Gerwyn Davies from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the professional body for HR and people development, said: ""The jobs market appears resilient on the surface, partly because the official statistics lag events by a couple of months. ""Despite this, the rise in the number of economically inactive people and the fall in the number of self-employed people shows that the current economic situation is already having an impact on the labour market. ""And with a spike in redundancies over the coming months now almost inevitable due to the unwinding of the Job Retention Scheme, we can expect to see unemployment rise sharply too."" Rebecca Wooley, director of Citizens Advice Cymru, said their data showed groups most likely to face redundancy included parents, carers and those who have been shielding. She added: ""Our biggest worry is we predict an increase in those numbers once the furlough scheme ends. ""Even now, we're helping one person every two minutes with a redundancy issue."" So why is unemployment and economic inactivity still falling in Wales? One reason is the various schemes from the UK government to keep people on payrolls, meaning they have not been made redundant so far. The Job Retention Scheme, in particular, allowed employees to be furloughed on 80% of their salary, paid for by the UK Treasury. More than one in four of the Welsh workforce has been furloughed and the fear is that when those schemes end in the autumn many will not have a job to go back to. But are those who are predicting unemployment levels like the 1930s ""doom mongers""? These figures might seem surprising when organisations such as the Bank of England are warning of unemployment levels the like of which we have not seen for decades. They are a reminder that the detailed analysis by the ONS, which includes a breakdown for what is happening in Wales, lags several months behind what is happening to individual people and workforces. It is interesting that the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, and the north west of England are following a similar pattern. Economies there are more similar to Wales and less like the behaviour of the south east of England, for instance. Another report from the ONS, looking specifically at employment in July across the UK, is much more concerning. It shows that the number of people on the payroll was down by nearly three-quarters of a million (730,000) in July compared with March when coronavirus hit. That is warning of what is on the horizon.

Celtic and Aberdeen games off after Covid breaches,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Consider this the yellow card' Nicola Sturgeon has issued a warning to Scottish football asCeltic and Aberdeen matches were called offafter their players broke lockdown rules. The first minister had said the two clubs should not play this week. She said she did not want rule-abiding clubs and players, or fans, to be punished for the individual breaches. But she warned: ""Consider today the yellow card. The next time it will be the red card because you will leave us with absolutely no choice."" Celtic defender Boli Bolingoliflew to Spain without the club's knowledge, failed to quarantine, then played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock. Police Scotland confirmed Bolingoli had been issued with a fixed penalty notice for breaching quarantine regulations. The previous weekendeight Aberdeen players broke lockdown regulationsby visiting a bar together. Follow the latest news on coronavirus in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said news of Bolingoli's ""flagrant breach"" of the guidelines came through while the national clinical director, Professor Jason Leitch, was holding a meeting with the managers and captains of Scotland's top flight clubs to reinforce the importance of the guidance. St Mirren vCeltic- Wednesday, 12 August at 18:00 Aberdeenv Hamilton - Wednesday, 12 August at 19:45 CelticvAberdeen- Saturday, 15 August at 15:00 She said: ""This is just not acceptable. ""Every day I stand here and ask members of the public to make huge sacrifices on how they live their lives. The vast majority are doing that and it's not easy. ""We can't have privileged football players just deciding that they are not going to bother. This can't go on."" The SPFL later agreed to the call-offs and announced an ""urgent package of measures"" to prevent a repeat. These include plans to punish players who break the rules, an ""immediate"" player education programme and an agreement to take part in promotional activity for the Scottish government's FACT campaign. Sport Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ""This latest example indicates that the current arrangements are not working as intended, and so clearly additional steps now need to be taken to ensure that the necessity of strict compliance with the rules is fully and properly understood."" In the meantime, Celtic and Aberdeen can train as usual but friendly matches will not be allowed. Boli Bolingoli said he was ""guilty of an error of judgement"" Celtic managerNeil Lennon said it would be ""very difficult""for Bolingoli to be accepted back into the dressing room. He added: ""I am livid, it was a total betrayal of trust."" Ms Sturgeon earlier indicated ""very clear penalties"" will be in place for players and clubs when the rules are breached. The first minister said footballers are ""talented, skilled, hard-working professionals"" and ""well-rewarded"" role models. But she added: ""I don't think it is too much to ask them to live up to that, and that is all we are asking."" Prof Leitch said footballers who flout the regulations pose a risk to public health and endanger the return of all elite sport. He said Bolingoli had travelled to a ""high risk country"" then went to work and ""put both his team and the opposing team at risk of catching coronavirus. ""There has to be an implication of that in public health terms for those he was in contact with and their contact with others."" Eight Aberdeen players are self-isolating Bolingoli played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock even though he should have been self-isolating. The defender said he was ""guilty of an error of judgement"" and apologised. Celtic apologised and said his actions were ""beyond explanation"". All players and backroom staff have since been tested twice and returned negative results. Eight Aberdeen players have apologised for visiting a bar at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak in the city. Two of the players later tested positive for the virus, while six are currently self-isolating. A total of 165 positive cases of coronavirus are now linked to the outbreak in Aberdeen. Dr Emmanuel Okpo, consultant in Public Health Medicine, said a lack of physical distancing had been ""the significant factor in the spread of these cases"". He said it was now likely that all licensed premises in the city had been affected. ""This is because physical distancing - or the lack of it - has come up repeatedly in our investigation,"" he said. ""I would stress again that we must all take personal responsibility for physical distancing."" SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? RULES:Which lockdown rules will change next - and when?

Putin: Russia's Covid-19 vaccine approved for useThe Russian president says the vaccine has passed all the required checks but experts are sceptical.Europe,"President Putin said one of his daughters had been vaccinated against the virus Russian President Vladimir Putin has said a locally developed vaccine for Covid-19 has been given regulatory approval after less than two months of testing on humans. Mr Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checks, adding that his daughter had already been given it. Officials have said they plan to start mass vaccination in October. Experts have raised concerns about the speed of Russia's work, suggesting that researchers might be cutting corners. Amid fears that safety could have been compromised, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged Russia last week to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. On Tuesday, the WHO said it had been in talks with Russian authorities about undertaking a review of the vaccine, which has been named Sputnik-V. Currently, the Russian vaccine is not among the WHO's list of six vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials, which involve more widespread testing in humans. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? Encouraging results in vaccine trials Russian spies target Covid-19 vaccine research More than 100 vaccines around the world are in early development, with some of those being tested on people in clinical trials. Despite rapid progress, most experts think any vaccine would not become widely available until mid-2021. Calling it a world first, President Putin said the vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, offered ""sustainable immunity"" against the coronavirus. He said he knew the vaccine was ""quite effective"", without giving further details, and stressed that it had passed ""all needed checks"". This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Mr Putin also said the vaccine had been given to one of his daughters, who was feeling fine despite a brief temperature increase. ""I think in this sense she took part in the experiment,"" Mr Putin said, without specifying which of his two daughters had received the vaccine. ""After the first injection her temperature was 38 degrees, the next day 37.5, and that was it. After the second injection her temperature went up slightly, then back to normal."" It is rare for President Putin to talk publicly about his daughters - named Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova in media reports - and their lives have been shrouded in secrecy. Russian scientists said early-stage trials of the vaccine had been completedand the results were a success. The Russian vaccine uses adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that usually causes the common cold, to trigger an immune response. In July Russian scientists announced that early-stage trials of a vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute had been completed But the vaccine's approval by Russian regulators comes before the completion of a larger study involving thousands of people, known as a phase-three trial. Experts consider these trials an essential part of the testing process. Despite this, Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Tuesday the vaccine had ""proven to be highly effective and safe"", hailing it as a big step towards ""humankind's victory"" over Covid-19. Russian officials said the vaccine had been named Sputnik-V, in honour of the world's first satellite. Sputnik is the Russian word for satellite. They have likened the search for a vaccine to the space race contested by the Soviet Union and the US during the Cold War. Russia has previously been accused by the UK, US and Canada of seeking to steal research related to Covid-19. Russia is fast-tracking its Covid-19 vaccine at an extraordinary pace. It began the first clinical trials on 17 June, months after teams in China, the US and Europe. Unlike other groups, the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow has not released any safety or immunity data from its studies. This makes it impossible for independent scientists to make an assessment. President Putin is keen to send a clear message to the world regarding the prowess of Russian science.  But simply being first is not enough. No Covid-19 vaccine being developed has yet been shown to offer protection against coronavirus. That central question remains unanswered. The progress Russia says it has made on a coronavirus vaccine has been met with scepticism by health officials and media outlets in the US and Europe. Last month, America's leading infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci expressed doubts about the rigour of the testing process in fast-track vaccine efforts in Russia and China. WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier has echoed those sentiments, telling reporters on 4 August: ""Sometimes individual researchers claim they have found something, which is of course, as such, great news. ""But between finding or having a clue of maybe having a vaccine that works, and having gone through all the stages, is a big difference."" Meanwhile the Moscow-based Association of Clinical Trials Organizations (Acto), which represents the world's top drug companies in Russia, urged the health ministry to postpone approval until after phase-three trials. Acto executive director Svetlana Zavidova told the Russian MedPortal site that a decision on mass vaccination had been carried out after a combined first- and second-phase tests on 76 people, and that it was impossible to confirm the efficacy of a drug on this basis.

The Scottish government said it was in discussion with the club and football governing bodies to establish the facts. ""If confirmed as another serious incident within Scottish football, where protocols have been breached at the risk of wider public health, then the Scottish government will have little choice but to consider whether a pause is now needed in the resumption of the game in Scotland,"" they added.

"Trump exits briefing as man shot near White HouseThe US president returned minutes later, saying that the Secret Service had shot a suspect.US & Canada","This video can not be played Watch President Trump being rushed out of news conference US President Donald Trump was escorted out of a news conference after Secret Service agents shot and wounded a man who claimed to be armed outside the White House. The Secret Service said the incident happened one block from the compound, when an officer fired on the suspect who had run ""aggressively"" towards him. An agent then walked on stage as Mr Trump was speaking and led him away. The president returned minutes later to say the situation was under control. The US Secret Service said the incident happened on Monday on the corner of 17th Street and Pennsylvania Ave - outside the White House perimeter. It said a 51-year-old man, who has not been identified, approached the officer, told him he had weapons and assumed a ""shooter's stance"", whereupon the officer shot him in the torso. The Secret Service did not say whether the man was armed. It added that ""both the officer and the suspect were then taken to hospital"", and that ""at no time during this incident was the White House complex breached"". After Mr Trump and his staff left, doors to the briefing room were locked with the journalists inside. When the president returned nine minutes later, he said: ""Law enforcement shot someone, it seems to be the suspect."" He said he did not know if the person harboured any ill intentions towards him.

Statue campaign for black footballer reaches goalA statue for Jack Leslie who was dropped by England in 1925 will stand outside Home Park in Plymouth.,"Jack Leslie was picked to play for England in 1925, but dropped soon after Crowdfunders have raised Â£100,000 to erect a statue of a footballer who was dropped from the England team when selectors discovered he was black. Jack Leslie would have been the first black person to play for the nation having been selected in 1925. Acampaign for his statue outside Plymouth Argyle's Home Parkstadium has attracted donations from nearly 2,000 people since July. Campaign co-founder Greg Foxsmith said he was ""delighted"" by the news. Leslie joined Argyle in 1921 and stayed there for 14 years, making 401 appearances and scoring 137 goals. Club chairman Simon Hallett said: ""Jack was not just a great footballer. He has become a symbol of the injustices in our game and in our society. ""I hope that when we have his statue up it will become an enduring symbol of the progress we can make in fighting the evil of racism."" Jack Leslie played for Plymouth Argyle in the 1920s Leslie's granddaughter Lyn Davies said: ""I nearly fell over when I realised we had gone over the Â£100,000. It's just amazing, I'm stunned."" Lesley Hiscott, another granddaughter, said she was ""over the moon"" and ""ecstatic"". Former Argyle player Ronnie Mauge described the campaign as ""phenomenal"" and said he was ""so proud of the Plymouth people and the club"". ""He [Leslie] laid the foundation for someone like me to go to Plymouth,"" Trinidad and Tobago international Mauge added. The statue will stand outside Home Park Argyle supporter and comedian Josh Widdicombe said the campaign had ""shined a light"" on racism in football. Mr Foxsmith said: ""We want to use the Jack Leslie story to highlight those issues, to challenge prejudice, to challenge discrimination, and to show in 2020 we can be better than we were in 1925."" Fundraising for the statue will continue, with proposals for its design considered by Leslie's family and fans.

"Debenhams to cut 2,500 jobs amid pandemicThe chain says current trading environment for retailers is still ""a long way from returning to normal.""Business","Struggling department store group Debenhams says it will cut 2,500 more jobs as it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. This is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its workforce. The cuts will be mainly across its UK stores and distribution centre, but it said no new shops were slated to shut. Shop workers' union Usdaw reacted angrily to the news, saying legal procedures had not been followed. By law, mass redundancies have to be subject to a consultation period. Usdaw said it was preparing a legal challenge on behalf of members affected. ""We have been contacted by members who say they are being made redundant by conference call, with no meaningful consultation or proper notice period, as required by law,"" said union national officer Dave Gill. ""That is an appalling way to treat staff."" Debenhams, which is currently in administration, declined to comment but its administrators, FRP, said consultation had not been possible as the retailer was insolvent and had ""limited"" options. A spokesman said: ""Those affected by redundancy will take no particular comfort from this, but the steps taken are in response to an unpredictable and challenging trading environment and aim to ensure the future viability of the business, while also meeting wider statutory obligations."" In April, Debenhams fell into administration for the second time in a year as coronavirus heaped pressure on the business. The firm said the current trading environment for retailers was still ""a long way from returning to normal"". How have you been affected by job losses at Debenhams? Tell us about your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Earlier this year, it said 20 of its stores would remain permanently closed because of the impact of the pandemic. Debenhams said on Tuesday: ""Such difficult decisions are being taken by many retailers right now, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to give Debenhams every chance of a viable future. ""We have to ensure our store costs are aligned with realistic expectations,"" it added. The chain said that people affected had been informed and thanked them for their ""service and commitment"". ""We have successfully reopened 124 stores post-lockdown, and these are currently trading ahead of management expectations,"" it said. Debenhams could remain in administration for the rest of this year, as lenders wait to see how it performs post-lockdown and in the crucial Christmas trading period. Like many of its competitors, the retailer was already ailing before the pandemic forced it to suspend trading at its department stores. The news of the latest job cuts came after the British Retail Consortium saidthe number of visits to High Streets was still down significantlyas people shopped online instead. The BRC said some retailers were continuing to struggle because of the coronavirus crisis. It made a fresh call for government help with rents. Other High Street names have also announced job losses as they fight to stay afloat. Last week,WH Smith said it was cutting 1,500 jobs- 11% of its workforce - after the lockdown caused sales to plummet. DW Sports, John Lewis, Marks and Spencer, Boots and Selfridges are among other big names to announce redundancies. It's less than two weeks into August and at least another 10,000 jobs have been lost as the furlough scheme starts to wind down.

Sex-abuse victim accused of 'grooming' awarded Â£1mHis convicted rapist teacher argued that the 13-year-old had groomed him - not the other way round.UK,"James's abuser was Andrew Adams, a PE teacher at Highgate Wood School A man sexually abused as a schoolboy has been awarded more than Â£1m from his teacher's employer. Haringey Council's insurers argued unsuccessfully the assaults by Andrew Adams had caused no long-term trauma. Despite pleading guilty to criminal charges, Adams argued in a civil case 13-year-old ""James"" had groomed him. Haringey said it had ""strongly condemned"" Adams's actions, adding the appeal had been brought by its insurers to determine the level of damages. In 1980, a man raped James. Scared and confused, he confided in his teacher at Highgate Wood School, in north London. Adams told him the rape proved he was gay, everyone would hate him but he would be his friend. And he proceeded to groom and then sexually abuse James for years. Speaking exclusively to BBC News, in his first interview since the ruling in February, James, who asked not to use his real name, said: ""Adams assaulted me in the school changing rooms, the gym and outside of term time in the school's VW van. ""He was admired, no-one questioned him."" After school, Adams would take him to the home he shared with his mother and rape him while she was in the house. Afterwards, Adams would make himself a sandwich and eat it while James watched him, hungry. Adams also took James to Hampstead Heath and public lavatories and made him watch men having sex. Adams made James watch men having sex on Hampstead Heath ""His thing was assaulting you in public places and getting away with it,"" James said. ""He sexually assaulted me in Regent's Park mosque. ""And I'm sure it was just for titillation, to get away with it."" James believes other staff at the school suspected Adams - but no-one investigated. The teenager became distant from his friends and family. And the abuse and sexual activity continued until he was 21. He felt utterly alone with his secret. And, even though he was successful in the IT industry, James had two breakdowns. Meanwhile, Adams thrived, becoming deputy head of Highgate Wood and even having a wing of the school named after him. Eventually, when talking to a psychiatrist, James disclosed the abuse. He then went to the police. And in 2014, Adams pleaded guilty to charges of assault and buggery against James. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, later reduced to eight years on appeal. By this point, James was so mentally damaged by the legacy of what had happened he could no longer work. He sued Adams and Haringey. But in court Adams said it was James who had groomed him. And James had to spend two days in the witness box. ""The idea that I, as a 13-year-old pre-pubescent boy, could somehow instigate or groom a 35-year-old teacher - I was shocked,"" he said. James was shocked at the claim a 13-year-old could have groomed a teacher ""All I could do was deny it."" Haringey had sought to have James's claim dismissed in its entirety on the basis it was time barred. The council's insurers argued Haringey was not responsible for Adams's acts after James had: left the school for a brief period, aged 15, in 1982, but continued to go on sailing trips with pupils there - because he had consented to sex with Adams returned to the school to do his A-levels  - because Adams no longer taught him PE And the assaults could not have caused any long-term trauma because they had not been violent. But the Court of Appeal rejected all the arguments raised on behalf of the local authority. James was shocked at the council's attitude. ""It felt like I was under attack,"" he said. ""I felt tremendously let down by Haringey. James feels let down by Haringey Council ""I thought they were dishonest in pretending to the public that they actually care, because when they are confronted with someone who has suffered from abuse from one of their staff, and the long-term consequences of that, they want to say it's nothing to do with them."" His solicitor, David McClenaghan, from the firm Bolt Burdon Kemp, told BBC News: ""James can be incredibly proud of himself. ""The Court of Appeal has roundly accepted his case that it was impossible for him to consent to sexual activity with his teacher, given the background of manipulation and grooming that he was subjected to. ""So other victims and survivors of child abuse are unlikely to face these kinds of arguments from defendants like Haringey or people like Andrew Adams."" A Haringey Council official said: ""Our sincere sympathies remain with the victim following these incidents at Highgate Wood School back in the 1980s. ""We have previously strongly condemned the actions of Andrew Adams. ""And that position has not changed. ""To be clear, Andrew Adams was jailed in 2014 for admitted criminal acts.

Redundancy: 'It's been stressful',"""It's been really upsetting and stressful,"" says Will Bird, an events producer who was recently made redundant. Mr Bird will need to move out of his apartment soon as he can no longer afford the rent without a job. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June 1,778 firms said were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In June 2019, only 345 firms had plans to cut 24,000 jobs. The cuts came as coronavirus wiped more than a quarter off UK economic output. The figures give an insight into the surge of redundancies announced since coronavirus blighted the UK. Airbus, Royal Mail, the airport services group Swissport, HSBC, Centrica and the Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie and Benny's, were among the businesses to announce redundancy plans in June. Firms planning to make 20 or more staff redundant have to notify the government by filing a form called an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy. The number of these forms filed with the Insolvency Service shows a steep rise in the number of firms planning to cut staff. Events producer William Bird has been made redundant after four years with his firm William Bird, 27, had been working as an assistant producer at an events agency in London that creates tailored experiences for big brands. He was furloughed in April, and then at the end of June, he was told that he was being made redundant, after four years with the firm. ""Unfortunately, right now members of the public do not feel safe to attend events... so at the end of June, I was told that my company had done everything to try to retain me, but due to the lack of work coming in, they didn't have the financial backing to keep me on,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bird said it had been a ""difficult year in general"", as his mother passed away from cancer a few weeks into lockdown. ""It's been really upsetting and stressful. I've gone from having a tragedy in the family, to looking for work, and at the end of August I'm going to have to move out from the flat I rent in London with my girlfriend because we can't afford it anymore,"" he said. He says he only received three weeks' of redundancy pay as he was on rolling contracts during his first year with the firm. And he is upset that his month of notice in July was paid at the 80% furlough rate, rather than the full salary listed in his contract. The only consolation to the situation, says Mr Bird, is that his firm didn't want to let him go: ""They told me that this wasn't performance-based at all, and that they were making difficult decisions for the future of the company, with the hope that after the industry recovered, they'd love to offer me my job back."" The figures from May and June show a substantial increase from the same months the previous year, and from March and April, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: ""I would expect it to be bigger in July and bigger again in August, because there was a wave of firms that announced redundancies in the first week of July and the first week of August. ""I think it is inevitable now that redundancy numbers will be higher than they were at the peak of the last recession in 2008."" Companies including WH Smith, Dyson, Dixons Carphone, John Lewis, and Casual Dining Group have all announced redundancies recently, and there has beena surge in requests for redundancy advice,external. Adding up the total number of dismissals planned shows a similar picture of stricken employers cutting staff. Though the June figure excludes information from 79 firms, which was not available when the numbers were compiled, it shows a steep rise in the number of positions being considered for redundancy. The total number of employers making redundancies will be higher than these figures, as firms making fewer than 20 posts redundant at any one ""establishment"" do not have to notify government. However, employers often end up making fewer redundancies than the original number they notify to the government. The redundancy process takes time. It includes a consultation period of a minimum of 30 days for 20 staff and over, and 45 days for 100 or more staff. This helps to explain why official redundancy figures gathered by the Office for National Statistics do not yet show a significant rise. In Northern Ireland HR1 forms are filed with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures. In response to the BBC's findings the Department for Work and Pensions pointed to the measures it has introduced to try to support those looking for work. ""Across the country our Plan for Jobs will give business the confidence to recruit and retain workers... and - through the Kickstart scheme - create hundreds of thousands of new, subsidised jobs for young people,"" a spokesperson said.

PM considers law change for migrant removals,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK should work with France over channel crossings. The UK needs to consider changes to asylum laws to deter migrants from crossing the English Channel, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said it was currently ""very, very difficult"" to legally return people who arrive in the UK from France using small boats. More than 4,000 people have successfully crossed the English Channel this way so far this year. Immigration Minister Chris Philp is in Paris for talks with French officials. He has been accompanied by the UK's newly appointed Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney, to discuss how to reduce the number of migrant crossings. The UK government has said it wants to work with the French authorities to make the route ""unviable"". Speaking ahead of the meeting, the UK's former national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the UK may need to pay for increased enforcement along the French coast. What happens to migrants found in the Channel? Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? Inquiry launched into Channel migrant crossings ""The French do have 300km of coastline facing the UK which is quite hard to police and I think a lot of the money they are asking for is to reinforce mobile patrols up and down those beaches to stop people even getting into these boats,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Johnson pledged to work with the French authorities to discourage people from making the ""dangerous"" journey across the channel. But he added the UK also needed to look at ""the panoply of laws that an illegal immigrant has at his or her disposal that allow them to stay here"". The Ministry of Defence said on Monday it had sent an RAF Atlas transport aircraft to help Border Force spot small boats trying to cross the Channel. The Home Officehad asked defence chiefsfor help to deal with migrants making the crossing. This video can not be played The men and women on the boat told the BBC's Simon Jones they were from Syria Since Thursday, more than 600 people have been intercepted on the route. Downing Street said Border Force was looking at a ""range of options,"" including new measures, to stop boats entering British waters. The UK is currently following EU asylum law during its 11-month post-Brexit transition period following its departure from the bloc in January. This includes the so-calledDublin regulation, which states that a person's asylum claim can be transferred to the first member state they entered. The PM's spokesman said the UK wanted to replace the ""inflexible and rigid"" regulation with a new agreement on returns after December. This video can not be played Migrants setting out to sea 20 miles east of Calais were filmed by a BBC team on Saturday He added that the current Dublin rules, whichput a time limit,externalon transfers, could be ""abused by both migrants and their lawyers to frustrate the returns of those who have no right to be here"". In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Monday, 23 Tory MPs and two peers said the UK should refuse to sign up to a ""similar agreement"" to Dublin after December. The group said ministers should do ""whatever it takes"" to deal with the problem, saying many of their constituents were angry that migrants had been put up in ""expensive hotels"" and given ""immediate access"" to financial support. Ms Patel went out on a police boat patrol during her visit to Dover on Monday. Dover MP Nathalie Elphicke, who was not one of the signatories, said Tuesday's talks were welcome but engagement at a higher level was needed to enable boats to be safely turned around and returned to France. ""There is no reason we can't come to an agreement with France on returns,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's really important we work with the French on this issue as it's a joint issue."" Ms Patel, who met her opposite number GÃ©rald Darmanin last month, has said the UK is committed to ""shutting down"" the route and dismantling the criminal gangs facilitating the illegal crossings. Speaking during a visit to Dover on Monday, she said the current situation was ""totally unacceptable"" and the UK and France need to work together to address what was a ""shared challenge"". The French government says it has deployed extra resources to detect and intercept boats before they set out, leading to a ten-fold increase in the number of crossings being prevented. Intelligence co-operation with the UK has been stepped up while plans to strengthen control of the main crossing points are being finalised, the country's interior ministry added. Since the demolition of the infamous 'Jungle' nearly four years ago, French authorities have been successful in stopping other large-scale camps from forming. But migrants do still arrive in Calais; they are just more scattered. Greater security measures - including a wall built along the motorway with UK funding - have made it more difficult for migrants to stow away on lorries. But that's led the people smugglers to increasingly turn to using the equally risky method of small boats. The UK and France have worked closely on this for close to two decades. The Treaty of Le Touquet which effectively 'moved' the UK border to Calais (and the French border to Dover) to allow checks to happen before crossings, was signed in 2003. But they can't change geography. Calais remains a magnet because it is only 20 miles from the UK - on a clear day in Dover, you can see the headlights of French traffic on the other side of the sea. No amount of planes, walls or Navy deployments can alter that. Quite apart from the humanitarian issue here, there is added political pressure for the UK government. David Cameron was pretty roundly criticised for suggesting in 2016 that Brexit would mean the French would pull out of bilateral agreements and we'd see ""Jungles"" popping up on the South coast of England. There's certainly no indication of that, but there's no doubt that the images of dinghies landing on Kent's beaches will be a difficult one for a government that has set huge store by its promise to 'take back control' of immigration.

This afternoon's updates are:  There are fears brass bands will not be able to survive lockdown without being able to rehearse in person again. But in recent months, bands across Wales have been creative, practising and putting on concerts online. When Brecon Town Concert Band met for their first rehearsal after lockdown they were not able to meet inside - but they did the next best thing. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Brecon band plays again, but outdoors Coronavirus has exposed the ""grim truth"" of homelessness, says Plaid Cymru's health spokeswoman Delyth Jewell. Welcoming the announcement of loans for private tenants in arrears due to the pandemic, she added the commitment to tackling homelessness and the housing crisis was ""long overdue"". âTo truly address these long terms problems we need a housing first model, more affordable homes being built and ending no-fault evictions for good,"" she said. âHomelessness is and remains a political choice that should have been tackled long ago. Access to housing should be a human right."" Department store group Debenhams says itwill cut 2,500 more jobsas it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. This is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its workforce. The cuts will be mainly across its UK stores and distribution centre, but it said no more shops were planned to shut. During lockdown just four gardeners have been responsible for the upkeep of Bodnant Gardens About 80 jobs at the National Trust in Wales could be lost due to the coronavirus pandemic. Houses, gardens and shops managed by the charity were closed in March as lockdown began. Now despite being able to reopen some sites to visitors, the trust has warnedmany historical properties may have to remain closed for years. Assistant director Rebecca Williams said the lack of income meant the trust had to make ""very difficult decisions"". The UK's largest conservation charity, the National Trust looks after historic houses, gardens and hundreds of miles of coastline in Wales. It had previously announced about1,200 jobs would be cut acrossthe charity as a result of anticipated losses of Â£200m. The latest two people to die with coronavirus in Wales were both in the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board region, covering the whole of north Wales. It has recorded 407 deaths, the highest number of any health board in Wales. Two more deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales takes the total to 1,581, according to Public Health Wales.  There have been two more  deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales (PHW). It takes the number of pandemic deaths across Wales to 1,581. A further 13 cases of Covid-19 have also been recorded by PHW. It means there have now been 17,476 positive cases of Covid-19 in Wales since the start of the pandemic.  The latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of
lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. The
rate of unemployment in Wales between April and June was down, at 2.7%, with
8,000 fewer people unemployed than between January and March, Office for
National Statistics (ONS) figures show. That
is 20,000 fewer than the same period a year ago. The
rate of unemployment across the UK was higher at 3.9%. Gerwyn Davies from the
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the professional body
for human resources, said: ""The jobs market appears resilient on
the surface, partly because the official statistics lag events by a couple of
months. ""And
with a spike in redundancies over the coming months now almost inevitable due
to the unwinding of the Job Retention Scheme, we can expect to see unemployment
rise sharply too."" Read more here. Citizens Advice has welcomed a scheme to help people who have fallen into rental arrears during lockdown. It follows an announcement during the Welsh Government's weekly coronavirus briefing that tenants will be able to pay back arrears using a Tenancy Saver Loan. Rebecca Woolley, Citizens Advice Wales director, said: 

""Research has shown that renters have been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus crisis. ""We're pleased that the Welsh Government is taking steps to help people who have built up rent arrears during the crisis through no fault of their own."" She said to ensure the scheme is effective, it was essential users were not pushed further into financial difficulty with interest charges, which would mean additional costs. Julie James says
it is âtoo early to sayâ what the level of appeals might look like after A-level
results are announced on Thursday. The housing minister's comments comes after theScottish Government apologised over the way exams in Scotland were marked. Ms James was asked during the Welsh Government's weekly news conference whether exam appeals in Wales would be made free. She said: âThe
appeals process in Wales will be in place. ""The schools will be able to appeal
if they need to do so; we'll wait to see what the results are. ""It's too early to
say at the moment what the level of appeal might look like or what the results
might be. ""Weâre a couple of days in advance of the results coming out.â The latest unemployment figures for Wales âdonât tell the whole storyâ, the housing minister has said. The figures suggest thefull force of lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. The rate of unemployment in Wales between April and June was 2.7%, with 8,000 fewer people unemployed than between January and March, official figures showed. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Julie James said: âWe don't think these figures tell the whole story. âWe definitely think that the picture will become clearer over the coming months as the furlough scheme winds down, and as companies take stock of where that leaves them. âWe're still in the easing process so people are still trying to gauge whether their companies are still viable and what that means for income and so on, so it's very difficult to say right now exactly where we are.â ""We absolutely rely on the good faith and good conscience"" of Welsh people to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, Julie James has said. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs weekly coronavirus
briefing, the housing minister said people needed to comply with regulations to keep cases down. She said: âWe want people to continue to be cautious and to continue
to obey the rules and in that way we have the best chance of stopping a second
wave. âOf course weâve got preparations in place with our local
authorities and other public services in order to prepare. Itâs only sensible
that any government would do that."" Julie James says local authorities should only âenforceâ social distancing measures for pubs, bars and restaurants as a âlast resortâ if they flout the rules. Speaking during the coronavirus press conference, the minister said the Welsh Government had given further powers to councils to enforce rules, but it was important they worked with local businesses in an âengaged"" and ""educatedâ way. She said: âLocal authorities are working with their local businesses to ensure that they understand the rules, that theyâre able to apply those rules, and then only enforce when itâs obvious that somebody is deliberately flouting those rules.â The Minister for Housing
and Local Government has said the Welsh Government is ""very reliant on
people doing the right thing"" by wearing face masks on public transport. Julie James told the weekly news conference the government had given local
authorities the power to enforce this rule. But she said authorities should
""engage, educate and only enforce right at the end of that process"". She added that the Welsh Government is
""expecting people to just behave reasonably"". And she reiterated: ""They are mandatory
on public transport in Wales."" In response to questions about reassurance for Welsh students who are expecting exam results next week, Julie James said: âI am really happy to reassure every learner in Wales that
the model here is very different.â It followsconcerns about the way grades are being awarded in England and Scotland. She said the system âtakes into account work that
has been completed by the students"". ""For example, here in Wales weâve never let
go of AS-Levels so if you took A-Levels this year then you would have had your
AS-Levels last year and they would have contributed 40% to your A-Level
grade.â âWe are very keen that our learners are given the accolades
they need for the hard work that theyâve done but also that they get the grades
they deserve and those grades are robust.â The housing minister says âit's hard to put actual numbersâ on
how many people may look to benefit from a new scheme to help them with rent
arrears. Earlier Julie James said the Welsh Government was making Â£8m
available to help those who have fallen behind with their rent payments as a
result of the pandemic. Speaking at the weekly Welsh Government press conference,
Ms James said: âWeâre expecting a particular cohort of people to benefit from
this. âAnyone who's entitled to benefit or is in socially
rented housing has a different route to help themâ¦ So we're encouraging people
who have recourse to any of the other public funds to use that public fund. âThis is for a particular cohort of people who weren't in
any rent arrears before and this rent is as a result of Covid-19, so
they won't have had substantial rent arrears before March of this year and have
now found themselves through no fault of their own in this particular
circumstance. âIt's hard to put actual numbers on that, we know the
cohort exists, it's very difficult to track them exactly. âWe think Â£8m is sufficient.â The housing and local government
minister also announced a new loan scheme for tenants who have built up rent
arrears during the pandemic. Julie James told the Welsh Government's news
conference she hoped the Â£8m scheme would ""stop many thousands of people
from eviction and even homelessness"". The scheme is for private sector
tenants who are not on benefits. It will not apply to people who
were in significant rental arrears before March - when lockdown began. The Welsh Government says once the loan is accepted the money will be paid directly to the landlord or
agent and tenants will be able to pay back the amount over five years with an
APR rate of 1%. There is no maximum amount for
the loan but it will be limited to covering rent arrears only. Welsh Housing and Local Government
Minister Julie James has told the Welsh Government's weekly news conference that since lockdown
started more than 2,000 people who were homeless or in unsuitable accommodation
had now been given somewhere to live. She confirmed Â£50m would be spent
on projects to ensure no-one would need to âreturn to life on the streetsâ. Ms James said all 22 local councils
across Wales had come up with innovative projects but there remained ""some
big and complex issues which we're not going to solve overnight"". ""Long-lasting and
transformative solutions"" were needed ""if we're going to end
homelessness for good"", she said. A man who lost his job
at the beginning of the pandemic has said it is harder for older people to find
work. Myke Jones, from
Cwmbran, was working in IT project management. He is now trying to apply for
new jobs at the age of 58. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""It's a big competition, I've noticed a huge
difference in the past couple of months in the fact that jobs are few and far
between. âYou're
looking at 200-plus people applying for those jobs. ""I've spent ages
on my CV trying to make it look flashy and say the right things, but the video
interview comes along and the moment they see you, you can tell they see
straight away 'you're quite old' and they tend to shy away. ""I
struggle to pay our bills, we've got mortgages to pay, I can't see my pension
covering it all so I'm going to be working for a long time yet. I can see a lot
of travelling and staying away from home."" Mr
Jones has also been recovering from cancer during lockdown. ""We
live in a flat, we haven't got a garden, I need to be a bit more careful so I
don't go out as much as most people and that worry I've got about cancer
returning just adds to the mix of 'I'm struggling to find a job, how will I pay
the bills next month'."" It comes as the latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of lockdown has not yet hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Face mask law extended if virus 'starts to spread',"Welsh ministers have been sceptical about the overall value of face coverings Face coverings will be made mandatory in more settings if coronavirus ""starts to spread"", the Welsh first minister has said. In Wales they are only compulsory on public transport. People are advised to wear them in public places when they cannot social distance. In England and Scotland they are mandatory in shops. First Minister Mark Drakeford made the comments during a live Facebook question and answer session. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? 'Re-think face masks in shops' says scientist ""We will make them mandatory in other places if coronavirus starts to spread in Wales again,"" he said. ""But at the moment coronavirus is so effectively suppressed that we don't think it is proportionate, that it is fair, to say to somebody 'you can't go into a shop unless you're wearing one'. ""There are lots of people who aren't comfortable wearing face coverings. ""People with breathing difficulties for example, or if you rely on seeing somebody else, if you're lip reading, it's difficult if someone else is wearing a face covering. ""But I want to be clear with everybody that if the virus begins to circulate again in Wales and we think it is right to make them mandatory in shops or other settings we won't hesitate to do so."" Mr Drakeford and his government have long been sceptical about the overall value of face coverings, concerned that wearing them may encourage people to take risks with social distancing and hygiene measures. Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton said in July that theevidence for making them mandatory was ""quite weak"". The Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have called for them to be made compulsory in shops.

Statue campaign for black footballer reaches goal,"Jack Leslie was picked to play for England in 1925, but dropped soon after Crowdfunders have raised Â£100,000 to erect a statue of a footballer who was dropped from the England team when selectors discovered he was black. Jack Leslie would have been the first black person to play for the nation having been selected in 1925. Acampaign for his statue outside Plymouth Argyle's Home Parkstadium has attracted donations from nearly 2,000 people since July. Campaign co-founder Greg Foxsmith said he was ""delighted"" by the news. Leslie joined Argyle in 1921 and stayed there for 14 years, making 401 appearances and scoring 137 goals. Club chairman Simon Hallett said: ""Jack was not just a great footballer. He has become a symbol of the injustices in our game and in our society. ""I hope that when we have his statue up it will become an enduring symbol of the progress we can make in fighting the evil of racism."" Jack Leslie played for Plymouth Argyle in the 1920s Leslie's granddaughter Lyn Davies said: ""I nearly fell over when I realised we had gone over the Â£100,000. It's just amazing, I'm stunned."" Lesley Hiscott, another granddaughter, said she was ""over the moon"" and ""ecstatic"". Former Argyle player Ronnie Mauge described the campaign as ""phenomenal"" and said he was ""so proud of the Plymouth people and the club"". ""He [Leslie] laid the foundation for someone like me to go to Plymouth,"" Trinidad and Tobago international Mauge added. The statue will stand outside Home Park Argyle supporter and comedian Josh Widdicombe said the campaign had ""shined a light"" on racism in football. Mr Foxsmith said: ""We want to use the Jack Leslie story to highlight those issues, to challenge prejudice, to challenge discrimination, and to show in 2020 we can be better than we were in 1925."" Fundraising for the statue will continue, with proposals for its design considered by Leslie's family and fans.

Celtic player apologises for quarantine breach,"Celtic have apologised for a player's breach of coronavirus rules and described it as ""beyond explanation"". Boli Bolingoli admitted he played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock despite having recently returned from Spain without quarantining. The defender said he was ""guilty of an error of judgement"" and apologised. The club later confirmed all players and backroom staff have since been tested twice and returned negative results. Police Scotland confirmed Bolingoli had been issued with a fixed penalty notice for breaching quarantine regulations. Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the player's actions were ""utterly unacceptable."" The breach comes after eightAberdeen players apologised for visiting a bar at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak. Two of the players later tested positive for the virus, while six are currently self-isolating. Celtic said it ""unreservedly condemns and apologises"" for the behaviour of Bolingoli, who travelled to Spain without informing the club and then failed to observe quarantine restrictions."" Aclub statement,externaladded: ""It is difficult to imagine a more irresponsible action in current circumstances and we find it beyond explanation. ""The club will take immediate action through our own disciplinary procedures."" The Scottish champions said they have been in touch with every SPFL club and all relevant authorities to apologise ""for the fact that one of our employees has created so much additional difficulty through his actions."" In an earlier statement,Bolingoli, 25, said he wanted to apologise to his manager, team mates, supporters,external, ""and so many others for letting them down so badly"". He added: ""I am guilty of a major error of judgement. I know what I did was wrong and I know that I must now deal with the consequences."" Mr Yousaf said the player's actions could have major consequences for top flight football, which only resumed in Scotland on 1 August. He tweeted: ""Utterly unacceptable from Bolingoli. With a number of incidents, Scot Govt left with little choice but to consider whether pause is now needed in resumption of the game. ""Operational matter for Border Force & Police Scot, I support whatever enforcement action they deem necessary."" The Scottish government said it was in discussion with the club and football governing bodies to establish the facts. ""If confirmed as another serious incident within Scottish football, where protocols have been breached at the risk of wider public health, then the Scottish government will have little choice but to consider whether a pause is now needed in the resumption of the game in Scotland,"" they added.

Facial recognition use by police force 'unlawful',"Ed Bridges has had his image captured twice by AFR technology, which he said breached his human rights The use of automatic facial recognition (AFR) technology by South Wales Police is unlawful, the Court of Appeal has ruled. It follows a legal challenge brought by civil rights group Liberty and Ed Bridges, 37, from Cardiff. But the court also found its use was proportionate interference with human rights as the benefits outweighed the impact on Mr Bridges. South Wales Police said it would not be appealing the findings. Mr Bridges had said being identified by AFR caused him distress. Meet the man who took on a police force and won The South Wales force has previously demonstrated the technology with a member of staff standing in The court upheld three of the five points raised in the appeal. It said there was no clear guidance on where AFR Locate could be used and who could be put on a watchlist, a data protection impact assessment was deficient and the force did not take reasonable steps to find out if the software had a racial or gender bias. Facial scans to identify bad Elvises at Porthcawl festival South Wales Police to use facial recognition app on phones Facial recognition fails on race, government study says The appeal followed the dismissal of Mr Bridges' case at London's High Court in September by two senior judges, who had concluded use of the technology was not unlawful. Responding to Tuesday's ruling, South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes said: ""The test of our ground-breaking use of this technology by the courts has been a welcome and important step in its development. I am confident this is a judgment that we can work with."" Mr Bridges said: ""I'm delighted that the court has agreed that facial recognition clearly threatens our rights. ""This technology is an intrusive and discriminatory mass surveillance tool. ""For three years now, South Wales Police has been using it against hundreds of thousands of us, without our consent and often without our knowledge. ""We should all be able to use our public spaces without being subjected to oppressive surveillance."" Mr Bridges' face was scanned while he was Christmas shopping in Cardiff in 2017 and at a peaceful anti-arms protest outside the city's Motorpoint Arena in 2018. He had argued it breached his human rights when his biometric data was analysed without his knowledge or consent. Liberty lawyer Megan Goulding described the judgment as a ""major victory in the fight against discriminatory and oppressive facial recognition"". She added: ""It is time for the government to recognise the serious dangers of this intrusive technology. Facial recognition is a threat to our freedom - it has no place on our streets."" The technology maps faces in a crowd by measuring the distance between features, then compares results with a ""watch list"" of images - which can include suspects, missing people and persons of interest. South Wales Police has been trialling this form of AFR since 2017, predominantly at big sporting fixtures, concerts and other large events across the force area. The force had confirmed Mr Bridges was not a person of interest and had never been on a watch list. Responding to the ruling, the force said its use of the technology had resulted in 61 people being arrested for offences including robbery and violence, theft and court warrants. It said it remained ""completely committed to its careful development and deployment"" and was ""proud of the fact there has never been an unlawful arrest as a result of using the technology in south Wales"". During the remote hearing last month, Liberty's barrister Dan Squires QC argued that if everyone was stopped and asked for their personal data on the way into a stadium, people would feel uncomfortable. ""If they were to do this with fingerprints, it would be unlawful, but by doing this with AFR there are no legal constraints,"" he said, as there are clear laws and guidance on taking fingerprints. Mr Squires said it was the potential use of the power, not its actual use to date, that was the issue. ""It's not enough that it has been done in a proportionate manner so far,"" he said. He argued there were insufficient safeguards within the current laws to protect people from an arbitrary use of the technology, or to ensure its use is proportional. The impact of the ruling will extend to other police forces. But what it has not done is create an insurmountable barrier to them using live facial recognition in the future. In fact, the judgesstate that the benefits of the tech,externalare ""potentially great"" and the intrusion into innocent people's privacy ""minor"". But their determination expresses a need for more care. Police forces - including London's Met, which has trialled a similar system - need clearer guidance. Specifically, the ruling indicates officers will have to clearly document who they are looking for and what evidence they have that those targets are likely to be in the monitored area. They will also need to check that the software doesn't exhibit racial or sexual bias as to who it flags. Tony Porter - England and Wales' Surveillance Camera Commissioner -has said he hopes the Home Office will take this opportunity,externalto update a ""woefully"" out-of-date code of practice used to regulate facial recognition and other surveillance efforts. That echoes a call by the House of Commons' Science and Technology committee last year, which called for all use of automatic facial recognition to be suspended until relevant regulations had been put in place. Elsewhere, a committee of MSPs have made it clear they think it would be premature for the police in Scotland to use the tech in its current state, and Northern Ireland has long-standing plans to create its own Biometrics Commissioner, who might eventually examine the issue.

Challenger leaves Belarus: 'Difficult decision',"This video can not be played Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: ""Not one life is worth what is happening now"" Belarus's main opposition leader says she took a ""very difficult decision"" to leave the country, after disputing an election result she claimed was rigged. On YouTube, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she did it for her children. A second video, apparently filmed when she was held in Minsk, was released. She was ""safe"" now in Lithuania, the country's foreign minister said. Clashes between protesters and police continued in Belarus for a third night. One demonstrator died the night before. There have been numerous reports of police brutality. On Tuesday evening, three BBC journalists, part of a filming crew in the capital Minsk, said they were attacked by law enforcement officials in black uniforms without insignia. They say two of the officials beat up the cameraman and tried to break the equipment. The reporters were not detained. President Alexander Lukashenko secured 80% of the vote in Sunday's poll, the electoral commission says, but there have been numerous claims of fraud. Mr Lukashenko, 65, who has ruled the former Soviet country since 1994, has described opposition supporters as ""sheep"" controlled from abroad. Five things you might not know about Belarus How protests shook up the election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure But Ms Tikhanovskaya has galvanised the opposition, which presented a stronger than ever challenge to the autocratic leader. The 37-year-old is a former teacher who was a stay-at-home mother until she entered the race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. When she attempted to register a complaint about the results - which gave her just 9.9% of the vote - on Monday, she was detained for seven hours. Allow Twitter content?

""I thought that this campaign had really steeled me and given me so much strength that I could cope with anything,"" she said. ""But I guess I'm still the same weak woman that I was."" Profile: Svetlana Tikhanovskaya She said her decision to leave was taken ""completely independently"" and not influenced by anyone around her, even though many people would ""condemn"" or ""hate"" her for it. ""Not one life is worth what is happening now,"" she added. ""Children are the most important things in our lives."" Ms Tikhanovskaya sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the election. Earlier Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted about Ms Tikhanovskaya's whereabouts after rumours that she had disappeared. Allow Twitter content?

There had been concern for her on Monday but her campaign later said she was ""safe"", without saying where. Mr Linkevicius told the BBC: ""The option to leave the country was found as the only rational [one], I understand."" He added: ""It appears she visited the electoral committee, submitted a complaint... but she stayed. To [say] that she was visiting the electoral committee with a friendly visit would be too good. She was detained."" He later told a news conference that she had been given a one-year visa and a place to stay in Lithuania. An associate of the opposition leader said she had been escorted from the country by the authorities as part of a deal to allow the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz, who was arrested on Friday evening. Mr Linkevicius confirmed that the two women left the country together. A second video has now emerged which appears to have been taken during her detention. The images show her, head lowered, reading nervously from a script as she urges her supporters to ""obey the law"" and stay away from street protests. Ms Tikhanovskaya's allies said the video - which has been published by state media - had been recorded under pressure. This video can not be played A BBC team in Minsk encountered violent scenes on Monday night Analysis by Tatsiana Melnichuk, BBC Russian, Minsk Svetlana Tikhanovksaya is ""a hero"", according to opposition campaign partner Maria Kolesnikova, who says her departure does not diminish her achievements. Activists and many others here are convinced she left under pressure from Belarus authorities. They all think Ms Tikhanovskaya was given a text to read under pressure. After the 2010 election, state TV ran ""confessions"" from detained opposition activists that looked similar to what we saw on Tuesday. Many people I have spoken to in Minsk back Ms Tikhanovskaya all the way, saying she had no choice but to flee in order to protect her children, as her husband is in prison. But others believe she should have realised what she was getting into and how dangerous this could be. No-one doubts her good intentions or her sincerity. Protesters clashed with riot police in Minsk Protests in Minsk and other Belarusian cities broke out after the polls closed late on Sunday and continued on a large-scale for three consecutive nights. Riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse thousands of demonstrators rallying in the capital. The brutality of the crackdown has shocked observers as many of these weapons had not been used in Belarus before the weekend. Reports say some of the demonstrators fought back, throwing petrol bombs. Protesters also tried to build barricades. Officials say one demonstrator died on Monday when an explosive device went off in his hands - the first confirmed fatality since the clashes began. The internet has been ""significantly disrupted"" since the polls closed on Sunday, according to online monitor NetBlocks. In the last presidential election in 2015, Mr Lukashenko was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. Mr Lukashenko cast his ballot at a polling station in Minsk Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government this time has been in part fuelled by its response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease. Belarus, which has a population of 9.5 million, has reported nearly 70,000 cases and almost 600 deaths. Belarus in surprising presidential election battle.

Unemployment rate dips in Wales during lockdown,"The number of people out of work in Wales has fallen slightly, according to new figures, but nearly a third of the Welsh workforce is now on furlough. There are now 41,000 across Wales unemployed, suggests the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It is an unemployment rate of 2.7% compared to the UK-wide rate of 3.9% for the period of March to May. However, figures from the ONS also show 378,000 people are on the UK's furlough job retention scheme. The Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency in Gwynedd has the second highest furlough take-up in the UK at 40%. Support pledge as benefits claims double in Wales Airbus to cut 1,730 jobs at two UK factories General Electric cuts 369 jobs at Wales plant The latest unemployment figures for March to May show a fall in the overall rate of 1%. However, the latest figures do not reflect recent announcements on large job losses announced at Airbus in Flintshire, BA and GE Aviation in south Wales, and at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport. Flintshire mother-of-three Stephanie Barnett found herself caught between an employment rock-and-a-hard-place when lockdown hit. She had decided to switch careers, from working in the home care sector to becoming a teaching assistant. She officially finished with her care firm on 23 March and was due to take up a school post in Connah's Quay on Deeside the next day. Of course, lockdown was then imposed and it meant Stephanie was no longer employed as a carer and not eligible for furlough. But she could not take up her school job either. Stephanie Barnett has been left stressed by being out of work Instead, as a single mother, she was left living off working tax credit payments, and then had to claim Universal Credit. ""It was stressful - it was worrying,"" she admitted. ""It was down to me to pay the rent, pay the bills, buy the shopping for the children. ""It was tight for a few months and I struggled to get by.

""It's just a waiting game until September and I can get back to work."" Across the rest of the UK, Scotland also saw a drop in unemployment, while England and Northern Ireland saw small increases. Overall, the number of workers on UK payrollshas fallen by 649,000 between March and June, official figures indicate. The number of people claiming work-related benefits - including the unemployed - was 2.6 million. However, one think tank has warned it believes the way the UK reports unemploymentmay not reflect the ""true scale of joblessness"". The Resolution Foundation argues that the 23% drop in average hours worked between early March and late April is a better indicator of unemployment. The damage to the economy from coronavirus is happening in real time while the official statistics tell us what was happening six weeks ago. They're of limited use in such a fast moving environment. There is a lot of data around though. A higher proportion of Welsh businesses have furloughed staff compared to other parts of the UK. Small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) are a major driver of the Welsh economy responsible for 62% of jobs. As an example, the tourism sector employs around 120,000 people in Wales and has largely been closed down due to coronavirus. Parts of Wales where tourism is the dominant industry have shown high rates of businesses furloughing staff. When furlough comes to end it's expected that many more jobs will be lost but it will take months for that to be reflected in the official figures.

Unemployment hits record low of 3%,"Unemployment in Wales has hit a record low of 3%, official figures suggest. The rate has fallen more in the country in the past three months than in any other nation or region of theUK, where overall unemployment stands at 3.8%. Between September and November, there were 46,000 people in Wales available for work but not working, 18,000 fewer than the previous quarter. Compared with last year there was a fall in both the number of people counted as employed and unemployed. This was because the rate of ""economic inactivity"" has risen - these are working age people who are not available for work because they are on long-term sick, have taken early retirement, or are full-time carers or students. On the same period last year, the unemployment rate fell from 4.1%, the employment rate was down from 75.8% to 74.9%, and the rate of economic inactivity was up from 20.8% to 22.7%, although this remains at a relatively low level. In the north-east of England, a region which was often compared with Wales in the past because of similarities in its economy, unemployment for September to November stood at 6.2%, employment at 71.4% and economic inactivity at 24%. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart called it a ""thoroughly strong set of statistics"" for Wales. ""Thousands of people have found work over the previous quarter and unemployment in Wales is below the UK average,"" he said. ""This is testament to the hard work both governments are contributing to stimulating our economy."" Wales' Economy Minister, Ken Skates, said the country could be ""proud"" of record low unemployment. He said the Welsh Government would continue ""standing up for people in every part of Wales and taking the proactive approach that our economy needs in order to prosper and grow"".

Support pledge as benefits claims double in Wales,"Coronavirus will have a ""huge impact"" on jobs in Wales, said Mr Skates Everyone aged over 16 in Wales will be offered help to find work, self-employment, education or training, a minister has said. Figures show the numbers claiming benefits in Wales have doubled compared with this time last year. There were 118,600 claimants in the middle of May, equivalent to 6.2% of 16 to 64-year-olds, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures. Economy Minister Ken Skates said theÂ£40m scheme would bring ""hope"". The local authority with the highest claimant rate was Newport with 7.5%. There were 47,000 people unemployed in Wales during the three months from February to April - 4,000 fewer than the previous quarter and 22,000 fewer than the same period the year before. Overall, 3% of people were out of work, compared with 3.9% UK-wide. However the figures also show a fall in employment in Wales, by 15,000, compared with the same period last year. More than 600,000 lose their jobs amid lockdown Wales unemployment levels hits record low of 3% Rise in full-time female workers boosts employment Mr Skates told the Welsh Government's daily news conference on Tuesday that coronavirus ""will have a huge impact on our labour market"". ""We've given hope to businesses that have faced a perilous situation and now we are preparing to deliver hope to people who question whether the virus will steal them of livelihoods,"" he said. ""We will make sure everyone over 16 in Wales gets the offer of support and advice to find work, to pursue self-employment or to find a place in education or training."" Mr Skates said the plan would be funded from the Welsh Government'sEconomic Resilience Fund,externaland was part of its covid commitment to the people of Wales. Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones called for action from UK and Welsh ministers to respond to the ""coming crisis"". ""We can't sit around discussing what might be needed when tens of thousands of people face falling off an economic cliff edge in August,"" she said. The impact of lockdown is partially illustrated in the number of hours worked. Between February and April there was an 8.9% fall in the number of hours people worked - a total of 94.2 million hours lost across the UK. The full effects of coronavirus is likely to be seen later this year, according to David Jones That is the largest decrease in hours worked since 1971. Wales continues to have a high rate of economic inactivity - people not in work and not available for work because they are ill, caring for someone or in full time education - 23.2% of 16 to 64-year-olds in Wales are in this category, higher than the same period last year. Shops could reopen at next lockdown review Deaths with coronavirus lowest for 10 weeks Only Northern Ireland has a higher rate at 26.7%. Clwyd West Conservative MP David Jones said: ""It's fairly clear the full effects of the virus and lockdown have not yet started to come through. ""It's most likely to start making an impact in August when furlough winds down. ""The biggest concern is autumn when it runs down completely. It's clearly not an optimistic outlook."" Looking ahead, he called for two-metre social distancing to be changed, saying businesses in his constituency were ""worried sick"" about it. He added onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Quite simply restaurants can't operate. If it was reduced to one metre, they could probably operate at 75% capacity. Two metres is an absolute killer for the industry."" Fears over coronavirus led to Owen Davies losing his job Owen Davies, 29, from Newport, had to leave his job working with porters at his local hospital, helping to transport patients. While he described the job as ""stressful"", he said he enjoyed it, adding: ""What happened was that I fell ill, I had to take a couple of days off just before the pandemic started. ""At the time my mum was in hospital having major heart surgery. So when this pandemic started she ended up coming home. ""My father has also got chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and I have a partner with asthma, so I had to make the decision to stay off when the lockdown was starting."" Mr Davies has struggled to find new work because of lockdown While he said he made the decision to protect his family, the agency he worked for gave him an ultimatum to ""either come back or we are getting rid of you"" and ended his contract. He said it had a knock-on effect on his confidence and mental health, and added: ""Being on Universal Credit as a lifestyle as a means to get by is not good, it's really stressful. ""I'm trying to get some normality back now and hopefully find something I can get up and running and start working again. ""I've pretty much had enough of this lockdown now and I just want to get back to work."" Mr Davies is currently being helped to find a job by the Prince's Trust and is hopeful they will get him a place on a Google IT course. With the information we've already had about the impact of coronavirus on the economy, the news that unemployment has fallen a little further in Wales might seem surprising and today's claimants figures may seem contradictory. When you unpick the statistics a clearer picture emerges. The unemployment figures, just released, are for the three months from February to April and so only half of that period includes lockdown. The claimant count however shows us the number of people claiming work related benefits on a specific day - 14 May, 2020. The increases recorded there are very significant. We have also learnt today that across the UK job vacancies have fallen steeply. There's been a record decline in self-employed work and the number of hours worked have plummeted. The unemployment figures that will be published next month will be more representative of what has happened in the workplace. The evidence suggests that the furlough scheme, introduced by the UK government, has kept many millions of employees on the pay roll. That was the idea of it. We will have to wait several more months before we will know the full impact of the pandemic on Welsh jobs.

"Wales jobs not yet hit by full force of lockdownThe proportion of people employed in Wales has risen, and economic inactivity is down.WalesComments","Across the UK employment fell by the largest amount in more than a decade The latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. The rate of unemployment in Wales between April and June was down at 2.7% with 8,000 fewer people unemployed than between January and March, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show. That is 20,000 fewer than the same period a year ago. The rate of unemployment across the UK was higher at 3.9%. The figures do not include the millions of people who are furloughed, those on zero-hours contracts but not getting shifts, or people on temporary unpaid leave from a job, as they still count as employed. In June,316,500 employees in Wales were paid 80% of their salariesunder the UK government's furlough scheme, figures from the Treasury showed. As such, today's figures do not capture the full impact of the pandemic. The number of people on the payroll across the UK in July was down by 730,000 compared with March as coronavirus hit, thelargest quarterly decrease in more than a decade. This could act as an indication that many more job losses are to come in Wales. The level of economic inactivity - the number of people in Wales who were not working and not available to work - between April and June was 432,000, which is 11,000 fewer than between January and March this year but 15,000 more than April to June last year. Those are the people who cannot work because they are ill, caring for someone or in full-time education. There were 41,000 people unemployed but able to work between April and June. Vic Phillips, from Brecon, said he been using the time to consider different career options For Vic Phillips the last few months have been a whirlwind of emotions. Since the end of July, the father-of-one, from Brecon, Powys, has been furloughed, under the UK Treasury scheme, after theWales Millennium Centre, in Cardiff Bay, closed due to lockdown. With shows cancelled until at least January, the deputy tech manager, who has worked in theatre for 15 years, has now been made redundant. With no date for when performances might resume, Mr Phillips said he had felt anxious about being able to pay bills and provide for his family and knew he needed to change career. ""It doesn't feel like the normality of changing jobs, where taking someone out of position leaves a hole that's filled,"" he said. ""There are people that are trying to find work and there aren't extra jobs, if anything there's less. ""That feels very challenging and at times it can feel a little bit bleak."" But having fallen in love with gardening and enjoying spending more time with his family during lockdown, he is now using it as an opportunity to ""embrace"" other options outside the world of theatre. Many more job losses could still come in Wales Myke Jones, from Cwmbran, was working in IT but lost his job at the beginning of the pandemic. He is now trying to apply for new jobs at the age of 58. Speaking to theBBC Radio Wales' Breakfastprogramme, he said he had already applied for two jobs before 08:00 BST on Tuesday. ""It's a big competition, I've noticed a huge difference in the past couple of months in the fact that jobs are few and far between. You're looking at 200-plus people applying for those jobs. ""I've spent ages on my CV trying to make it look flashy and say the right things, but the video interview comes along and the moment they see you, you can tell they see straight away 'you're quite old' and they tend to shy away. ""I struggle to pay our bills, we've got mortgages to pay, I can't see my pension covering it all so I'm going to be working for a long time yet. I can see a lot of travelling and staying away from home."" Mr Jones has also been recovering from cancer during lockdown. ""We live in a flat, we haven't got a garden, I need to be a bit more careful so I don't go out as much as most people and that worry I've got about cancer returning just adds to the mix of 'I'm struggling to find a job, how will I pay the bills next month'."" Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' One in three firms 'expect to make redundancies' University students 'selling clothes to pay rent' Creative industries 'face thousands of job losses' Jonathan Athow from the ONS said: ""The labour market continues recent trends, with a fall in employment and significantly reduced hours of work as many people are furloughed. ""Figures from our main survey show there has been a rise in people without a job and not looking for one, though wanting to work. ""In addition, there are still a large number of people who say they are working no hours and getting zero pay. ""The falls in employment are greatest among the youngest and oldest workers, along with those in lower-skilled jobs."" He said the number of vacancies began to recover in July, especially in small businesses and sectors such as hospitality, though demand for workers remains depressed. Gerwyn Davies says a spike in redundancies over the next few months was ""almost inevitable"" Gerwyn Davies from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the professional body for HR and people development, said: ""The jobs market appears resilient on the surface, partly because the official statistics lag events by a couple of months. ""Despite this, the rise in the number of economically inactive people and the fall in the number of self-employed people shows that the current economic situation is already having an impact on the labour market. ""And with a spike in redundancies over the coming months now almost inevitable due to the unwinding of the Job Retention Scheme, we can expect to see unemployment rise sharply too."" Rebecca Wooley, director of Citizens Advice Cymru, said their data showed groups most likely to face redundancy included parents, carers and those who have been shielding. She added: ""Our biggest worry is we predict an increase in those numbers once the furlough scheme ends. ""Even now, we're helping one person every two minutes with a redundancy issue."" So why is unemployment and economic inactivity still falling in Wales? One reason is the various schemes from the UK government to keep people on payrolls, meaning they have not been made redundant so far. The Job Retention Scheme, in particular, allowed employees to be furloughed on 80% of their salary, paid for by the UK Treasury. More than one in four of the Welsh workforce has been furloughed and the fear is that when those schemes end in the autumn many will not have a job to go back to. But are those who are predicting unemployment levels like the 1930s ""doom mongers""? These figures might seem surprising when organisations such as the Bank of England are warning of unemployment levels the like of which we have not seen for decades. They are a reminder that the detailed analysis by the ONS, which includes a breakdown for what is happening in Wales, lags several months behind what is happening to individual people and workforces. It is interesting that the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, and the north west of England are following a similar pattern. Economies there are more similar to Wales and less like the behaviour of the south east of England, for instance. Another report from the ONS, looking specifically at employment in July across the UK, is much more concerning. It shows that the number of people on the payroll was down by nearly three-quarters of a million (730,000) in July compared with March when coronavirus hit. That is warning of what is on the horizon.

Worker sacked after Hitler meme wins payoutScott Tracey used the scene from Downfall to portray scenes from company wage negotiations.,"The meme used the dramatic scene from the film Downfall A BP refinery worker in Australia who was sacked for parodying the company via a well-known Hitler meme has been awarded a $200,000 (Â£109,000) payout. Scott Tracey used the popular meme, from 2004 film Downfall, to portray scenes from company wage negotiations, posting it on a closed Facebook group. He was sacked by the company. However, after a two-year legal battle, he won an unfair dismissal case and returned to work. The payout covers lost earnings. The meme uses a dramatic scene in Downfall - in which Hitler angrily confronts his generals in his bunker - and replaces the subtitles with alternative dialogue as a joke. BP worker sacked over Hitler parody wins job back The rise, rise and rise of the Downfall Hitler parody,external BP had said it was ""highly offensive and inappropriate"" and dismissed Mr Tracey. The refinery worker first took his case to a tribunal, arguing unfair dismissal, but lost. Mr Tracey then appealed, insisting he had not intended to offend anyone and that the video was meant to be humorous. He added that it did not identify BP or anyone specifically. The federal court ruled it was unreasonable to say the meme had likened BP managers to Nazis and Mr Tracey was allowed to return to work. On Monday, he was awarded $177,325 in wages and lost bonuses, minus tax, and also $24,070 in superannuation or pension payments. BP had argued that Mr Tracey should be paid $150,000, less than what he would have earned if he had not been dismissed. The company wanted money to be deductedbecause the video was shared among colleagues,external, which BP said was misconduct, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. BP also said more money should be deducted as Mr Tracey could have found work during the trial. The Fair Work Commission said there was no evidence to argue that Mr Tracey had not searched for employment. Brad Gandy, secretary at Australian Workers Union, said that Mr Tracey had been through ""unnecessary drama"". ""To dig in and drag an honest worker through nearly two years of stress and uncertainty, all because a few stuffed shirts didn't get a joke, is poor corporate behaviour,"" Mr Gandy told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive',"Many people currently working from home are fearful of ultimately losing their jobs Latest UK unemployment figures show that the much-feared coronavirus ""cliff-edge"" has not yet taken its toll on the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate has remained at 3.9% since the lockdown was introduced. UK employment falls by biggest amount in over a decade Joblessness has not surged, as many feared, because large numbers of firms have put employees on the government-backed furlough scheme. But in recent weeks, growing numbers of employees have found themselves being made redundant after having initially been furloughed. And while some have immediately thrown themselves into the search for another job, others have been left reeling from the impact. Theatre technician Charlotte Baker, 29, is out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She started a new job at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon in September last year and was furloughed in March. In June, she was made redundant, even though she could have been kept on furlough. Now management at the Fairfield Halls has said the venue will not reopen until April next year, forcing her to contemplate a possible career change. ""It's definitely an uphill struggle and it's proving harder then previous ones,"" she told the BBC. ""It's hard to have a positive outlook."" Charlotte has been looking into doing a carpentry course, but to obtain the necessary City and Guilds qualification would require her to spend Â£5,000 on training. ""It's a mountain to climb. I wouldn't mind climbing that mountain if it's something that I'm passionate about, but I'm not sure,"" she says. ""I'm hoping to make a decision by the end of August."" Jon Ellis-Fleming, 31, of Keighley in West Yorkshire, lost his job in recruitment shortly before lockdown began. ""I'd been working in HR about five years and the redundancy came quite out of the blue,"" he told the BBC. His problems were made all the more acute because his partner Julia Paterson, who worked in the same department, was on maternity leave at the time, having given birth to their daughter Daisy. ""It was a lot of stress, to say the least,"" he says. ""We had a lot of help from family, but without that, I don't know what we would have done."" That made him all the more determined to find work again - but it meant a complete change of direction for him. ""I was unemployed until June, then I ended up becoming a self-employed contract driver for a logistics firm,"" he says. ""It was the only option I had to bring money in. ""I'm working in an industry I never expected to work in and I'm not entirely comfortable in it. But you do what you can to make ends meet."" Kate Treglown, 44, of Walthamstow in east London, was made redundant from her advertising job at the end of July after being on furlough. ""I worked for 16-and-a-half years for an advertising agency that promoted live events. The work totally dried up in May,"" she told the BBC. Kate says she has spent the past four months trying to home-school her children, while her husband, a cabinet maker, has carried on working as usual the whole time. Now she feels ""stuck in limbo"" - keen to try something new, but unsure of when her children will return to school. ""I would like to take the opportunity to do something different,"" she says. ""I was in my old job for so long and I talked about leaving, but never did. ""But it would be a very challenging time for me to start a new job."" Kate adds: ""I've been keeping an eye on the market. There is work. There are jobs available. But when I look on LinkedIn, every single job has hundreds of applications, so competition is very stiff. ""I feel women are really carrying the burden of this pandemic with regards to the childcare, whether working or not. It's made me feel quite depressed at times. ""My redundancy money is only going to last so long and I'm scared of what the future holds for us at the moment."" Sue Hudson, 59, of New Milton in Hampshire, lost her job as a legal secretary two weeks into lockdown. ""I was working from home late on Friday afternoon and I got a telephone call saying, 'We're making you redundant,'"" she told the BBC. ""Because I had been there under two years, they didn't have to pay me any redundancy allowance. They gave me a week's notice, a month's pay and the accrued holiday."" While working from home, she had been using a foot pedal belonging to the company. ""They said, 'Can we have our foot pedal back?'"" Sue adds: ""I had a drawer full of shoes at work and they said I could come in and collect them. I asked them to post them to me, saying I couldn't afford the train fare."" Sue is on Jobseeker's Allowance at the moment, but says that from the end of this month, she will be reliant on her partner Ian, who works as a groundsman for New Milton town council. Sue has had several interviews for other jobs and says that fortunately, her age doesn't appear to be a factor for prospective employers. However, she remains hurt by the ""appalling"" way she was treated. ""They could have put me on furlough for a couple of months, then I would have been able to look for other jobs in comfort,"" she says. Have you lost your job because of the pandemic?

Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting',"""It's been really upsetting and stressful,"" says Will Bird, an events producer who was recently made redundant. Mr Bird will need to move out of his apartment soon as he can no longer afford the rent without a job. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June 1,778 firms said were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In June 2019, only 345 firms had plans to cut 24,000 jobs. The cuts came as coronavirus wiped more than a quarter off UK economic output. The figures give an insight into the surge of redundancies announced since coronavirus blighted the UK. Airbus, Royal Mail, the airport services group Swissport, HSBC, Centrica and the Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie and Benny's, were among the businesses to announce redundancy plans in June. Firms planning to make 20 or more staff redundant have to notify the government by filing a form called an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy. The number of these forms filed with the Insolvency Service shows a steep rise in the number of firms planning to cut staff. Events producer William Bird has been made redundant after four years with his firm William Bird, 27, had been working as an assistant producer at an events agency in London that creates tailored experiences for big brands. He was furloughed in April, and then at the end of June, he was told that he was being made redundant, after four years with the firm. ""Unfortunately, right now members of the public do not feel safe to attend events... so at the end of June, I was told that my company had done everything to try to retain me, but due to the lack of work coming in, they didn't have the financial backing to keep me on,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bird said it had been a ""difficult year in general"", as his mother passed away from cancer a few weeks into lockdown. ""It's been really upsetting and stressful. I've gone from having a tragedy in the family, to looking for work, and at the end of August I'm going to have to move out from the flat I rent in London with my girlfriend because we can't afford it anymore,"" he said. He says he only received three weeks' of redundancy pay as he was on rolling contracts during his first year with the firm. And he is upset that his month of notice in July was paid at the 80% furlough rate, rather than the full salary listed in his contract. The only consolation to the situation, says Mr Bird, is that his firm didn't want to let him go: ""They told me that this wasn't performance-based at all, and that they were making difficult decisions for the future of the company, with the hope that after the industry recovered, they'd love to offer me my job back."" The figures from May and June show a substantial increase from the same months the previous year, and from March and April, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: ""I would expect it to be bigger in July and bigger again in August, because there was a wave of firms that announced redundancies in the first week of July and the first week of August. ""I think it is inevitable now that redundancy numbers will be higher than they were at the peak of the last recession in 2008."" Companies including WH Smith, Dyson, Dixons Carphone, John Lewis, and Casual Dining Group have all announced redundancies recently, and there has beena surge in requests for redundancy advice,external. Adding up the total number of dismissals planned shows a similar picture of stricken employers cutting staff. Though the June figure excludes information from 79 firms, which was not available when the numbers were compiled, it shows a steep rise in the number of positions being considered for redundancy. The total number of employers making redundancies will be higher than these figures, as firms making fewer than 20 posts redundant at any one ""establishment"" do not have to notify government. However, employers often end up making fewer redundancies than the original number they notify to the government. The redundancy process takes time. It includes a consultation period of a minimum of 30 days for 20 staff and over, and 45 days for 100 or more staff. This helps to explain why official redundancy figures gathered by the Office for National Statistics do not yet show a significant rise. In Northern Ireland HR1 forms are filed with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures. In response to the BBC's findings the Department for Work and Pensions pointed to the measures it has introduced to try to support those looking for work. ""Across the country our Plan for Jobs will give business the confidence to recruit and retain workers... and - through the Kickstart scheme - create hundreds of thousands of new, subsidised jobs for young people,"" a spokesperson said.

"PM considers law change for migrant removalsImmigration minister will hold talks in Paris with French authorities to make Channel route ""unviable"".UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the UK should work with France over channel crossings. The UK needs to consider changes to asylum laws to deter migrants from crossing the English Channel, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said it was currently ""very, very difficult"" to legally return people who arrive in the UK from France using small boats. More than 4,000 people have successfully crossed the English Channel this way so far this year. Immigration Minister Chris Philp is in Paris for talks with French officials. He has been accompanied by the UK's newly appointed Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney, to discuss how to reduce the number of migrant crossings. The UK government has said it wants to work with the French authorities to make the route ""unviable"". Speaking ahead of the meeting, the UK's former national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the UK may need to pay for increased enforcement along the French coast. What happens to migrants found in the Channel? Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? Inquiry launched into Channel migrant crossings ""The French do have 300km of coastline facing the UK which is quite hard to police and I think a lot of the money they are asking for is to reinforce mobile patrols up and down those beaches to stop people even getting into these boats,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Johnson pledged to work with the French authorities to discourage people from making the ""dangerous"" journey across the channel. But he added the UK also needed to look at ""the panoply of laws that an illegal immigrant has at his or her disposal that allow them to stay here"". The Ministry of Defence said on Monday it had sent an RAF Atlas transport aircraft to help Border Force spot small boats trying to cross the Channel. The Home Officehad asked defence chiefsfor help to deal with migrants making the crossing. This video can not be played The men and women on the boat told the BBC's Simon Jones they were from Syria Since Thursday, more than 600 people have been intercepted on the route. Downing Street said Border Force was looking at a ""range of options,"" including new measures, to stop boats entering British waters. The UK is currently following EU asylum law during its 11-month post-Brexit transition period following its departure from the bloc in January. This includes the so-calledDublin regulation, which states that a person's asylum claim can be transferred to the first member state they entered. The PM's spokesman said the UK wanted to replace the ""inflexible and rigid"" regulation with a new agreement on returns after December. This video can not be played Migrants setting out to sea 20 miles east of Calais were filmed by a BBC team on Saturday He added that the current Dublin rules, whichput a time limit,externalon transfers, could be ""abused by both migrants and their lawyers to frustrate the returns of those who have no right to be here"". In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Monday, 23 Tory MPs and two peers said the UK should refuse to sign up to a ""similar agreement"" to Dublin after December. The group said ministers should do ""whatever it takes"" to deal with the problem, saying many of their constituents were angry that migrants had been put up in ""expensive hotels"" and given ""immediate access"" to financial support. Ms Patel went out on a police boat patrol during her visit to Dover on Monday. Dover MP Nathalie Elphicke, who was not one of the signatories, said Tuesday's talks were welcome but engagement at a higher level was needed to enable boats to be safely turned around and returned to France. ""There is no reason we can't come to an agreement with France on returns,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's really important we work with the French on this issue as it's a joint issue."" Ms Patel, who met her opposite number GÃ©rald Darmanin last month, has said the UK is committed to ""shutting down"" the route and dismantling the criminal gangs facilitating the illegal crossings. Speaking during a visit to Dover on Monday, she said the current situation was ""totally unacceptable"" and the UK and France need to work together to address what was a ""shared challenge"". The French government says it has deployed extra resources to detect and intercept boats before they set out, leading to a ten-fold increase in the number of crossings being prevented. Intelligence co-operation with the UK has been stepped up while plans to strengthen control of the main crossing points are being finalised, the country's interior ministry added. Since the demolition of the infamous 'Jungle' nearly four years ago, French authorities have been successful in stopping other large-scale camps from forming. But migrants do still arrive in Calais; they are just more scattered. Greater security measures - including a wall built along the motorway with UK funding - have made it more difficult for migrants to stow away on lorries. But that's led the people smugglers to increasingly turn to using the equally risky method of small boats. The UK and France have worked closely on this for close to two decades. The Treaty of Le Touquet which effectively 'moved' the UK border to Calais (and the French border to Dover) to allow checks to happen before crossings, was signed in 2003. But they can't change geography. Calais remains a magnet because it is only 20 miles from the UK - on a clear day in Dover, you can see the headlights of French traffic on the other side of the sea. No amount of planes, walls or Navy deployments can alter that. Quite apart from the humanitarian issue here, there is added political pressure for the UK government. David Cameron was pretty roundly criticised for suggesting in 2016 that Brexit would mean the French would pull out of bilateral agreements and we'd see ""Jungles"" popping up on the South coast of England. There's certainly no indication of that, but there's no doubt that the images of dinghies landing on Kent's beaches will be a difficult one for a government that has set huge store by its promise to 'take back control' of immigration.

Opposition leader 'safe' after leaving BelarusSvetlana Tikhanovskaya leaves Belarus as protests continue over Sunday's disputed elections.Europe,"This video can not be played Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: ""Not one life is worth what is happening now"" Belarus's main opposition leader says she took a ""very difficult decision"" to leave the country, after disputing an election result she claimed was rigged. On YouTube, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she did it for her children. A second video, apparently filmed when she was held in Minsk, was released. She was ""safe"" now in Lithuania, the country's foreign minister said. Clashes between protesters and police continued in Belarus for a third night. One demonstrator died the night before. There have been numerous reports of police brutality. On Tuesday evening, three BBC journalists, part of a filming crew in the capital Minsk, said they were attacked by law enforcement officials in black uniforms without insignia. They say two of the officials beat up the cameraman and tried to break the equipment. The reporters were not detained. President Alexander Lukashenko secured 80% of the vote in Sunday's poll, the electoral commission says, but there have been numerous claims of fraud. Mr Lukashenko, 65, who has ruled the former Soviet country since 1994, has described opposition supporters as ""sheep"" controlled from abroad. Five things you might not know about Belarus How protests shook up the election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure But Ms Tikhanovskaya has galvanised the opposition, which presented a stronger than ever challenge to the autocratic leader. The 37-year-old is a former teacher who was a stay-at-home mother until she entered the race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. When she attempted to register a complaint about the results - which gave her just 9.9% of the vote - on Monday, she was detained for seven hours. Allow Twitter content?

In anemotional video address to supporters (in Russian),external, Ms Tikhanovskaya said she had overestimated her own strength. ""I thought that this campaign had really steeled me and given me so much strength that I could cope with anything,"" she said. ""But I guess I'm still the same weak woman that I was."" Profile: Svetlana Tikhanovskaya She said her decision to leave was taken ""completely independently"" and not influenced by anyone around her, even though many people would ""condemn"" or ""hate"" her for it. ""Not one life is worth what is happening now,"" she added. ""Children are the most important things in our lives."" Ms Tikhanovskaya sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the election. Earlier Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted about Ms Tikhanovskaya's whereabouts after rumours that she had disappeared. Allow Twitter content?

There had been concern for her on Monday but her campaign later said she was ""safe"", without saying where. Mr Linkevicius told the BBC: ""The option to leave the country was found as the only rational [one], I understand."" He added: ""It appears she visited the electoral committee, submitted a complaint... but she stayed. To [say] that she was visiting the electoral committee with a friendly visit would be too good. She was detained."" He later told a news conference that she had been given a one-year visa and a place to stay in Lithuania. An associate of the opposition leader said she had been escorted from the country by the authorities as part of a deal to allow the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz, who was arrested on Friday evening. Mr Linkevicius confirmed that the two women left the country together. A second video has now emerged which appears to have been taken during her detention. The images show her, head lowered, reading nervously from a script as she urges her supporters to ""obey the law"" and stay away from street protests. Ms Tikhanovskaya's allies said the video - which has been published by state media - had been recorded under pressure. This video can not be played A BBC team in Minsk encountered violent scenes on Monday night Analysis by Tatsiana Melnichuk, BBC Russian, Minsk Svetlana Tikhanovksaya is ""a hero"", according to opposition campaign partner Maria Kolesnikova, who says her departure does not diminish her achievements. Activists and many others here are convinced she left under pressure from Belarus authorities. They all think Ms Tikhanovskaya was given a text to read under pressure. After the 2010 election, state TV ran ""confessions"" from detained opposition activists that looked similar to what we saw on Tuesday. Many people I have spoken to in Minsk back Ms Tikhanovskaya all the way, saying she had no choice but to flee in order to protect her children, as her husband is in prison. But others believe she should have realised what she was getting into and how dangerous this could be. No-one doubts her good intentions or her sincerity. Protesters clashed with riot police in Minsk Protests in Minsk and other Belarusian cities broke out after the polls closed late on Sunday and continued on a large-scale for three consecutive nights. Riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse thousands of demonstrators rallying in the capital. The brutality of the crackdown has shocked observers as many of these weapons had not been used in Belarus before the weekend. Reports say some of the demonstrators fought back, throwing petrol bombs. Protesters also tried to build barricades. Officials say one demonstrator died on Monday when an explosive device went off in his hands - the first confirmed fatality since the clashes began. The internet has been ""significantly disrupted"" since the polls closed on Sunday, according to online monitor NetBlocks. In the last presidential election in 2015, Mr Lukashenko was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. Mr Lukashenko cast his ballot at a polling station in Minsk Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government this time has been in part fuelled by its response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease. Belarus, which has a population of 9.5 million, has reported nearly 70,000 cases and almost 600 deaths. Belarus in surprising presidential election battle.

Universities told to hold places open until appeal,"Universities in England are being told to keep places open for students if they appeal against A-level results. Amid uncertainty about replacement exam grades, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has urged university heads to be as ""flexible as possible"". It means if students miss the required grades but successfully appeal, they could still start next term. ""Nobody should have to put their future on hold because of the virus,"" said Ms Donelan. With A-levels cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, students will receive estimated results on Thursday, which will be used to decide university places. But if students get disappointing results that they think are unfair, universities are being told to leave the door open for places until appeals have been considered by exam boards. Nicola Sturgeon 'sorry' about exam results Boris Johnson understands 'anxiety' over grades How will exam results day work this year? A-level results to be higher this year, says watchdog Appeals, which have to be submitted through schools, should be completed by 7 September, allowing students who get improved grades to take up places this autumn. The biggest factors determining the replacement exam grades will be how students are ranked in ability and the previous exam results of their school or college. Protests in Scotland criticised how estimated results were pegged to schools' previous results As the row over Scottish exam results has shown, this can mean that high-achieving youngsters in schools with poor results can be marked down. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon apologised on Monday after accepting her government""did not get it right"" over exam results. Education Secretary John Swinney will set out the Scottish government's plan to fix the issue later. Ms Donelan said she recognised the need for universities to be fair towards ""students who are highly talented in schools or colleges that have not in the past had strong results"". She said the ""vast majority of grades"" were expected to be accurate, but added it was ""essential"" to have the appeals ""safety net"" for ""young people who may otherwise be held back from moving on to their chosen route"". Calling on universities to show ""flexibility"" in admissions decisions, she called on them to hold the places of students whose ""grade may change as the result of an appeal"". But despite these concerns - and the change of heart in Scotland - there are no signs of any change in using a similar approach to moderating results in England. This is still expected to be a good year for applicants, with an expected reduction in overseas students meaning that universities will have more places to fill. A-level results are going to be higher this year - but not by as much as teachers' predicted The exam regulator Ofqual has already said there will be a more lenient approach to grades this year, with a two-percentage-points increase expected in top grades at A-level. But results will not be as generous as teachers' predictions, which would have pushed up results by 12 percentage points - with these predictions able to be shared with pupils after the results are published. The results to be issued this week are designed to maintain continuity with previous years, but there have been concerns about whether individual students could be treated unfairly. A survey of 500 A-level students in England, carried out by the University of Birmingham and the University of Nottingham, suggested almost twice as many students would have preferred to have taken their exams, rather than rely on estimated grades. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson defended the system for calculating grades this year as ""fundamentally a fair one"". ""We know that, without exams, even the best system is not perfect,"" he said. ""That is why I welcome the fact that Ofqual has introduced a robust appeal system, so every single student can be treated fairly - and today we are asking universities to do their part to ensure every young person can progress to the destination they deserve."" But Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, said there was ""absolutely no merit"" in looking at schools' prior overall performance to judge students' results this year, criticising it as ""baking inequality into the system"". She told BBC Newsnight: ""They're just trying to fit students' attainment against a prior year, which means you're just assuming and reproducing the fact that students from low socio-economic backgrounds are - as this system would say - due to get lower grades.""

Opposition leader 'safe' after leaving Belarus,"This video can not be played Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: ""Not one life is worth what is happening now"" Belarus's main opposition leader says she took a ""very difficult decision"" to leave the country, after disputing an election result she claimed was rigged. On YouTube, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she did it for her children. A second video, apparently filmed when she was held in Minsk, was released. She was ""safe"" now in Lithuania, the country's foreign minister said. Clashes between protesters and police continued in Belarus for a third night. One demonstrator died the night before. There have been numerous reports of police brutality. On Tuesday evening, three BBC journalists, part of a filming crew in the capital Minsk, said they were attacked by law enforcement officials in black uniforms without insignia. They say two of the officials beat up the cameraman and tried to break the equipment. The reporters were not detained. President Alexander Lukashenko secured 80% of the vote in Sunday's poll, the electoral commission says, but there have been numerous claims of fraud. Mr Lukashenko, 65, who has ruled the former Soviet country since 1994, has described opposition supporters as ""sheep"" controlled from abroad. Five things you might not know about Belarus How protests shook up the election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure But Ms Tikhanovskaya has galvanised the opposition, which presented a stronger than ever challenge to the autocratic leader. The 37-year-old is a former teacher who was a stay-at-home mother until she entered the race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. When she attempted to register a complaint about the results - which gave her just 9.9% of the vote - on Monday, she was detained for seven hours. Allow Twitter content?

In anemotional video address to supporters (in Russian),external, Ms Tikhanovskaya said she had overestimated her own strength. ""I thought that this campaign had really steeled me and given me so much strength that I could cope with anything,"" she said. ""But I guess I'm still the same weak woman that I was."" Profile: Svetlana Tikhanovskaya She said her decision to leave was taken ""completely independently"" and not influenced by anyone around her, even though many people would ""condemn"" or ""hate"" her for it. ""Not one life is worth what is happening now,"" she added. ""Children are the most important things in our lives."" Ms Tikhanovskaya sent her children to Lithuania for safety before the election. Earlier Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted about Ms Tikhanovskaya's whereabouts after rumours that she had disappeared. Allow Twitter content?

There had been concern for her on Monday but her campaign later said she was ""safe"", without saying where. Mr Linkevicius told the BBC: ""The option to leave the country was found as the only rational [one], I understand."" He added: ""It appears she visited the electoral committee, submitted a complaint... but she stayed. To [say] that she was visiting the electoral committee with a friendly visit would be too good. She was detained."" He later told a news conference that she had been given a one-year visa and a place to stay in Lithuania. An associate of the opposition leader said she had been escorted from the country by the authorities as part of a deal to allow the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz, who was arrested on Friday evening. Mr Linkevicius confirmed that the two women left the country together. A second video has now emerged which appears to have been taken during her detention. The images show her, head lowered, reading nervously from a script as she urges her supporters to ""obey the law"" and stay away from street protests. Ms Tikhanovskaya's allies said the video - which has been published by state media - had been recorded under pressure. This video can not be played A BBC team in Minsk encountered violent scenes on Monday night Analysis by Tatsiana Melnichuk, BBC Russian, Minsk Svetlana Tikhanovksaya is ""a hero"", according to opposition campaign partner Maria Kolesnikova, who says her departure does not diminish her achievements. Activists and many others here are convinced she left under pressure from Belarus authorities. They all think Ms Tikhanovskaya was given a text to read under pressure. After the 2010 election, state TV ran ""confessions"" from detained opposition activists that looked similar to what we saw on Tuesday. Many people I have spoken to in Minsk back Ms Tikhanovskaya all the way, saying she had no choice but to flee in order to protect her children, as her husband is in prison. But others believe she should have realised what she was getting into and how dangerous this could be. No-one doubts her good intentions or her sincerity. Protesters clashed with riot police in Minsk Protests in Minsk and other Belarusian cities broke out after the polls closed late on Sunday and continued on a large-scale for three consecutive nights. Riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse thousands of demonstrators rallying in the capital. The brutality of the crackdown has shocked observers as many of these weapons had not been used in Belarus before the weekend. Reports say some of the demonstrators fought back, throwing petrol bombs. Protesters also tried to build barricades. Officials say one demonstrator died on Monday when an explosive device went off in his hands - the first confirmed fatality since the clashes began. The internet has been ""significantly disrupted"" since the polls closed on Sunday, according to online monitor NetBlocks. In the last presidential election in 2015, Mr Lukashenko was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. Mr Lukashenko cast his ballot at a polling station in Minsk Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government this time has been in part fuelled by its response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease. Belarus, which has a population of 9.5 million, has reported nearly 70,000 cases and almost 600 deaths. Belarus in surprising presidential election battle.

Retail sales rise despite fewer High Street visits,"Retail sales rose again in July, but shops are still trying to make up lost ground, industry body figures suggest. They show the number of visits to High Streets is still down significantly as people shop online instead. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said some retailers continue to struggle due to the coronavirus crisis, and it made a fresh call for government help with rents. The housing ministry said landlords and tenants should ""find solutions that work for both parties"". May 'another month of struggle for retailers' Retail sales jump in June - 'but crisis not over' Retail sales rose for the second consecutive month in July, the BRC said, up 3.2% compared with the same month last year. But the picture for retailers was mixed. Food sales continued to be strong, while furniture and homeware sales also did well as people ""increasingly invest in their time at home"", the BRC-KPMG retail sales report found. Online shopping remained ""prominent"" in July, accounting for 40% of sales, said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG. Computer sales also continued to soar as people who could worked from home, he said. Food and alcohol sales slowed but drink sales still made a significant contribution to supermarket growth, Susan Barratt, the chief executive of grocery research organisation IGD said. And while local coronavirus lockdowns in the north of England had taken a toll on consumer confidence in the region, morale was higher in Scotland, she said. But many British shops, particularly in fashion, jewellery and beauty, are ""still struggling to survive,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. ""While the rise in retail sales is a step in the right direction, the industry is still trying to catch up lost ground, with most shops having suffered months of closures. ""The fragile economic situation continues to bear down on consumer confidence, with some retailers hanging by only a thread in the face of rising costs and lower sales,"" she added. Shoppers queued outside Primark when it reopened on 15 June KPMG's Mr Martin said that while the return to school in September traditionally drove higher sales volumes, the unwinding of the government's furlough scheme could make consumers less willing to spend. And new data from credit card company Visa suggests that consumer confidence has been further knocked by difficulties getting a refund. It shows that more than one in 10 people who have requested a return for items and services bought during the coronavirus lockdown are yet to get their money back. Meanwhile, more than a third say they are avoiding making a big purchase over fears their money would not be returned if they needed a refund. One major concern for many shops was footfall continuing to be down, ""with many people still reluctant to go out, and fewer impulse purchases"", Ms Dickinson said. Separate figures from market intelligence firm Springboard suggested a 40% drop in footfall in the month, which was still an improvement from June, and the best month since February. Online spending is unlikely to decline, while a lack of tourism, more people working from home, and rising unemployment were all factors keeping people away from shops, it said. But there was one bright spot for High Streets. Springboard figures for the beginning of August suggest footfall rising during the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which lets restaurant diners get up to 50% off their food and soft drink bills Monday to Wednesday. However, according to the Centre for Retail Research, more than 22,000 UK restaurant jobs have been cut so far in 2020 and nearly 1,500 restaurants and outlets closed. On Tuesday the BRC repeated a call for a government grant to help pay rents, saying retailers were ""struggling"". ""Next quarter rent day could see many otherwise viable businesses fall into insolvency, costing stores, jobs and economic growth,"" Ms Dickinson said. On Monday the BRC and a number of industry bodies, including UKHospitality, which represents restaurants and pubs, called for a so-called ""Property Bounceback Grant"". The groups, including landlords, called for the government to pay 50% of retail, hospitality and leisure rents for six months, at a cost of Â£1.75bn to the Exchequer. The industry bodies claimed that this would generate tax revenue from economic activity of almost Â£7bn, and save 375,000 jobs. In a joint statement, they said landlords have been ""walking a tightrope to support their customers and protect the pensions and savings of millions of people invested in commercial property across the country"". The Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government said that government support was already available for landlords, and that there was a moratorium on landlords being able to evict commercial tenants for non-payment of rent until 30 September. There were also temporary measures to protect businesses from ""aggressive"" rent recovery, it added. ""We recognise the huge challenges being faced by commercial tenants and landlords during this period, which is why we're working closely with them to ensure they are supported and would urge both landlords and tenants to follow the example of others and find solutions that work for both parties,"" the housing ministry said. ""The government has taken unprecedented action to protect jobs and livelihoods, with a package of around Â£160bn of support, including loans, rates relief and grants for businesses to support them through the pandemic.""

Restrictions had been lifted in New Zealand after the country appeared to eliminate the virus Here's what you need to know this evening: Palestinians have been preparing to leave as the border crossing with Egypt opened for 72 hours Palestinians have been able to leave densely populated Gaza for the first time since March as its border crossing with Egypt opened on Tuesday. The Rafah crossing was closed in March when Hamas, who govern the Gaza strip, worried about the spread of the virus in the enclave with a poor health system. The crossing, which is the only one into Gaza that bypasses Israel, has opened for 72 days for two-way movement. Hundreds of people gathered at a waiting room before dawn, AFP reports. The PM said there are going to be ""bumpy months ahead"" It's almost the end of the day for the live page team. If you're just catching up, here's what you might have missed: Many universities closed during the pandemic, including the University of Delhi, India The disruption to young people's education caused by coronavirus is threatening their job prospects and heightening inequalities, a new report on the impact of the pandemic suggests. The International Labour Organization (ILO) report says 73% of young people in school, university or vocational training worldwide have had their education disrupted. Of the 73% whose education has been disrupted, 65% say they have learnt less during lockdown. Half now believe their studies will be delayed while 9% fear they may fail their exams or degree courses altogether. And, as ever, money plays a role: in wealthier countries, 65% of young people were taught in video lectures, whereas in poorer nations just 18% could continue to study online. Depression and anxiety among young people also appears to be increasing as job prospects decline, it suggested. âThe pandemic is inflicting multiple shocks on young people. It is not only destroying their jobs and employment prospects, but also disrupting their education and training and having serious impacts on their mental well-being. We cannot let this happen,â says ILO director-general Guy Ryder. Read stories of young people affected by anxiety and tips on how to cope. A further 102 people have died after contracting coronavirus in the UK, meaning the death toll now stands at 46,628, Public Health England says. And 1,148 new positive cases have been recorded, bringing the total number to 312,789. Steve Smith came up with the idea and was the first trader to pitch up in the pub car park A weekly market at a village pub in the English Midlands has been told to stop trading because it breaches an 800-year-old charter. Traders started selling vegetables, bread and flowers in the car park of The Free Trade Inn in Sileby, Leicestershire, during lockdown. But a charter signed by King Henry III in 1227 prohibits any market ""within six and two-thirds miles"" (10.8km) of nearby Loughborough. Charnwood Borough Council said it had to protect the town's market. Read the full story here. Sonia OxleyBBC Sport No job = no sport. A simple sum that may have far-reaching consequences at the top of women's sport. Most elite sportswomen (60%) earn less than Â£10,000 from their sport and have to work ""normal"" jobs to support themselves financially, according to aBBC survey. Some, like darts player Kirsty Chubb, have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving them with difficult choices to make about their future - with sport dropping lower in their priorities. For others, like weightlifter Olivia Blatch, the enforced break and lack of training has left them wondering if they can ever get back to the level they were at before. While the Premier League season ended behind closed doors and England's Test Cricket team have won a series of dramatic victories, much of women's sport is yet to restart. Athletes responding to theBBC Sport survey of elite British sportswomenfound that many felt women's sport had taken a backseat during the pandemic. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said supporting its return was a ""priority"" of his. Read Sonia Oxley's full report here. Russia claims it has developed the world's first coronavirus vaccine We've been reporting today thatRussia says it has developed a coronavirus vaccineand it has been approved for use after less than two months of testing on humans. In the past couple of hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has not received enough information about the vaccine to evaluate it. It had been suggested that Brazil would begin producing the vaccine, but that should not be done until more trials are completed, said Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of WHO. ""Any vaccine producer has to follow this procedure that guarantees it is safe and has the WHO's recommendation,"" he said in a briefing. Last week the WHO urged Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19. We reported earlier that France's prime minister said the country has been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks, as he introduced stricter advice on wearing face masks and limits on large public gatherings. The French health ministry has released its daily figures. It reports 1,397 new infections in the past 24 hours - almost twice Monday's tally of 785, according to Reuters news agency. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent The decision toupgrade the exam results of tens of thousands of studentsin Scotland puts the cat among the pigeons for exam results for the rest of the UK, where A-level results are due on Thursday. If Scotlandâs students are given higher grades based on teachersâ predictions, how will it be fair if theyâre competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Will the newly boosted grades of Scottish students bump others out of university places, whose results have been pushed down by the moderation process? And if pegging pupilsâ results to the previous achievement of their school is unfair in Scotland, how will it be fair for those getting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? These grades are for life, important for jobs as well as higher education. It raises the question of which is more important: fairness for individuals, or the smooth running of the exam system? Scotlandâs change of heart will pile on the pressure for changes in the rest of the UK. But, like turning an ethical Rubik's cube, any change will generate other patterns of unfairness. In England, using teachersâ predictions would have meant almost 40% getting an A* or A at A-level this year - and below that average some teachers will have been very tough and others very generous. That would risk creating even more inequalities. Until now, Englandâs Department for Education has rejected any change of plan, but the stakes have been raised. This video can not be played Scottish Education Secretary John Swinney announces all downgraded results will be withdrawn Volunteers in Nepal have been helping women and girls in rural areas where taboos over menstruation have been further complicated by the pandemic. Voluntary Service Overseas' Sisters for Sisters' Education project,externalhas provided guidance and distributed hygiene packs to nearly 3,000 girls in Surkhet, Lamjung, Dhading and Parsa districts of Nepal. The kits include basic items such as soap, a towel, toothbrush, reusable sanitary pads and underwear. Read more on this story here. Brazil, which has been badly hit by the virus, is also developing its own vaccine Russia has given regulatory approval to a nationally-produced coronavirus vaccine after less than two months of testing on humans - although scientists in the West have raised concerns about the speed of its programme. Although Russia's claims are in the headlines today, it's not the only country working on vaccines.More than 100 vaccines are in early development,and more than 20 are being tested on people in clinical trials. The US has six vaccines in development and the country's leading infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said they could have a ""safe and effective"" treatment by the end of the year. The UK government has signed four coronavirus vaccine deals. They include 100 million doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and scientists at Oxford University and an experimental treatment being developed by drug giants GSK and Sanofi. On Tuesday, Indonesia and Mexico both announced late stage clinical trials for possible vaccines. Just catching up? Here's what you need to know about virus-related news in the UK: Around 10,000 people in southern France gathered for an illegal rave over the weekend France's Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country had been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks now as cases of coronavirus rise. Some 10,800 new cases have been identified there in the past week, according to the health ministry. Local authorities will be told to instruct citizens to wear masks in public spaces ""as far as possible"", Castex said in a press conference on Tuesday. Mask are currently obligatory on public transport, enclosed spaces such as shops and government offices, and Paris's main tourist sites. Castex also extended a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people until 30 October. The ban was originally scheduled to lift at the end of this month. At the weekend around 10,000 people gathered for an illegal rave on a mountain plateau in Lozere in the south of the country. The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) has announced an ""urgent package of measures"" following thepostponement of Celtic and Aberdeen matchesbecause players broke lockdown rules. Celtic defender Boli Bolingoliflew to Spain without the club's knowledge, failed to quarantine, then played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock. The previous weekendeight Aberdeen players broke lockdown regulationsby visiting a bar together. The new SPFL measures include plans to punish players who break the rules, an ""immediate"" player education programme and an agreement to take part in promotional activity for the Scottish government's coronavirus public awareness campaign FACTS. Sport Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ""This latest example indicates that the current arrangements are not working as intended, and so clearly additional steps now need to be taken to ensure that the necessity of strict compliance with the rules is fully and properly understood."" In the meantime Celtic and Aberdeen can train as usual, but training and friendly matches will not be allowed. Read the full story here. Reality Check Bangladesh says
it will stop providing daily updates on coronavirus infections and deaths in the
country from 12 August. Health Minister Zahid Maleque says this is because âwe believe
the infection rate is decreasing and the situation is getting under control.â In its latest weekly report, the World
Health Organization (WHO) says new cases in the country have dropped by 2.5% from the
previous week. But the headline figure masks a more complicated reality - reported cases are fluctuating widely, with daily tallies ranging
between 900 and 3,000 since the start of August, according to WHO data. This may well be to do with the amount of
testing being carried out, which has also fluctuated widely â from around
12,000 a day in July, then down to less than 4,000 in early August and back up
to 12,000 again. The
authorities attributed the drop in testing to severe flooding in July as well
as what they say is the unwillingness of people to get tested due to a lack of
trust in medical facilities. And
Bangladesh still has a high rate of positive tests - at the end of last week it
was nearly a quarter of all testswhich suggests that only a small proportion of the true number of infections is being picked up.,external  We know all about washing our hands, what to do when out in public and on public transport but one area which hasn't been discussed much is in the bedroom. Sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust has published advice on how people can lower their risk of catching Covid-19 while enjoying a healthy sex life. Some of the tips include wearing a mask and choosing positions which are not face-to-face during sex. It may sound tough, but people need to find a way ""to balance our need for sex and intimacy with the risks of the spread of Covid-19"", the Trust says. For more tips you can readthis story. Disney World in Florida will reduce its opening hours after receiving fewer visitors than expected Here's a round-up of top stories from the US, which remains the country with the highest number of cases in the world: Here is some more fromthat announcement in Holyrood. Scottish students who had their grades moderated up will not have their results downgraded and Education Secretary John Swinney says the government will work with universities to ensure that pupils are not ""crowded out"" of places they have been promised. It comes after the government had faced criticism over its grading of pupils after exams were cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Results were given based on teachers' estimations but also on the past performance of the school - leading to criticism that bright students in poorer schools could be unfairly penalised. More than 124,000 results were downgraded, with the pass rate for higher pupils from the most deprived areas of Scotland being reduced by 15.2%, compared with 6.9% in the most affluent parts of the country. Mr Swinney has faced calls to resign amid criticism from political opponents, parents, teachers and pupils. Nicola Sturgeon apologised to pupils yesterday and Mr Swinney, her deputy, followed suit today. He said: ""Perhaps our approach to maintaining standards for the 2020 cohort alongside every other year - even though 2020 is so unique - did not fully understand the trauma of Covid-19 for this year group and did not appreciate that a different approach might actually help to even things out.""

"Call for 'virtual trial' in Harry Dunn caseAndrea Leadsom MP has asked the home secretary to consider the idea as a ""way to achieve closure"".Northampton","Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The home secretary has been asked to consider a ""virtual trial"" for Harry Dunn death suspect Anne Sacoolas. The American was charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a crash in August last year which resulted in the 19-year-old's death. The 42-year-old claimed diplomatic immunity following the collision outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. She was able to return to her home country, sparking controversy. The Dunn family's constituency MP Andrea Leadsom has written to ministers, including Priti Patel, ""asking that they seek a virtual trial of Ms Sacoolas"". The MP said: ""A traumatised family are still waiting for a trial that will give them closure."" Ms Leadsom said a virtual trial would allow the US government to ""avoid giving the waiver of diplomatic immunity"" and should any custodial sentence be handed down it ""could likewise be undertaken in the United States"". ""Harry's family are not vengeful - but like every citizen they believe in right and wrong,"" Ms Leadsom added. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after a crash involving her car and Mr Dunn's motorbike outside RAF Croughton She also wrote to the Solicitor General, the foreign secretary, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Lord Chancellor to put forward the idea. Mr Dunn's family said their ""final goodbye"" to their son last month as they scattered his ashes in his favourite place - Portland Bill, near Weymouth in Dorset. Reacting to the letters, Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles, said: ""For me and my family, it is all about doing the right thing and ensuring justice is done."" The Home Office said it was a matter for the Attorney General's Office which confirmed a letter had been received but declined to comment further.

Second night of clashes over disputed Belarus poll,"Demonstrators say the election result was rigged Police in Belarus's capital Minsk have fired rubber bullets for a second night to quash protests following Sunday's disputed presidential elections. Officials say one demonstrator died when an explosive device went off in his hands - the first confirmed fatality since the clashes began. Autocratic President Alexander Lukashenko won 80% of the vote. His main rival Svetlana Tikhanovskaya refused to accept the results, saying she was the real winner. A lack of scrutiny - no observers were present - has led to allegations of widespread vote-rigging in the poll. This video can not be played On Sunday, people were detained in cities across Belarus The election was held amid growing frustration at Mr Lukashenko's leadership, with opposition rallies attracting large crowds. The preceding days sawa crackdown on activists and journalists. Mr Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has described opposition supporters as ""sheep"" controlled from abroad, and vowed not to allow the country to be torn apart. How protests shook up Belarus presidential election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure He won 80.23% of the vote, according to election officials, with Ms Tikhanovskaya receiving 9.9%. Ms Tikhanovskaya entered the election in place of her jailed husband and went on to lead large opposition rallies. Riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse thousands of demonstrators rallying in the capital. Polish-based broadcaster Belsat TV aired footage of the police charging into the crowds. Protesters clashed with riot police in Minsk Demonstrators built barricades on the city streets to try to stop police A number of people were arrested Reports say some of the demonstrators fought back, throwing petrol bombs. Protesters also tried to build barricades. A number of people were arrested. One journalist was injured, her colleagues and eyewitnesses said. Later on Monday, the interior ministry said a protester died when he ""tried to throw an unidentified explosive device at members of law enforcement"". ""It exploded in his hand,"" the ministry said in a statement. Protests were also being held in other Belarusian cities. The internet, which was ""significantly disrupted"" on election day, continued to be mostly unavailable for a second day,external, according to online monitor NetBlocks. The opposition candidate said that the authorities should think about how to peacefully hand over power. ""We have seen that the authorities are trying to hold on to their positions by force,"" she said. Ms Tikhanovskaya says she wants the authorities to hand over power ""No matter how much we asked authorities not to turn on their own people, we were not listened to."" Her campaign said it would challenge ""numerous falsifications"" in the vote. The political novice challenging an authoritarian president ""The election results announced by the Central Electoral Commission do not correspond to reality and completely contradict common sense,"" her spokeswoman Anna Krasulina said. But Mr Lukashenko vowed to stay in control. ""Our response will be robust,"" he said. ""We will not allow the country to be torn apart."" Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated his Belarusian counterpart on his victory, despite friction overaccusations of a Russian plot, which Mr Lukashenko has tried to link to the opposition. The leaders of China and several former Soviet nations have sent messages of support. But the US said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the election and urged the government to ""respect the right to peacefully assemble and to refrain from the use of force"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for the election results to be published, saying harassment and repression had no place in Europe. Individual EU countries expressed support for the demonstrators, and neighbouring Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said doubts over the election were ""a direct road to violence, conflict and growing public outcry"". President Lukashenko, 65, was first elected in 1994. Mr Lukashenko cast his ballot at a polling station in Minsk In the last vote in 2015, he was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. The campaign saw the rise of Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, a former teacher who became a stay-at-home mother until she was thrust into the political spotlight. After her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote, she stepped in to take his place. President Lukashenko has dismissed Ms Tikhanovskaya as a ""poor little girl"", manipulated by foreign ""puppet masters"". Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government has been in part fuelled by its response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease. Belarus, which has a population of 9.5 million, has reported nearly 70,000 cases and almost 600 deaths. Belarus in surprising presidential election battle.

"Retail sales rise despite fewer High Street visitsSales grew again in July, but some retailers are 'hanging by a thread', the industry body says.Business","Retail sales rose again in July, but shops are still trying to make up lost ground, industry body figures suggest. They show the number of visits to High Streets is still down significantly as people shop online instead. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said some retailers continue to struggle due to the coronavirus crisis, and it made a fresh call for government help with rents. The housing ministry said landlords and tenants should ""find solutions that work for both parties"". May 'another month of struggle for retailers' Retail sales jump in June - 'but crisis not over' Retail sales rose for the second consecutive month in July, the BRC said, up 3.2% compared with the same month last year. But the picture for retailers was mixed. Food sales continued to be strong, while furniture and homeware sales also did well as people ""increasingly invest in their time at home"", the BRC-KPMG retail sales report found. Online shopping remained ""prominent"" in July, accounting for 40% of sales, said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG. Computer sales also continued to soar as people who could worked from home, he said. Food and alcohol sales slowed but drink sales still made a significant contribution to supermarket growth, Susan Barratt, the chief executive of grocery research organisation IGD said. And while local coronavirus lockdowns in the north of England had taken a toll on consumer confidence in the region, morale was higher in Scotland, she said. But many British shops, particularly in fashion, jewellery and beauty, are ""still struggling to survive,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. ""While the rise in retail sales is a step in the right direction, the industry is still trying to catch up lost ground, with most shops having suffered months of closures. ""The fragile economic situation continues to bear down on consumer confidence, with some retailers hanging by only a thread in the face of rising costs and lower sales,"" she added. Shoppers queued outside Primark when it reopened on 15 June KPMG's Mr Martin said that while the return to school in September traditionally drove higher sales volumes, the unwinding of the government's furlough scheme could make consumers less willing to spend. And new data from credit card company Visa suggests that consumer confidence has been further knocked by difficulties getting a refund. It shows that more than one in 10 people who have requested a return for items and services bought during the coronavirus lockdown are yet to get their money back. Meanwhile, more than a third say they are avoiding making a big purchase over fears their money would not be returned if they needed a refund. One major concern for many shops was footfall continuing to be down, ""with many people still reluctant to go out, and fewer impulse purchases"", Ms Dickinson said. Separate figures from market intelligence firm Springboard suggested a 40% drop in footfall in the month, which was still an improvement from June, and the best month since February. Online spending is unlikely to decline, while a lack of tourism, more people working from home, and rising unemployment were all factors keeping people away from shops, it said. But there was one bright spot for High Streets. Springboard figures for the beginning of August suggest footfall rising during the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which lets restaurant diners get up to 50% off their food and soft drink bills Monday to Wednesday. However, according to the Centre for Retail Research, more than 22,000 UK restaurant jobs have been cut so far in 2020 and nearly 1,500 restaurants and outlets closed. On Tuesday the BRC repeated a call for a government grant to help pay rents, saying retailers were ""struggling"". ""Next quarter rent day could see many otherwise viable businesses fall into insolvency, costing stores, jobs and economic growth,"" Ms Dickinson said. On Monday the BRC and a number of industry bodies, including UKHospitality, which represents restaurants and pubs, called for a so-called ""Property Bounceback Grant"". The groups, including landlords, called for the government to pay 50% of retail, hospitality and leisure rents for six months, at a cost of Â£1.75bn to the Exchequer. The industry bodies claimed that this would generate tax revenue from economic activity of almost Â£7bn, and save 375,000 jobs. In a joint statement, they said landlords have been ""walking a tightrope to support their customers and protect the pensions and savings of millions of people invested in commercial property across the country"". The Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government said that government support was already available for landlords, and that there was a moratorium on landlords being able to evict commercial tenants for non-payment of rent until 30 September. There were also temporary measures to protect businesses from ""aggressive"" rent recovery, it added. ""We recognise the huge challenges being faced by commercial tenants and landlords during this period, which is why we're working closely with them to ensure they are supported and would urge both landlords and tenants to follow the example of others and find solutions that work for both parties,"" the housing ministry said. ""The government has taken unprecedented action to protect jobs and livelihoods, with a package of around Â£160bn of support, including loans, rates relief and grants for businesses to support them through the pandemic.""

First pupils return to classrooms after lockdown,"Pupils at Kelso High School are among the first in the UK to begin the new 2020/21 academic year Scotland's pupils have returned to classes for the first time since lockdown began nearly five months ago. Borders and Shetland schools are the first to reopen with most others following on Wednesday. Physical distancing among students will not generally be required but hygiene and safety measures such as one-way systems have been put in place. Except for children of key workers, most of the country's 700,000 pupils have not been in class since 20 March. Is it safe for Scotland's schools to reopen? What's your council's plan for the return to school? Has your child returned to school? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external While councils have been given some flexibility over the back to school timetable, the Scottish government wants all schools fully open by 18 August. All age groups returned in the Scottish Borders on Tuesday - a week earlier than the normal start of term - but most councils have opted for a phased approach, for instance by having youngest pupils return first. Signs have been put up in classrooms at Cullivoe Primary School in Shetland in a bid to limit contact While there is no requirement for physical distancing between pupils, teachers should remain 2m apart from students or other adults. Older secondary pupils are also being encouraged to maintain distancing where possible if this does not hinder the return to full-time learning. There is no general requirement to wear face coverings although staff and pupils can do so voluntarily. School buses are treated as part of the school building, so normal distancing or face covering rules do not apply to pupils, but they will have to sanitise their hands prior to boarding. At her coronavirus briefing on Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that some teachers, parents and pupils would feel anxious, but said the guidance was carefully worked through and informed by scientific advice. ""Schools have worked really hard to support pupils through lockdown but we know the impact on education, on wellbeing, on happiness has been negative for young people so to get them back into full-time education has to be a priority,"" she said. Kelso High head teacher Jill Lothian says it's the new procedures that represent the biggest change Kelso High School in the Scottish Borders is one of the first in the country to welcome pupils back to full-time learning. Head teacher Jill Lothian says for young people, it's the procedures rather than the building itself that have changed most. She said there were different entry and exit points and the school is trying to limit the amount of time pupils are moving around the building. It is also attempting to keep them apart as much as possible. ""There's a bit of anxiety but that's what we're here for, to ensure that they get into the routines that are expected as we get them round the school,"" she said. Hand sanitiser stations have been set up in schools, including this one at Cullivoe Primary in Shetland Every classroom is equipped with sanitiser and a cleaning station for pupils to wipe down their desks and chairs. One-way systems are in place and pupils will be encouraged to spend break times outdoors, with controls to ensure they do not all leave the building at the same time. Shona Haslam, leader of Scottish Borders Council, believes the council has done everything it can to make the return to school as safe as possible ""Additional cleaning, additional ventilation, children not walking around the school quite so much, one-way systems in place, school transport being an extension of the school estate - we've done all of those measures that are in the Scottish government guidance and we are as confident as we can be,"" she said. Scottish Borders Council leader Shona Haslam says it has implemented the Scottish government's guidance in full At Inverclyde Academy in Greenock, the school's fresh cohort of S1 pupils will be the first to encounter the new normal of schooling when they arrive on Wednesday, with other year groups returning in the following days. There will be no sharing of equipment such as stationery or headphones. They can bring equipment from home but there is no need as individual stationery packs and calculators will be issued. Desks and seating have been arranged so that pupils are facing the front of the classroom and not each other. They can sit in pairs with a ""shoulder partner"" but there is a strict seating plan to keep students in ""bubbles"", limiting the number of close contacts. Head teacher Denise Crawford said there would be designated areas outside and in the cafeteria so year groups stay within their groups. The teacher's workstation is a measured 2m distance from the desks. A teacher is allowed to approach a child to give them individual help, but such contact must be kept to a minimum and for a maximum of 15 minutes. Inverclyde pupils Layla, Eddy, Rachel, Andrew and Emily spoke of their hopes and concerns over the return to school New Inverclyde Academy first year Emily,12, said she can't wait to see her friends again when she starts back at on Wednesday. ""We've not seen each other for so long, we'll be so happy to see each other,"" she said. ""It will just be great."" Layla, 11, thinks there will be some catching up to do. She said: ""I'm quite good at English and things and I don't think I've missed too much on that because I'm quite confident but definitely maths, I'll need to revise some things."" S5 pupil Eddy has found it difficult to motivate himself during lockdown but has some concerns about the return to school and the possible spread of Covid-19. ""I've got my gran who is in shielding. I need to keep her safe,"" he said ""That's what I'm worried about."" Rachel, 15, is concerned she will not be fully prepared for her higher exams next year. ""I think because we haven't sat the exams in fourth year, that going into fifth year and then sitting highers will be a bit of a shock,"" she said. ""I don't know how I'm going to cope with it."" Andrew, 12, is looking forward to some much-missed social interaction. ""During lockdown we were communicating but eventually there was just nothing to talk about because nothing was happening,"" he said. ""I hope we'll be able to talk about something other than Covid once we get back into school."" SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? RULES:Which lockdown rules will change next - and when?

Is it safe for Scotland's schools to reopen?,"Schools across Scotland have been told to fully reopen to all pupils by 18 August at the latest Scottish pupils are returning to the classroom this week for the first time since schools closed in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Schools in the Borders and Shetland open today, with most others going back from Wednesday - but how safe will pupils and teachers be? The Scottish government insists that it is. Scotland has hadone of the highestcoronavirus death rates in Europe, but infection rates are now generallyvery low,externalacross the country. Only about 170 children under the age of 15 have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland since the pandemic began - and none have died. The government points to studies from other parts of the world which suggest that children could be much less likely to be infected than adults, generally develop milder symptoms and may be less likely to spread the virus to others. No deaths of any children in Scotland have been linked to coronavirus Experts from the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre concluded that""children do not appear to be super-spreaders"",externaland there was no need for schools anywhere to remain closed. However,the scientific evidence,externalis by no means conclusive - and the Scottish government admits it is less clear for older, secondary school pupils than it is for younger children. But it says keeping schools closed is bad for children's health and wellbeing, and that ""the balance of risk is now strongly in favour of children and young people returning to school full-time"". Children won't need to socially distance - but will need to follow hygiene rules Scotland's schools are going to look and feel very different to how they did before the pandemic. The government says,externalthere is no need for primary school children to socially distance - but secondary schools should encourage pupils to distance ""where possible"". This means older pupils will be urged not to crowd together, especially indoors, or touch each other. Adults will need to keep at least 2m apart from each other and from pupils if possible - although it is accepted that this is not realistic for teachers dealing with nursery age children. No-one will need to wear face coverings, apart from staff who have close personal contact with a pupil for an extended period of time. But anyone who wants to wear a face covering should be allowed to do so. Pupils will be urged not to gather together in large groups All schools will have to provide adequate hand washing and sanitizing facilities - and ensure they are properly used - and there will be enhanced ventilation and cleaning. Specific rules vary from school to school, but class sizes could be changed and many are staggering drop-off and pick-up times. They should try and keep pupils in consistent groups, like a class or year group. Some are making pupils eat lunch in their classroom rather than the canteen, and staggering break times. Schools are urged to use outdoor spaces as much as possible, but music and singing ""should be avoided during the initial return to school"". Read the Scottish government's advice for parents,external Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, says many of its members still have serious concerns. Itcarried out a survey,externalof about 25,000 teachers last week. While the majority (64%) supported the decision to re-open schools, only a fifth were confident schools were currently safe. There have been calls for the routine testing of staff, even if they have no symptoms of the virus. The EIS said there was ""strong support"" for the use of face coverings among its members. Some teachers have questioned why they will need to wear one on the bus to work, but not while surrounded by pupils. The close contacts of anyone who tests positive will be traced Anyone who thinks they might have the virus should stay at home, and pupils or staff who show possible symptoms at school will be told to follow the national rules on testing and self-isolation. If anyone connected to the school tests positive, the local health protection team will then assess what further action is needed. The school could potentially shut temporarily, although Education Secretary John Swinney has said that this will""not necessarily""be the case. Any significant rise in the number cases either locally or nationally could lead to schools moving to a part-time model or even closing completely for a time. Parents have been home schooling since March - and not all are ready for their children to return to the classroom Many parents struggled with home learning and are looking forward to the return to school. However, the government accepts this is not the case for everyone and that some parents might want to keep their children at home. The government says schools and local authorities should offer reassurance about safety and encourage parents to allow their children to return to school. Rules on compulsory attendance ""should only be used as a last resort"". All children and staff who have been shielding are expected to return to school, unless they have been given medical advice not to do so.

Apple boss Tim Cook joins the billionaires club,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook has moved into the billionaire club as the tech firm's share price continues to soar. Apple's market value has been on the rise following strong results and the upbeat outlook for tech giants. Mr Cook owns 847,969 shares directly and took home more than $125m (Â£96m) last year as part of his pay package. Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg saw his personal wealth hit $100bn (Â£76bn). Technology companies including Apple, Facebook and Amazon have seen their profits grow during the coronavirus pandemic as more people went online. Silicon-Valley based Apple is now closing in on the milestone of being the first company to be valued at $2tn. Two years ago it become the first company to be valued at $1tn. Facebook's Zuckerberg sees wealth hit $100bn Tech bosses grilled over claims of 'harmful' power Apple defends Xbox streaming block on iPhones Mr Cook took over from Apple founder Steve Jobs nine years ago. His billionaire status is based on the shares he owns and the compensation he has been paid at Apple, and calculated by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In 2015, he said he planned to give most of his fortune away and has already donated million of dollars worth of Apple shares. Facebook's Zuckerberg has made a similar pledge to give away the majority of his shares. Mr Zuckerberg, along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk, accrued their wealth from the huge stakes in the companies they founded. In comparison, Mr Cook's stake in Apple is minuscule at about 0.02%. Based on US federal and state taxes for California, Mr Cook would face a tax rate of just over 50%, as a top-bracket earner. While Apple has not revealed any new products as groundbreaking as its iPhone, the company has still thrived since Mr Cook took over the reins. He has overseen the development of devices such as the iPhone X and Apple Watch, along with new services like Apple Music.

"'Eat out to help out' used 10 million times so farThe Treasury has set aside Â£500m to cover the cost of the scheme for restaurants, bars and cafes.BusinessComments","Diners used the ""eat out to help out"" scheme more than 10.5 million times in its first week, the Treasury has said. Under the scheme, which is intended to boost the struggling hospitality sector, the government pays for 50% of a meal eaten at a cafe, restaurant or pub on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. The discount, which is due to run through August, is capped at Â£10. Treasury estimates put the average claim at close to Â£5, making the cost of the policy around Â£50m so far. HMRC said that, as of 9 August, it had received 10,540,394 claims under the scheme. Chancellor Rishi Sunak described the figures as ""amazing"", adding those using the scheme were helping support the hospitality sector. How can I use the 'eat out to help out' scheme? 'We've had 15,000 bookings for eat out to help out' The government has set aside Â£500m to fund the policy. And it has already led to an increase in the number of people visiting High Streets across the country, according to Springboard, which measures footfall figures. It said the number of people in retail destinations after 18:00 BST last Monday, the first day of the scheme, was 19% higher than the week before. Meanwhile lunchtime visits were up 10%. However, visits to High Streets are still down significantly compared to the same time last year. The Treasury said that 83,068 restaurants had signed up to the scheme. They include fast-fast food chains like McDonald's and KFC as well as lots of local, independent pubs, restaurants and cafes. Government figures show that 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and that 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector. ""Britons are eating out to help out in big numbers,"" said Mr Sunak. ""And they aren't just getting a great deal - they're supporting the almost 2 million people employed in this sector,"" he said. The discount is only on food and soft drinks eaten on the premises, so it does not apply to takeaways. There is no limit on how many times the discount can be used in August, or for how many people, including children. Will the 'eat out to help out scheme' be extended?

Worker sacked after Hitler meme wins payout,"The meme used the dramatic scene from the film Downfall A BP refinery worker in Australia who was sacked for parodying the company via a well-known Hitler meme has been awarded a $200,000 (Â£109,000) payout. Scott Tracey used the popular meme, from 2004 film Downfall, to portray scenes from company wage negotiations, posting it on a closed Facebook group. He was sacked by the company. However, after a two-year legal battle, he won an unfair dismissal case and returned to work. The payout covers lost earnings. The meme uses a dramatic scene in Downfall - in which Hitler angrily confronts his generals in his bunker - and replaces the subtitles with alternative dialogue as a joke. BP worker sacked over Hitler parody wins job back The rise, rise and rise of the Downfall Hitler parody,external BP had said it was ""highly offensive and inappropriate"" and dismissed Mr Tracey. The refinery worker first took his case to a tribunal, arguing unfair dismissal, but lost. Mr Tracey then appealed, insisting he had not intended to offend anyone and that the video was meant to be humorous. He added that it did not identify BP or anyone specifically. The federal court ruled it was unreasonable to say the meme had likened BP managers to Nazis and Mr Tracey was allowed to return to work. On Monday, he was awarded $177,325 in wages and lost bonuses, minus tax, and also $24,070 in superannuation or pension payments. BP had argued that Mr Tracey should be paid $150,000, less than what he would have earned if he had not been dismissed. The company wanted money to be deductedbecause the video was shared among colleagues,external, which BP said was misconduct, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. BP also said more money should be deducted as Mr Tracey could have found work during the trial. The Fair Work Commission said there was no evidence to argue that Mr Tracey had not searched for employment. Brad Gandy, secretary at Australian Workers Union, said that Mr Tracey had been through ""unnecessary drama"". ""To dig in and drag an honest worker through nearly two years of stress and uncertainty, all because a few stuffed shirts didn't get a joke, is poor corporate behaviour,"" Mr Gandy told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Power project could be 'devastating' for seabirds,"The seabed around Anglesey's South Stack could become a world-leading tidal energy site Plans for a massive tidal energy project off the Welsh coast could have a devastating impact on seabird populations, RSPB Cymru has warned. The charity says it has ""grave concerns"" about a planning application for the Morlais scheme off Anglesey. It claims an assessment by the scheme's backers shows 60% of guillemots and 97% of razorbills could be lost from cliffs at South Stack, near Holyhead. But developers Menter MÃ´n said that was a ""worse case scenario"" only. The not-for-profit social enterprise said there was no evidence worldwide suggesting wildlife would be damaged by such tidal flow energy schemes. The Morlais project would see a development on 35 sq km (13 sq miles) of seabed, generating up to 240MW of electricity from the power of the tides in the Irish Sea. It would make it one of the largest tidal stream energy sites in the world. Up to 5,000 guillemots can descend on to South Stack's sea cliffs in the spring But the RSPB said it feared ""political and economic pressures to complete the application are pushing this development to take unmanageable risks with our fragile marine environment"". ""If this project is serious about being a test bed for new marine energy generation technologies in an environmentally sensitive way, it must proceed in a step-wise manner, learning from each stage,"" insisted RSPB Cymru director Katie-jo Luxton. ""However, our faith in this approach is jeopardised by Menter MÃ´n seeking blanket, large scale consents. ""We are calling for the large 240MW scale proposal to be withdrawn and be replaced by a smaller scale initial 'pilot' project."" The road to clean energy? Energy and the future Lockdown and renewable energy The charity has a large presence in the area, with its South Stack nature reserve attracting about 250,000 visitors a year. Between March and July, the sea cliffs are home to the nesting populations of razorbills, which spend most of their life at sea. The reserve is also a prime location to spot puffins in the wild. Menter MÃ´n told BBC Wales it always intended to take a step-by-step approach to the project, with only a small number of underwater turbines initially installed, while the affect on wildlife can be assessed. The enterprise has also estimated it could create about 160 jobs. The cliffs become home to about 1,400 razorbills every year Gerallt Llewelyn Jones, one of the directors responsible for the scheme, added: ""This would have a huge economic impact but nobody wants economic impact which damages wildlife. ""That's not what we're about."" It is expected a public inquiry on the application for the Morlais scheme will be held later this year. A Welsh Government official said the process for developments such as this ""provide strong environmental protections"" with monitoring if consent is granted. ""The regulator is able to place legally-binding requirements on developers to ensure projects begin small in initial stages and are scaled up step-by-step, subject to the outcome of project-specific monitoring,"" said a spokesman. ""In this way, the process can ensure there are not significant impacts on wildlife populations and that the integrity of Marine Protected Areas are not compromised."" A final decision on whether the scheme can go ahead is expected to be made in 2021.

HK newspaper Apple Daily defiant after crackdown,"This video can not be played Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai is released on bail The holding company of Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper has seen its stock rise fourfold, a day after the arrest of its owner Jimmy Lai. Mr Lai was arrested on Monday under a controversial security law imposed by Beijing, but has now been bailed. The pro-democracy tycoon was among 10 people detained on charges including colluding with foreign forces. But Hong Kongers have rallied behind the newspaper, buying stocks in the company. The stock closed on Tuesday at HK$1.10, up from its close of HK$0.255 just 24 hours before. The paper, which offers a rare, unvarnished take on Hong Kong and China's leadership, said more than 500,000 copies were printed, five times the usual number. The Hong Kong paper that pushed the boundary In extraordinary scenes streamed by the paper on Monday, a handcuffed Mr Lai was led through his newsroom as nearly 200 police officers raided the building. The move sparked global condemnation of the escalating crackdown on dissent. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China had ""eviscerated Hong Kongâs freedoms"". On Tuesday, the newspaper's front page showed an image of Mr Lai in handcuffs with the headline: ""Apple Daily must fight on."" He was released on bail early on Wednesday local time and greeted by a crowd of cheering supporters. In some parts of the city Hong Kongers were seen queuing for a copy as early as 02:30 as vendors reported selling out of the popular tabloid founded by Mr Lai. ""(I bought these) to hand them out to others, I'm afraid a lot of people can`t get their copies,"" a woman, who only gave her name as Chan, told the BBC while buying 16 copies. Online subscriptions are also reportedly up 20,000 this week. Supporters of the paper bought copies in bulk in the early hours Shares of holding company Next Digital, which had initially dropped on Monday, almost reached a 12-year high on Tuesday. This came as activists called for supporters to buy the stock. However, there are concerns that investors with ties to the mainland could also be buying up shares. Louise Wong, a senior executive at Next Digital,told the Nikkei Asian Review,externalthat ""if someone could get over 5% of the holdings, he or she could ask for a seat on the board"". Mr Lai, who is viewed as a hero by many in Hong Kong for his direct criticism of Beijingâs top leadership, is the highest-profile detainee under use of the new legislation so far. But on the mainland, he has long been labelled a traitor. Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hours after his arrest, prominent youth activist Agnes Chow and Wilson Li, a freelance journalist, were also arrested under the same law. Ms Chow was released on bail late on Tuesday. She told reporters: ""It's very obvious that the regime is using the national security law to suppress political dissidents."" The arrests renewed criticism from Washington, London and the United Nations of attacks on the cityâs freedoms. Agnes Chow was detained hours after Jimmy Lai ""Iâm deeply troubled by reports of the arrest of@JimmyLaiApple,externalunder Hong Kongâs draconian National Security Law,"" tweeted US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. âFurther proof that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] has eviscerated Hong Kongâs freedoms and eroded the rights of its people,â he wrote. Similar sentiments were expressed in Britain, which has already said it will suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and offer a pathway to citizenship for many of the city's residents, in the light of the new law. This video can not be played Hong Kong arrests media tycoon Jimmy Lai ""This is further evidence that the national security law is being used as a pretext to silence opposition,"" a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Reuters. ""The Hong Kong authorities must uphold the rights and freedoms of its people."" The controversial security law introduced to Hong Kong in June had already prompted some of the cityâs highest-profile activists to flee overseas in anticipation of a broader clampdown on the cityâs freedoms. Pro-democracy protests flared in Hong Kong last year over plans to allow extradition from the territory to mainland China. While this proposal was eventually withdrawn, the demonstrations carried on, to reflect widespread demands for democratic reforms.

Celtic player 'sorry' over quarantine breach,"Celtic have apologised for a player's breach of coronavirus rules and described it as ""beyond explanation"". Boli Bolingoli admitted he played in Sunday's match against Kilmarnock despite having recently returned from Spain without quarantining.

Police Scotland confirmed Bolingoli had been issued with a fixed penalty notice for breaching quarantine regulations. Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the player's actions were ""utterly unacceptable."" The breach comes after eightAberdeen players apologised for visiting a bar at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak.

With a number of incidents, Scot Govt left with little choice but to consider whether pause is now needed in resumption of the game. ""Operational matter for Border Force & Police Scot, I support whatever enforcement action they deem necessary."" The Scottish government said it was in discussion with the club and football governing bodies to establish the facts. ""If confirmed as another serious incident within Scottish football, where protocols have been breached at the risk of wider public health, then the Scottish government will have little choice but to consider whether a pause is now needed in the resumption of the game in Scotland,"" they added.

"Apple boss Tim Cook joins the billionaires clubThe company's share price has soared, helping to boost the personal wealth of its chief executive.","Apple chief executive Tim Cook has moved into the billionaire club as the tech firm's share price continues to soar. Apple's market value has been on the rise following strong results and the upbeat outlook for tech giants. Mr Cook owns 847,969 shares directly and took home more than $125m (Â£96m) last year as part of his pay package. Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg saw his personal wealth hit $100bn (Â£76bn). Technology companies including Apple, Facebook and Amazon have seen their profits grow during the coronavirus pandemic as more people went online. Silicon-Valley based Apple is now closing in on the milestone of being the first company to be valued at $2tn. Two years ago it become the first company to be valued at $1tn. Facebook's Zuckerberg sees wealth hit $100bn Tech bosses grilled over claims of 'harmful' power Apple defends Xbox streaming block on iPhones Mr Cook took over from Apple founder Steve Jobs nine years ago. His billionaire status is based on the shares he owns and the compensation he has been paid at Apple, and calculated by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In 2015, he said he planned to give most of his fortune away and has already donated million of dollars worth of Apple shares. Facebook's Zuckerberg has made a similar pledge to give away the majority of his shares. Mr Zuckerberg, along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk, accrued their wealth from the huge stakes in the companies they founded. In comparison, Mr Cook's stake in Apple is minuscule at about 0.02%. Based on US federal and state taxes for California, Mr Cook would face a tax rate of just over 50%, as a top-bracket earner. While Apple has not revealed any new products as groundbreaking as its iPhone, the company has still thrived since Mr Cook took over the reins. He has overseen the development of devices such as the iPhone X and Apple Watch, along with new services like Apple Music.

""We are calling for the large 240MW scale proposal to be withdrawn and be replaced by a smaller scale initial 'pilot' project."" The road to clean energy? Energy and the future Lockdown and renewable energy The charity has a large presence in the area, with its South Stack nature reserve attracting about 250,000 visitors a year. Between March and July, the sea cliffs are home to the nesting populations of razorbills, which spend most of their life at sea. The reserve is also a prime location to spot puffins in the wild. Menter MÃ´n told BBC Wales it always intended to take a step-by-step approach to the project, with only a small number of underwater turbines initially installed, while the affect on wildlife can be assessed. The enterprise has also estimated it could create about 160 jobs. The cliffs become home to about 1,400 razorbills every year Gerallt Llewelyn Jones, one of the directors responsible for the scheme, added: ""This would have a huge economic impact but nobody wants economic impact which damages wildlife. ""That's not what we're about."" It is expected a public inquiry on the application for the Morlais scheme will be held later this year. A Welsh Government official said the process for developments such as this ""provide strong environmental protections"" with monitoring if consent is granted. ""The regulator is able to place legally-binding requirements on developers to ensure projects begin small in initial stages and are scaled up step-by-step, subject to the outcome of project-specific monitoring,"" said a spokesman. ""In this way, the process can ensure there are not significant impacts on wildlife populations and that the integrity of Marine Protected Areas are not compromised."" A final decision on whether the scheme can go ahead is expected to be made in 2021.

Call for 'virtual trial' in Harry Dunn case,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The home secretary has been asked to consider a ""virtual trial"" for Harry Dunn death suspect Anne Sacoolas. The American was charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a crash in August last year which resulted in the 19-year-old's death. The 42-year-old claimed diplomatic immunity following the collision outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. She was able to return to her home country, sparking controversy. The Dunn family's constituency MP Andrea Leadsom has written to ministers, including Priti Patel, ""asking that they seek a virtual trial of Ms Sacoolas"". The MP said: ""A traumatised family are still waiting for a trial that will give them closure."" Ms Leadsom said a virtual trial would allow the US government to ""avoid giving the waiver of diplomatic immunity"" and should any custodial sentence be handed down it ""could likewise be undertaken in the United States"". ""Harry's family are not vengeful - but like every citizen they believe in right and wrong,"" Ms Leadsom added. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after a crash involving her car and Mr Dunn's motorbike outside RAF Croughton She also wrote to the Solicitor General, the foreign secretary, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Lord Chancellor to put forward the idea. Mr Dunn's family said their ""final goodbye"" to their son last month as they scattered his ashes in his favourite place - Portland Bill, near Weymouth in Dorset. Reacting to the letters, Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles, said: ""For me and my family, it is all about doing the right thing and ensuring justice is done."" The Home Office said it was a matter for the Attorney General's Office which confirmed a letter had been received but declined to comment further.

Apple boss Tim Cook reaches billionaire status,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook has moved into the billionaire club as the tech firm's share price continues to soar. Apple's market value has been on the rise following strong results and the upbeat outlook for tech giants. Mr Cook owns 847,969 shares directly and took home more than $125m (Â£96m) last year as part of his pay package. Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg saw his personal wealth hit $100bn (Â£76bn). Technology companies including Apple, Facebook and Amazon have seen their profits grow during the coronavirus pandemic as more people went online. Silicon-Valley based Apple is now closing in on the milestone of being the first company to be valued at $2tn. Two years ago it become the first company to be valued at $1tn. Facebook's Zuckerberg sees wealth hit $100bn Tech bosses grilled over claims of 'harmful' power Apple defends Xbox streaming block on iPhones Mr Cook took over from Apple founder Steve Jobs nine years ago. His billionaire status is based on the shares he owns and the compensation he has been paid at Apple, and calculated by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In 2015, he said he planned to give most of his fortune away and has already donated million of dollars worth of Apple shares. Facebook's Zuckerberg has made a similar pledge to give away the majority of his shares. Mr Zuckerberg, along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk, accrued their wealth from the huge stakes in the companies they founded. In comparison, Mr Cook's stake in Apple is minuscule at about 0.02%. Based on US federal and state taxes for California, Mr Cook would face a tax rate of just over 50%, as a top-bracket earner. While Apple has not revealed any new products as groundbreaking as its iPhone, the company has still thrived since Mr Cook took over the reins. He has overseen the development of devices such as the iPhone X and Apple Watch, along with new services like Apple Music.

"Universities told to hold places open until appealWith uncertainty over replacement grades, universities are told to wait for the outcome of appeals.Family & Education","Universities in England are being told to keep places open for students if they appeal against A-level results. Amid uncertainty about replacement exam grades, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has urged university heads to be as ""flexible as possible"". It means if students miss the required grades but successfully appeal, they could still start next term. ""Nobody should have to put their future on hold because of the virus,"" said Ms Donelan. With A-levels cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, students will receive estimated results on Thursday, which will be used to decide university places. But if students get disappointing results that they think are unfair, universities are being told to leave the door open for places until appeals have been considered by exam boards. Nicola Sturgeon 'sorry' about exam results Boris Johnson understands 'anxiety' over grades How will exam results day work this year? A-level results to be higher this year, says watchdog Appeals, which have to be submitted through schools, should be completed by 7 September, allowing students who get improved grades to take up places this autumn. The biggest factors determining the replacement exam grades will be how students are ranked in ability and the previous exam results of their school or college. Protests in Scotland criticised how estimated results were pegged to schools' previous results As the row over Scottish exam results has shown, this can mean that high-achieving youngsters in schools with poor results can be marked down. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon apologised on Monday after accepting her government""did not get it right"" over exam results. Education Secretary John Swinney will set out the Scottish government's plan to fix the issue later. Ms Donelan said she recognised the need for universities to be fair towards ""students who are highly talented in schools or colleges that have not in the past had strong results"". She said the ""vast majority of grades"" were expected to be accurate, but added it was ""essential"" to have the appeals ""safety net"" for ""young people who may otherwise be held back from moving on to their chosen route"". Calling on universities to show ""flexibility"" in admissions decisions, she called on them to hold the places of students whose ""grade may change as the result of an appeal"". But despite these concerns - and the change of heart in Scotland - there are no signs of any change in using a similar approach to moderating results in England. This is still expected to be a good year for applicants, with an expected reduction in overseas students meaning that universities will have more places to fill. A-level results are going to be higher this year - but not by as much as teachers' predicted The exam regulator Ofqual has already said there will be a more lenient approach to grades this year, with a two-percentage-points increase expected in top grades at A-level. But results will not be as generous as teachers' predictions, which would have pushed up results by 12 percentage points - with these predictions able to be shared with pupils after the results are published. The results to be issued this week are designed to maintain continuity with previous years, but there have been concerns about whether individual students could be treated unfairly. A survey of 500 A-level students in England, carried out by the University of Birmingham and the University of Nottingham, suggested almost twice as many students would have preferred to have taken their exams, rather than rely on estimated grades. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson defended the system for calculating grades this year as ""fundamentally a fair one"". ""We know that, without exams, even the best system is not perfect,"" he said. ""That is why I welcome the fact that Ofqual has introduced a robust appeal system, so every single student can be treated fairly - and today we are asking universities to do their part to ensure every young person can progress to the destination they deserve."" But Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, said there was ""absolutely no merit"" in looking at schools' prior overall performance to judge students' results this year, criticising it as ""baking inequality into the system"". She told BBC Newsnight: ""They're just trying to fit students' attainment against a prior year, which means you're just assuming and reproducing the fact that students from low socio-economic backgrounds are - as this system would say - due to get lower grades."" She described the algorithm being used to determine grades as a ""lazy move"", leading to ""individuals being let down by an unjust system"", which she said was ""completely wrong"".

Lebanon cabinet resigns as anger over blast mountsThe prime minister announced the move in a TV address as clashes continued for a third day.Middle East,"This video can not be played Lebanese government resigns as public anger grows Lebanon's government has resigned amid mounting anger over the explosion on Tuesday that devastated parts of Beirut and left more than 200 people dead. The announcement was made in a national TV address by Prime Minister Hassan Diab on Monday evening. Many people have accused the country's leaders of culpability through their alleged negligence and corruption. Protesters have taken to the streets and clashed with police for a third straight day. The massive blast was caused by the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at the port for years. President Michel Aoun has asked the government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is formed. Mr Diab, who was appointed prime minister in January after months of deadlock, said his government had ""gone to great lengths to lay out a road map to save the country"". But corruption in Lebanon was ""bigger than the state"" itself, and ""a very thick and thorny wall separates us from change; a wall fortified by a class that is resorting to all dirty methods in order to resist and preserve its gains"", he said. Why Lebanon is in crisis ""They knew that we pose a threat to them, and that the success of this government means a real change in this long-ruling class whose corruption has asphyxiated the country,"" he added. ""Today we follow the will of the people in their demand to hold accountable those responsible for the disaster that has been in hiding for seven years, and their desire for real change,"" Mr Diab said. Protesters angry about corruption threw fireworks in Beirut on Monday The prime minister presented himself in the speech as a reforming leader blocked by endemic corruption dating back years, BBC Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman says. Parliament will now have to decide on a new prime minister - a process involving the same sectarian politics at the root of protesters' discontent, our correspondent adds. It is unlikely to be a smooth or quick process due to the country's complex political system. Power in Lebanon is shared between leaders representing the country's different religious groups. Additionally, following the end of the 1975-1990 civil war a number of warlords entered politics and still control large parts of the country's political, economic and social sectors. Many protesters blame this entrenched system for the country's corruption. This video can not be played Starting with the epicentre, we follow how the 4 August blast ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt On Monday police clashed with angry residents as protests continued in the capital following the government's resignation. Footage showed protesters gathering near barriers leading to the parliament building as security forces fired tear gas at them. The death toll from last week's explosion has risen to 220 with 110 people still missing, Beirut city governor Marwan Abboud was quoted by the al-Marsad Online news website as saying. Many foreign workers and lorry drivers were among the missing, he told Al Jadeed TV channel. Riot police fired weapons during anti-government protests in Beirut The huge blast damaged buildings in a radius of several kilometres in Beirut, leaving more than 200,000 people homeless or living in homes with no windows or doors. Officials estimate that the explosion caused more than $3bn (Â£2.3bn) of damage and that Lebanon's collective economic losses may amount to $15bn. The country was already suffering a major economic downturn before the explosion, with families pushed into poverty and hunger. The inferno and the mystery ship Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images 'We don't have dreams any more' What we know about the blast Discontent in Lebanon has been brewing for years. In late 2019, a plan to tax Whatsapp calls spilled over into mass protests against economic turmoil and corruption, which eventually led to the government's resignation. Coronavirus had curbed the protests, but the financial situation has continued to worsen and last Tuesday's explosion was seen by many as the deadly result of years of corruption and mismanagement. Police and protesters clashed in Beirut on Monday The government's plans to investigate were not enough for many  who have lost all faith in the political elite. Before the cabinet's resignation, a number of ministers had already offered to step down. But the end of this government does not necessarily mean an end to the anger. Last year's protests led to the formation of the government which has now been forced to step down over the same accusations of corruption.
