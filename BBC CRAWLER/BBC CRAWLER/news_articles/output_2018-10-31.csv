Parkinson's disease 'may' start in gut,"The brain disease Parkinson's may actually start in the depths of the digestive system, US scientists say. In their study, people whose appendix had been removed were less likely to develop the neurodegenerative disease. And the appendix, long thought of as pointless in the human body, contained the substance that kills brain cells. Parkinson's UK said the findings were the most compelling evidence yet that the disease's origins lie outside the brain. In Parkinson's, toxic proteins build up in the brain to kill nerves, particularly those linked with movement. Parkinson's disease is incurable It affects 128,000 people in the UK As well as damaging movement, it affects the senses, memory and mood It might feel counter-intuitive, but there is now growing evidence that the gut is involved. Researchers at the Van Andel Research Institute, in Michigan, looked at data on 1.7 million people over half a century. The study,published in Science Translational Medicine,external, showed the risk of Parkinson's was 20% lower in the people who had had their appendix removed. The appendix is a little sac at the opening of the large intestine and is probably the best known vestigial (without a use) organ in the human body. And analysing the content of people's appendixes showed they contained the same toxic protein - called alpha synuclein - that is found in the brains of Parkinson's patients. The appendix is clearly not the whole of the story (otherwise removing it would prevent all cases). But the researchers argue the guts are a breeding ground for the protein, which then travels up the vagus nerve and into the brain. One of the researchers, Dr Viviane Labrie, said people should not rush to have their appendix removed. She said: ""We're not advocating appendectomy as a form of protecting against Parkinson's disease. ""It would be much more wise to control or dampen excessive formation of alpha synuclein to tune down the overabundance or potentially to prevent its escape."" The idea that the gut is involved in Parkinson's is rapidly gaining attention. Patients often report digestive disorders. Cutting the vagus nerve is linked to a lower level of Parkinson's and animal studies have suggestedbacteria that live in the gut are key. Claire Bale, from Parkinson's UK, said: ""This research is really important because it gives us some of the most compelling evidence yet that Parkinson's may begin outside the brain, which is a revolutionary new idea that is emerging in the scientific world. ""Understanding where and how Parkinson's begins will be absolutely crucial to developing treatments that can stop it and potential prevent it altogether."" The study showed nearly everybody tested had alpha-synuclein protein in their appendix. And there were some differences in the structure of the protein between healthy people and Parkinson's patients. However, the hunt for the origins of Parkinson's still cannot explain why the disease develops in some people but not others. This field of research is asking as many new questions as it answers.

Mobile phone shop staff 'enabling scams',"Staff in mobile phone shops have become key to the execution of ""Sim swap"" scams, Watchdog Live has discovered. Undercover filming revealed that O2 and Vodafone employees are bypassing basic ID checks and handing over replacement Sim cards to potential criminals. Once fraudsters gain control of a mobile number, they can intercept SMS text messages from banks containing security codes. Scammers have drainedthousands of pounds from victims' bank accounts. O2 told the BBC it currently only asks for photo ID when replacing Sims on a monthly contract, and that customers on Pay As You Go contracts would always receive an authorisation code alerting them that someone is trying to access their number. However, that did not happen with any of the numbers being used by the Watchdog Live team, who were able to walk out with a replacement Sim in almost every case. O2 says it did send out authorisation codes, but they were not received by the victims' smartphones. Vodafone said that it takes Sim swap fraud ""extremely seriously"" and that it is disappointed that two of its employees did not follow established security check procedures, despite being given mandatory training, reinforced by regular reminders to the contrary. Previously, in some countries, Sim swap scams were used by scammers to ring and text premium numbersto run up large mobile phone bills,external. But now that more online services use two-factor authentication, which requires text messages to be sent to mobile phones, there is more at risk. Olga from Buckinghamshire had Â£2,000 taken from her bank account, after a fraudster managed to successfully request a replacement Sim for her mobile number without her knowing anything about it. ""It was like a state of shock and my first thought was that there must be some sort of error,"" Olga told Watchdog. ""I was just sobbing down the phone saying all my money's been stolen."" Initially, Olga's bank refused to refund her the money, blaming her for not keeping her details safe. But it eventually became clear that the fraudster had found a way in to her account after being given a replacement Sim card by EE. Watchdog's undercover visits found that staff in EE and Three stores always stuck to their security policies by demanding photo ID. Sim swap scams occur when a criminal is able to convince a mobile operator to issue them with a replacement Sim card, by claiming a false identity and pretending that their mobile phone has been either lost or stolen. Criminals are able to do this using people's personal details that have been stolen using malware or cyber-attacks. Many of these details are then soldon the dark web. The victim's Sim card stops working and the criminal can then access any online service that requires security codes to be sent to a user's mobile phone. Security researchers have long believed that UK crime gangs are behind these scams, as the fraudsters manage to trick banks bylogging onto mobile banking systems from locations close to the victim's home address,external. In the past, this scam has been perpetrated by fraudsters calling the customer service call centres of mobile operators, as well as by hackers usingfake mobile base station equipment bought from the black market,external. While the scam has been in existence for at least four years - BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programmedemonstrated that they could attack bank accounts in 2016- the number of cases of Sim swap fraud have rocketed by 60% since 2016.

Imran Khan condemns blasphemy hardliners,"This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has attacked hardliners and appealed for calm after the acquittal of a Christian woman convicted of blasphemy. In a televised broadcast, Mr Khan said hardliners were ""inciting [people] for their own political gain"", claiming they are ""doing no service to Islam"". The landmark Asia Bibi case has already set off violent protests by hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws. Her lawyer has told the BBC she would need to move abroad for her safety. Asia Bibi was convicted in 2010 of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a row with neighbours. She always maintained her innocence, but has spent most of the past eight years in solitary confinement. Pakistan's 'historic' Asia Bibi ruling Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Wednesday's verdict by the Supreme Court triggered demonstrations in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Multan. Clashes with police have been reported. A leader of the hard-line Islamist Tehreek-i-Labaik party, Muhammad Afzal Qadri, said all three Supreme Court judges ""deserve to be killed"". The Red Zone in the capital, Islamabad, where the Supreme Court is located, has been sealed off by police. Demonstrations have been held in several cities including Peshawar Late on Wednesday, Mr Khan said: ""Which government can function like this, blackmailed by protests? ""And who suffers due to this? Our Pakistanis. The common people, the poor. You block the roads, you rob people's livelihood... ""This is not the service of Islam, this is enmity with the country. Only anti-state elements talk like this, that kill the judges, start a revolt in army... They are only trying to beef up their vote bank."" Asia Bibi and a lonely Christmas in a prison cell The Muslims building a Christian church in Pakistan The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. Laws enacted by the British Raj in 1860 made it a crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship, punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Several more clauses were added in the 1980s by Pakistan's military ruler Gen Zia ul-Haq: 1980 - up to three years in jail for derogatory remarks against Islamic personages 1982 - life imprisonment for ""wilful"" desecration of the Koran 1986 - ""death, or imprisonment for life"" for blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws? Blasphemy laws around the world The judges said the prosecution had ""failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"". The case was based on flimsy evidence, they said, and proper procedures had not been followed. The alleged confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". The ruling heavily referenced the Koran and Islamic history.,externalIt ended with a quote from the Hadith, the collected sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, which calls for non-Muslims to be treated kindly. Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemers in Pakistan The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy. Asia Bibi, who was born in 1971 and has four children, was the first woman to be sentenced to death under the laws. Salman Taseer had taken up Asia Bibi's cause and called for reform of the blasphemy laws Internationally, her conviction has been widely condemned as a breach of human rights. Authorities said she is scheduled for release later this week, after which her plans are unknown. Speaking to the BBC, her lawyer Saiful Mulook said she would need to move to a Western country after the ruling for her own safety. She has been offered asylum by several countries and many expect her and her family to leave Pakistan. Asia Bibi's husband and daughter say they fear for their safety in Pakistan Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

From prison cell to football coach,"""A blessing that landed at my feet"" - that's how Andrew describes the football coaching course he enrolled in during his time at Brixton Prison. The 45-year-old, from north London - whose surname we've chosen not to reveal - was sentenced to five years in jail in 2015 for drug dealing. Andrew says he was reaching crisis point as his release date neared - until Fulham's course came along. ""I love football, I play it all the time. At my age what a wonderful opportunity, because I couldn't think of a job I could see myself fitting into at this time of my life,"" he says. ""I'm not really that good at anything. I've got no qualifications. I couldn't see myself sitting in an office. This course was brilliant."" Can prison yoga help tackle reoffending? 'Don't release prisoners on Fridays' Andrew has a coaching role lined up once he has recovered from a stomach operation - and a chance of a career for the first time in his life. He's also formed lasting relationships with the club staff, like employability officer Jim Hart, who keep him motivated. He's currently learning about the business side of running a football club and will start his level two coaching course in January. All of which Andrew is hoping will help him towards his dream of opening a soccer school. Ex-Arsenal vice chairman David Dein says he's confident his project will work It's opportunities like this that former FA and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein is hoping can become the norm. He's the man behind a new initiative - the Twinning Project - to pair every professional football club with their local prison to reduce reoffending by delivering coaching and refereeing courses. At present, Dein says the offering is ""patchy"", but he wants to get at least 20 clubs signed up by the end of the year. He's spoken to offenders in 106 jails and says: ""In those prisons I've seen some stark stories where the prisoners are in a cell for 16 hours a day - there's low self esteem. ""Sport has got a big part to play."" Dein, 75, who spent four decades at the top of the game, believes his initiative will save the taxpayer Â£700,000 if just 20 offenders are rehabilitated.

Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright, who spent two weeks in prison for a motoring offence, is fully behind the project.

UK village used in 'appalling' US advert,"An image of Jaywick Sands was used to create a campaign advert for Dr Nick Stella A United States congressional candidate has used a picture of a British seaside village to show what could happen if voters do not back President Trump. An advert used an image of Jaywick Sands, near Clacton in Essex, to attack Nick Stella's Democrat opponent. The campaign picture, which showed an unpaved road and rundown homes, said: ""Help President Trump keep America on track and thriving."" It has received angry criticism from locals and Tendring District Council. Republican Dr Stella is standing in the 11th Illinois congressional district in the US mid-term elections against Bill Foster. The advert, which was shared on Dr Stella's campaign Facebook page, showed a billboard congratulating Congress speaker Nancy Pelosi and a message saying: ""A vote for Foster is a vote for a speaker Pelosi. We can't go back to foreclosures, unemployment and economic recession."" Jaywick has undergone a Â£6.5m programme of improvements Jaywick was the most deprived neighbourhood in England in 2010 and 2015, according to the government'sdeprivation index,external. Since then Essex County Council has completed a Â£6.5m programme to improve the roads and drainage. Paul Honeywood, Tendring District Council Cabinet Member with special responsibility for Jaywick, said it was appalling to use the old image for political gain and said the village was on the up. He said: ""I know that many Jaywick Sands residents will be outraged at being smeared in this way, and rightly so."" Jaywick was the most deprived area in England, according to the government's deprivation index in 2015 Penelope Read, who filmed a documentary called Jaywick: A Diamond in the Rough in 2016, said she was angry at the use of the village and said she would happily show Dr Stella the real Jaywick if he visited. She said: ""In the last couple of years since we did the documentary the council has tried really hard to improve things. Jaywick is starting to really go forward and it makes me really cross when it gets this bad publicity. ""Of course there are things that are wrong currently but they are being improved."" Dr Stella's campaign director of operations Raquel Mitchell said it had never been their intent to smear the town, which they did not name. She said: ""We have learned, and it is great to know, the town pictured has recovered from economic hardship. ""Let it serve as an an example of how government responding to the needs of the people can overcome hardship. May those days remain well behind us. ""I'm sure Jaywick Sands is charming.

Teachers sent home over unruly pupils row,"The teachers were sent home from the Kaimes School in Liberton Teachers at a school in Edinburgh have been sent home without pay after refusing to teach pupils they claim are violent and abusive. A union has accused the city council of ""bullying and intimidating"" staff at Kaimes School in Liberton, a school for children with additional support needs. Eleven teachers have refused to give lessons to eight pupils following physical and verbal assaults. The council said it was wrong for staff to pick and choose who to teach. The teachers are members of the NASUWT union, which earlier this year balloted for industrial action short of a strike by refusing to teach or supervise eight pupils who they believe pose a risk to health, safety and welfare. Violent attacks are understood to have included chairs and signs thrown at teachers, causing injuries with police called in on some occasions. The special school provides education for primary and secondary aged pupils who require support associated with autism. It has six primary classes, 10 secondary groups and has more than 80 staff. On average there are about six pupils per class. ""They refused to teach them because they had been assaulted so many times"", said a source at the school. ""There's just no control."" The eight students are understood to have spent last week in a class together with seven pupil support assistants. ""This is the first time this has ever happened in Scotland. A teacher has refused to teach one kid before but never eight,"" the source added. ""The assistants with the eight kids last week were just trying to keep them apart and stop them fighting. They were just running around the school swearing - it was just chaos."" Union officials are to meet Education Secretary John Swinney later to discuss the situation, after negotiations with the council broke down. NASUWT general secretary, Chris Keates, criticised the council's decision to send the teachers home The council, however, insisted action was being taken to support staff at the school and said it was not acceptable for teachers to refuse to teach certain individuals. A spokesman said: ""An improvement action plan for Kaimes School has been developed in consultation with staff and subject to external expert scrutiny. ""This is in the very early stages of being implemented and would urge everyone to work with us as we take this plan forward. ""The council has been trying to engage with NASUWT at all levels to discuss any concerns they have and we are disappointed that they have failed to respond positively to date and decided on this course of action. ""We cannot have a situation where staff decide who they are and who they are not willing to teach as this would be contrary to their terms of employment. ""We remain committed to working with staff to ensure we improve attainment and well-being while also delivering a positive working environment for both teachers and pupils."" The council is urging the union to negotiate a solution, and has written to parents to update them on the situation. Chris Keates, NASUWT general secretary, criticised the council's decision to send the teachers home, and accused the authority of failing in its ""duty of care"" to staff. She said: ""The teachers, and indeed other pupils at the school have, month after month, faced violent physical assaults, a constant stream of verbal abuse and threats and malicious allegations. Equipment has been smashed and classrooms trashed. ""Rather than supporting the teachers to deal with these pupils, City of Edinburgh Council instead has embarked on a campaign of aggressive and punitive actions towards the teachers, simply because they have dared to stand up for what is right. ""The council has sought to bully and intimidate the teachers in a meeting, has stopped all their salary and, despite the fact they are turning up to work each day willing and ready, not only to take their timetabled classes and teach the overwhelming majority of the pupils, but also to provide appropriate work for the eight pupils. ""They have been refused entry to their classrooms and told to leave the school premises."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The situation at Kaimes School is a matter that can best be resolved by discussions between the City of Edinburgh council and NASUWT and we encourage both parties to negotiate a solution as soon as possible to allow the pupils education to continue.""

Start-up beats Samsung to bendy-screen phone,"Royole showed off its flexible phone at a trade event in China A little-known California-based company has laid claim to creating the ""world's first foldable phone"". Royole Corporation - a specialist in manufacturing flexible displays -unveiled the FlexPai handset,externalat an event in Beijing. When opened, the device presents a single display measuring 7.8in (19.8cm) - bigger than many tablets. But when folded up, it presents three separate smaller screens - on the front, rear and spine of the device. The six-year-old companysaid it would hold three ""flash sales"",externalto consumers in China on 1 November to offer the first product run. The firm says that when folded the spine of the device will be used to show notifications The phones will be priced between 8,999 and 12,999 yuan ($1,290 to $1,863; Â£1,011 to Â£1,460) depending on the memory and storage specifications selected. In addition, Royole said it would also offer a slightly different version of the devices to developers across the world the same day. It intends to start deliveries,externalin ""late December"". The launch has caught many industry watchers by surprise. It was widely believed Samsung or Huawei would be the first to sell such a device to the public. Samsung was expected to preview its efforts at an event in San Francisco on 7 November, but is not understood to be ready to put a product on sale. The handset is powered by Water OS - a variant of Android Venturebeat reporter Evan Blasshas also claimed LG intends to unveil a foldable phone of its own,externalat the CES trade show in January. Videos posted to social media of the FlexPai in action, however, indicate the version of Android they run still needs some work. In particular, the display is shown to flick between different orientations after being switched from one mode to another before settling. Purchasers will also need to be mindful that the device weighs 320g - more than 50% more than the iPhone XS Max or Galaxy Note 9. Huawei promises foldable phone within a year Samsung: Time for folding smartphones Why do smartphones look so alike? However, Royole says the FlexPai has been tested to withstand more than 200,000 open-and-shut movements, meaning it should offer many years of use before the action damages the picture.

One expert said the smartphone was unlikely to become a bestseller but was impressive nonetheless. ""Royole gets the bragging rights to being first, and it's quite astonishing that someone you've never heard of is doing this,"" said Carolina Milanesi, from the Creative Strategies consultancy. ""What's great is that it's putting this into the hands of developers, who will be able to start the legwork that will result in apps for flexible devices that will eventually be sold by Samsung and whoever else. ""You need developers to think through how they can best take advantage of screens that double in size."" She added that Royole might ultimately become an acquisition target for one of the mainstream consumer electronics brands. Royole designs its own flexible sensors and displays Another company-watcher added that he doubted the FlexPai would ever be produced in large numbers. ""Royole has carried out several publicity stunts over the years to showcase its flexible OLED [organic light-emitting diode] displays,"" said Dr Guillaume Chansin from Irimitech Consulting. ""The FlexPai is probably another stunt. ""Royole is building its first OLED factory and it is now trying to compete directly with other display manufacturers such as Samsung and LG.""

Crash helicopter 'spun' after take-off,"This video can not be played The widely shared footage shows the helicopter taking off Video footage of the helicopter carrying the Leicester City owner shows it spinning moments before it crashed killing him and four others. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died along with two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger in the crash outside the King Power Stadium. The video shows the aircraft going into a spin, which experts said suggests a problem with the tail rotor. Investigators would not comment on the video or causes of Saturday's crash. The widely shared footage, taken inside the stadium, shows the AgustaWestland AW169 climbing normally for about 40 seconds, before it pauses and goes into a downward spin. Mr Vichai, a Thai billionaire, regularly flew in and out of the stadium on match days Aviation expert David Learmount said the video showed the aircraft completed an ""awkward"" take-off without issue before getting into difficulty. ""At lift-off you can't see anything that's abnormal, but it's an awkward job climbing out of a stadium because ideally you want some forward speed as well as continuing to climb,"" Mr Learmount said. ""The pilot climbed very nearly vertically until he was above the height of the stadium and then started to turn to the right - it was very shortly after that control was lost. ""Just after he did a manoeuvre that seemed to be intended, he lost control."" Leicester City owner's son 'proud of dad' A tragic end to Leicester City's fairytale Who were the victims? Mr Learmount said if the tail rotor was the problem, the pilot's options were limited to simply shutting power off to the rotors. ""That leaves you with no power - if you have no power you have to go down,"" he said. ""This action - bringing both rotors back to idle - has to be done incredibly quickly. ""If you shut the power down rapidly enough, you can keep the rotor spinning and that effectively puts the helicopter into a glide. ""If you've already started spinning, trying to do all of this is very nearly impossible."" All five occupants of the helicopter were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. As well as Mr Vichai, Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, and pilots and partners Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz also died. Police have said Ms Lechowicz was a passenger at the time of the crash. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger were killed when the aircraft spiralled out of control and crashed in a fireball The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is already examining the flight recorders, which were retrieved the day after the crash. It said it was ""too early"" to comment on the video or the possible causes of the crash and said it ""will consider a wealth of evidence, and the video is just one element"". A spokesperson for Leonardo, the Italian company which manufacturers the AW169, said it was working closely with the AAIB and British authorities. So far it has not issued any new safety advice relating to the AW169 in light of the crash. On Wednesday, coroners for Leicester said formal identification of 60-year-old Mr Vichai had taken place, along with 32-year-old Ms Nusara, 46-year-old Ms Lechowicz and 53-year-old Mr Swaffer. Identification of the fifth victim was still in progress and no date for inquests have been set yet, police said. This video can not be played Leicester City fans gather to pay tribute to owner Striker Jamie Vardy, his wife Rebekah and club ambassador Alan Birchenall lay their own tributes at the memorial outside the stadium A huge display of floral and footballing tributes have been left outside the stadium and a steady stream of people have signed a book of condolence since it opened on Tuesday. Families of those who died, players and members of the wider Leicester community have also visited the scene. A minute's silence will be held and black armbands will be worn by players at all Premier League matches this weekend as a mark of respect, the Premier League has confirmed. Leicester players will also travel by road to their game at Cardiff on Saturday rather than fly, as it was felt insensitive to go by plane given the circumstances of Mr Vichai's death.

Vegan freelancer: We're not snowflakes,"William Sitwell has apologised for any offence caused The journalist who was sent an email by the editor of Waitrose Food magazine suggesting she write about ""killing vegans"" has hit back. Selene Nelson said vegans were not ""snowflakes"",,externalbut were people trying to live in a ""moral"" way. She said those who argued that William Sitwell - who has since resigned - was only joking were missing the point. The real issue, she said, was ""why it's accepted or considered funny to speak to vegans with hostility and anger"". Sitwell, also a critic on Masterchef, has apologised for any offence caused by an ""ill-judged joke"". He said he loved and respected ""people of all appetites, be they vegan, vegetarian or meat eaters"". Vegan journalist gets 'murderous' response Will going vegan make you healthier? Is being a vegan better for the environment? Vegans eat a plant-based diet, meaning they avoid all animal products such as meat, dairy, eggs and honey, and refuse to use materials derived from animals like leather. Ms Nelson had pitched ideas to Sitwell on ""healthy, eco-friendly meals"" as the ""popularity of the movement is likely to continue to skyrocket"". Sitwell had emailed back 10 minutes later, saying: ""Thanks for this. How about a series on killing vegans, one by one. Ways to trap them? How to interrogate them properly? Expose their hypocrisy? Force-feed them meat?"" Writing for the Independent, Ms Nelson said she couldn't comment on the precise circumstances of his departure from the magazine, but his response to her was a ""shock"" and ""speaks to a wider problem"". ""Vegans are often criticised for being dogmatic, militant, too extreme or unnecessarily antagonistic,"" she said. ""But if this disappointing exchange exposes anything, it's the belligerent attitude that, sadly, many vegans experience every day, simply for trying to make a positive lifestyle change. ""Vegans are not 'snowflakes'. Perhaps the real 'snowflakes', if we insist upon using this term, are those who become defensive and abusive when anyone dares question the status quo."" Sitwell has received support from fellow journalists, including Guardian writer Hadley Freeman. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Waitrose Food editor quits over vegan row,"The editor of Waitrose Food magazine, William Sitwell, is standing down with immediate effect after suggesting a series on ""killing vegans, one by one"". He was responding to an email pitch from freelance journalist Selene Nelson who had suggested features on plant-based recipes. Sitwell, also a critic on Masterchef, apologised for any offence caused.

Channel 4 chooses Leeds for new HQ,"Channel 4 said Leeds put forward an ""ambitious strategy"" Channel 4 will set up a new national HQ in Leeds in an attempt to boost the way it reflects life outside London. The broadcaster will keep another headquarters in the capital, but will move roughly 200 of its 800 staff to the West Yorkshire city. Leeds was chosen above Birmingham and Greater Manchester, which were also on the shortlist. The channel has also announced it will open ""creative hubs"" in Bristol and Glasgow, with around 50 staff in each. It's all part of a plan to increase the amount Channel 4 spends on programmes outside London by Â£250m over the next five years. That means half of its programme budget will be spent outside the capital by 2023, up from 35% currently. Tom Riordan, chief executive of Leeds City Council, said it was ""the best news"".

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the decision to house one of the creative hubs in Glasgow was ""fantastic news for Scotland's screen sector and creative industries"". Mayor of BristolMarvin Rees tweeted,externalthat he is looking forward to working with Channel 4 in ""our creative, innovative city"". All three new sites will house ""key creative decision-makers"", including programme commissioners who will have responsibility ""for some of Channel 4's biggest shows and who oversee significant spend"". The new national HQ will regularly host executive and board meetings, and will be home to a ""digital creative unit"" to make material for online platforms and social media. Channel 4 News will also open three new bureaux outside London, including one in Leeds. Writer Kay Mellor said Leeds was ""the perfect fit"" for Channel 4 The city was the home of Channel 4's Countdown for 27 years until 2009 Other C4 shows made in the region include Educating Yorkshire (in nearby Dewsbury) and the Red Riding trilogy Over on ITV, the city has been home to Emmerdale since the soap began in 1972 Screenwriter Kay Mellor's production company is based there, and she has set dramas including Fat Friends, The Syndicate and Love, Lies and Records in her home city Mellor saidthe move was a ""game changer""that would put the city ""firmly on the media map"". She said: ""Leeds is the perfect fit in terms of location and talent and we'll all be there with open arms to welcome them to our wonderful city."" Channel 4 said Leeds had put forward an ""ambitious strategy"" to support growth in the creative industries and ""to nurture new talent from diverse backgrounds - in the region and across the UK"". Chris Curtis, editor of trade publication Broadcast, said the difference it will make on screen will depend on which staff move to the new hubs, and how much power they have. ""They have talked about moving creative decision-makers out of London but there's still a sense that the big creative decisions will still be taken in the London HQ,"" he told BBC News. The broadcaster will keep its London HQ on Horseferry Road ""Which roles move, the level of seniority of those roles, and how much autonomy those people are given are yet to be determined, and they will have an influence on Channel 4's output. ""But I don't believe C4 are just paying lip service - they genuinely want it to be a success."" Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon said she wanted to open the publicly-owned company up to ""people from across the UK and supercharge the impact we have in all parts of the country"". She said: ""Locating our national HQ in Leeds enables us to capitalise on a strong and fast-growing independent production sector in cities across the north of England - and also has the potential to unlock growth in the north-east and east of the country, an area without a major presence from other national broadcasters."" Sally Joynson, chief executive of Screen Yorkshire, said the move would be ""transformational"" for the TV industry in the city and the north of England. The move has come about after pressure from the government to boost the broadcaster's presence outside London. The Conservative Party put a relocation in its 2017 general election manifesto, and pushed for a full move. But Channel 4 chairman Charles Gurassawarned,externalthat a full or substantial relocation would cause ""significant difficulties and problems"". It has now settled on a compromise that will send almost 40% of jobs out of the capital. After Wednesday's announcement, culture secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The government made clear that Channel 4 needed to do more to increase its presence in the regions to help better reflect and provide for UK audiences outside of London. ""Congratulations to Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow, and I look forward to Channel 4 taking further steps to increase its impact around the UK in the years ahead.""

The paralysed man who can ride a bike,"This video can not be played Darek learns to cycle again A man who was paralysed from the chest down after a knife attack in 2010 can now ride an adapted tricycle. In 2014, surgeons in Polandannouncedthey had reversed Darek Fidyka's paralysis using cells taken from his nose to repair his spinal cord. The former fireman says he has noticed a gradual return of feeling and muscle control below his injury. The surgical team are now launching a search for two more paralysed patients who they will try to help walk again. Mr Fidyka told me: ""I can tell that sensation is coming back and I am getting stronger.  A year ago I would not have been able to ride a tricycle.  Now I can feel each muscle and each press of the foot on the pedals."" TheBBC's Panoramatold the remarkable story of Darek Fidyka and the 40-year research programme involving scientists in Britain and Poland. The medical team are now launching the worldwide search as they are looking for patients with an uncommon type of injury, where the spinal cord has been completely severed, which can happen after a knife injury. The head of the project, surgeon Dr Pawel Tabakow said: ""If we can bridge the gap between two spinal cord stumps then there will be no doubt that our technique works and this will be historic - if we succeed we will have found a cure for paralysis. ""Then we will be able to help other patients with the most common type of injury, caused by a crush or compression."" How Darek Fidyka's spinal injury was repaired TheWroclaw Walk Again Project,externalwill be conducted in Poland, but patients anywhere in the world aged 16-65 will be able to apply via the team'swebsite,external, which will be officially launched on 8th March in Wroclaw. All the treatment will be free, but to be eligible patients must have no feeling or voluntary muscle function below the injury and they must be prepared to spend around three years in Poland. They will undergo extensive physiotherapy before and especially after the transplant surgery. The medical team are expecting to be inundated with applications in the months ahead. They will make an initial shortlist based on patient scans and medical notes and then invite a few potential volunteers for assessment in Poland. Those selected will undergo the same pioneering surgery that was performed on Darek Fidyka which was published inCell Transplantation.,external Scientists have spent decades searching for a means of enabling the paralysed to walk again.  Motorisedexoskeletons, which are strapped on the body, bypassing the injury, are now available commercially. Electrical stimulation techniquesuse implants to enable patients to flex their lower limbs.  But neither method involves repairing the damaged spinal cord. The approach in Poland aims to reconnect the brain with the lower limbs along the neural superhighway that is the spinal cord, enabling both motor control commands to travel down the body and sensation to travel up. Darek Fidyka's spinal cord had been almost completely severed as a result of a knife attack, apart from a thin thread of external connective tissue and prior to the transplant, he had no feeling or control below his injury. Now he has had to re-learn how to control his muscles and interpret sensations.  He said: ""I realise how important the brain is while cycling, and that thinking is more tiring than the exercise itself."" But the results from one patient, however impressive, would never be sufficient evidence on which to base a new approach to spinal cord injury. The forthcoming trial in Poland will be crucial if the wider scientific community is to be convinced that a patient's own cells can be used to regenerate their spinal cord. It is also worth stressing that the patients selected will have to show enormous determination if they are to see the full benefits of the treatment. In the first of two operations, surgeons will remove one of the patient's olfactory bulbs, which sit above the nasal cavity at the base of the brain, and process the sense of smell. The bulb contains specialist cells known as olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) which act as a pathway that enables nerve fibres in the olfactory system to continually renew. In a second operation the patient's OECs will be injected above and below the injury and strips of tissue laid across the gap in the cord. The team believe the OECs will enable nerve fibres to regenerate across the cord and so repair the damage. An independent team of assessors led by neurophysiologists from Imperial College London will also be closely involved in monitoring the research. Peter Ellaway, emeritus professor of physiology, at Imperial said: ""I'm excited because this is a novel treatment with a lot of promise."" But he cautioned that even if it works it would take some years to refine and so would not be immediately available for patients. The treatment in Poland will cost Â£250,000 per patient and is being funded by a small British charity, theNicholls Spinal Injury Foundation (NSIF).,external It was founded by chef David Nicholls after his 18-year-old son Daniel was paralysed from the neck down in a swimming accident. Mr Nicholls said: ""I know how important progress is to people living with spinal cord injury and am optimistic that success with the next two patients will result in an announcement that paralysis is curable."" Darek Fidyka still undergoes five hours of physiotherapy a day NSIF and theUK Stem Cell Foundation,externalboth support the research of Prof Geoff Raisman, chair of neural regeneration at University College London (UCL), who has pioneered the use of OECs to repair the damaged spinal cord and leads the British side of the Walk Again project. Prof Raisman said:  ""Darek's latest progress demonstrates the extraordinary power of (neuro) plasticity. But it depends on the patient's own efforts. It is like a baby learning to walk. We cannot teach it how. The progress comes from inside."" Darek underwent his transplant in April 2012, and he still spends five hours a day undergoing physiotherapy. He can now walk slowly using crutches or a small walking frame, but usually relies on a wheelchair as it is simply quicker and less tiring. The return of sensation below his injury has brought other benefits like bladder control and the return of sexual function. Darek was happy to discuss sex and explained that the reawakening of the erogenous zones was a crucial part of his recovery. He said: ""The return of sexual satisfaction - which travels along the spinal cord to the brain - is very important psychologically and is another part of my growing sense of independence.""

Turkey: Khashoggi was strangled immediately,"This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Turkey has given its first official statement on how it believes Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed, saying he was immediately strangled. The statement follows weeks of media reports about the murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. Turkey has yet to provide evidence. Chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan said meetings with his Saudi counterpart this week led to ""no concrete results"". Saudi Arabia has not commented on the meetings. The Turkish statement said: ""In accordance with plans made in advance, the victim, Jamal Khashoggi, was choked to death immediately after entering the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia."" His body was then dismembered and destroyed ""again, in line with advance plans"", it added. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who is the journalist that disappeared? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words Khashoggi, a Saudi national working for the US press, was a well-known critic of his home country's rulers. His body has not been found, but Turkey, the US and Saudi Arabia have all agreed that he was killed at the consulate. There is still no consensus on how he died. Turkey said it had put three main questions to the Saudis during the prosecutor's visit: Where is Khashoggi's body? Do they have any new information about the planning of the killing? Who was the ""local co-operator ""? An unnamed Saudi official previously told Reuters news agency that Khashoggi's body had been rolled in a rug and given to a ""local co-operator"", who disposed of it. On Wednesday, the delegation responded the questions in writing, according to Turkey. Saudi Arabia said the answers could only come from a joint investigation. It also noted that it had never given an official statement on the existence of a ""co-operator"". Turkey has steered away from publicly blaming Saudi Arabia for the killing. However, a senior spokesperson from the ruling AK Party said on Wednesday that it could not have been carried out without orders from someone in a senior position. Saudi Arabia denies its royal family was involved. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Saudi King Salman last week, and the two agreed to continue co-operating in the investigation. Unnamed Turkish officials have previously told media outlets that they had audio and visual evidence to prove their accounts of the writer's death, but nothing has been released. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" Turkish media have published details on how sources say Khashoggi was killed, including allegations he was tortured. His Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, gave a tearful interview to local television last week, saying she would never have let her partner enter the consulate if she had thought that the ""Saudi Arabia authorities would hatch a plot"" to kill him. He had entered the consulate to sort out documents for their marriage. Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb met Mr Fidan twice, visited the consulate and spoke with Turkey's intelligence agency during his visit to Istanbul this week. He flew back to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday without making an official statement. Saudi Arabia has changed its account of what happened to Khashoggi. When he first disappeared, it said Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive. It later admitted he had been murdered, saying the killing was premeditated and a result of a ""rogue operation"". This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Saudi Arabia has subsequently said that Khashoggi was murdered, and that it is ""determined to find out all the facts"". It has arrested 18 suspects, who, it says, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. Turkey wants the suspects to be extradited. Saudi Arabia has faced backlash over the death, including from its allies, who have called for answers. President Donald Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, he also said he was unwilling to sacrifice lucrative arms deals with the country. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? Meanwhile, US activists have launched a petition, calling for a section of road near the Saudi embassy in Washington to be renamed Jamal Khashoggi Way. On Wednesday, France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Khashoggi's death was a ""crime"" and ""odious"". He said France was not ""dependent on our economic relations with Saudi Arabia"" and the country would impose sanctions, but no details were given. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said it was an appalling act, adding thatit had ""possibly"" given the US and the UK a chance to put new pressure on Saudi Arabiaover other issues. Earlier in the day,the US called for a swift cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting local Houthi rebels. Khashoggi's fiancee on writer's death.

Paralysed men walk again with spinal implant,"Sebastian, Gertjan and David have all benefited from the work of Dr Courtine Three paralysed men, who were told they would spend the rest of their lives in a wheelchair, are able to walk again thanks to doctors in Switzerland. An electrical device inserted around the men's spines boosted signals from their brains to their legs. And it also helped damaged nerves in the spinal cord to regrow. The researchers hope that this unexpected bonus will enable some paralysed people ultimately to regain independent movement. BBC News has had exclusive access to the patients in the clinical trial, the results of which arepublished in the journal Nature,external. The first patient to be treated was 30-year-old Swiss man David M'zee, who suffered a severe spinal injury seven years ago in a sporting accident. David's doctor said he would never walk again. However, thanks to an electrical implant developed by a team at Ãcole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL), he can walk more than half a mile with the implant turned on. This video can not be played 'I always dreamed of walking again' As I strolled with him on a cloudless sunny day in the foothills of the Alps overlooking Lake Geneva, he told me how the ability to walk, albeit for short periods under controlled conditions, had changed his life. ""To me it means a lot. I'm surprised at what we have been able to do. I think you've got to try the impossible to make the possible possible. It's a lot of fun - it feels really good,"" he said. David comes across as an overwhelmingly positive person, but after his injury he had some dark moments. All attempts at rehabilitation had failed, so he agreed to take part in a trial led by Dr GrÃ©goire Courtine at EPFL. David told Dr Courtine's daughter that he would walk before her - and he did Dr Courtine recalls David's determination to succeed. ""I came with my daughter, Charlotte, who was one month old at the time. As we approached David, he looked her in the eye and said, 'I will walk before you'. ""When Charlotte took her first step she was 14 months old, by which time David was walking by Lake Geneva. ""He said to her, 'I have beaten you'."" To Dr Courtine's surprise, the spinal implant did more than enable David to walk. ""What was completely unexpected was the spinal cord repair that we observed. ""What we observed in animals is that it seems that the nerve fibres are regrowing and reconnecting the brain to the spinal cord,"" he said. The paralysed man who can ride a bike Spinal implant 'truly changed my life' 'Woman paralysed after being 'catapulted' off bed David had his implant surgically inserted by one of Switzerland's leading neurosurgeons, Dr Jocelyne Bloch, from Lausanne University Hospital. She told me that she was also astonished at David's improvement. David can now walk up to eight paces when his implant is turned off and this is the first time that this has been recorded in a chronic spinal injury. Out of the lab, in the real world, it is hard for David to walk more than a few paces. The signals from the implant soon become uncomfortable and so can't be used all the time. The system is also expensive and not reliable enough to be used outside of the laboratory for day-to-day use, so it's far from a cure. David is the first of three patients who have benefited from the first wave of the treatment. Two other men have also managed to walk again, to varying degrees. Three men have been helped by the system so far Gertjan Oskan, a 35-year-old engineer from the Netherlands, was knocked over by a car seven years ago. His doctors told him on his birthday that he would be paralysed for life. He is now beginning to regain some movement. Sebastian Tobler, a 48-year-old man from Germany, was a keen cyclist who loved being out in the countryside before he was knocked off his bike. Now he's back on a specially adapted bike that is powered mostly by his hands - but also partly by his legs. The researchers believe that their system will improve and restore some movement to people who had lost all hope of walking again. They plan to begin larger trials in Europe and the US in three years' time. If these go well, the researchers hope the system could become more widely available.

The Jamal Khashoggi story so far,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death On 2 October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's government, walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered. In the months that followed, conflicting narratives emerged over how he died, what happened to his remains, and who was responsible. Saudi officials said the journalist was killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom, while Turkish officials said the agents acted on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government. As a prominent Saudi journalist, he covered major stories, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, for various Saudi news organisations. For decades, the 59-year-old was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler. In his first column for the Post in September 2017, Khashoggi said he had feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Read excerpts from some of his columns This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi first visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 28 September 2018 to obtain a Saudi document stating that he was divorced, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz. But he was told he would have to return to pick up the document and arranged to come back on 2 October. ""He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil,"" Ms Cengiz wrote in the Post. Ms Cengiz accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate on 2 October. He was last seen on CCTV footage entering the building at 13:14 local time. The journalist's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, waited for him outside the consulate for hours Despite reassuring friends that he would not face any problems inside, he gave Ms Cengiz two mobile phones and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not come back out. She ultimately waited for more than 10 hours outside the consulate and returned the following morning when Khashoggi had still not reappeared. For more than two weeks, Saudi Arabia consistently denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate. Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News that the journalist had left the consulate ""after a few minutes or one hour"". ""We have nothing to hide,"" he added. Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? But in a change of tune on 20 October, the Saudi government said a preliminary investigation by prosecutors had concluded that the journalist died during a ""fight"" after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. Later, a Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold. The Saudi consulate initially said Khashoggi had left after completing paperwork On 15 November, Saudi Arabia's deputy public prosecutor Shalaan al-Shalaan said the murder was ordered by the head of a ""negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul by the Saudi deputy intelligence chief to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom ""by means of persuasion"" or, if that failed, ""by force"". Investigators concluded that Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death, Mr Shalaan said. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the consulate for disposal, he added. Five individuals had confessed to the murder, Mr Shalaan asserted, adding: ""[The crown prince] did not have any knowledge about it."" The Saudi public prosecution said in late September 2018 that a total of 31 individuals were investigated over the killing and that 21 of them were arrested. Five senior government officials were also sacked, including Deputy Intelligence Chief Ahmad Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, a senior aide to Prince Mohammed. In January 2019, 11 individuals - who have not been named - were put on trial at the Riyadh Criminal Court in connection with Khashoggi's murder, and the public prosecutor sought the death penalty for five of them. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" Human Rights Watch said the trial, which took place behind closed doors, did not meet international standards and that authorities ""obstructed meaningful accountability"". In December 2019, the court sentenced five individuals to death for ""committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim"". Three others were handed prison sentences totalling 24 years for ""covering up this crime and violating the law"", while the remaining three were found not guilty. The public prosecution said Mr Asiri was tried but acquitted ""due to insufficient evidence"", while Mr Qahtani was investigated over the killing but not charged. At a news conference following the verdict, Shalaan al-Shalaan said the public prosecution's investigation had shown that ""the killing was not premeditated"". Ms Callamard dismissed that assertion as ""utterly ridiculous"" and said the trial represented ""the antithesis of justice"", from which the ""masterminds"" walked free. Khashoggi's son Salah met Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince weeks after the murder But Khashoggi's son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia, tweeted: ""We affirm our confidence in the Saudi judiciary at all levels, that it has been fair to us and that justice has been achieved."" In May 2020, Salah Khashoggi announced that he and his brothers were ""pardoning those who killed our father, seeking reward from God almighty"", accepting the public prosecution's contention that the murder was not premeditated. Four months later, the Riyadh Criminal Court commuted the death sentences handed to five of the defendants to 20 years in prison. The three others were given sentences of between seven and 10 years. The prosecution said the verdicts were final and that the criminal trial was now closed. Ms Cengiz said the ruling made ""a complete mockery of justice"". ""The Saudi authorities are closing the case without the world knowing the truth of who is responsible for Jamal's murder,"" she added. ""Who planned it, who ordered it, where is his body? These are the most basic and important questions that remain totally unanswered."" Turkish officials said that a team of 15 Saudi agents, assisted by three intelligence officers, arrived in Istanbul in the days before the murder, and that the group removed the security cameras and surveillance footage from the consulate before Khashoggi's arrival. Istanbul's chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said on 31 October 2018 that the journalist was suffocated almost as soon as entered the consulate, and that his body was dismembered and destroyed. Writing in the Washington Post on 2 November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared it had been established that Khashoggi ""was killed in cold blood by a death squad"" and ""that his murder was premeditated"". ""Yet there are other, no less significant questions whose answers will contribute to our understanding of this deplorable act"" he added. ""Where is Khashoggi's body? Who is the 'local collaborator' to whom Saudi officials claimed to have handed over Khashoggi's remains? Who gave the order to kill this kind soul? Unfortunately, the Saudi authorities have refused to answer those questions."" Mr Erdogan said he knew the order to kill Khashoggi ""came from the highest levels of the Saudi government"", but that he did ""not believe for a second that King Salman, the custodian of the holy mosques, ordered the hit"". In March 2020, the Istanbul chief prosecutor formally charged Saad al-Qahtani, Ahmad Asiri and 18 other Saudi nationals with murder. Prince Mohammed's two former aides were accused of ""instigating a premeditated murder with the intent of [causing] torment through fiendish instinct"". The others were charged with carrying out ""a premeditated murder with the intent of [causing] torment through fiendish instincts"". Saudi Arabia rejected Turkey's extradition request, so all 20 men were put on trial in absentia in Istanbul in July 2020. Court-appointed Turkish lawyers representing the defendants said their clients denied the charges. In November, the court accepted a second indictment adding another six Saudis to the case. A vice-consul and an attachÃ© were accused of ""premeditated murder with monstrous intent"". The four others were charged with destroying, concealing or tampering with evidence. A report released in June 2019 by Agnes Callamard, the special rapporteur, concluded that Khashoggi's death ""constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible"". She also found there was ""credible evidence"" to warrant an investigation into Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials, and said the prince should be subject to the targeted sanctions already imposed by some UN member states against other named individuals allegedly involved in the killing. Ms Callamard said both the investigations into Khashoggi's death by Saudi Arabia and Turkey ""failed to meet international standards"". This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" She called for the trial in Saudi Arabia of the 11 suspects to be suspended, saying it would ""not deliver credible accountability"". ""The trial is held behind closed doors; the identity of those charged has not been released nor is the identity of those facing the death penalty. At the time of writing, at least one of those identified as responsible for the planning and organising of the execution of Mr Khashoggi has not been charged,"" she noted. The Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, rejected the report, tweeting that it was ""nothing new"" and contained ""clear contradictions and baseless allegations which challenge its credibility"". ""The Saudi judiciary is the sole party qualified to deal with the Khashoggi case and works with full independence,"" he added. Saudi prince 'may be liable for Khashoggi death' In mid-November 2018, Turkey's government said it had shared audio recordings of the killing with Saudi Arabia, the US, the UK, Germany and France. While not officially made public, details of the recordings were included in Ms Callamard's report. The UN special rapporteur noted that she was not able to obtain copies of the recordings from Turkish intelligence or authenticate them. This video can not be played The Jamal Khashoggi secret tapes explained But in one recording, her report says, two Saudi officials are apparently heard discussing how to cut up and transport Khashoggi's body just minutes before the journalist entered the consulate. One is quoted as saying: ""The body is heavy. First time I cut on the ground. If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished."" At the end of the conversation, the other asks whether ""the sacrificial animal"" has arrived. A later conversation recorded inside the consul general's office purportedly features Khashoggi being told by officials: ""We will have to take you back. There is an order from Interpol. Interpol requested you to be sent back. We are coming to get you."" The reports quotes Khashoggi as replying that ""there isn't a case against me. I notified some people outside; they are waiting for me; a driver is waiting for me."" At 13:33 local time, he is heard saying: ""There is a towel here. Are you going to give me drugs?"" Someone responds: ""We will anaesthetise you."" The report says the conversation was followed by sounds of a struggle, during which people are heard saying, ""Did he sleep?"", ""He raises his head,"" and ""Keep pushing."" Later, there are sounds of movement, heavy panting, and plastic sheets. Turkish intelligence identified the sound of a saw at 13:39, but Ms Callamard said she and her delegation could not make out the sources of the sounds they heard. Investigators searched Belgrad forest for Khashoggi's body Assessments of the recordings by intelligence officers in Turkey and other countries suggest Khashoggi could have been injected with a sedative and then suffocated using a plastic bag, according to the special rapporteur. Turkish officials were not granted access to the Saudi consulate for DNA testing until more than two weeks after the incident. The special rapporteur said there was credible evidence that crime scenes had been ""thoroughly, even forensically, cleaned"" before investigators arrived. Among the areas searched for Khashoggi's remains are the Belgrad forest, which a consular attachÃ© visited on 1 October 2018, and the coastal town of Yalova, the location of a farmhouse allegedly owned by a Saudi national. None of those put on trial have been identified by Saudi prosecutors, but the report by the UN special rapporteur named them, citing information from ""various governments' sources"". According to the report, the five facing the death penalty were Fahad Shabib Albalawi; Turki Muserref Alshehri; Waleed Abdullah Alshehri; Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, an intelligence officer who the US says worked for the crowd prince's aide Saud al-Qahtani; and Dr Salah Mohammed Tubaigy, a forensic doctor with the interior ministry. The other six defendants were Mansour Othman Abahussain; Mohammed Saad Alzahrani; Mustafa Mohammed Almadani; Saif Saad Alqahtani; Muflih Shaya Almuslih, reportedly a member of the consulate staff; and Ahmad Asiri, the former deputy intelligence chief. According to interviews conducted by the special rapporteur, the defendants' lawyers argued during a court hearing in January that they were ""state employees and could not object to the orders of their superiors"". Turkish officials identified these men as Saudis suspected of involvement in Khashoggi's murder Three defendants allegedly said that Khashoggi ""started screaming, so they covered his mouth to prevent him from making noise, which accidentally killed him"", according to the report. Ms Callamard noted that she had heard no screaming in the audio recordings from the consulate. Mr Asiri was cited as telling the court that he had ""never ordered the use of force"" to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. Nine of the defendants named by Ms Callamard were previously identified by Turkish officials as members of the 15-strong team of agents sent to Istanbul. Most of the agents arrived at and departed from the city's airport by private or commercial jet the same day as Khashoggi's killing. CCTV footage appears to show vehicles driving them to the consulate, and two hours after Khashoggi's arrival, some of them heading to the consul's residence. The special rapporteur said three men were filmed entering the residence with what seemed like plastic trash bags, and at least one rolling suitcase. Khashoggi's killing was internationally condemned and caused a diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and some of its closest allies, including the US. After the murder was confirmed by the Saudis, then US President Donald Trump described it as the ""worst cover-up in history"". However, he defended US ties to the kingdom, a key trading partner. Analysing Trump's Saudi statement line by line Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West This response was widely derided by senators in Congress, who pointed the finger at Prince Mohammed. According to US media reports, the CIA - whose director heard the consulate audio recordings - concluded with ""medium to high confidence"" that Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi's killing. Mr Trump denied that and his administration defied a legal requirement to release an unclassified report identifying anyone implicated in ""the directing, ordering or tampering of evidence"" in the case. His successor, Joe Biden, has said he will declassify the report. The US, Canada, France and the UK all levied sanctions against 18 Saudis allegedly linked to the killing. The Saudi crown prince was not among them. Germany, Finland and Denmark were among the European nations to cancel arms deals with Saudi Arabia after the killing.

Pakistan Christian cleared of blasphemy,"This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row A Pakistani court has overturned the death sentence of a Christian woman convicted of blasphemy, a case that has polarised the nation. Asia Bibi was convicted in 2010 after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a row with her neighbours. She always maintained her innocence, but has spent most of the past eight years in solitary confinement. The landmark ruling has already set off violent protests by hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws. Demonstrations against the verdict are being held in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Multan. Clashes with police have been reported. The Red Zone in the capital Islamabad, where the Supreme Court is located, has been sealed off by police, and paramilitary forces have been deployed to keep protesters away from the court. Demonstrations have been held in several cities including Peshawar Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, who read out the ruling, said Asia Bibi could walk free from jail in Sheikupura, near Lahore, immediately if not wanted in connection with any other case. She was not in court to hear the ruling, but reacted to the verdict from prison with apparent disbelief. ""I can't believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really?"" AFP news agency quoted her as saying by phone. Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Asia Bibi and a lonely Christmas in a prison cell The Muslims building a Christian church in Pakistan The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made three offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. By Secunder Kermani, BBC News, Islamabad The court delivered its verdict quickly, no doubt aware of the sensitivity of the case and the danger of a violent reaction to it. Asia Bibi's lawyer, closely flanked by a policeman, told me he was ""happy"" with the verdict, but also afraid for his and his client's safety. Even after she is freed, the legacy of her case will continue. Shortly after her conviction a prominent politician,Punjab Governor Salman Taseer, was murdered for speaking out in her supportand calling for the blasphemy laws to be reformed. The killer - Mumtaz Qadri - was executed, but has become a cult hero with a large shrine dedicated to him on the outskirts of Islamabad. His supporters also created a political party - campaigning to preserve the blasphemy laws - which gathered around two million votes in this year's general election. It's the same party which many fear could be responsible for violent unrest in the coming days. Laws enacted by the British Raj in 1860 made it a crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship, punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Several more clauses were added in the 1980s by Pakistan's military ruler Gen Zia ul-Haq: 1980 - up to three years in jail for derogatory remarks against Islamic personages 1982 - life imprisonment for ""wilful"" desecration of the Koran 1986 - ""death, or imprisonment for life"" for blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws? The judges said the prosecution had ""categorically failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"". The case was based on flimsy evidence, they said, and proper procedures had not been followed. The alleged confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". The ruling heavily referenced the Koran and Islamic history.,externalIt ended with a quote from the Hadith, the collected sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, which calls for non-Muslims to be treated kindly. Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hardline politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemers in Pakistan The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Many of the attacks are motivated by blasphemy cases, but others have come in reaction to the US-led war in Afghanistan. No-one has ever been executed under the laws, but some people accused of the offence have been lynched or murdered. Asia Bibi, who was born in 1971 and has four children, was the first woman to be sentenced to death under the laws. Salman Taseer had taken up Asia Bibi's cause and called for reform of the blasphemy laws Internationally, her conviction has been widely condemned as a breach of human rights. There are fears that there could be a violent response to her acquittal. Asia Bibi's husband and daughter say they fear for their safety in Pakistan As with her previous trials and appeals, large crowds gathered outside the court in Islamabad on Wednesday demanding her conviction be upheld and the execution carried out. She has been offered asylum by several countries and is expected to leave the country. Her daughter, Eisham Ashiq, had previously told the AFP news agency that if she were released: ""I will hug her and will cry meeting her and will thank God that he has got her released."" But the family said they feared for their safety and would likely have to leave Pakistan. Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

Indonesia plane search 'detects black box',"This video can not be played Debris found from Lion Air crash in sea A signal from the black box of the Lion Air plane which crashed on Monday with 189 people on board has been located, Indonesian rescuers believe. Indonesia's military chief said divers were trying to check the location some 30-40m (100-130ft) down in the Java Sea but had to battle strong currents. Flight JT610, a Boeing 737, went down shortly after take-off from Jakarta. No survivors have been found. Meanwhile Lion Air has sacked its technical director. The company said its dismissal of Muhammad Asif had come on the orders of the transport ministry. Representatives from Boeing are meeting Indonesian officials on Wednesday as part of the investigation. How could a brand new plane crash? Mourning siblings and mystery couple on ill-fated plane How likely are you to survive a plane crash? Air disasters timeline There is no indication so far of what caused the plane to go down 13 minutes after taking off, thougha log obtained by the BBCshowed the plane had encountered technical problems while flying from Bali to Jakarta the previous day. Search teams have been using an underwater drone, as well as underwater ""pinger locators"", to try to pick up the sonar signals from the flight recorders. On Wednesday, armed forces head Hadi Tjahjanto said rescuers believed a ""ping"" first detected the previous day came from one of the recorders. He said divers had tried to retrieve it and would make fresh attempts shortly. ""I am sure we will find a black box given the strong indication, and, not far from there, the main body of the plane,"" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. Indonesian officials shared technical maps of the area being searched Efforts to find parts of the plane have been hampered by strong currents and the presence of oil and gas pipelines in the vicinity, said search and rescue agency chief Muhammed Syaugi. He added that, if found, the plane's main fuselage would be lifted by crane. A large number of bodies was expected to be trapped inside, he said. Body parts, debris and personal belongings have already been collected from the water, and body bags are being taken to Jakarta for identification. Flight JT610 was heading for the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down. Officials say the pilot of the Boeing 737 had asked to return to Soekarno-Hatta airport shortly before losing contact with air traffic control. The cause of the crash is not known, although a technical log from the plane's previous flight on Sunday showed one instrument was giving ""unreliable"" airspeed readings and the captain had to hand over to the first officer. Altitude readings also differed on the captain and first officer's instruments. Lion Air chief executive Edward Sirait said on Tuesday that the plane had had technical problems, but had been repaired before being allowed to fly again. Indonesia, a vast archipelago, is heavily reliant on air travel but many of its airlines have a poor safety record. The country has had issues of safety and poor management in the past and its airlines were banned from flying into European airspace until 2016.

Raab 'expects Brexit deal by 21 November',"The Brexit secretary expects to be able to answer MPs' questions on 21 November Dominic Raab has suggested he expects a deal on the UK's exit from the EU to be agreed within three weeks. The Brexit secretary told a committee of MPs he was happy to appear before them to give evidence ""when a deal is finalised"" and ""currently expected 21 November to be suitable"". However, Mr Raab's own department later clarified that there was ""no set date for the negotiations to conclude"". November 21 was the date offered by the committee's chairman, it added. Meanwhile, Ireland's foreign minister has said it is up to the UK to ""intensify"" talks. Simon Coveney, who met Mr Raab on Tuesday evening, said time was short and while an overall deal was possible within three weeks, it had to take shape soon. What's the latest on the Brexit deal talks? The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The two sides want an agreement on the details of the UK's withdrawal and an outline plan for their future relations before the end of the year, to give the UK and EU Parliaments enough time to vote on it. But the talks have stalled over how to prevent the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Plans for a special summit in mid-November to seal the withdrawal agreement were put on hold after insufficient progress was made at a meeting of EU leaders earlier this month. Technical discussions continue to try to find a way ahead. In his letter to the Brexit committee chairman, Labour MP Hilary Benn, on 24 October, Mr Raab struck an upbeat tone. He said the end of the negotiations was ""firmly in sight and while obstacles remain it cannot be beyond us to navigate them"". Despite differences over Northern Ireland, he said the two sides were ""not far"" from agreement over the terms of the so-called ""backstop"", which could see the whole of the UK remain in a temporary customs arrangement with the EU until their future relationship was settled. ""An agreement on the details of that backstop should be possible,"" Mr Raab wrote. ""We have resolved most of the issues and we are building up together what the future relationship should look like and making real progress,"" he added. Officials in the Brexit department said concluding a deal by the middle of next month remained an aspiration and there had been no major breakthrough in recent days. In response to Mr Raab's letter, Downing Street said ""we are working to achieve a deal as soon as possible"".

Toilet roll donated to school due to cuts,"This video can not be played School principal Graham Gault criticises local politicians for playing ""pathetic games"" Parents are ""donating toilet roll"" to a primary school due to budget cuts, a committee of MPs has heard. Maghaberry Primary School principal Graham Gault was speaking at a Northern Ireland Affairs committee hearing into education funding. Politicians were playing ""pathetic games"" while pupils needed help, the County Antrim school's principal said. Dr Gault was one of four local principals giving evidence to the committee in Westminster on Wednesday. Parents asked to pay for pencils and paper Education system 'under major strain' Schools body criticised for overspend He told MPs that although Maghaberry was a popular and sustainable school, it would have a six-figure budget deficit by the end of the financial year. ""I've actually found myself in the humiliating position of begging my parents to support the wellbeing of their children by providing Pritt Stick, reading books, tissues and soap,"" he said. ""I actually have parents - and this isn't a joke - who are donating toilet roll to my school. ""It feels Victorian - it's a disgrace."" Later, in response to a question from North Down MP Lady Sylvia Hermon on the impact of the lack of a functioning assembly, Dr Gault launched a stinging attack on local politicians. ""I lament when I see the children in my school and look at the level of need, that the level of political discourse that I look at back home is like something I wouldn't accept in my playground,"" he said. ""My children beg for a field of politics that is based around integrity, honesty and authenticity and looks at their needs rather than the needs of party politics and petty squabbles. ""There's no more time for our politicians to play pathetic games; my children need their help right now."" Dr Gault was speaking alongside Deirdre Gillespie of St Mary's Grammar School in Magherafelt, Nigel Frith of Drumragh Integrated College in Omagh and Jo McColgan of Ashfield Boys' School in east Belfast. Mr Frith told the committee that the mental health of both teachers and pupils was being affected by financial pressures and a lack of resources. ""There is an epidemic of mental health problems in our schools, which is nowhere near being addressed effectively,"" he said. ""My central role as a principal has become trying to scan across the school in a daily basis to see who's ok and who's not ok and to try and get to the ones who are not ok before they fall."" DUP MP Jim Shannon said that, as a school governor, he knew there were enormous pressures in meeting special educational needs (SEN) and mental health needs. ""There is an epidemic of mental health problems in our schools"" - Nigel Firth, Drumragh Integrated College principal In response, Ms Gillespie said her school had a 110% increase in the number of pupils with SEN over the past five years, while all of the principals said they were seeing increasing numbers of pupils with SEN. Ms Gillespie also said there were too many schools in Northern Ireland and too little reform. ""What we have is a fragmented system of education in Northern Ireland, which is far too costly,"" she said. ""We've got five competing sectors, we've got duplication across the sectors - we've got lack of co-operation and lack of co-ordination, and it's leading to this pressure pot of an unsustainable system. ""We have far too many schools in Northern Ireland, and we're not able to release the money that we need for viable schools because we haven't tackled the elephant in the room."" The committee is due to hear more oral evidence over the coming months, but while they will eventually produce recommendations they cannot compel any additional funding. The Education Authority had previously told the committee thatschools in Northern Ireland were set to overspend their budgets by about Â£33min 2018/19.

France investigates babies missing limbs,"A cluster of birth defect cases was initially dismissed, but several more have now emerged France has launched a national investigation into the number of babies being born with missing arms or hands - weeks after an initial inquiry closed. The first investigation began after it emerged more than a dozen children had been born with the condition in clusters in three French regions. It ended after health authorities failed to identify a common cause. But now another 11 cases have emerged in the eastern region of Ain, prompting officials to open a fresh inquiry. Evidence of harm from French epilepsy drug Ageing in the wake of thalidomide The condition is a type of agenesis, where the upper limbs of a foetus fail to form correctly during pregnancy. It includes entire missing upper limbs, missing forearms and hands, or fingers - but not unrelated medical conditions, such as missing thumbs. The cases are clustered in the rural Ain area not far from the Swiss border, as well as in Brittany and Loire-Atlantique, two neighbouring regions on the north-west coast. Health Minister AgnÃ¨s Buzyn had already pledged a further investigation in the wake of the initial report's lack of explanations, amid continued public concern and widespread media coverage. Speaking on French television on Wednesday morning, she said the first results from the national inquiry would be published in January, with more to follow by summer. ""I think all of France wants to know,"" said Ms Buzyn. ""We don't want to rule anything out. Perhaps it's do with the environment, or something they ate, or something they drank. Perhaps it's what they breathed - right now I just don't know."" All the cases reported in Ain involve people within a 17km (11 miles) radius of the village of Druillat, leading to speculation about the possible influence of pesticides - which has yet to be proven. The stories of some affected children were widely covered in the French media in the wake of the first report. Ryan, now aged eight, is one of the children from the Ain region who is missing a hand. His parents told French news channel Franceinfo that there had been no hint of a problem on ultrasound scans. Instead they found out when he was born, and doctors were unable to tell them why.

Another affected mother, from Brittany, said she was quizzed by doctors after the birth of her son Leo with a malformed forearm. They wanted to know about eating habits or any pharmaceutical or drug use - but again, could not find a cause. Chair of the scientific committee in Ain's regional health centre, geneticist Dr Elizabeth Gnansia, said the number of concentrated cases of a rare condition was significant. ""Let's imagine they are born between 2009 and 2014, which is five years, can you imagine that in a small rural school seven infants are in the same school with a type of amputation of forearm?"" she said. ""We don't need statistics for that. It's highly significant. It's 50 times what you expect."" The regional register for birth defects, Remera, had raised concerns about a possible surge in cases in Ain in July, following reports from local doctors. It discovered seven cases clustered close together around Druillat over six years. But an initial report from Public Health France in October concluded that those cases, between 2009 and 2014, were not significantly higher than the national average. However, it now says that the 11 new cases it uncovered were all from Ain, covering 15 years since 2000. Three other cases in Loire-Atlantique and four in Brittany were also looked at. In those cases, the health body acknowledged that the numbers were higher than average - but again, no common cause was found. Officials concluded that in all three regions, further investigations were not possible without a hypothesis to pursue. The report also said that monitoring of birth defects was only carried out by a handful of registers, covering just 19% of births in France. That has prompted some fears that the number of cases may be under-reported. On Tuesday, Public Health France announced that the new cases had  been uncovered by a further analysis of hospital databases. It warned that a comprehensive survey several years after the birth of affected children would be ""complex"". The case has drawn parallels with the Thalidomide scandal, involving a drug often taken by pregnant women to alleviate morning sickness. The link between Thalidomide and limb malformation during pregnancy was only uncovered after years of the drug's use. However, no such link between a chemical or pharmaceutical cause has been drawn in France.

US presses Saudis to agree Yemen ceasefire,"This video can not be played The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues The US has called for a swift cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where three years of civil war have caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Defence Secretary James Mattis said all parties needed to take part in UN-led peace talks within the next 30 days. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meanwhile urged the Saudi-led coalition battling the rebel Houthi movement to end its air strikes on populated areas. The US has faced growing pressure to end its support for the coalition. UN human rights experts saycoalition forces may have committed war crimes in Yemenand humanitarian organisations saytheir partial blockade of the country has helped push 14 million people to the brink of famine. The murder of the US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agentsin Istanbul this month has also strained ties between Washington and Riyadh. Hunt 'welcomes' US Yemen announcement The sick children trapped by the war Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. They have received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. Air strikes have caused widespread damage and many civilian casualties At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,560 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. Speaking at the US Institute of Peace in Washington on Tuesday, Mr Mattis said the US had been watching the conflict ""for long enough"". ""We have got to move towards a peace effort here, and we can't say we are going to do it sometime in the future. We need to be doing this in the next 30 days,"" he said. Mr Mattis added that all sides were being urged to meet UN special envoy Martin Griffiths in Sweden in November and ""come to a solution"". This video can not be played Headmaster grieves for the ""sons"" he lost In a separate statement, Mr Pompeo called on the Houthis to end missile and drone strikes on Saudi Arabia and the UAE,external, and on the coalition to subsequently cease air strikes on all populated areas in Yemen. ""It is time to end this conflict, replace conflict with compromise, and allow the Yemeni people to heal through peace and reconstruction,"" he added. The Trump administration has previously backed Mr Griffiths' mediation efforts and called for a settlement in keeping withUN Security Council 2216,external, which demands that the Houthis withdraw from all areas they have seized and relinquish their heavy weapons. The Houthis have rejected those demands. Ending Yemenâs never-ending war Witnessing Yemen's desperate suffering Families of bus strike victims despair at global response By James Landale, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News For months the Trump administration has said little about this bloody conflict, leaving its Saudi allies to take the lead. But the remarks by Mr Mattis and Mr Pompeo show the US is now engaging in a way it has not for some time. Until now both the US and the UK have resisted calling formally for a ceasefire through the UN while it was obvious that neither side was willing to contemplate one. But that seems to have changed. The question, of course, is why? Diplomats point to the growing pressure from the US Congress to act ahead of the mid-term elections. The US might also be hoping to use the backlash against Saudi Arabia over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi to put pressure on Riyadh to try to end the conflict. Some diplomats have even spoken of a Saudi compromise on Yemen being part of the rehabilitation of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto leader. The big question is how Iran, the main backer of the Houthi rebels, will react. Some diplomats have suggested that Tehran would not be unhappy to step back from Yemen, that its involvement there was always opportunistic rather than strategic, and that it has bigger priorities elsewhere. But it is not clear whether Iran would be willing to help the US when it is re-imposing sanctions on its economy after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. So the US move is important, but there is still a long way to go before a ceasefire becomes possible, let alone a political process to end the conflict for good. There was no immediate response from the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis or Yemen's government. Mr Griffiths said the UN welcomed the US calls,externaland stressed that there could be no military solution to the conflict. ""We remain committed to bring the Yemeni parties to the negotiations table within a month. Dialogue remains the only path to reach an inclusive agreement,"" he said.

Crash helicopter take-off 'not abnormal'An aviation expert says new footage shows the helicopter performing well until it clears the stadium.Leicester,"This video can not be played The widely shared footage shows the helicopter taking off Video footage of the helicopter carrying the Leicester City owner shows it spinning moments before it crashed killing him and four others. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died along with two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger in the crash outside the King Power Stadium. The video shows the aircraft going into a spin, which experts said suggests a problem with the tail rotor. Investigators would not comment on the video or causes of Saturday's crash. The widely shared footage, taken inside the stadium, shows the AgustaWestland AW169 climbing normally for about 40 seconds, before it pauses and goes into a downward spin. Mr Vichai, a Thai billionaire, regularly flew in and out of the stadium on match days Aviation expert David Learmount said the video showed the aircraft completed an ""awkward"" take-off without issue before getting into difficulty. ""At lift-off you can't see anything that's abnormal, but it's an awkward job climbing out of a stadium because ideally you want some forward speed as well as continuing to climb,"" Mr Learmount said. ""The pilot climbed very nearly vertically until he was above the height of the stadium and then started to turn to the right - it was very shortly after that control was lost. ""Just after he did a manoeuvre that seemed to be intended, he lost control."" Leicester City owner's son 'proud of dad' A tragic end to Leicester City's fairytale Who were the victims? Mr Learmount said if the tail rotor was the problem, the pilot's options were limited to simply shutting power off to the rotors. ""That leaves you with no power - if you have no power you have to go down,"" he said. ""This action - bringing both rotors back to idle - has to be done incredibly quickly. ""If you shut the power down rapidly enough, you can keep the rotor spinning and that effectively puts the helicopter into a glide. ""If you've already started spinning, trying to do all of this is very nearly impossible."" All five occupants of the helicopter were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. As well as Mr Vichai, Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, and pilots and partners Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz also died. Police have said Ms Lechowicz was a passenger at the time of the crash. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger were killed when the aircraft spiralled out of control and crashed in a fireball The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is already examining the flight recorders, which were retrieved the day after the crash. It said it was ""too early"" to comment on the video or the possible causes of the crash and said it ""will consider a wealth of evidence, and the video is just one element"". A spokesperson for Leonardo, the Italian company which manufacturers the AW169, said it was working closely with the AAIB and British authorities. So far it has not issued any new safety advice relating to the AW169 in light of the crash. On Wednesday, coroners for Leicester said formal identification of 60-year-old Mr Vichai had taken place, along with 32-year-old Ms Nusara, 46-year-old Ms Lechowicz and 53-year-old Mr Swaffer. Identification of the fifth victim was still in progress and no date for inquests have been set yet, police said. This video can not be played Leicester City fans gather to pay tribute to owner Striker Jamie Vardy, his wife Rebekah and club ambassador Alan Birchenall lay their own tributes at the memorial outside the stadium A huge display of floral and footballing tributes have been left outside the stadium and a steady stream of people have signed a book of condolence since it opened on Tuesday. Families of those who died, players and members of the wider Leicester community have also visited the scene. A minute's silence will be held and black armbands will be worn by players at all Premier League matches this weekend as a mark of respect, the Premier League has confirmed. Leicester players will also travel by road to their game at Cardiff on Saturday rather than fly, as it was felt insensitive to go by plane given the circumstances of Mr Vichai's death.

Pakistan Christian cleared of blasphemyAsia Bibi's conviction was one of the most prominent cases of blasphemy that have polarised Pakistan.Asia,"This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row A Pakistani court has overturned the death sentence of a Christian woman convicted of blasphemy, a case that has polarised the nation. Asia Bibi was convicted in 2010 after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a row with her neighbours. She always maintained her innocence, but has spent most of the past eight years in solitary confinement. The landmark ruling has already set off violent protests by hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws. Demonstrations against the verdict are being held in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Multan. Clashes with police have been reported. The Red Zone in the capital Islamabad, where the Supreme Court is located, has been sealed off by police, and paramilitary forces have been deployed to keep protesters away from the court. Demonstrations have been held in several cities including Peshawar Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, who read out the ruling, said Asia Bibi could walk free from jail in Sheikupura, near Lahore, immediately if not wanted in connection with any other case. She was not in court to hear the ruling, but reacted to the verdict from prison with apparent disbelief. ""I can't believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really?"" AFP news agency quoted her as saying by phone. Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Asia Bibi and a lonely Christmas in a prison cell The Muslims building a Christian church in Pakistan The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made three offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. By Secunder Kermani, BBC News, Islamabad The court delivered its verdict quickly, no doubt aware of the sensitivity of the case and the danger of a violent reaction to it. Asia Bibi's lawyer, closely flanked by a policeman, told me he was ""happy"" with the verdict, but also afraid for his and his client's safety. Even after she is freed, the legacy of her case will continue. Shortly after her conviction a prominent politician,Punjab Governor Salman Taseer, was murdered for speaking out in her supportand calling for the blasphemy laws to be reformed. The killer - Mumtaz Qadri - was executed, but has become a cult hero with a large shrine dedicated to him on the outskirts of Islamabad. His supporters also created a political party - campaigning to preserve the blasphemy laws - which gathered around two million votes in this year's general election. It's the same party which many fear could be responsible for violent unrest in the coming days. Laws enacted by the British Raj in 1860 made it a crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship, punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Several more clauses were added in the 1980s by Pakistan's military ruler Gen Zia ul-Haq: 1980 - up to three years in jail for derogatory remarks against Islamic personages 1982 - life imprisonment for ""wilful"" desecration of the Koran 1986 - ""death, or imprisonment for life"" for blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws? The judges said the prosecution had ""categorically failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"". The case was based on flimsy evidence, they said, and proper procedures had not been followed. The alleged confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". The ruling heavily referenced the Koran and Islamic history.,externalIt ended with a quote from the Hadith, the collected sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, which calls for non-Muslims to be treated kindly. Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hardline politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemers in Pakistan The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Many of the attacks are motivated by blasphemy cases, but others have come in reaction to the US-led war in Afghanistan. No-one has ever been executed under the laws, but some people accused of the offence have been lynched or murdered. Asia Bibi, who was born in 1971 and has four children, was the first woman to be sentenced to death under the laws. Salman Taseer had taken up Asia Bibi's cause and called for reform of the blasphemy laws Internationally, her conviction has been widely condemned as a breach of human rights. There are fears that there could be a violent response to her acquittal. Asia Bibi's husband and daughter say they fear for their safety in Pakistan As with her previous trials and appeals, large crowds gathered outside the court in Islamabad on Wednesday demanding her conviction be upheld and the execution carried out. She has been offered asylum by several countries and is expected to leave the country. Her daughter, Eisham Ashiq, had previously told the AFP news agency that if she were released: ""I will hug her and will cry meeting her and will thank God that he has got her released."" But the family said they feared for their safety and would likely have to leave Pakistan. Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

"Frozen Apple Watches must be returnedApple has withdrawn a software update after complaints that it ""bricked"" some owners' smartwatches.Technology","Some users who installed the latest WatchOS software say it caused their devices to stop working Apple has pulled an update for its smartwatches after some owners complained the software had caused their devices to stop working. The problem appears to have baffled the firm's repair staff, and there appears to be no way at present for owners to restore the products themselves. Several have said they have been told they need to send in the devices for a fix. Apple said it intended to release a revised update soon. Those affected reported that their watches had become stuck in a state showing the Apple logo - but nothing else - on their screens. One owner of a newly released Series 4 model said he had been told it would take the firm's repair staff up to a week to decide whether his device needed to be repaired or replaced. Chris Ball from Belfast said Apple Support had sent him a message saying: ""I know it's hard to be without your Watch, but this is the only service method available for Watch. Even if you went to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorised Service Provider, we'd need to ship the Watch to a repair depot."" He expressed frustration that having recently spent Â£750 on the device he would now be without it for days. ""My Apple Watch is now completely useless, stuck on the Apple logo screen,"" he told the BBC. ""So I have to wait, due to a problem Apple's software caused, meaning I have no watch. ""I would like to question their quality assurance on software.""

However, it is relatively uncommon for people to have to physically return affected items to address a software problem. ""Due to a small number of Apple Watch customers experiencing an issue while installing WatchOS 5.1 today, we've pulled back the software update as a precaution,"" Apple said in a statement. ""Any customers impacted should contact AppleCare, but no action is required if the update installed successfully. ""We are working on a fix for an upcoming software update."" The issue serves as a distraction at a time when Apple is focused on its latest launches - it unveiled new iPads and Mac computers in New York on Tuesday. The firm does not force users to adopt its latest software, but one expert suggested that in general it made sense to check the internet for reports of problems before downloading any update. ""History has shown that waiting a little while before installing the latest software can help users avoid a mishap,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""There are now numerous examples across all different manufacturers that updates can cause considerable pain for the owners of the devices they are targeted at, and it's probably wise to be cautious if you want to be certain they will keep working.""

Ambulance raided as crew treats patient,"This video can not be played CCTV from the ambulance's cameras has been released A thief broke into an ambulance and stole paramedics' belongings as they treated a patient in a nearby house. The crew returned to the locked vehicle in Northfield, Birmingham, to find the driver's window smashed. CCTV footage from an on-board camera shows a man approach, damaging the vehicle before hoisting himself in. West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS) said the ""despicable crime"" meant the ambulance could not be used for 999 calls. Video of the break-in, which happened on Frankley Beeches Road at about 21:00 GMT on Sunday, shows a figure entering the courtyard where the vehicle was parked. He approaches the door, and spends a few seconds attempting to gain entry to the vehicle. At the end of the clip, he lifts himself up, and leans into the window before fleeing the scene. The thief took a number of personal items, including an iPhone. Nathan Hudson, from WMAS, said: ""I cannot begin to understand why someone would do this to an emergency blue-lighted vehicle which has the sole responsibility of helping people. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands ""It really does make you question the morals of some people. ""It is unacceptable that ambulance staff, who are there to help people in their hour of need, are made to suffer by members of the public."" The out-of-service ambulance is being repaired.

"Car and house insurance faces regulator probeThe City regulator warns customers face ""significant harm"" from the prices charged by some firms.BusinessComments","The City regulator is to investigate how home and car insurance policies are priced after finding ""hidden"" discrimination between customers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will study the scale of the issue, whom it affects, and possible solutions. Insurance customers may pay different prices depending on how loyal they are, their age, and whether they are online. Marital status, home postcode and employment status may also have a hidden effect on price, the FCA said. Citizens Advice has already warned loyal customers are being ""ripped off"". It launched a super-complaint claiming that customers who stick with the same supplier for a variety of household services are losing a total of Â£4.1bn a year. That amounts to an average of Â£877 per person. Failing to shop around, or the inability to do so, costs people hundreds of pounds. This is known in the industry as ""price walking"" - where the cost of insurance is increased each year the customer sticks with the same provider, eventually making their policy much more expensive (and profitable for the insurer) than for a new customer. Park on the drive, and other tips for cheaper insurance Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers pledge fairer premiums for long-term customers Part of the response to the Citizens Advice complaint is this review into the general insurance market by the FCA. The FCA said UK insurers generated Â£78bn in premiums from customers and that 82% of adults had one or more general insurance products. In an analysis of the home insurance market, the FCA said there was evidence of significant price competition for new customers with new policies offered at 30% below the cost of providing the policy and firms increased premiums in the second and third years of the policy. BBC website readers have told of how they challenged their insurance renewal price - and saw the cost drop dramatically. Jeffrey Allen says: ""Last year, I challenged the premium which was Â£1,100 after my son said he was paying Â£600 for a similar-sized house in a similar area. In the 20-plus years [with the same insurer], we have made one claim for a leak in one room. After a 10-minute call and threatening to go elsewhere, the premium dropped to Â£650."" Paul Strong says in the first year of home emergency insurance, he was quoted Â£114, in the second it was Â£278, and in the third it was Â£522. ""I said Â£300 would be reasonable to include inflation and increase in Insurance Premium Tax. They agreed to this immediately,"" he says. Paul texted BBC Radio 5 live to say: ""[My insurer] quoted me Â£1,400 for a multi-car renewal this week. I called them and got the price reduced by Â£400. Crazy."" The regulator has now written to the chief executives of insurance firms to set out that it expects them to treat customers fairly. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said: ""This market study will help us examine the outcomes from general insurance pricing practices and inform how, if necessary, we should intervene to improve the market. ""If change is needed to make the market work well for consumers, we will consider all possible remedies to achieve this."" The FCA said it had already found some firms were not complying with its rules about information that customers should receive when they renew their policies and could use its regulatory powers against those with whom it had concerns. These rules include making it clear in a renewal letter how much people paid the previous year. In November last year, the BBC revealed how some insurers wereburying these pricing detailsdeep in renewal documents. Inthe letter to the heads of insurance firms,external, Mr Bailey said: ""There is a significant risk of consumer harm if your firm has not implemented an appropriate pricing strategy with effective governance and controls to determine and monitor your pricing activities and evaluate how your pricing decisions will affect consumer outcomes."" In May, insurers said they would crack down on ""excessive"" differences in premiums for new customers and existing policyholders. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) said their Guiding Principles and Action Points should mean ""an improvement in the outcomes for long-standing customers"". However, the FCA investigation seems to challenge whether this response was sufficient.

Osborne: Mistakes led to EU leave vote,"This video can not be played George Osborne: We did get things wrong George Osborne has admitted to ""regrets"" about his time in office and the ""mistakes"" that led to Brexit. The former chancellor was a prominent figure in the ill-fated Remain campaign at the 2016 EU referendum, led by then prime minister David Cameron. He said Mr Cameron's government had been ""too late in the day"" to explain the benefits of EU membership. And, he told the BBC's Newsnight, it should not have set immigration targets it could not deliver. ""That led to a debate about how you might deliver those targets,"" he said, and the government ""didn't make enough of the value of immigration"". Brexit: All you need to know Osborne 'ignored child poverty warning' George Osborne takes on another job That allowed a previously ""minority concern"" about leaving the EU and national sovereignty ""to be linked to immigration control and that was pretty lethal in that referendum debate"", he said. Interviewed on Evan Davis's last Newsnight as presenter (you can watch the whole programme here), Mr Osborne said: ""We were wrong to play into the debate that everything that Brussels did was a challenge and a battle and was wrong."" Mr Osborne was David Cameron's closest ally in government and served as his chancellor for the whole six years Mr Cameron was prime minister - from 2010 to 2016. He has admitted in the past he was ""not keen"" on holding an EU referendum and had only gone along with it to support Mr Cameron. This video can not be played Newsnight: The pair were part of a discussion on Evan Davis's last programme as presenter During the campaign itself, he issued a series of warnings about job losses and tax rises if Britain left the EU, which critics attacked as scaremongering and Project Fear. Mr Cameron launched the referendum campaign after spending weeks trying to strike a deal with the EU to curb immigration. At the same time, his government was consistently failing to meet its own target - at a time when the home secretary was Theresa May - of reducing net migration to below 100,000 a year. Mr Osborne told Newsnight: ""We were too late in the day trying to explain some of the benefits of European Union membership. ""On immigration we were promising targets that we couldn't deliver and that then led to a debate about how you might deliver those targets - not that I see any evidence that they're going to be delivered in the future - but, you know, we definitely contributed to that argument, didn't make enough of the value of immigration. ""So I'm happy to look at mistakes we made."" Mr Cameron has yet to comment publicly on what went wrong in the Remain campaign. Mr Osborne was a leading figure in the cross-party Remain campaign Mr Osborne, who is now the editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper, in addition toa number of other post-politics jobs, said his other regrets included not focusing on fixing the banking system more quickly after the 2008 financial crash. Mr Osborne, who became chancellor in 2010, when the Conservatives went into coalition with the Liberal Democrats, said: ""Overall, faced with the gigantic financial crash and a set of difficult decisions in a hung parliament I think David Cameron, myself, Nick Clegg and others worked hard in what we felt to be the national interest to put things right in as fair a way as possible. ""Ultimately the country grew, jobs were created and we avoided the calamitous situation that a lot of European countries found themselves in this period."" Mr Osborne denied his austerity policies had encouraged people to vote for Brexit, saying that, for instance, many pensioners had favoured leaving the EU despite being ""insulated"" from austerity. But he came under attack on the programme from Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee, who told him he had ""done such harm and damage to this country"". David Cameron and George Osborne were close political allies Mr Osborne was also asked if he had any regrets over comments, attributed to him, that he would not rest until Prime Minister Theresa May was ""chopped up in bags in my freezer"". ""I certainly have said things in private which you know, I probably shouldn't have, and actually, apologised for it,"" he said. ""But I worked very hard all my life to make the Conservative Party electable, and it's painful to me to see it losing support in large areas of the country where it shouldn't be losing that support, particularly against, actually, a Labour opposition which I don't think is in a fit state at the moment."" But Mr Osborne warned Theresa May not to attempt to copy the policies of Jeremy Corbyn's party. He said that the Conservatives lost their majority in 2017 by trying to ""out-Ukip Ukip"" and were not going to win the next election ""by trying to out-Corbyn Corbyn"". ""Trying to bang the nationalist drum doesn't actually work for modern conservativism and trying to outspend our political opponents isn't going to help the Conservatives either,"" he told Newsnight.

Channel 4 chooses Leeds for new HQThe broadcaster is moving almost 40% of its staff out of the capital.Entertainment & Arts,"Channel 4 said Leeds put forward an ""ambitious strategy"" Channel 4 will set up a new national HQ in Leeds in an attempt to boost the way it reflects life outside London. The broadcaster will keep another headquarters in the capital, but will move roughly 200 of its 800 staff to the West Yorkshire city. Leeds was chosen above Birmingham and Greater Manchester, which were also on the shortlist. The channel has also announced it will open ""creative hubs"" in Bristol and Glasgow, with around 50 staff in each. It's all part of a plan to increase the amount Channel 4 spends on programmes outside London by Â£250m over the next five years. That means half of its programme budget will be spent outside the capital by 2023, up from 35% currently. Tom Riordan, chief executive of Leeds City Council, said it was ""the best news"".

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the decision to house one of the creative hubs in Glasgow was ""fantastic news for Scotland's screen sector and creative industries"". Mayor of BristolMarvin Rees tweeted,externalthat he is looking forward to working with Channel 4 in ""our creative, innovative city"". All three new sites will house ""key creative decision-makers"", including programme commissioners who will have responsibility ""for some of Channel 4's biggest shows and who oversee significant spend"". The new national HQ will regularly host executive and board meetings, and will be home to a ""digital creative unit"" to make material for online platforms and social media. Channel 4 News will also open three new bureaux outside London, including one in Leeds. Writer Kay Mellor said Leeds was ""the perfect fit"" for Channel 4 The city was the home of Channel 4's Countdown for 27 years until 2009 Other C4 shows made in the region include Educating Yorkshire (in nearby Dewsbury) and the Red Riding trilogy Over on ITV, the city has been home to Emmerdale since the soap began in 1972 Screenwriter Kay Mellor's production company is based there, and she has set dramas including Fat Friends, The Syndicate and Love, Lies and Records in her home city Mellor saidthe move was a ""game changer""that would put the city ""firmly on the media map"". She said: ""Leeds is the perfect fit in terms of location and talent and we'll all be there with open arms to welcome them to our wonderful city."" Channel 4 said Leeds had put forward an ""ambitious strategy"" to support growth in the creative industries and ""to nurture new talent from diverse backgrounds - in the region and across the UK"". Chris Curtis, editor of trade publication Broadcast, said the difference it will make on screen will depend on which staff move to the new hubs, and how much power they have. ""They have talked about moving creative decision-makers out of London but there's still a sense that the big creative decisions will still be taken in the London HQ,"" he told BBC News. The broadcaster will keep its London HQ on Horseferry Road ""Which roles move, the level of seniority of those roles, and how much autonomy those people are given are yet to be determined, and they will have an influence on Channel 4's output. ""But I don't believe C4 are just paying lip service - they genuinely want it to be a success."" Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon said she wanted to open the publicly-owned company up to ""people from across the UK and supercharge the impact we have in all parts of the country"". She said: ""Locating our national HQ in Leeds enables us to capitalise on a strong and fast-growing independent production sector in cities across the north of England - and also has the potential to unlock growth in the north-east and east of the country, an area without a major presence from other national broadcasters."" Sally Joynson, chief executive of Screen Yorkshire, said the move would be ""transformational"" for the TV industry in the city and the north of England. The move has come about after pressure from the government to boost the broadcaster's presence outside London. The Conservative Party put a relocation in its 2017 general election manifesto, and pushed for a full move. But Channel 4 chairman Charles Gurassawarned,externalthat a full or substantial relocation would cause ""significant difficulties and problems"". It has now settled on a compromise that will send almost 40% of jobs out of the capital. After Wednesday's announcement, culture secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The government made clear that Channel 4 needed to do more to increase its presence in the regions to help better reflect and provide for UK audiences outside of London. ""Congratulations to Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow, and I look forward to Channel 4 taking further steps to increase its impact around the UK in the years ahead.""

Bake Off final watched by 7.5 millionIt's an increase on the number who watched last year's final on Channel 4.Entertainment & Arts,"Rahul Mandal (centre) is crowned champion by judges Paul Hollywood (left) and Prue Leith (right) The Great British Bake Off final was watched by an average live audience of 7.5 million people, according to overnight figures. This is aslight increase on last year's final, which brought in 7.3 million live viewers. A peak audience of 8.1 million saw Rahul Mandal crowned the winner in the final five minutes of the show. Ratings did not match those obtained when the show was on BBC One - the 2016 final brought in 14 million viewers. This was the second series of Bake Off to be broadcast on Channel 4, not including the celebrity specials for Stand Up To Cancer. Tuesday's finale gave the network its highest viewing figures since the broadcast of the Paralympics Opening Ceremony in 2012 -which reached a peak live audience of 11.2 million. Rahul triumphed over fellow finalists Kim-Joy Hewlett and Ruby Bhogal. He was crowned 2018's winner after a near-disaster in the show stopper. He said: ""I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. I just feel I need to talk with my mum."" The moment Rahul was announced winner, celebrated by fellow finalists Kim-Joy (left) and Ruby (right) The final three contestants were evenly matched, having each been named star baker twice during the course of this year's series. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today, Rahul said: ""Only my parents knew about [me applying for Bake Off], in the newspaper they published the news and the rest of the family found out, they are very happy but shocked and surprised. ""I think baking is science, its a mixture of physics, chemistry and engineering so perfectly fits what I do. ""I just want to spread this word to students that maybe they think science is not for them, especially guys in school think they can't bake but its the same thing [as science] - anyone can do it."" Lucy Mangan from The Guardian,externalwas full of praise: ""The most joyful thing about this series of The Great British Bake Off - apart, possibly, from Kim-Joy herself - was that as we entered the final, the average viewer would have been equally content whichever of the three remaining competitors won."" The Mirror's Ian Hyland wrote,external: ""As well as being a great baker, Rahul was a great story. ""The timorous immigrant boy who decided the best way to learn about his new home was to bake his way through its history and customs. You can hear the orchestra tuning up already."" This video can not be played ""His Mum said to me, you're his Mum in England"" says Liz Anson, who with husband David, took Rahul under their wing Michael Hogan from The Telegraph agreed,external: ""It was a triumph of quiet talent as endearingly nerdy nuclear scientist Rahul Mandal, from Rotherham via Kolkata, became the cake-making contest's first male winner for six years. ""His ambitious creations occasionally looked messy but left the judges dumbstruck with their deliciousness."" The Independent's Sean O'Grady was a little less complimentary:,external""I wonder how much more the viewers can take of GBBO, but the format is obviously durable. So maybe another slice or two before it goes mouldy. ""In any case, say what you like about Brexit and the great British industrial productivity problem, we may rest assured that our amateur baking skills lead the world. Let's make Britain bake again!"" In the signature challenge, the bakers were called upon to make two batches of iced doughnuts - one set filled and one set rings. Indian-born Rahul was complimented for his decorations, with Leith saying: ""The colours are absolutely amazing and have such personality."" Kim-Joy, who lives in Leeds, impressed with her amaretto creme diplomat doughnuts. Leith said: ""I might come back and eat that"". And Paul Hollywood praised London-based Ruby's doughnuts adorned with chocolate rainbows: ""They have great designs on the top and the decoration is very clever"". In a Bake Off first, the three finalists were then asked to take their cooking tools outside for a tough technical challenge. Hollywood tasked the trio with making six pita breads and three dips in 90 minutes, using campfires for all the cooking. Kim-Joy, a mental health specialist, won the technical for the first time. Research scientist Rahul came in second and project manager Ruby took third. But it all came down to the show stopper to see who would take the crown. Kim-Joy, Rahul and Ruby all won star baker twice during the series The finalists were given four-and-a-half hours to make a landscape dessert, painting a picture with cake, pastry and biscuits. Drama ensued as Rahul created a rock garden, inspired by Victorian explorers bringing back exciting plants from around the world. But his glass storage container smashed due to the 32C heat in the tent and after a swift clean up by producers he had to start again - with an extra 15 minutes to make up for lost time. Kim-Joy's Lost city of Atlantis was also applauded for being ""original and colourful"". But there were some questions on the amount of ginger she used in her biscuits and cakes - recipes that won her star baker in spice week. Ruby's magical landscape, with unicorns and mushrooms, was praised for its theme. The choux pastry mountain impressed with its height, despite being overcooked, whilst both judges praised the delicious flavours, beautiful sponge and buttery biscuits. But the taste and complexity of Rahul's final bake saw him come back from the brink of disaster to win the final. Leith said: ""He never reined in his ambition, he always tried to do a bit more than everybody else, and it paid off."" Hollywood added: ""He is one of those characters that you will miss when you are not with him. ""I don't think he realises still how good he actually is and I think that's what's magic about Rahul.""

Ambulance raided as crew treats patientParamedics' belongings were stolen when a man smashed the vehicle's window and climbed inside.,"This video can not be played CCTV from the ambulance's cameras has been released A thief broke into an ambulance and stole paramedics' belongings as they treated a patient in a nearby house. The crew returned to the locked vehicle in Northfield, Birmingham, to find the driver's window smashed. CCTV footage from an on-board camera shows a man approach, damaging the vehicle before hoisting himself in. West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS) said the ""despicable crime"" meant the ambulance could not be used for 999 calls. Video of the break-in, which happened on Frankley Beeches Road at about 21:00 GMT on Sunday, shows a figure entering the courtyard where the vehicle was parked. He approaches the door, and spends a few seconds attempting to gain entry to the vehicle. At the end of the clip, he lifts himself up, and leans into the window before fleeing the scene. The thief took a number of personal items, including an iPhone. Nathan Hudson, from WMAS, said: ""I cannot begin to understand why someone would do this to an emergency blue-lighted vehicle which has the sole responsibility of helping people. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands ""It really does make you question the morals of some people. ""It is unacceptable that ambulance staff, who are there to help people in their hour of need, are made to suffer by members of the public."" The out-of-service ambulance is being repaired.

Met Police to launch merchandise rangeScotland Yard hopes the merchandise will help improve the Met's image and raise incomeLondon,"Scotland Yard has hired specialists to look into branded clothing, toys and games, stationery, homeware and tourist souvenir items A range of Metropolitan Police merchandise may soon hit the shops after the force hired a specialist branding firm. Scotland Yard is hoping to follow the example of the New York Police Department, which has been selling merchandise for more than 15 years. It is hoped the move will help improve the Met's image and raise income. City Hall calculatesthe Met will need to find an extra Â£325m of savings before April 2021. The New York Police Department (NYPD) raise extra revenue through branded clothing, as worn by actress Chloe Grace Moretz The project is looking into Met Police branded clothing, toys and games, stationery, homeware and tourist souvenir items. Any money raised by the licensing project would be used to fund frontline services, train staff and ""build greater affiliation with, and support for the service, thereby inspiring future generations to join"". A contract has been signed with branding firm The Point.1888, which has worked with Tate galleries, Leon and Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. Simon Wilson, director of commercial services at the Met, said: ""As a team we feel there is a huge global opportunity to develop marketing leading consumer products to support our vision."" TfL's limited edition trainers featured the Underground roundel and a map of the Metropolitan Line Will Stewart, managing director of The Point.1888, said: ""I grew up in London, so to be able to generate revenue that puts more bobbies on the beat in my home town is an honour. ""The Metropolitan Police and New Scotland Yard brands have unbelievable awareness and we will partner with outstanding licensees to help us really make a difference."" However, Met Police Federation chair Ken Marsh called the plan a ""ridiculous idea"". ""I think my colleagues will take a dim view when people are wandering around with Metropolitan Police written on them,"" he said. Transport for London recently collaborated with clothing brand Adidas on a similar project, creating limited edition trainers featuring the Underground roundel and a map of the Metropolitan Line. TfL's director of commercial development Graeme Craig said such link-ups ""provide vital funds that we invest in modernising the transport network"". No products that look like Met uniforms would be produced, and Scotland Yard would have the final say on any products made by external companies, the force said. The project will run until May 2021.

Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament By 312 votes to 295, MPs approve budget resolution 79, which empowers the Treasury to maintain the effect of certain taxes after Brexit. Some MPs suggested it was a power grab by the government, allowing ministers to make certain changes without consulting Parliament. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Work and Pensions Minister Baroness Buscombe says the government spends more than any other developed nation on supporting families. She says that Labour created ""complicated"" systems of tax breaks and benefits for families. 1.4m people spent the majority of 2000-2010 on benefits, she says. ""The system simply was not sustainable,"" she states. There are 637,000 fewer children growing up in ""workless households"" since 2010, she states, adding that the government believes the ""best way out of poverty"" is through work. With that, the Lords adjourns. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Opposition spokesperson Baroness Drake says the Department for Work and Pensions has ""routinely dismissed evidence"" that ""it does not want to see"". Levels of child poverty are rising, along with household debt and insecure contracts or self employment, she says. She says most of the  projected increase in child poverty comes from a limit on paying child benefits to families with three or more children under universal credit. ""This is a system that is causing anxiety and hardship, wherever it is rolled out,"" she says. ""The budget was a missed opportunity to bring children in from the cold"". House of CommonsParliament By 314 to 31, MPs pass budget resolution 5, which authorises government plans to bring forward a planned rise in the personal allowance threshold. Under government plans, the point at which people start paying income tax will rise to to Â£12,500 next April - a year earlier than planned. After quickly approving a series of other motions, they divide to vote on resolution 79, which Labour said earlier they will oppose.

McDonnell had said Labour would not oppose plans to raise the 40% rate to Â£50,000 from next April. The government resolution is then later approved. Debate on the Budget comes to a close, and MPs will now vote
on a series of âways and meansâ resolutions to bring in the finance bill. This is the legislation which implements the governmentâs
proposed changes to income tax and corporation tax. It is expected to be
published next week. Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss says ""this is a budget that will help working families and grow our economy."" ""Even the shadow chancellor has welcomed our tax cuts,"" she says, adding: ""it's just a shame his party don't agree with him...But there is always a space for him on our front bench"". During her speech, Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith intervenes to ask if ministers are willing to discuss the date for the new maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals before the publication of the finance bill, the legislation which implements the Budget. Ministersfaced opposition this morningover alleged delays to the new Â£2 maximum bet, which will not come into force before October next year. Liz Truss says says she is ""happy to discuss"" with MPs ""what more we can do"" about the matter. There had been reports earlier today that ministers were facing a potential rebellion from Tory MPs who had wanted the maximum stake to be brought in earlier. Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow chief secretary to the treasury Peter Dowd, wrapping up for the opposition, says ""austerity has never, and will not, end under a Tory government"". He says the government is making ""unprecedented"" attacks on Parliament and parliamentary scrutiny. ""There is nothing in this budget for our teachers, police officers or local government workers"", he says, adding that the government has ""broken all their own targets"". The money for the NHS ""is not enough"", he quotes the Health Foundation in saying, whilst social care funding is ""less than half that what is needed"". He calls on Conservatives to support a Labour amendment to the resolution on income tax which will shortly be voted on, which sets out their plans for the tax system. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord Shinkwin says one million disabled people gain around Â£110 per month due to the government targeting support to the ""most vulnerable"". He says the government is ""listening and acting"" in response to issues raised by MPs. He describes Iain Duncan-Smith as a ""champion of social justice"". He adds that he is pleased to learn that the DWP will fund Citizens' Advice in order to help out with Universal Credit payments. He accuses Labour of a ""total inability"" to accept responsibility for the ""high level of debt"" that ""Gordon Brown inflicted upon this country"". He says this would be worse under the ""Marxist"" Chancellor McDonnell if Labour were to win a general election. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Livermore, who worked for ten years in the Treasury during the last Labour government, says that Labour's work in office led to reductions in child poverty. He says that any cuts the Chancellor now imposes, with ""austerity over"", are out of ""political choice"". Those at the bottom 30% of income distribution will still earn less after the planned changes to the personal allowance, he says. He says it would cost Â£1.5bn to reverse benefit cuts, but the Chancellor has made Â£2.8bn in tax cuts, of which half go to the top 10%. He says many families in receipt of benefits are now Â£1,940 a year worse off. He adds that it is a ""bad choice for Labour to support"" these new tax cuts. Benefit cuts debate The Bishop of Portsmouth says it would be ""negligent""
to not express the ""likely impacts"" of other changes ""coming
down the tracks"". He says families with disabled children shortly face an
""unjust, shameful reduction"" in their benefits. He states that he cannot accept the ""government's
rationale"" for the two child limit on benefits, adding that this doesn't
take into account a redundancy or a family breakdown. ""Children already in need will be in greater need""
with further cuts, he says. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Baroness Jenkin of Kennington says the government has a duty to ensure money is ""well-spent,"" with benefits spending equivalent to 28% of government expenditure. People are paying less in income tax since 2010, she says, and people are able to keep more of what they earn. Youth unemployment has fallen by 40% since 2010, she adds. ""Those calling to dismantle UC risk throwing out the baby with the bathwater"". Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Bassam of Brighton is now opening a debate on the impact of reducing welfare benefits, universal credit payments, tax credits, housing benefits and child benefit. He pays tribute to former Labour minister Baroness Hollis, whodied earlier this month, for fighting against cuts to universal credit and other benefits. The last Labour government managed to bring 1.1m out of child poverty, he states. Social security cuts ""continue to hit the poorest hardest,"" he adds. Problem gamblers debate House of LordsParliament Government spokesperson Baroness Manzoor says that she ""recognises the strong feelings across this House"" on gambling addiction. The rates of problem gambling in the UK have remained ""relatively stable"" over the years, she says, at around 1% of the population. There is not enough data on what can be done to stop people from ""stepping into problem gambling in the first place,"" she states. The GambleAware charity commissions treatment services such as counselling and helplines, she adds. Problem gamblers debate House of LordsParliament Shadow culture minister Lord Stevenson of Balmacara says that problem gamblers are more likely to relapse, and the rate of suicide among sufferers is high. He says new technology enables more people ""to get involved in this dreadful world"". Other countries have introduced bans on advertising for gambling during, before and after live sporting events on TV, he says. The number of suicides is ""such an extraordinarily worrying issue,"" he tells peers. Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge says a ""truthful conversation"" needs to take place with voters about ""how much we need to raise in tax to fund public services"". She had hoped to welcome the new digital services tax, she says, but calls the government's proposal ""little more than a PR stunt"". Google and Facebook ""should have paid Â£480m in 2017"", she says, which exceeds the government's Â£400m projection for revenue from all tech firms. ""This tax gives us far too little and far too late"", she adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Clampdown on NHS staff assaults,"New measures to protect NHS staff are to be introduced to try to reduce the thousands of assaults on them that take place every year. Staff are to be given better training in dealing with violent situations and offenders will be prosecuted more quickly. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out further details later. He says the NHS will adopt a ""zero tolerance"" approach to violence against its staff. A bill to double the sentence for assaults on emergency workers from six months to a year is shortly expected to become law too. The NHS Violence Reduction Strategy expands on work previously carried out by a body that was scrapped by government more than a year ago. Nurse Sharon Morris was on duty in a secure unit when she was attacked by a service user Sharon Morris, a nurse for more than 30 years, was attacked in the medium security mental health unit where she worked. The effect on her life has been profound. It was in 2016 that the abuse happened and she still experiences flashbacks and nightmares. ""It was a patient I had been working with for a year and it all happened out of the blue. He went to attack a colleague and I stepped in. ""I remember him hitting and punching me in the head and then I passed out."" Sharon was off sick for three months and it took another three months after that for her to feel safe enough to work with patients again. ""The worst bit is the psychological side. It's made me feel very wary of people. For a while I would see my assailant's face in other young men - even my eldest son, who is physically quite similar. ""There are still things that make me anxious now. I can't read or watch things like crime programmes that contain a lot of violence."" Shelley still works as a nurse, despite repeated attacks Nurse Shelley Pearce was ""taken hostage"" by an alcoholic patient on an acute ward, who held a piece of broken plastic against her throat. She has also experienced other serious assaults, including being head-butted. NHS Protect, the body that was disbanded in March 2017, used to support and advise hospitals in England on staff safety. Afterwards, it was solely up to individual NHS trusts to safeguard their workers. Speaking to the Royal College of Nursing, Mr Hancock will outline how the new strategy will work: Offenders to be prosecuted quickly as a result of new partnership between the NHS, Police and Crown Prosecution Service Care inspectors will scrutinise NHS trusts on quality of plans to reduce violence against staff Better training for staff to deal with violent situations, including challenging circumstances involving patients with dementia or mental health issues A new system so that staff can record assaults more easily NHS England will also look at national data to determine which staff are most vulnerable to violence and what more needs to be done. Mr Hancock says: ""We will not shy away from the issue - we want to empower staff and give them greater confidence to report violence, knowing that they will see meaningful action from trusts and a consistent prosecution approach from the judicial system."" Royal College of Nursing National Officer, Kim Sunley said: ""Nurses and health care workers understand their roles aren't risk-free but -  to many - it still seems as if the threat of physical violence is a daily reality. ""These measures are another way to change this for good by increasing the accountability of employers for the safety of their staff, and ensuring those who wilfully assault healthcare workers feel the full force of the law.""

Crash helicopter take-off 'not abnormal',"This video can not be played The widely shared footage shows the helicopter taking off Video footage of the helicopter carrying the Leicester City owner shows it spinning moments before it crashed killing him and four others. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died along with two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger in the crash outside the King Power Stadium. The video shows the aircraft going into a spin, which experts said suggests a problem with the tail rotor. Investigators would not comment on the video or causes of Saturday's crash. The widely shared footage, taken inside the stadium, shows the AgustaWestland AW169 climbing normally for about 40 seconds, before it pauses and goes into a downward spin. Mr Vichai, a Thai billionaire, regularly flew in and out of the stadium on match days Aviation expert David Learmount said the video showed the aircraft completed an ""awkward"" take-off without issue before getting into difficulty. ""At lift-off you can't see anything that's abnormal, but it's an awkward job climbing out of a stadium because ideally you want some forward speed as well as continuing to climb,"" Mr Learmount said. ""The pilot climbed very nearly vertically until he was above the height of the stadium and then started to turn to the right - it was very shortly after that control was lost. ""Just after he did a manoeuvre that seemed to be intended, he lost control."" Leicester City owner's son 'proud of dad' A tragic end to Leicester City's fairytale Who were the victims? Mr Learmount said if the tail rotor was the problem, the pilot's options were limited to simply shutting power off to the rotors. ""That leaves you with no power - if you have no power you have to go down,"" he said. ""This action - bringing both rotors back to idle - has to be done incredibly quickly. ""If you shut the power down rapidly enough, you can keep the rotor spinning and that effectively puts the helicopter into a glide. ""If you've already started spinning, trying to do all of this is very nearly impossible."" All five occupants of the helicopter were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. As well as Mr Vichai, Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, and pilots and partners Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz also died. Police have said Ms Lechowicz was a passenger at the time of the crash. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger were killed when the aircraft spiralled out of control and crashed in a fireball The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is already examining the flight recorders, which were retrieved the day after the crash. It said it was ""too early"" to comment on the video or the possible causes of the crash and said it ""will consider a wealth of evidence, and the video is just one element"". A spokesperson for Leonardo, the Italian company which manufacturers the AW169, said it was working closely with the AAIB and British authorities. So far it has not issued any new safety advice relating to the AW169 in light of the crash. On Wednesday, coroners for Leicester said formal identification of 60-year-old Mr Vichai had taken place, along with 32-year-old Ms Nusara, 46-year-old Ms Lechowicz and 53-year-old Mr Swaffer. Identification of the fifth victim was still in progress and no date for inquests have been set yet, police said. This video can not be played Leicester City fans gather to pay tribute to owner Striker Jamie Vardy, his wife Rebekah and club ambassador Alan Birchenall lay their own tributes at the memorial outside the stadium A huge display of floral and footballing tributes have been left outside the stadium and a steady stream of people have signed a book of condolence since it opened on Tuesday. Families of those who died, players and members of the wider Leicester community have also visited the scene. A minute's silence will be held and black armbands will be worn by players at all Premier League matches this weekend as a mark of respect, the Premier League has confirmed. Leicester players will also travel by road to their game at Cardiff on Saturday rather than fly, as it was felt insensitive to go by plane given the circumstances of Mr Vichai's death.

"Apple Watches must be returned for fixApple has withdrawn a software update after complaints that it ""bricked"" some owners' smartwatches.Technology","Some users who installed the latest WatchOS software say it caused their devices to stop working Apple has pulled an update for its smartwatches after some owners complained the software had caused their devices to stop working. The problem appears to have baffled the firm's repair staff, and there appears to be no way at present for owners to restore the products themselves. Several have said they have been told they need to send in the devices for a fix. Apple said it intended to release a revised update soon. Those affected reported that their watches had become stuck in a state showing the Apple logo - but nothing else - on their screens. One owner of a newly released Series 4 model said he had been told it would take the firm's repair staff up to a week to decide whether his device needed to be repaired or replaced. Chris Ball from Belfast said Apple Support had sent him a message saying: ""I know it's hard to be without your Watch, but this is the only service method available for Watch. Even if you went to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorised Service Provider, we'd need to ship the Watch to a repair depot."" He expressed frustration that having recently spent Â£750 on the device he would now be without it for days. ""My Apple Watch is now completely useless, stuck on the Apple logo screen,"" he told the BBC. ""So I have to wait, due to a problem Apple's software caused, meaning I have no watch. ""I would like to question their quality assurance on software.""

However, it is relatively uncommon for people to have to physically return affected items to address a software problem. ""Due to a small number of Apple Watch customers experiencing an issue while installing WatchOS 5.1 today, we've pulled back the software update as a precaution,"" Apple said in a statement. ""Any customers impacted should contact AppleCare, but no action is required if the update installed successfully. ""We are working on a fix for an upcoming software update."" The issue serves as a distraction at a time when Apple is focused on its latest launches - it unveiled new iPads and Mac computers in New York on Tuesday. The firm does not force users to adopt its latest software, but one expert suggested that in general it made sense to check the internet for reports of problems before downloading any update. ""History has shown that waiting a little while before installing the latest software can help users avoid a mishap,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""There are now numerous examples across all different manufacturers that updates can cause considerable pain for the owners of the devices they are targeted at, and it's probably wise to be cautious if you want to be certain they will keep working.""

Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament By 312 votes to 295, MPs approve budget resolution 79, which empowers the Treasury to maintain the effect of certain taxes after Brexit. Some MPs suggested it was a power grab by the government, allowing ministers to make certain changes without consulting Parliament. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Work and Pensions Minister Baroness Buscombe says the government spends more than any other developed nation on supporting families. She says that Labour created ""complicated"" systems of tax breaks and benefits for families. 1.4m people spent the majority of 2000-2010 on benefits, she says. ""The system simply was not sustainable,"" she states. There are 637,000 fewer children growing up in ""workless households"" since 2010, she states, adding that the government believes the ""best way out of poverty"" is through work. With that, the Lords adjourns. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Opposition spokesperson Baroness Drake says the Department for Work and Pensions has ""routinely dismissed evidence"" that ""it does not want to see"". Levels of child poverty are rising, along with household debt and insecure contracts or self employment, she says. She says most of the  projected increase in child poverty comes from a limit on paying child benefits to families with three or more children under universal credit. ""This is a system that is causing anxiety and hardship, wherever it is rolled out,"" she says. ""The budget was a missed opportunity to bring children in from the cold"". House of CommonsParliament By 314 to 31, MPs pass budget resolution 5, which authorises government plans to bring forward a planned rise in the personal allowance threshold. Under government plans, the point at which people start paying income tax will rise to to Â£12,500 next April - a year earlier than planned. After quickly approving a series of other motions, they divide to vote on resolution 79, which Labour said earlier they will oppose. The resolution relates to the way government can make tax changes after Brexit. BBC political correspondent tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament First up, MPs vote on resolution number 1, which authorises the government to levy income tax during the next financial year. Under parliamentary rules, this is the only one of the budget resolutions which can be amended.

Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament By 312 votes to 295, MPs approve budget resolution 79, which empowers the Treasury to maintain the effect of certain taxes after Brexit. Some MPs suggested it was a power grab by the government, allowing ministers to make certain changes without consulting Parliament. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Work and Pensions Minister Baroness Buscombe says the government spends more than any other developed nation on supporting families. She says that Labour created ""complicated"" systems of tax breaks and benefits for families. 1.4m people spent the majority of 2000-2010 on benefits, she says. ""The system simply was not sustainable,"" she states. There are 637,000 fewer children growing up in ""workless households"" since 2010, she states, adding that the government believes the ""best way out of poverty"" is through work. With that, the Lords adjourns. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Opposition spokesperson Baroness Drake says the Department for Work and Pensions has ""routinely dismissed evidence"" that ""it does not want to see"". Levels of child poverty are rising, along with household debt and insecure contracts or self employment, she says. She says most of the  projected increase in child poverty comes from a limit on paying child benefits to families with three or more children under universal credit. ""This is a system that is causing anxiety and hardship, wherever it is rolled out,"" she says. ""The budget was a missed opportunity to bring children in from the cold"". House of CommonsParliament By 314 to 31, MPs pass budget resolution 5, which authorises government plans to bring forward a planned rise in the personal allowance threshold. Under government plans, the point at which people start paying income tax will rise to to Â£12,500 next April - a year earlier than planned. After quickly approving a series of other motions, they divide to vote on resolution 79, which Labour said earlier they will oppose. The resolution relates to the way government can make tax changes after Brexit. BBC political correspondent tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament First up, MPs vote on resolution number 1, which authorises the government to levy income tax during the next financial year. Under parliamentary rules, this is the only one of the budget resolutions which can be amended. However they vote to reject Labour's amendment calling on the government to assess the Labour's own income tax proposals by 313 votes to 246. The amendment was tabled last night, amid reports Labour MPs would
defy their party whip and vote against government plans to change the higher rate income tax
threshold. Shadow chancellor John
McDonnell had said Labour would not oppose plans to raise the 40% rate to Â£50,000 from next April. The government resolution is then later approved. Debate on the Budget comes to a close, and MPs will now vote
on a series of âways and meansâ resolutions to bring in the finance bill. This is the legislation which implements the governmentâs
proposed changes to income tax and corporation tax. It is expected to be
published next week. Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss says ""this is a budget that will help working families and grow our economy."" ""Even the shadow chancellor has welcomed our tax cuts,"" she says, adding: ""it's just a shame his party don't agree with him...But there is always a space for him on our front bench"". During her speech, Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith intervenes to ask if ministers are willing to discuss the date for the new maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals before the publication of the finance bill, the legislation which implements the Budget. Ministersfaced opposition this morningover alleged delays to the new Â£2 maximum bet, which will not come into force before October next year. Liz Truss says says she is ""happy to discuss"" with MPs ""what more we can do"" about the matter. There had been reports earlier today that ministers were facing a potential rebellion from Tory MPs who had wanted the maximum stake to be brought in earlier. Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow chief secretary to the treasury Peter Dowd, wrapping up for the opposition, says ""austerity has never, and will not, end under a Tory government"". He says the government is making ""unprecedented"" attacks on Parliament and parliamentary scrutiny. ""There is nothing in this budget for our teachers, police officers or local government workers"", he says, adding that the government has ""broken all their own targets"". The money for the NHS ""is not enough"", he quotes the Health Foundation in saying, whilst social care funding is ""less than half that what is needed"". He calls on Conservatives to support a Labour amendment to the resolution on income tax which will shortly be voted on, which sets out their plans for the tax system. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord Shinkwin says one million disabled people gain around Â£110 per month due to the government targeting support to the ""most vulnerable"". He says the government is ""listening and acting"" in response to issues raised by MPs. He describes Iain Duncan-Smith as a ""champion of social justice"". He adds that he is pleased to learn that the DWP will fund Citizens' Advice in order to help out with Universal Credit payments. He accuses Labour of a ""total inability"" to accept responsibility for the ""high level of debt"" that ""Gordon Brown inflicted upon this country"". He says this would be worse under the ""Marxist"" Chancellor McDonnell if Labour were to win a general election. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Livermore, who worked for ten years in the Treasury during the last Labour government, says that Labour's work in office led to reductions in child poverty. He says that any cuts the Chancellor now imposes, with ""austerity over"", are out of ""political choice"". Those at the bottom 30% of income distribution will still earn less after the planned changes to the personal allowance, he says. He says it would cost Â£1.5bn to reverse benefit cuts, but the Chancellor has made Â£2.8bn in tax cuts, of which half go to the top 10%. He says many families in receipt of benefits are now Â£1,940 a year worse off. He adds that it is a ""bad choice for Labour to support"" these new tax cuts. Benefit cuts debate The Bishop of Portsmouth says it would be ""negligent""
to not express the ""likely impacts"" of other changes ""coming
down the tracks"". He says families with disabled children shortly face an
""unjust, shameful reduction"" in their benefits. He states that he cannot accept the ""government's
rationale"" for the two child limit on benefits, adding that this doesn't
take into account a redundancy or a family breakdown. ""Children already in need will be in greater need""
with further cuts, he says. Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Baroness Jenkin of Kennington says the government has a duty to ensure money is ""well-spent,"" with benefits spending equivalent to 28% of government expenditure. People are paying less in income tax since 2010, she says, and people are able to keep more of what they earn. Youth unemployment has fallen by 40% since 2010, she adds. ""Those calling to dismantle UC risk throwing out the baby with the bathwater"". Benefit cuts debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Bassam of Brighton is now opening a debate on the impact of reducing welfare benefits, universal credit payments, tax credits, housing benefits and child benefit. He pays tribute to former Labour minister Baroness Hollis, whodied earlier this month, for fighting against cuts to universal credit and other benefits. The last Labour government managed to bring 1.1m out of child poverty, he states. Social security cuts ""continue to hit the poorest hardest,"" he adds. Problem gamblers debate House of LordsParliament Government spokesperson Baroness Manzoor says that she ""recognises the strong feelings across this House"" on gambling addiction. The rates of problem gambling in the UK have remained ""relatively stable"" over the years, she says, at around 1% of the population. There is not enough data on what can be done to stop people from ""stepping into problem gambling in the first place,"" she states. The GambleAware charity commissions treatment services such as counselling and helplines, she adds. Problem gamblers debate House of LordsParliament Shadow culture minister Lord Stevenson of Balmacara says that problem gamblers are more likely to relapse, and the rate of suicide among sufferers is high. He says new technology enables more people ""to get involved in this dreadful world"". Other countries have introduced bans on advertising for gambling during, before and after live sporting events on TV, he says. The number of suicides is ""such an extraordinarily worrying issue,"" he tells peers. Budget Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge says a ""truthful conversation"" needs to take place with voters about ""how much we need to raise in tax to fund public services"". She had hoped to welcome the new digital services tax, she says, but calls the government's proposal ""little more than a PR stunt"". Google and Facebook ""should have paid Â£480m in 2017"", she says, which exceeds the government's Â£400m projection for revenue from all tech firms.

US presses Saudis to agree Yemen ceasefireSecretary of State Mike Pompeo calls on Saudi-led forces to end air strikes on populated areas.,"This video can not be played The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues The US has called for a swift cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where three years of civil war have caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Defence Secretary James Mattis said all parties needed to take part in UN-led peace talks within the next 30 days. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meanwhile urged the Saudi-led coalition battling the rebel Houthi movement to end its air strikes on populated areas. The US has faced growing pressure to end its support for the coalition. UN human rights experts saycoalition forces may have committed war crimes in Yemenand humanitarian organisations saytheir partial blockade of the country has helped push 14 million people to the brink of famine. The murder of the US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agentsin Istanbul this month has also strained ties between Washington and Riyadh. Hunt 'welcomes' US Yemen announcement The sick children trapped by the war Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. They have received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. Air strikes have caused widespread damage and many civilian casualties At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,560 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. Speaking at the US Institute of Peace in Washington on Tuesday, Mr Mattis said the US had been watching the conflict ""for long enough"". ""We have got to move towards a peace effort here, and we can't say we are going to do it sometime in the future. We need to be doing this in the next 30 days,"" he said. Mr Mattis added that all sides were being urged to meet UN special envoy Martin Griffiths in Sweden in November and ""come to a solution"". This video can not be played Headmaster grieves for the ""sons"" he lost In a separate statement, Mr Pompeo called on the Houthis to end missile and drone strikes on Saudi Arabia and the UAE,external, and on the coalition to subsequently cease air strikes on all populated areas in Yemen. ""It is time to end this conflict, replace conflict with compromise, and allow the Yemeni people to heal through peace and reconstruction,"" he added. The Trump administration has previously backed Mr Griffiths' mediation efforts and called for a settlement in keeping withUN Security Council 2216,external, which demands that the Houthis withdraw from all areas they have seized and relinquish their heavy weapons. The Houthis have rejected those demands. Ending Yemenâs never-ending war Witnessing Yemen's desperate suffering Families of bus strike victims despair at global response By James Landale, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News For months the Trump administration has said little about this bloody conflict, leaving its Saudi allies to take the lead. But the remarks by Mr Mattis and Mr Pompeo show the US is now engaging in a way it has not for some time. Until now both the US and the UK have resisted calling formally for a ceasefire through the UN while it was obvious that neither side was willing to contemplate one. But that seems to have changed. The question, of course, is why? Diplomats point to the growing pressure from the US Congress to act ahead of the mid-term elections. The US might also be hoping to use the backlash against Saudi Arabia over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi to put pressure on Riyadh to try to end the conflict. Some diplomats have even spoken of a Saudi compromise on Yemen being part of the rehabilitation of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto leader. The big question is how Iran, the main backer of the Houthi rebels, will react. Some diplomats have suggested that Tehran would not be unhappy to step back from Yemen, that its involvement there was always opportunistic rather than strategic, and that it has bigger priorities elsewhere. But it is not clear whether Iran would be willing to help the US when it is re-imposing sanctions on its economy after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. So the US move is important, but there is still a long way to go before a ceasefire becomes possible, let alone a political process to end the conflict for good. There was no immediate response from the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis or Yemen's government. Mr Griffiths said the UN welcomed the US calls,externaland stressed that there could be no military solution to the conflict. ""We remain committed to bring the Yemeni parties to the negotiations table within a month. Dialogue remains the only path to reach an inclusive agreement,"" he said. Mr Griffiths suffered a setback last month when Houthi representatives refused to fly to Geneva for the first peace talks in two years because of what they said was the UN's failure to guarantee their safe return to the rebel-controlled capital Sanaa. This video can not be played Newsnight: Jeremy Hunt says a humanitarian corridor could be created in Yemen UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted,external: ""All parties must listen to the important call from the US for de-escalation in Yemen, in line with the UK's long-standing position. I discussed this issue with Martin Griffiths... at the FCO last night and we must back his efforts to find a political solution to the hilt."" A spokeswoman for the International Rescue Committee, a charity operating in Yemen, said hostilities needed to end as soon as possible so aid could be delivered to those suffering the most. ""From our perspective there's a lot that could have been done before a call for this ceasefire, but [it] is a significant breakthrough in this war and a welcome recognition that the current policy is failing,"" Kellie Ryan said.

Being wrong weight 'cuts four years off life',"Being overweight or underweight could knock four years off life expectancy, a study in a Lancet journal suggests. The report, one of the largest of its kind,,externalinvolved nearly 2 million people who were registered with doctors in the UK. Researchers found that, from the age of 40, people at the higher end of the healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) range had the lowest risk of dying from disease. But people at the top and bottom ends of the BMI risked having shorter lives. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height. A ""healthy"" BMI score ranges from 18.5 to 25. Most doctors say it is the best method they have of working out whether someone is obese because it is accurate and simple to measure. The study, published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, showed that life expectancy for obese men and women was 4.2 and 3.5 years shorter respectively than people in the entire healthy BMI weight range. The difference for underweight men and women was 4.3 (men) and 4.5 (women) years. BMI was associated with all causes of death categories, except transport-related accidents, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. The places where too many are fat and too many are thin Low-calorie shakes and soup diets 'recommended for obese' Obesity and BMI: 'If I wasn't this size I wouldn't have a job' Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? However, not everybody in the healthy category is at the lowest risk of disease, according to report author Dr Krishnan Bhaskaran. He told the BBC: ""For most causes of death we found that there was an 'optimal' BMI level, with risk of death increasing both below and above that level. ""At BMIs below 21, we observed more deaths from most causes, compared with the optimum BMI levels. However, this might partly reflect the fact that low body weight can be a marker of underlying ill-health. ""For most causes of death, the bigger the weight difference, the bigger the association we observed with mortality risk. ""So a weight difference of half a stone would make a relatively small (but real) difference; we could detect these small effects because this was a very large study.""

""We know from the diabetes remission data how low-calorie diets and weight loss can improve diabetes, for example,"" she said. ""And we know weight loss can also help in improving risk so that would also then improve mortality rates."" The report suggested that a higher BMI in older people may not be as dangerous, because a bit of extra weight was ""protective"" for them.

The Houthis have rejected those demands. Ending Yemenâs never-ending war Witnessing Yemen's desperate suffering Families of bus strike victims despair at global response By James Landale, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News For months the Trump administration has said little about this bloody conflict, leaving its Saudi allies to take the lead. But the remarks by Mr Mattis and Mr Pompeo show the US is now engaging in a way it has not for some time. Until now both the US and the UK have resisted calling formally for a ceasefire through the UN while it was obvious that neither side was willing to contemplate one. But that seems to have changed. The question, of course, is why? Diplomats point to the growing pressure from the US Congress to act ahead of the mid-term elections. The US might also be hoping to use the backlash against Saudi Arabia over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi to put pressure on Riyadh to try to end the conflict. Some diplomats have even spoken of a Saudi compromise on Yemen being part of the rehabilitation of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto leader. The big question is how Iran, the main backer of the Houthi rebels, will react. Some diplomats have suggested that Tehran would not be unhappy to step back from Yemen, that its involvement there was always opportunistic rather than strategic, and that it has bigger priorities elsewhere. But it is not clear whether Iran would be willing to help the US when it is re-imposing sanctions on its economy after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. So the US move is important, but there is still a long way to go before a ceasefire becomes possible, let alone a political process to end the conflict for good. There was no immediate response from the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis or Yemen's government. Mr Griffiths said the UN welcomed the US calls,externaland stressed that there could be no military solution to the conflict. ""We remain committed to bring the Yemeni parties to the negotiations table within a month. Dialogue remains the only path to reach an inclusive agreement,"" he said. Mr Griffiths suffered a setback last month when Houthi representatives refused to fly to Geneva for the first peace talks in two years because of what they said was the UN's failure to guarantee their safe return to the rebel-controlled capital Sanaa.

US calls for swift ceasefire in YemenUS Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urge all sides to hold talks soon.Middle East,"This video can not be played The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues The US has called for a swift cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where three years of civil war have caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Defence Secretary James Mattis said all parties needed to take part in UN-led peace talks within the next 30 days. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meanwhile urged the Saudi-led coalition battling the rebel Houthi movement to end its air strikes on populated areas. The US has faced growing pressure to end its support for the coalition. UN human rights experts saycoalition forces may have committed war crimes in Yemenand humanitarian organisations saytheir partial blockade of the country has helped push 14 million people to the brink of famine. The murder of the US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agentsin Istanbul this month has also strained ties between Washington and Riyadh. Hunt 'welcomes' US Yemen announcement The sick children trapped by the war Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. They have received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. Air strikes have caused widespread damage and many civilian casualties At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,560 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. Speaking at the US Institute of Peace in Washington on Tuesday, Mr Mattis said the US had been watching the conflict ""for long enough"".

MPs in new attempt to question ZuckerbergBritish and Canadian politicians request Facebook boss appear before joint data privacy hearing.UK Politics,"MPs are stepping up their campaign to get Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg to appear before them to answer questions on data privacy and disinformation. The Commons Digital Culture is joining forces with its Canadian counterpart to hold a joint hearing on 27 November. Its chair Damian Collins has urged Mr Zuckerberg to appear, saying his ""evidence is now overdue and urgent"".

University halts unconditional offers,"A London university has said it is stopping making unconditional offers to would-be students, to ensure it maintains its entry standards. St Mary's University, Twickenham, took the decision after discovering some students, given unconditional offers, did not get their predicted grades. There has been a rise in the number of unconditional offers in recent years, which has drawn criticism. Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said it undermined the education system. Last year, nearly a quarter of applicants from England, Wales and Northern Ireland received at least one unconditional offer. That is where they do not need to achieve certain grades in order to be admitted. In total 67,915 unconditional offers were made to 18-year-olds in 2018. The university and college admissions service said the offers were not necessarily being made to the highest-achieving candidates. Unions said the situation risked encouraging teenagers not to strive for the best A-level results possible. And Mr Gyimah said giving out unconditional offers just to put ""bums on seats"" damaged the credibility of the university system. He also said they risked distracting students from the final year of their schooling, and could sway them into making decisions they may not have otherwise made. John Brewer, Pro Vice Chancellor of St Mary's University said: ""We believe that we've made the right decision to withdraw unconditional offers. ""We are determined to maintain standards of entry to St Mary's and by listening to the views of schools, teachers, our own staff and students we believe that with the evidence that has been available to us that we've made the right decision."" He added: ""It was clear to us that a number of students who enrolled with us after an unconditional offer was made didn't meet the grades they expected."" People with conditional offers were found to be more likely to achieve their grades. Last year the university, which has degree entry tariffs ranging from BBB to BBC, made 499 unconditional offers. It was the first year it made them and the university said the data showed it was not worth pursuing. Head of policy and campaigns at the University and College Union, Matt Waddup said: ""The decision by St Mary's demonstrates the desperate need to overhaul our failing admissions system. ""We are alone in the world in persisting with a system where students are offered university places based on highly inaccurate predicted grades. ""Unconditional offers have made a mockery of exams and led to inflated grade predictions, while putting students under enormous pressure to make a snap decision about their future. ""The simplest and fairest way to deal with these problems is for us to adopt a system of post-qualification admissions, where offers are based on actual achievement rather than estimated potential.""

Suzy Lamplugh search enters day three,"Suzy Lamplugh was reported missing at 18:45 BST on 28 July 1986 The sister of a murdered estate agent hopes her body will be found so the family can ""finally have closure"". Suzy Lamplugh, 25, from London, disappeared in July 1986 and was declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994. A body has never been found. Police have been searching the back garden of a house once owned by the mother of prime suspect John Cannan in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. Lizzie Bingham said the family were ""cautious"" about the latest search. What do we know about Suzy Lamplugh? A fourth forensic tent was erected closer to the house, in the garden, of the property on Wednesday. Ms Bingham told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""We have seen various police searches over the years so we are cautious. ""But we hope Suzy's body will be found and we can have the closure we really need."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The property in Shipton Road, Sutton Coldfield, is being searched by police Owner Phillip Carey bought the home in Shipton Road from the mother of Cannan, a convicted killer. Mr Carey, 52, told the BBC he was yet to discuss with police whether he and his family would have to move out of the semi-detached house as the search entered day three. He said police were interested in what was underneath concrete where a garage once stood and the iron structure was dismantled by police. New police search for Suzy Lamplugh body The Metropolitan Police is leading the operation, supported by officers from the West Midlands force. John Cannan bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of a man seen with Ms Lamplugh on the day she went missing It was reported by The Sun that police allegedlymissed the chance to catch the estate agent's killer because a senior detective fell out with her mother.,external The Met Police said a review was carried out in 2000 ""in line with its murder investigation policy at that time"". The review led to a reinvestigation, a spokesman said. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands A reinvestigation of the case has also drawn criticism when the back garden currently being searched was not dug up in 2003. Jim Dickie, a former Met Police deputy chief inspector who led a review of the case between 2000 and 2006, told the BBC: ""I don't think we did an extensive search there. ""The reason for that was that we had no evidence or intelligence to lead us to believe that John Cannan may have secreted Suzy's body there or indeed there was any other evidence which would assist with our review of the murder."" He believed cold case detectives were likely acting on ""new evidence"". Areas at the rear of the house were being searched Ms Lamplugh disappeared after going to meet a client in Fulham. He was known only as ""Mr Kipper"" and was never traced. No-one has ever been charged in connection with the disappearance, but in 2002 police named Cannan as the only suspect. He always denied any involvement and no prosecution has ever been brought, with police citing insufficient evidence. Three days before Ms Lamplugh's disappearance, Cannan, now aged 64, was released from prison, where he had been serving a six-year sentence for rape. Sites in Worcester and Somerset have been searched previously He bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of a man with whom the estate agent was seen talking on the day she went missing - thought to be the mysterious Mr Kipper. According to reports, Cannan was nicknamed Kipper while serving his earlier sentence. In 1989, Cannan was jailed for life for the abduction and murder of Bristol newlywed Shirley Banks and two further rapes. Two sites in Worcestershire - a former Army barracks and a field outside thevillage of Drakes Broughton-  and a woodland in the Quantock Hills, Somerset, have also been searched in the hunt for Ms Lamplugh's body.

Car and house insurance faces FCA probe,"The City regulator is to investigate how home and car insurance policies are priced after finding ""hidden"" discrimination between customers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will study the scale of the issue, whom it affects, and possible solutions. Insurance customers may pay different prices depending on how loyal they are, their age, and whether they are online. Marital status, home postcode and employment status may also have a hidden effect on price, the FCA said. Citizens Advice has already warned loyal customers are being ""ripped off"". It launched a super-complaint claiming that customers who stick with the same supplier for a variety of household services are losing a total of Â£4.1bn a year. That amounts to an average of Â£877 per person. Failing to shop around, or the inability to do so, costs people hundreds of pounds. This is known in the industry as ""price walking"" - where the cost of insurance is increased each year the customer sticks with the same provider, eventually making their policy much more expensive (and profitable for the insurer) than for a new customer. Park on the drive, and other tips for cheaper insurance Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers pledge fairer premiums for long-term customers Part of the response to the Citizens Advice complaint is this review into the general insurance market by the FCA. The FCA said UK insurers generated Â£78bn in premiums from customers and that 82% of adults had one or more general insurance products. In an analysis of the home insurance market, the FCA said there was evidence of significant price competition for new customers with new policies offered at 30% below the cost of providing the policy and firms increased premiums in the second and third years of the policy. BBC website readers have told of how they challenged their insurance renewal price - and saw the cost drop dramatically. Jeffrey Allen says: ""Last year, I challenged the premium which was Â£1,100 after my son said he was paying Â£600 for a similar-sized house in a similar area. In the 20-plus years [with the same insurer], we have made one claim for a leak in one room. After a 10-minute call and threatening to go elsewhere, the premium dropped to Â£650."" Paul Strong says in the first year of home emergency insurance, he was quoted Â£114, in the second it was Â£278, and in the third it was Â£522. ""I said Â£300 would be reasonable to include inflation and increase in Insurance Premium Tax. They agreed to this immediately,"" he says. Paul texted BBC Radio 5 live to say: ""[My insurer] quoted me Â£1,400 for a multi-car renewal this week. I called them and got the price reduced by Â£400. Crazy."" The regulator has now written to the chief executives of insurance firms to set out that it expects them to treat customers fairly. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said: ""This market study will help us examine the outcomes from general insurance pricing practices and inform how, if necessary, we should intervene to improve the market. ""If change is needed to make the market work well for consumers, we will consider all possible remedies to achieve this."" The FCA said it had already found some firms were not complying with its rules about information that customers should receive when they renew their policies and could use its regulatory powers against those with whom it had concerns. These rules include making it clear in a renewal letter how much people paid the previous year. In November last year, the BBC revealed how some insurers wereburying these pricing detailsdeep in renewal documents. Inthe letter to the heads of insurance firms,external, Mr Bailey said: ""There is a significant risk of consumer harm if your firm has not implemented an appropriate pricing strategy with effective governance and controls to determine and monitor your pricing activities and evaluate how your pricing decisions will affect consumer outcomes."" In May, insurers said they would crack down on ""excessive"" differences in premiums for new customers and existing policyholders. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) said their Guiding Principles and Action Points should mean ""an improvement in the outcomes for long-standing customers"". However, the FCA investigation seems to challenge whether this response was sufficient. Hugh Savill, the ABI's director of regulation, said: ""While many customers benefit from competitive motor and home insurance markets with lower premiums, we agree that the market is not working as well as it should for some long-standing customers. ""This is an important issue and insurers will work with the FCA to address issues raised in the report to  ensure that the market works as well as possible for all consumers.""

Pakistan acquits Christian on death row,"This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row A Pakistani court has overturned the death sentence of a Christian woman convicted of blasphemy, a case that has polarised the nation. Asia Bibi was convicted in 2010 after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a row with her neighbours. She always maintained her innocence, but has spent most of the past eight years in solitary confinement. The landmark ruling has already set off violent protests by hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws. Demonstrations against the verdict are being held in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Multan. Clashes with police have been reported. The Red Zone in the capital Islamabad, where the Supreme Court is located, has been sealed off by police, and paramilitary forces have been deployed to keep protesters away from the court. Demonstrations have been held in several cities including Peshawar Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, who read out the ruling, said Asia Bibi could walk free from jail in Sheikupura, near Lahore, immediately if not wanted in connection with any other case. She was not in court to hear the ruling, but reacted to the verdict from prison with apparent disbelief. ""I can't believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really?"" AFP news agency quoted her as saying by phone. Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Asia Bibi and a lonely Christmas in a prison cell The Muslims building a Christian church in Pakistan The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made three offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. By Secunder Kermani, BBC News, Islamabad The court delivered its verdict quickly, no doubt aware of the sensitivity of the case and the danger of a violent reaction to it. Asia Bibi's lawyer, closely flanked by a policeman, told me he was ""happy"" with the verdict, but also afraid for his and his client's safety. Even after she is freed, the legacy of her case will continue. Shortly after her conviction a prominent politician,Punjab Governor Salman Taseer, was murdered for speaking out in her supportand calling for the blasphemy laws to be reformed. The killer - Mumtaz Qadri - was executed, but has become a cult hero with a large shrine dedicated to him on the outskirts of Islamabad. His supporters also created a political party - campaigning to preserve the blasphemy laws - which gathered around two million votes in this year's general election. It's the same party which many fear could be responsible for violent unrest in the coming days. Laws enacted by the British Raj in 1860 made it a crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship, punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Several more clauses were added in the 1980s by Pakistan's military ruler Gen Zia ul-Haq: 1980 - up to three years in jail for derogatory remarks against Islamic personages 1982 - life imprisonment for ""wilful"" desecration of the Koran 1986 - ""death, or imprisonment for life"" for blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws? The judges said the prosecution had ""categorically failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"". The case was based on flimsy evidence, they said, and proper procedures had not been followed. The alleged confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". The ruling heavily referenced the Koran and Islamic history.,externalIt ended with a quote from the Hadith, the collected sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, which calls for non-Muslims to be treated kindly. Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hardline politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemers in Pakistan The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Many of the attacks are motivated by blasphemy cases, but others have come in reaction to the US-led war in Afghanistan. No-one has ever been executed under the laws, but some people accused of the offence have been lynched or murdered. Asia Bibi, who was born in 1971 and has four children, was the first woman to be sentenced to death under the laws. Salman Taseer had taken up Asia Bibi's cause and called for reform of the blasphemy laws Internationally, her conviction has been widely condemned as a breach of human rights. There are fears that there could be a violent response to her acquittal. Asia Bibi's husband and daughter say they fear for their safety in Pakistan As with her previous trials and appeals, large crowds gathered outside the court in Islamabad on Wednesday demanding her conviction be upheld and the execution carried out. She has been offered asylum by several countries and is expected to leave the country. Her daughter, Eisham Ashiq, had previously told the AFP news agency that if she were released: ""I will hug her and will cry meeting her and will thank God that he has got her released."" But the family said they feared for their safety and would likely have to leave Pakistan. Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

NHS staff face violence 'every day',"This video can not be played Shocking footage of attacks and aggression at Welsh hospitals Police are called to at least one violent incident against NHS staff each day on average, figures have suggested. Statistics from four health boards showed officers were called 521 times in 2017/18 and 2,719 times since 2013. One nurse said she struggled to pass a street in Newport where she was attacked by a patient's husband on a home visit. She spoke out as a bill to double the sentence for assaults on emergency workers was discussed in Parliament. In total, there were more than 7,900 incidents of physical or verbal assault against Welsh NHS staff in the year to March - suggesting on any given day, 20 workers face abuse. Body cameras deter attacks and abuse at Welsh hospitals Body cams for paramedics in Wales after attack spike Emergency worker attacks law backed by AMs Jane Carroll, a senior Royal College of Nursing (RCN) officer, who was attacked while out on a home visit said calling the police was not taken lightly. ""He was circling me and shouting at me and as I opened the door two hands came very hard on my back. I fell over and took the skin off my knees,"" she said. ""I sat in my car and cried for a little while but realised I couldn't stay there because I felt vulnerable."" This video can not be played Police 'disruptive but needed' in hospital ""When you go into your shift you don't expect to have to deal with the police,"" she added. ""It's not appropriate to have that disruption, but to do what you have to do, sometimes you have to call on them."" On Friday,a private members bill,externallaunched by Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant was given its second reading in the House of Lords, having passed a major hurdle by getting the backing of the UK government and being passed by the Commons. If approved by the Lords and brought into law later this year, it would see the maximum prison sentence for a common assault double from six months to one year, if the victim is a firefighter, police officer, prison officer, search and rescue volunteer, or NHS worker. Chris Bryant said attacks on emergency workers were an attack on ""all of us"" Ms Carroll said she often has to support RCN members who have experienced violence on the job. ""I think it's a sad a sign of the times that we need a bill from Chris Bryant to address this behaviour,"" she added. ""We also have to realise the impact this has on the relationship between health workers and the patient. It's not good."" 'Most staff have been attacked' Emergency staff suffer horrific attacks Last week the Welsh Ambulance Service said it was considering giving body cameras to paramedics after a spike in ambulance staff being attacked. And Home Office data indicates police forces in Wales reported 950 assaults on officers in 2016/17, while latest figures from Wales' three fire services indicate firefighters were attacked almost 145 in the last five years.

Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted,"Lahore is one of several cities with a significant Christian population Pakistan's Christians, like other religious minorities in the country, have been the target of escalating attacks in recent years. The attacks, on their residential areas and places of worship, have mostly been motivated by the country's controversial blasphemy laws. But there have also been political motives. The BBC's M Ilyas Khan explains more about the community and why it is being targeted. Pakistan is overwhelmingly Muslim but Christians and Hindus make up the largest minority groups, with each representing about 1.6% of the population. Besides Karachi, other cities like Lahore, Faisalabad and Peshawar also have Christian populations The southern metropolis of Karachi has a large Christian population, as do the cities of Lahore and Faisalabad. There are countless Christian villages in the Punjab heartland, while there is also a sizeable population in the deeply conservative north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, particularly in Peshawar city. Before the partition of India, what is now Pakistan was a much more diverse place but tolerance has declined as society has become increasingly Islamicised and more homogenous. Minorities used to make up 15% of the population in these cities. Now they account for less than 4%. The majority of Pakistan's Christians are descended from low-caste Hindus who converted during the British Raj - partly to escape the caste system. Religious minorities including Christians have been increasingly targeted amid the growing Islamicisation of Pakistan Many provided labour in garrison towns. In fact, to this day, every cantonment city in Pakistan has an area known as Lal Kurti, which is traditionally where the Christians reside. But Christian communities remain among the poorest sections of society and often still do menial jobs. Entire villages in parts of Punjab are Christian and their inhabitants work as labourers and farmhands. However, there are sections of the Christian community that are more well off. Better educated and mainly settled in Karachi, they came over from Goa during the British Raj. What all of them share, though, is a sense of vulnerability. This has seen a number of wealthier Christians leaving Pakistan to settle in countries like Canada and Australia as they feel the climate of intolerance in the country has become unbearable. Muslims and Christians mostly co-exist amiably enough without frequent outbreaks of animosity. Butaccusations of blasphemyhave also often led to mob violence against Christians, while militant Islamists have also targeted the community. Recent attacks include: An attack on a churchin Quetta in December 2017 that killed nine people and injured 57 A suicide attack targeting Christianscelebrating Easter at a Lahore playground in March 2016 left 70 dead and more than 340 wounded Two bomb blasts at churchesin Lahore in March 2015 killed 14 and hurt more than 70 people A twin suicide bomb attack at aPeshawar church in 2013left around 80 dead In 2009, nearly 40 houses and a church were burnt by a mob inGojra town in Punjab,external, with eight people burnt alive In 2005, hundreds fled their homes in Faisalabad as churches and Christian schools were set on fire by a mob, after a resident was blamed for burning pages of the Koran Christians mounted anti-Taliban protests following the 2013 Peshawar bomb attacks Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have also been convicted of ""desecrating the Koran"" or ""blaspheming against the Prophet Muhammad"", although experts say most accusations are fuelled by personal disputes. While most were handed death sentences by lower courts, those sentences were often set aside by higher courts due to lack of evidence or because the complainants were found to be targeting the community for economic benefits. In 2012,a Christian girl, Rimsha Masih, became the first non-Muslim to be acquitted in a blasphemy case when it was discovered she had been framed by a local Muslim cleric. Many Islamists saw Qadri as a martyr and protested against his execution Perhaps the best known example is that ofAsia Bibi, a Christian woman from a Punjab village who in 2010 got into an altercation with some Muslim women and was later accused by them of having blasphemed. Salman Taseer, the then governor of Punjab who stated that Pakistan's strict blasphemy law had been abused in the case, was latermurdered by his Islamist bodyguard, Mumtaz Qadri. Qadri was found guilty and executed in February 2016, promptingmass protests. Pakistan's minister for minority affairs and a Christian leader,Shahbaz Bhatti,was assassinated in 2011 by the Taliban for speaking out against the law. Many Christians are among the poorest in Pakistani society Some of the violence is directly related to the American-led war in Afghanistan, so it has an expressly political motive. Months after the US-led coalition attacked Afghanistan in late 2001, agrenade attack on a chapel,externalinside a Christian mission hospital in Taxila city killed four people. A couple of months later, gunmen executed six workers of a Christian charity in their Karachi office.  These incidents, although isolated, have continued through the years. Attacks on Pakistan's Christian and Hindu minorities could be part of a militant plan to send a message to the West or embarrass the country's civilian governments when they appear to be too friendly to the West. This may also be a strategy by the country's powerful military which is known to have protected Islamist militants operating in Afghanistan and India, and hassupported anti-blasphemy vigilante groups in the past.

'Most staff have been attacked',"Dr Brittain-George said most staff had been attacked or felt unsafe The body set up to advise hospitals on staff safety is to end that work at the end of March, the BBC has discovered. This is despite figures showing almost 200 assaults on doctors, nurses and other NHS staff in England every day. One A&E doctor said ""most NHS staff"" could say they had been attacked or felt unsafe at work. NHS Protect said it could not comment before a staff consultation ended but the government said it believed a new approach was needed to protect staff. The body was tasked with overseeing the measures that trusts were taking to stop physical attacks on doctors and nurses. It has co-ordinated safety standards and held trusts to account since 2003. Dr Jess Brittain-George, who works in accident and emergency, said: ""Most NHS staff can say they've been attacked or felt unsafe at work, especially those of us on the front line. ""Everyone is on alert and looking out for the patient who is going to kick off. ""When I joined as a student in 2008 it was never mentioned.  I did an A&E placement and no-one talked about it. ""Now it's a running joke in the staffroom - 'What's happened to you today? I've been hit again', or something like that."" Kim Sunley was shocked by the number of assaults on NHS staff Dr Brittain-George works in a hospital that takes staff security seriously and has seen attacks decline, but she says elsewhere in the health service security ""isn't stellar"" and has been frustrated by the unwillingness of police officers to investigate. She says a man told an A&E receptionist that he intended to wait outside to kill her when she left work. ""The police didn't care. They said, 'It's just a threat and it isn't important.' But everyone knows that a threat to your life is an offence and it is prosecutable."" Nurses' leaders say the intense pressure on the health service has fuelled attacks on staff. In total, 70,555 NHS staff were assaulted in 2015-16, according to NHS Protect figures - up 4% on the previous year. Kim Sunley, of the Royal College of Nursing, described it as ""an absolutely shocking figure"". ""You see some horrible physical assaults - people being punched in the face, grabbed by the throat, limbs being broken, chairs being thrown at people. ""There's the physical impact of the injury, but also the psychological impact, the long-term effect. People are traumatised. ""Where people are frustrated and are having to wait a long time, an environment that isn't fit for purpose so you have trolleys in corridors, it's going to increase tension, it's going to increase frustration and it's a tinderbox atmosphere."" Many assaults are carried out by people who lack mental capacity, but it is thought some claim mental disability as a way of dissuading the police from investigating. NHS Protect has stepped in to secure convictions in cases when the police have decided not to act. On the issue of ending security work, NHS Protect said in a statement that it was ""not appropriate for us to comment in detail"" before the consultation with staff ended on 1 March. But it confirmed that it was consulting staff about plans under which ""our organisation would not be tasked with security management work"". It added: ""Work continues on the potential of identifying who might be best placed to take the lead on guiding this work, if it is felt appropriate that another body should take it forward"". A Department of Health said its proposals come amid a ""persistently high numbers of these unacceptable incidents"". A spokesperson added: ""NHS staff work incredibly hard in a high-pressure environment, and it is completely unacceptable for them to be subject to aggression or violence. ""Trusts should have no hesitation in involving the police and pressing for the strongest penalties against offenders.""

Mystery as bones found at Vatican property,"The family of Emanuela Orlandi have long campaigned to find out what happened to her Human remains found at a property in Rome owned by the Vatican could hold the clue to a 35-year-old mystery. The bone fragments were found during construction work at the Vatican's embassy to Italy, near the city's famous Villa Borghese museum. A Vatican statement said experts were trying to determine the age and sex of the remains, and the date of death. Italian media have speculated they may be those of a teenage daughter of a Vatican employee who vanished in 1983. The disappearance of 15-year-old Emanuela Orlandi has been widely linked either to organised crime or to an attempt to force the release from prison of Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish man who tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981. Gangster's body exhumed over missing girl case Mafia turncoat asks to 'confess secrets' to Pope Orlandi's brother Pietro, has campaigned for decades to find out what happened to her. He has accused the Vatican of remaining silent in the case. But the remains could be those of Mirella Gregori, who disappeared in Rome 40 days before Orlandi and was also aged 15, media also report. A mural in Rome commemorates missing girls Emanuela Orlandi (R) and Mirella Gregori She answered the intercom at her family's apartment and told her parents it was a schoolfriend. She said she was going out to speak to him, and never returned. Detectives say it is possible that the cases are connected. ""During restoration works in a space annexed to the Apostolic Nunciature of Italy... fragments of human bone were found,"" the Vatican said in a statement. It said that as soon as the remains were found the Vatican's gendarmerie informed the Italian authorities, and the Holy See, and an investigation was launched. The Vatican has said on several occasions that it has co-operated fully with police investigating the Orlandi case.

Bolsonaro merger plan 'threat to Amazon',"This video can not be played Brazil's highly biodiverse Cerrado is being destroyed for soybean production, conservationists say Brazil's far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro will merge the ministries of agriculture and the environment, an aide says, in a move which critics say could endanger the Amazon rainforest. Mr Bolsonaro's future chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, announced the new ""super ministry"" as details of the new administration began to emerge. The controversial new Brazilian leader is supported by the agribusiness lobby. A former environment minister tweeted that the move was ""tragic"". ""This disastrous decision will bring serious damage to Brazil and will pass on to consumers abroad the idea that all Brazilian agribusiness survives thanks to the destruction of forests,"" Marina Silva said. Can Bolsonaro ride the 'Bullsonaro wave'? Jair Bolsonaro: The Trump of the Tropics? Earlier, Vice President-elect Hamilton Mourao dismissed environmentalists' concerns about development in the Amazon, saying the government would act responsibly by managing the spread of agriculture in the region. The Amazon region holds the largest tropical rainforest in the world and is home to plant and animal species that are still being discovered by scientists. Is the Amazon facing new dangers? Most of its millions of square kilometres are inside Brazil, where under laws dating back to 1965, landowners must keep a percentage of their terrain forested. The Amazon rainforest loses vast areas to deforestation every year That percentage ranges from 20% in some parts of the country to 80% in the Amazon. But a debate has raged in Brazil over the often conflicting needs of environmental protection and economic development. Earlier this yearthe supreme court upheld major changes to lawswhich environmentalists say will make illegal deforestation acceptable. Mr Bolsonaro, 63, has previously suggested that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. He says its requirements compromise Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon region. This video can not be played Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil's presidential election. But who is he? In the run-up to the election he had suggested merging the agriculture and environment ministries, saying, ""Let's be clear: the future ministry will come from the productive sector. We won't have any more fights over this."" Warned by activists that such a move would undermine the environment ministry's controls on the commercial sector, he struck a more conciliatory tone saying he was ""open to negotiation on that issue"". Following behind-closed-door talks on Tuesday, Mr Bolsonaro's top economic adviser Paulo Guedes confirmed that an economic super-ministry would be formed combining finance, planning, industry and trade. It will be headed by Mr Guedes. Senior aide Onyx Lorenzoni (C) and economist Paulo Guedes (L) held talks with Mr Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro Mr Lorenzoni also announced that Mr Bolsonaro's first foreign visits would be to Chile, Israel and the US. He described them as countries that ""share our worldview."" Mr Bolsonaro swept to victory in Sunday's election, easily beating his left-wing rival Fernando Haddad.

Court acquits Christian woman on death row,"This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row A Pakistani court has overturned the death sentence of a Christian woman convicted of blasphemy, a case that has polarised the nation. Asia Bibi was convicted in 2010 after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a row with her neighbours. She always maintained her innocence, but has spent most of the past eight years in solitary confinement. The landmark ruling has already set off violent protests by hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws. Demonstrations against the verdict are being held in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Multan. Clashes with police have been reported. The Red Zone in the capital Islamabad, where the Supreme Court is located, has been sealed off by police, and paramilitary forces have been deployed to keep protesters away from the court. Demonstrations have been held in several cities including Peshawar Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, who read out the ruling, said Asia Bibi could walk free from jail in Sheikupura, near Lahore, immediately if not wanted in connection with any other case. She was not in court to hear the ruling, but reacted to the verdict from prison with apparent disbelief. ""I can't believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really?"" AFP news agency quoted her as saying by phone. Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Asia Bibi and a lonely Christmas in a prison cell The Muslims building a Christian church in Pakistan The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made three offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. By Secunder Kermani, BBC News, Islamabad The court delivered its verdict quickly, no doubt aware of the sensitivity of the case and the danger of a violent reaction to it. Asia Bibi's lawyer, closely flanked by a policeman, told me he was ""happy"" with the verdict, but also afraid for his and his client's safety. Even after she is freed, the legacy of her case will continue. Shortly after her conviction a prominent politician,Punjab Governor Salman Taseer, was murdered for speaking out in her supportand calling for the blasphemy laws to be reformed. The killer - Mumtaz Qadri - was executed, but has become a cult hero with a large shrine dedicated to him on the outskirts of Islamabad. His supporters also created a political party - campaigning to preserve the blasphemy laws - which gathered around two million votes in this year's general election. It's the same party which many fear could be responsible for violent unrest in the coming days. Laws enacted by the British Raj in 1860 made it a crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship, punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Several more clauses were added in the 1980s by Pakistan's military ruler Gen Zia ul-Haq: 1980 - up to three years in jail for derogatory remarks against Islamic personages 1982 - life imprisonment for ""wilful"" desecration of the Koran 1986 - ""death, or imprisonment for life"" for blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws? The judges said the prosecution had ""categorically failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"". The case was based on flimsy evidence, they said, and proper procedures had not been followed. The alleged confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". The ruling heavily referenced the Koran and Islamic history.,externalIt ended with a quote from the Hadith, the collected sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, which calls for non-Muslims to be treated kindly. Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hardline politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemers in Pakistan The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Many of the attacks are motivated by blasphemy cases, but others have come in reaction to the US-led war in Afghanistan. No-one has ever been executed under the laws, but some people accused of the offence have been lynched or murdered. Asia Bibi, who was born in 1971 and has four children, was the first woman to be sentenced to death under the laws. Salman Taseer had taken up Asia Bibi's cause and called for reform of the blasphemy laws Internationally, her conviction has been widely condemned as a breach of human rights. There are fears that there could be a violent response to her acquittal. Asia Bibi's husband and daughter say they fear for their safety in Pakistan As with her previous trials and appeals, large crowds gathered outside the court in Islamabad on Wednesday demanding her conviction be upheld and the execution carried out. She has been offered asylum by several countries and is expected to leave the country. Her daughter, Eisham Ashiq, had previously told the AFP news agency that if she were released: ""I will hug her and will cry meeting her and will thank God that he has got her released."" But the family said they feared for their safety and would likely have to leave Pakistan. Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

Rural areas 'least socially mobile',"MPs said vital services like public transport were hampered in rural areas People living in England's rural and coastal counties are having their life chances held back by a ""false perception of affluence"", MPs say. Their report said vital services like public transport, youth centres and childcare were being ""hampered"" by an ""inequitable"" council funding model that benefits urban areas. They said rural areas were among the country's least ""socially mobile"". The government is currently carrying out a ""fair funding review"". Ministers say this will ensure that ""the link between local circumstances and resources allocated is clear"". The worst places to grow up poor 'Worst yet to come' in council cuts Councils under financial strain Is social mobility really about school cash? The report, from the County All-Party Parliamentary Group of MPs and the County Councils Network, says the current system favours big cities with more money per head of the population and should instead reflect ""hidden deprivation"". The Parliamentary group is made up of MPs representing seats in areas like Devon or Norfolk - which are often largely rural and less densely-populated than other parts. Its chairman Peter Aldous, who represents Waveney in Suffolk, said: ""For a long time now, the perception that counties are affluent and wealthy has meant they have been overlooked in terms of directing resource and policy towards improving social mobility. ""An outdated and inequitable method of funding local authorities has disproportionally channelled funding towards London and the major cities."" Social mobility is defined by the government as ""ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to build a good life for themselves regardless of their family background"". Last year areport,externalby the government's Social Mobility Commission dismissed the notion of a simple North-South divide. Instead, it said, there is a ""postcode lottery"" with ""hotspots"" and ""cold spots"" found in all regions. According to this report, there is a ""visible city versus rural divide"". It said transport networks were a ""major hindrance"" to social mobility in counties, and that families in rural areas often struggle to access childcare. According to its analysis of data at a ""strategic authority"" level, it says Kent, Cumbria and Northumberland are in the 10 least ""socially mobile"" areas alongside coastal communities like Dorset and Norfolk. Problems in these areas are made worse by a ""brain drain"" where teenagers go to university in cities and then settle away from their home communities, the report says. The MPs called for the government's review of local authority funding to address the disparity, and for ministers to devolve new powers to county leaders in the way they have in areas like Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.

Sellafield 'hit by ÃÂ£913m overspend',"A total of 14 major projects are behind schedule at Sellafield Costs of major projects in the run up to decommissioning Sellafield's nuclear site are likely to over-run by Â£913m and face long delays, a report says. The Public Accounts Committee also said the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) had cancelled three projects since 2012, costing taxpayers Â£586m. The committee said in its report it remained sceptical about the NDA's long-term strategy at the site. But the NDA said the report recognised improvements had been made since 2015. Despite the progress since that previous inspection, the committee found delays and expected cost over-runs with 14 major projects, which have an overall estimated total cost of Â£6bn. The committee added the NDA had not fully reviewed why its projects ran into difficulties. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, deputy chairman of the committee, said: ""The government's oversight of the NDA's performance could and should be much better, particularly on projects at Sellafield that cost a considerable amount of public money. ""This report follows the committee's earlier report into the NDA's Magnox contract. ""The NDA failed in both the procurement and management of this contract and cost the taxpayer Â£122m.""

Dad of 'Jihadi Jack' seeks Canada's help,"Jack Letts, from Oxford, travelled to Syria in 2014 The father of a British-Canadian national detained in Kurdish-held northern Syria is asking Canadian officials to help secure his release. John Letts is also pleading for their assistance in the repatriation of other Canadians being held in the region. His son, Jack Letts, 23, dubbed ""Jihadi Jack"", travelled to Syria in 2014. He was later captured by the Kurdish-led YPG - the group fighting against the Islamic State - when he left IS territory. Mr Letts said his son has been detained for the past 18 months and that his health is failing. The parents of Jack Letts, John Letts and Sally Lane, have asked Canada and the UK to help repatriate their son ""I need your help to save my son's life,"" he told journalists in Ottawa, where he was meeting officials on Tuesday to discuss his son's case and those of other detained Canadians. John Letts and his wife are facing charges of funding terrorism after sending their son money two years ago, which they say was to fund their son's escape from Syria. They have pleaded not guilty. Mr Letts said they have not been able to speak openly about their son's case in the UK due to contempt of court rules. ""In fact there's a very good chance I'll be sent to prison again when I fly back tomorrow,"" he said. ""Unfortunately I don't have any choice but to speak out because I love my son and think he's innocent."" The couple, who along with their son have dual citizenship, have made repeated attempts to get the British and Canadian governments to intervene and bring their son home. Mr Letts said Canadian officials had been initially helpful when his son was first captured, but have since said it would be too dangerous to have him removed. He said his son was ""naive and very religious"" when he travelled to Syria at the age of 18 and denies he was there to fight with IS. Jack Letts converted to Islam while at Cherwell comprehensive school in Oxford, England. It is unclear how much evidence exists about the true nature of his activities in Syria. At the Ottawa press conference, Mr Letts appeared alongside Families Against Violent Extremism (Fave), which said there are currently nine Canadian adults and several children, including a number under the age of six, being held in Kurdish prison camps in Syria. Fave said it is concerned that the families are housed in tents and lack adequate clothing to handle the approaching winter. ""These people need to be brought home to Canada and they need to be brought home now,"" said Fave director Alexandra Bain. Ms Bain said representatives from the UK-based legal Reprieve would travel to northern Syria to help facilitate their return if Canada agrees to supply the detainees with travel documents. 'Jihadi Jack' handover delay questioned 'Jihadi Jack' no longer in 'IS territory' Canada says that there is no safe way to get these Canadians out of the region. There are also concerns they would be detained by authorities and face charges in neighbouring countries if they did manage to leave Syria. In a statement, Canada's Foreign Affairs department told the BBC that its ability to provide consular assistance is ""extremely limited"" but that it is engaged to the extent possible in the cases raised by Fave. ""Canadian diplomats have established a communications channel with local Kurdish authorities in order to verify the whereabouts and well-being of Canadian citizens,"" it said. There has been significant debate in both Britain and Canada over what should happen to returning IS fighters who are still in Syria.

999 attack crackdown law passes hurdle,"This video can not be played Chris Bryant says Wales sees 20 assaults on emergency workers a day A new law giving harsher punishments to people who attack or sexually assault emergency workers has been backed by the UK government. Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant's private member's bill would double the maximum sentence for assaults against 999 staff. UK Justice Minister Rory Stewart said an assault on an emergency worker was an ""attack on the public"". Mr Bryant said there were 20 such assaults in Wales every day. If passed into law,his private member's bill,external, would see the maximum prison sentence for a common assault double from six months to one year, if the victim is a firefighter, police officer, prison officer, search and rescue volunteer, or NHS worker. Sexual assaults will also be added to the law as aggravating features of attacks. Labour MP Mr  Bryant said: ""Week after week emergency workers and particularly our paramedics and ambulance workers are subject to sickening sexual assaults by people who think they are a soft target. ""The government supporting this amendment means it will now become law, and sends a strong and clear message to would be attackers that their behaviour will not be tolerated and will be punished will the full weight of the law."" Emergency worker attacks law gets backing 999 staff attacks law plan tops poll 'Horrific' attacks on 'national heroes' Mr Stewart said: ""I am particularly pleased that in addition to providing additional protection to the police force and NHS workers this Bill provides protection for prison officers. ""Prison officers play an incredibly important role which is too often overlooked by the public. ""Considering the high levels of violence in prisons, this along with other measures such as providing additional equipment will help us tackle violence in prisons. In doing so we will protect prison officers and in turn the public."" NHS staff would also be covered by the new law If the offence is more serious than common assault - crimes causing serious physical injury - the fact the victim is an emergency worker will be classed as an aggravating factor when it comes to sentencing offenders. It could mean fewer suspended sentences in the future, and stiffer penalties from judges. Blood samples could also be taken from those suspected of assault, where there is a risk of spreading an infectious disease by their actions, such as spitting or biting a person. The UK government backing means theAssaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Bill,externalhas jumped a major hurdle towards becoming law during the Commons report stage debate, it now has to pass through the Lords. It has already been backed by AMs, making it clear it would apply to workers in the Welsh NHS and fire services, which are devolved.

'Most staff have been attacked' - doctor,"Dr Brittain-George said most staff had been attacked or felt unsafe The body set up to advise hospitals on staff safety is to end that work at the end of March, the BBC has discovered. This is despite figures showing almost 200 assaults on doctors, nurses and other NHS staff in England every day. One A&E doctor said ""most NHS staff"" could say they had been attacked or felt unsafe at work. NHS Protect said it could not comment before a staff consultation ended but the government said it believed a new approach was needed to protect staff. The body was tasked with overseeing the measures that trusts were taking to stop physical attacks on doctors and nurses. It has co-ordinated safety standards and held trusts to account since 2003. Dr Jess Brittain-George, who works in accident and emergency, said: ""Most NHS staff can say they've been attacked or felt unsafe at work, especially those of us on the front line. ""Everyone is on alert and looking out for the patient who is going to kick off. ""When I joined as a student in 2008 it was never mentioned.  I did an A&E placement and no-one talked about it. ""Now it's a running joke in the staffroom - 'What's happened to you today? I've been hit again', or something like that."" Kim Sunley was shocked by the number of assaults on NHS staff Dr Brittain-George works in a hospital that takes staff security seriously and has seen attacks decline, but she says elsewhere in the health service security ""isn't stellar"" and has been frustrated by the unwillingness of police officers to investigate. She says a man told an A&E receptionist that he intended to wait outside to kill her when she left work. ""The police didn't care. They said, 'It's just a threat and it isn't important.' But everyone knows that a threat to your life is an offence and it is prosecutable."" Nurses' leaders say the intense pressure on the health service has fuelled attacks on staff. In total, 70,555 NHS staff were assaulted in 2015-16, according to NHS Protect figures - up 4% on the previous year. Kim Sunley, of the Royal College of Nursing, described it as ""an absolutely shocking figure"". ""You see some horrible physical assaults - people being punched in the face, grabbed by the throat, limbs being broken, chairs being thrown at people. ""There's the physical impact of the injury, but also the psychological impact, the long-term effect. People are traumatised. ""Where people are frustrated and are having to wait a long time, an environment that isn't fit for purpose so you have trolleys in corridors, it's going to increase tension, it's going to increase frustration and it's a tinderbox atmosphere."" Many assaults are carried out by people who lack mental capacity, but it is thought some claim mental disability as a way of dissuading the police from investigating. NHS Protect has stepped in to secure convictions in cases when the police have decided not to act. On the issue of ending security work, NHS Protect said in a statement that it was ""not appropriate for us to comment in detail"" before the consultation with staff ended on 1 March. But it confirmed that it was consulting staff about plans under which ""our organisation would not be tasked with security management work"". It added: ""Work continues on the potential of identifying who might be best placed to take the lead on guiding this work, if it is felt appropriate that another body should take it forward"". A Department of Health said its proposals come amid a ""persistently high numbers of these unacceptable incidents"". A spokesperson added: ""NHS staff work incredibly hard in a high-pressure environment, and it is completely unacceptable for them to be subject to aggression or violence. ""Trusts should have no hesitation in involving the police and pressing for the strongest penalties against offenders.""

Wrong weight 'can cost four years of life',"Being overweight or underweight could knock four years off life expectancy, a study in a Lancet journal suggests. The report, one of the largest of its kind,,externalinvolved nearly 2 million people who were registered with doctors in the UK. Researchers found that, from the age of 40, people at the higher end of the healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) range had the lowest risk of dying from disease. But people at the top and bottom ends of the BMI risked having shorter lives. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height. A ""healthy"" BMI score ranges from 18.5 to 25. Most doctors say it is the best method they have of working out whether someone is obese because it is accurate and simple to measure. The study, published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, showed that life expectancy for obese men and women was 4.2 and 3.5 years shorter respectively than people in the entire healthy BMI weight range. The difference for underweight men and women was 4.3 (men) and 4.5 (women) years. BMI was associated with all causes of death categories, except transport-related accidents, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. The places where too many are fat and too many are thin Low-calorie shakes and soup diets 'recommended for obese' Obesity and BMI: 'If I wasn't this size I wouldn't have a job' Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? However, not everybody in the healthy category is at the lowest risk of disease, according to report author Dr Krishnan Bhaskaran. He told the BBC: ""For most causes of death we found that there was an 'optimal' BMI level, with risk of death increasing both below and above that level. ""At BMIs below 21, we observed more deaths from most causes, compared with the optimum BMI levels. However, this might partly reflect the fact that low body weight can be a marker of underlying ill-health. ""For most causes of death, the bigger the weight difference, the bigger the association we observed with mortality risk. ""So a weight difference of half a stone would make a relatively small (but real) difference; we could detect these small effects because this was a very large study.""

However, Dr Katarina Kos, senior lecturer in Diabetes and Obesity at the University of Exeter, believes it is. ""For the majority of people, BMI is a good measure,"" she told the BBC. Dr Kos added that the report did not contain any surprises but added that overweight people who could lower their BMI may reap the health benefits. ""We know from the diabetes remission data how low-calorie diets and weight loss can improve diabetes, for example,"" she said. ""And we know weight loss can also help in improving risk so that would also then improve mortality rates."" The report suggested that a higher BMI in older people may not be as dangerous, because a bit of extra weight was ""protective"" for them. But Dr Kos, who worked on a report on this topic in 60 to 69-year-olds last year, disagreed with the findings.

Can AI help stop religious violence?,"Software that mimics human society is being tested to see if it can help prevent religious violence. Researchers used artificial intelligence algorithms to simulate actions driven by sectarian divisions. Their model contains thousands of agents representing different ethnicities, races and religions. Norway and Slovakia are trialling the tech to tackle tensions that can arise when Muslim immigrants settle in historically Christian countries. The Oxford University researchers hope their system can be used to help governments respond to incidents, such as the recent London terror attacks. However, one independent expert said that the tool needed more work before it could be used in real-life situations. ""This could be an extremely useful research project when it reaches maturity as a thought tool for analysing factors involved in religious conflict,"" said Prof Noel Sharkey. The research, published in the Journal for Artificial Societies and Social Stimulation,external, indicates people are a peaceful species by nature. Even in times of crisis, such as natural disasters, the simulated humans came together peacefully. But in some situations the program indicated people were willing to endorse violence. Examples included occasions when other groups of people challenged the core beliefs that defined their identity. Researchers studied the Troubles in Northern Ireland before creating their model The research team drew on the Northern Ireland Troubles to programme conditions that saw what the researchers call ""xenophobic social anxiety"" escalate into extreme physical violence. The conflict - which involved political and cultural factors in addition to religion - spanned three decades and claimed the lives of approximately 3,500 people. The computer model also used scenarios based on the 2002 Gujarat riots in India. Two thousand people died during three days of inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims. Research author Justin Lane said: ""To use AI to study religion or culture, we have to look at modelling human psychology because our psychology is the foundation for religion and culture. ""The root causes of things like religious violence rest in how our minds process the information that our world presents."" The results suggest the risk of religious conflict escalates when a group's core beliefs or sacred values are challenged so frequently that they overwhelm people's ability to deal with them. But even then, anxiety only spills over into violence in about 20% of the scenarios modelled. ""Religious violence is not our default behaviour - in fact it is pretty rare in our history,"" said Mr Lane. ""It is only when people's core belief systems are challenged, or they feel that their commitment to their own beliefs is questioned that anxiety and agitations occur. ""We might be able to trick our psychology into accepting others as part of our group when we'd otherwise be triggered toward more primal fears,"" he added. The researchers believe one answer to reducing the risk of religious violence and terrorism is to create situations that stop people seeing outsiders as a threat. The most risky situations are when the difference in the size of two different religious groups is similar and people encounter ""out-group members"" more regularly, perceiving them as dangerous. The encounters need not be face-to-face. It could be that the threat is brought to someone's attention through conventional and social media. ""We appear to live somewhat in our own information bubbles, but we still receive a lot of information about out-group members and that information appears to trigger our psychology even if there isn't actually a real person there,"" Mr Lane warned. ""Just the idea of a threat can be as powerful as a real threat to elicit a reaction."" AI must be 'for common good' Is artificial intelligence racist?

Duchess says 'hugs are very important',"The Duchess of Cambridge hugged children as she arrived in Basildon The Duchess of Cambridge has revealed that she regularly teaches her children about the importance of hugs. The mother-of-three was at the Basildon Sporting Village with her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, to  highlight the ability of sport to change lives. She embraced young fans, along with Janet Emery, 58, who hugged both Catherine and Prince William. ""Thank you very much,"" Catherine told her. ""Hugs are very important. I keep saying that to my children."" Prince William and Catherine joined in with activities at the sports centre During the visit, the duchess played tennis, while the duke tried javelin practice, as they met young trainee coaches enrolled in the Royal Foundation's Coach Core project. It aims to empower those not in education or employment by training them up as the next generation of sports coaches - who will hopefully go on to inspire their communities. Catherine showed off her tennis skills during the visit Hugging members of the Royal Family is said to break with traditional protocol - you are not meant to touch a royal when meeting them unless they offer their hand to you first to shake. But BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said these are ""customs and practices"" rather than ""a book of rules"". You will not see the senior royals, such as the Queen or Prince Charles, handing out hugs. But, for the younger generation, he says ""nothing is set in stone"", adding: ""Reinvention is something they have become rather good at."" Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have flouted the tradition throughout their tour of Australia and New Zealand, embracing a number of well-wishers -one of which stroked Prince Harry's beard.
