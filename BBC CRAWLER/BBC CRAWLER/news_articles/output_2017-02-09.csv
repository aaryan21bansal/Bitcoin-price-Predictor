NHS 'back to 1950s' and council tax to rise,"The costs of school meals could rise in some areas, according to a report The Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph both lead on a survey by the think tank, the Local Government Information Unit, suggesting millions of households are facing above-inflation rises in council tax. Almost all of England's town halls are said to be planning to increase bills by up to 5% to pay for social care. Many are also planning higher charges for parking, school meals and even burials and cremations. According to the Mail,external, critics say councils could avoid the rises if they stopped hoarding cash and dipped into their huge reserves. Others say they could employ fewer chief executives earning more than the prime minister. There is a continued focus on problems besetting the health service. The Daily Mirror uses a picture,externalof a hospital ward in the 1950s to illustrate that NHS funding isgrowing at its lowest rate since records began in 1955. ""With the NHS collapsing around her ears, brazen Theresa May yesterday insisted the Tories have lavished record sums of cash on the service,"" the paper says. However, it quotes figures from the Institute of Fiscal Studies which the paper says ""shatter"" that claim. And it says the IFS has warned that ""a shocking funding crisis gripping the NHS"" means it'll be unable to cope with a growing and ageing population. The Guardian quotes,externala government health adviser, Patrick Carter, warning that hospitals are under such extreme pressure that they're ""in a state of war"". The Times quotes,externalSir Robert Francis QC, who led the public inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal, warning that the NHS faces an ""existential crisis"". It's manifestly failing, he says, and he dismisses plans for savings as ""unrealistic"". Several papers report that doctors will not have to reveal their income from private work, after a U-turn by health chiefs. A revolt by doctors is said to have forced NHS England to abandon plans to make them publish their outside earnings. Instead, they'll be expected to publish on NHS websites how much time they spend on private work. ""What are they hiding?""asks the Daily Mail,external. The Times castigates,externalWikipedia's volunteer editors in the UK for deciding that the Daily Mail can no longer be cited as a reliable source. It suggests there's been an extension of the phrase ""fake news"" to cover publications that people merely dislike. The paper also rejects Jeremy Corbyn's claim that reports suggesting he's close to stepping down as Labour leader are ""fake news"". Mr Miller was pinned down by a bar on the excavator It says he's a liability for his party - and that colleagues are appalled by what it calls his ineptitude. A cartoon in the Telegraph,externallikens the plight of Mr Corbyn to the misfortune of an Australian man who was trapped in a muddy ditch for six hours and survived by just about keeping his nose above the murky water. The photograph is published in a number of the papers. The Daily Express says,externalmigrants were caught trying to enter Britain illegally at the rate of 200 a day in the run-up to the Brexit referendum. Figures apparently show that 24,800 people were stopped in the first six months of last year. But as the historic vote on 23 June approached, the paper says, the rate of detection increased - with 5,900 being caught in June. The Express says the scale of illegal immigration through northern France can be revealed for the first time after the paper won a long battle with the Home Office to publish the figures. Several papers feature a former maths student from the University of Liverpool who is believed to be the first British woman to join the fight against so-called Islamic State in Syria. Kimberley Taylor, who is 27, travelled to the war zone without telling her family in Merseyside after becoming shocked by the plight of refugees. She is quoted saying: ""I'm prepared to give my life for this."" The Mail says,externalwomen fighters are greatly feared by the jihadis who believe it's a disgrace to be killed by a woman in battle, prohibiting them from entering paradise. Finally, there is more bad news for healthy eaters already struggling to find iceberg lettuces and courgettes. The Times warns,externalthat Britons will soon have to be a little less generous drizzling their olive oil. Apparently erratic weather in the Mediterranean has sent wholesale prices soaring. Italian olive groves have been particularly badly hit because fruit flies have been attracted by the humid weather, while a heatwave in Greece last spring is said to have cut the supply there by a quarter.

Presidential fleet 'missing 200 cars',"More than 50 of the government's Toyota Prados could not be found Ghana's new government is trying to track down more than 200 cars missing from the president's office, a government spokesman has said. The ruling party counted the cars a month after taking power following victory in December's elections. After previous transfers of power, state-owned cars have been seized from officials who did not return them. A minister in the former government said the implied allegation of wrongdoing by his colleagues was false. Former Communication Minister Omane Boamah told the BBC's Thomas Naadi that this was ""a convenient way for the new government to justify the purchase of new vehicles"". Africa Live: BBC News updates Ghana's unstable Honourable House Presidential spokesman Eugene Arhin told the press that officials could only find: 74 of the presidency's 196 Toyota Land Cruisers 20 of the 73 Toyota Land Cruiser Prados 11 of the 24 Mercedes two of the 28 Toyota Avalons two of the six BMWs. Ghanaian radio stationCiti FM reported,externalthat the president has been ""forced to use a 10-year-old BMW"" as a result. In making the statement Mr Arhin revealed the president's office was meant to have more than 300 cars but he did not divulge the purpose of these vehicles. Nana Akufo-Addo from the the New Patriotic Party won the Ghanaian presidential election at the beginning of December, taking power from John Mahama, of the National Democratic Congress.

'Real' Mr Darcy was no Colin Firth,"The 'historically accurate' portrait of Mr Darcy looks starkly different to Colin Firth who portrayed him in the BBC drama Academics have revealed what they claim is the first ""historically accurate"" portrait of Jane Austen's Mr Darcy - and he's a world away from the romantic hero of films and TV. Instead of the broad shoulders and square jaw of Colin Firth there is a modestly-sized chest and pointy chin. There is little description of him in Pride and Prejudice, so the academics used historical fashions from the 1790s, when it was written. This version also wears a powdered wig. ""Our Mr Darcy portrayal reflects the male physique and common features at the time,"" says Amanda Vickery, professor of early modern history at Queen Mary University of London. ""Men sported powdered hair, had narrow jaws and muscular, defined legs were considered very attractive,"" she says. Colin Firth in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice seems to have set the standard for the modern Mr Darcy A frock coat can be seen on the artist's impression, Colin Firth and Matthew Rhys in the BBC's Death Comes to Pemberley Colin Firth got the nation's collective hearts racing in 1995 with his depiction of the mysterious Mr Darcy in the BBC's adaptation. Further adaptations since have followed in the style of Firth's portrayal including  Matthew Macfadyen in the 2005 film of Pride and Prejudice. Matthew Macfadyen played Mr Darcy in the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice alongside Keira Knightley But the academics say their muscular chests and broad shoulders would have been the sign of a labourer and not a gentleman at the time the book was written. The fans' favourite Mr Darcy moments - when Colin Firth walked out of a lake dripping wet and Matthew Macfadyen crossed a field in the mist, both showing off their chests - would not have looked the same with the historically accurate Mr Darcy and his sloping narrow shoulders. Alan Badel - the BBC's Mr Darcy in 1958 - looks more like the academics' impression Some fans,externalhave not been impressed by the portrait. Professor John Sutherland, from University College London, who led the research says they only had ""scraps"" of physical description of the character Fitzwilliam Darcy. As well as looking at the fashions of the day they also looked at Austen's relationships and the men who may have inspired her characters. ""He is our most mysterious and desirable leading man of all time, says Prof Sutherland. And he appears frequently in modern culture. The character of Mark Darcy, the romantic hero in the Bridget Jones books, was named after Jane Austen's character and played by Colin Firth in the films Further depictions of Mr Darcy include Matthew Rhys who played the character in the TV adaptation of the Pride and Prejudice ""sequel"" Death Comes to Pemberley. He also inspired the character of Mark Darcy in Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding, also portrayed by Colin Firth in the film versions.

Winter Olympic medal chances 'exciting',"Could 2018 be a record-breaking Winter Olympics for Team GB? Great Britain should be excited about its medal chances at the 2018 Winter Olympics, according to chef de mission Mike Hay. It would be a record-breaking Games for Team GB in Pyeongchang if they win more than the four medals they have taken home on two occasions, in 1924 and 2014. UK Sport has doubled its investment in Olympic winter sports from Â£13.5m for the four-year cycle to the 2014 Sochi Games to Â£27.9m for the South Korea event. And with a year go until the 2018 Games begin, UK Sport has agreed a total target of between four and eight medals across the various Winter Olympic disciplines at their respective World Championship events this year. ""The money that UK Sport have put in is a real confidence boost to our winter athletes,"" Hay told BBC Sport. ""We've got to go in with high hopes and there are some early indicators that our athletes are going to be competing for podium places."" Great Britain may have won 67 medals in one Games at the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio but Winter Olympic medals have been harder to come by because of a lack of natural facilities and smaller talent pools to select from. In the 97-year history of the Winter Olympics, Great Britain have won only 26 medals but Hay believes the country is becoming more accepted on the world stage, especially in freestyle skiing and snowboarding, short track speed skating, curling and skeleton. ""It's very difficult to challenge the alpine nations but we're making progress into that second tier, if you like, and getting credibility,"" Hay said. Meanwhile, to mark a year to the event, British Ski and Snowboard has announced it plans to become one of the world's top five skiing and snowboarding nations by 2030. Great Britain will send about 60 athletes to the Games. Ski and snowboard:It took 90 years for Britain to win a first Winter Olympic medal on snow, courtesy ofJenny Jones' snowboard bronze in 2014but in Pyeongchang there could be podium ambitions for athletes in freestyle skiing, snowboarding and even alpine skiing. Snowboarder Katie Ormerod has been a model of consistency on the World Cup stage, winning the Moscow big air and claiming two other podiums as well as an X Games bronze medal. Her cousin Jamie Nicholls, Billy Morgan and Aimee Fuller have also won World Cup medals and could threaten the podium in slopestyle and big air in 2018. James Woods finished fifth in ski slopestyle in Sochi and will be a medal contender in South Korea. He won the season-opening World Cup slopestyle in New Zealand and just missed out on an X Games slopestyle medal, coming fourth. Woods did win the big air title in Aspen but only snowboard big air will make its debut in the Winter Olympics. In the alpine world, slalom specialist David Ryding became the first Briton for 36 years to claim a World Cup medal when he finished second in Kitzbuhel, Austria, in January and has backed that up with three other top 10s this season. British Ski and Snowboard has an ambitious target of being a top-five performing nation by 2030. It says it has a strategy to raise more funds and put a world-class coaching structure in place. This video can not be played Lizzy Yarnold's had a change of pace - making lampshades Short track speed skating:After the heartbreak of being penalised in all her races in Sochi,Elise Christiewill be determined to leave Pyeongchang with a medal. She is leading the world 500m standings this season and has also won World Cup medals in 1000m and 1500m. Charlotte Gilmartin could also claim a medal. Skeleton:Since skeleton was reintroduced into the Winter Olympics in 2002, Great Britain have won a medal at each of the four Games. Lizzy Yarnold won gold in Russia and is aiming to become the first Briton to retain a Winter Olympic title. She took the 2016 season off but is back and building up to South Korea. Laura Deas has had World Cup success and will also be in contention. Curling: Great Britain won silver and bronze in Sochi and will again be challenging for the medal matches in 2018. The introduction of mixed doubles boosts GB's chances even more. Snowboard big air:Snowboarders will head down a ramp and perform a trick off a large jump called a kicker. The new addition is great news for Britain's medal aspirations as there are podium potential athletes in the men's and women's competitions. Meanwhile, it is goodbye to snowboard parallel slalom, which has been dropped from the Games. Curling mixed doubles: Each team is made up of a man and a woman and they play with six stones, rather than the usual eight and there are only eight ends, instead of the traditional 10. Great Britain finished fourth at the 2016 World Championships and compete in the 2017 competition at the end of April. Performances from the 2016 and 2017 World Championships will be taken into account with the top seven ranked nations, plus hosts South Korea, qualifying for the Games. Speed skating mass start: This will take place on the long track and will be a 16-lap race where all skaters start simultaneously. There will be four sprints where points are awarded. The first three athletes to cross the finish line will be awarded the medals. Alpine skiing team event. Teams will consist of two men and two women and they will compete against other nations in head-to-head slalom races. The 2018 Winter Olympics will be held between 9 and 25 February and it is the third time Asia has held a Winter Olympics after Japan hosted both the 1972 Games in Sapporo and Nagano in 1998. Pyeongchang will be split between the coast and the mountains, similarly to Sochi. The coastal cluster will host curling, ice hockey, figure skating, short track and speed skating, while the mountain area will host skiing, snowboarding, bobsleigh, skeleton and luge. The winter Paralympics will run from 9 to 18 March. 'Concussion almost ended my ski career' Meet Britain's best ever cross-country skier.

Branwen Jeffreys: Inside Germany's healthcare system9 February 2017 (17:12:04),"Patient Georg Thoma after his hip operation The day after his hip replacement, Georg Thoma was cheerfully sitting up in bed. Like most Germans, the businessman pays into compulsory health insurance. He contributes 7% of his salary before tax and his employers match that amount. In return, patients get access to care which is so rapid that national waiting data is not collected. ""The doctor said to me that I have to decide when I get the operation. Normally it takes three or four weeks."" Georg travels for work to the UK and tells me he was astonished to hear that patients can sometimes wait months for a similar routine operation. Germany's spending on health care is relatively high, just over 11% of its wealth, compared to 9.8% in the UK and it has more doctors and hospital beds per patient than the UK. Georg's operation was carried out in an 80-bed hospital in one of the Black Forest towns in the south-west region Baden Wurttemberg. But even in Germany's well-funded system, the financial viability of a hospital this small is not guaranteed. A group of doctors in this area is trying to manage costs in an experiment that has attracted interest from the UK. Dr Martin Wetzel is focusing on prevention work Martin Wetzel, a GP for 25 years, explains they have done a deal with big insurance funds to make prevention a priority. ""I have more time - and it needs more time to explain to patients what I'm doing and why. So my consultations changed from an eye wink to an average of 15 minutes,"" he says. During that time patients might be offered a range of interventions to improve their health provided locally, which frees up time for the GP. These include subsidised gym sessions, access to different sports and nutrition advice as well as screening programmes to reduce loneliness as well as increasing healthiness. It is being run by a company called Gesundes Kinzigtal in which the doctors are majority shareholders. Already a couple of years into their 10-year project, they say healthcare is costing 6% less than you would expect for the population. They are trying to improve data sharing and believe hospital treatment can be reduced further. Much of the vision comes from its chief executive Helmut Hildebrandt, a pharmacist and public health expert. Hospital doctors on a ward round He says the health insurance funds have tended to concentrate on short-term cost control measures, rather than improving the health of their patients. ""At the moment the economy in Germany runs so well they don't have a problem. But in the long run every politician or administrator knows in the next 10 or 20 years the system will run into a crisis."" He fears that could undermine the commitment to the health insurance covering most Germans, with a risk of richer people opting out of it. What Gesundes Kinzigtal is trying to do is similar to some integrated care projects in the NHS. There is more money in the German system, but arguably more waste too. The Caesarean rate is higher, so is the use of MRI for diagnosis and the length of hospital stay. Patients waiting to see a GP in Thuringia And in many ways there has been little incentive for change in a system where doctors still have a high degree of influence and life expectancy in Germany is not higher than the UK. Bernadette Klapper heads the health section of the Robert Bosch Foundation, which funds social policy innovation. ""I think we should get more for the money we spend inside healthcare. While we see other countries spending less, but having the same results as us, there's something wrong."" Germany is ageing very rapidly, only just behind Japan in forecast for its population profile. But the health system is changing slowly and the Bosch foundation is trying to encourage more small health centres. Many doctors in Germany set up in practice on their own, as GPs or out-of-hospital specialists, but as cities are more popular that leaves rural areas with a shortage. Travel east to the wide open rolling countryside of Thuringia and you get a glimpse of the challenge. Five years ago they were 200 GPs short of what was needed in this region. It has taken grants, and offers of help with housing and arranging childcare, to reduce that to 60. A community nurse treats a patient Annette Rommel is head of the doctors' association in the village of Mechterstadt and says: ""A few years ago we arranged for specially-trained nurses to make home visits and for more teamwork with nurses and doctors together."" It is similar to the way many community nurses work in the UK, but in Germany this is a recent development. Nurses have a much more restricted role. On a visit I saw a nurse and a carer, who is paid for out of the long-term care insurance that Germany introduced 20 years ago, check up on an elderly couple. It has reduced the amount families have to pay, although social care can still be a financial worry. There is enough money in the German system to make trying new approaches to healthcare a little easier. Most patients feel they can see a doctor easily, so for example the number of visits to the equivalent of A&E is very low compared to the UK. While out of hours care has been reorganised, GPs and other out of hospital doctors are often still involved in helping provide cover on a rotation. None of this removes the long-term worry about whether providing such rapid and easy access to care is affordable in the long term. A debate that German politicians are unlikely to begin publicly in this election year or any time soon. Germany Nine out of 10 Germans pay 7% of their pre-tax salary into statutory health insurance, matched by their employers Pensioners and the short-term unemployed also contribute, children are covered by their parents and the federal government compensates for the rest The highest earners, civil servants and the self-employed have private insurance but use it to access the same doctors and hospitals There are more hospital beds, and doctors per patients than in the UK, and you can go directly to see a specialist based in the community Germans also pay a smaller amount into long-term care insurance, but families have to pay a significant amount for social care UK In every part of the UK, the NHS is paid for out of general taxation and the proportion of public money allocated to it is a matter of policy for each of the devolved governments Patients have direct access to a GP, but have to be referred to see a specialist, who mainly work in hospitals, with the exception of some specialities like psychiatry There are waiting targets, but for some routine operations patients can face waits of many months Social care is means tested and access is increasingly restricted to those with the highest level of need.  There is no insurance to cover for old age care The lessons for the UK are that money on its own is not the only solution, although it does ease pressure in the system considerably. Finding better co-ordinated ways of looking after patients, often elderly, with the highest health needs is a priority. And in Germany, despite the long-term care insurance, families still have to contribute a significant amount to looking after older people. However, there is a mechanism for sustainable funding for social care that is very different from the significant reductions in care budgets seen in the UK.

Is Trump's cabinet facing historic obstruction?Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter9 February 2017 (00:52:01),"The claim:It has taken longer for Donald Trump to have his ""full cabinet"" confirmed than any president in US history. Reality Check Verdict:Democrats have slow-walked many of Mr Trump's presidential nominations. It has taken longer so far for him to get the majority of his choices confirmed, although part of that is due to the lateness of a few nominations and delays in submitting background-check paperwork. Mr Trump still has months to go, however, before he sets a record for how long it has taken to have all his cabinet positions filled. On 7 February Donald Trumptweeted,externalthat it was a ""disgrace"" that he did not have his full cabinet of top-level presidential appointments confirmed by the US Senate. He called it the ""longest such delay in the history of our country"" and blamed it on Democratic obstruction. His message echoed comments made by other prominent Republicans in Congress and his own administration. Press secretary Sean Spicer said the length of time it has taken to get Mr Trump's presidential nominations confirmed was ""ridiculous"". ""The Senate Democrats have done everything in their power to slow the work of the Senate, while the president continues to take decisive action, just like he promised,""he said,external. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnellsaid,external""Democrat obstruction has reached new extreme levels"", which he called a ""historic break with tradition"". ""It's time to finally accept the results of the election and move on,"" he added. Do as I say, not as I do? At its most basic level, Mr Trump's tweet about the historic nature of the delays in assembling his ""full cabinet"" is demonstrably false. As of 8 February, Mr Trump has had six of his 15 cabinet selections confirmed by the Senate, with several more awaiting final Senate approval. While he still has a way to go before his entire team is in place, it's hardly historic at this point. Bill Clinton didn't have his final spot filled until 11 March. Republican George HW Bush took until 17 March. Barack Obama holds the modern record, as his last pick - Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius - didn't get her Senate vote until 28 April. Only George W Bush, who like Mr Trump won the presidency without securing a plurality of the popular vote, had his full team in place within weeks of his inauguration, following John Ashcroft's confirmation as attorney general on 30 January. While Mr Trump's assertion is without basis in fact, he - and his fellow Republicans - are on firmer ground with a more general complaint about delayed confirmations. Of the past five presidencies, Mr Trump has by far the fewest confirmed cabinet selections at this point. Only two of his nominees - Secretary of Defence James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly - were approved on inauguration day. Mr Clinton had three, Mr Obama had six, and George W Bush had seven. By mid-February, Mr Obama had all but three of his picks seated. Mr Clinton had all but one. George HW Bush was missing four. Part of the reason it took so long to fit those last pieces into their cabinets is because those past presidents had to withdraw initial selections due to scandal or insurmountable political opposition. George HW Bush's defence pick, John Tower, was voted down by the Senate. Mr Clinton swung and missed twice on attorney general before settling on Janet Reno. Mr Obama withdrew commerce nominees twice and health and human services once. So far, Mr Trump has stuck with his original picks - although labour secretary nominee Andrew Puzder has yet to complete his ethics review and has had his confirmation hearing delayed four times. Puzder isn't the only one of Mr Trump's wealthy nominees who has had difficulty completing the Office of Government Ethics' vetting paperwork, which has contributed to confirmation delays. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross wereamong those,externalwho were tardy in complying with background-check requirements. Mr Trump was also remarkably slow to come up with several cabinet picks. He didn't announce Veterans Affairs nominee David Shulkin until 11 January. Agriculture pick Sonny Perdue was unveiled just two days before inauguration on 20 January - an astounding fact, considering of Mr Trump's four predecessors, only four original nominations came after New Year's Day (George HW Bush's energy pick James Watkins was the latest, on 12 January). Empty Democrat seats during a committee vote on two cabinet nominee This isn't to discount the obvious efforts Democrats have made to drag out the confirmation process for some Trump picks. They staged walk-outs at committee hearings for health and human services nominee Tom Price and treasury's Steven Mnuchin, delaying approval votes by a day. They gave long speeches that held up votes for Mr Sessions in committee vote and Ms DeVos on the Senate floor. They've used bits of arcane Senate procedure and parliamentary manoeuvres to gum up the works where they can - although, due to their minority status, they can only delay, not derail. Although the efforts have been futile, Democratic senators are voting ""no"" on Mr Trump's nominees at an increasingly higher rate. More Democrats cast votes against Ms Devos than all previous education secretaries combined, dating back to the position's creation in 1980. There have been a total of 111 no votes in the five nominees who have come up for a full Senate vote so far - compared with only 18 in the entirety of Mr Clinton's presidency. Mr Obama's choices had 406 no votes, but that was over the course of eight years and 31 nominations. Betsy DeVos confirmation took Vice President's Pence tiebreaker vote Democrats have also pumped up the anti-Trump rhetoric, throwing red meat to a Democratic base that is furious at any signs of compromise or accommodation. ""If not total unanimity, we're going to have near Democratic unity in opposing the remaining nominees for President Trump's cabinet,"" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said on Monday. ""This unity makes clear just how bad this cabinet would be for America's middle class and those struggling to get there."" While Republicans cite statements like Schumer's as examples of unprecedented Democratic intransigence, Democrats are quick to note that in the latter days of the Obama administration, conservatives were equally vigorous in their opposition to the president's selections. Merrick Garland, whose Supreme Court nomination languished for 10 months before expiring without a hearing, is foremost in their minds, but even Mr Obama's second-term cabinet picks faced record-breaking delays. His choice for labour secretary, Thomas Perez, took 121 days to be confirmed. John Bryson, his commerce pick, waited 126 days. Attorney General Loretta Lynch holds the modern record, as 161 days passed before getting Senate approval. If a Trump nominee had that sort of delay, he or she wouldn't assume office until well into June.

Natural selection?,"This video can not be played Balmy days: The Body Shop story ""A confused shop with a mish-mash of products with no emphasis on the fact that this is supposed to be a shop specialising in cruelty-free, fair trade toiletries and make-up,"" is Suzy Bourke's damning verdict on The Body Shop. The 42-year-old stage manager used to be a regular shopper at the High Street chain, but now she tends to go to Boots instead. And she's not alone. Its owner, cosmetics giant L'Oreal, wants to offload the High Street chain, which has been suffering slowing sales. The Body Shop, founded by Dame Anita Roddick in 1976, was a pioneer using natural ingredients for its beauty products when it started out. It initially thrived, expanding rapidly, and by the 1980s was one of the most well-known brands on the High Street. I remember the chain fondly from my youth, when it seemed to be an exciting shop full of affordable, fun and exciting products. Coloured animal soaps, banana shampoo, white musk perfume and strawberry shower gel were the height of 1980s beauty chic as far as I was concerned. But by the early 2000s, rivals had caught up, with firms such as Boots, for example, developing similar natural beauty ranges. New challengers such as Lush also emerged, encroaching on The Body Shop's market share. ""You never see a Body Shop busy any more, they always used to be packed,"" says Suzy Bourke The chain is still a sizeable High Street presence with more than 3,000 stores in 66 countries and employs 22,000 people, according to its website. The Body Shop's results for 2016 show total sales were 920.8m euros (Â£783.8m), down from 967.2m euros in 2015, which L'Oreal blamed on market slowdowns in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. The sales were a tiny proportion of L'Oreal's overall 25.8bn euros of sales for the same period. And arguably the chain - which L'Oreal bought for Â£652m ($1.14bn) in 2006 - remains a lower-end and insignificant part of its huge portfolio of brands, which include skincare specialists Kiehl's, Lancome and Garnier, as well as fragrance brands Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani. Veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman argues that L'Oreal overpaid for the chain and has failed to add any value to it. ""Frankly it's a bit of mystery them buying it in the first place. ""What they bought is a retailer and what they're good at is brands,"" he says. The Body Shop's use of natural ingredients made it a pioneer when it started out in 1976 He thinks The Body Shop's struggles are down to the same issues facing the retail sector as a whole: competition from an ever-increasing number of shops all muscling in on the same territory, from supermarkets to fashion chains the seemingly unstoppable popularity of online shopping the high cost of running a large number of shops ""Retailing in shops is becoming an increasingly challenging business. You've got to have a very compelling retail proposition as opposed to a brand or product proposition. ""Everyone that shops in The Body Shop spends most of their personal care budget somewhere else. They're constantly chasing their tail, having to work hard to attract people into a store,"" he says. When the 2006 deal was struck, founder Dame Anita - who died just a year later - was forced to reject claims that The Body Shop, known for its ethically sourced goods, was joining with ""the enemy"". There were concerns that some of the ingredients L'Oreal then used in its products had been tested on animals, while The Body Shop was publicly opposed to animal testing. The French firm insisted the brand would complement its existing offering, giving it increased presence in the ""masstige"" sector - mass market combined with prestige. But Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at consultancy GlobalData Retail, believes the firm has ""slightly lost its way"" under L'Oreal's ownership. ""While The Body Shop's heritage is strong, it needs to work on its brand perception. It's not known as a brand which is innovative and new, and it's failed to keep up with market trends - contour sticks, kits and palettes were a strong trend in 2016, and these are nowhere to be seen in The Body Shop's range,"" she says. Analysts say The Body Shop has lost its cachet as a fashionable brand These days the firm is not seen as ""a trendy brand"", but mostly as a shop for gifting and low-value items, such as its body butters and body lotions, she says. ""With premium retailers such as Jo Malone and Liz Earle offering in-store treatments, there is more that The Body Shop could be doing to raise its profile and improve the customer experience,"" she adds. Nonetheless, Prof John Colley from Warwick Business School believes there will still be plenty of interest from private equity funds. He expects the firm to be sold with its current separate management team, who he says are likely to have their own ideas for how to improve it. ""When a major corporate has decided it doesn't want a business, it will sell it, probably, whatever the price. ""They [L'Oreal] are trying to get rid of it because it's underperforming. But anyone bidding will see a clear turnaround. Independent ownership would probably serve the firm well. A refreshed image would almost certainly work,"" he says. Mr Hyman, too, believes a new owner could improve The Body Shop, particularly by selling the chain's products outside its own shops. But he says trying to offload the large store estate with long committed leases will be a hindrance to any buyer. ""That's not to say it isn't a business with potential, but it could perform much more strongly,"" he says. Dame Anita Roddick, who founded the firm in 1976 at the age of 34,said her original motivation,externalfor the firm was simply to make a living for herself and her two daughters while her husband was away travelling. But as someone who had travelled widely, she set out to do things differently, relying on natural ingredients and her customers' interest in the environment. ""Why waste a container when you can refill it? And why buy more of something than you can use? We behaved as she [my mother] did in the Second World War, we reused everything, we refilled everything and we recycled all we could. ""The foundation of The Body Shop's environmental activism was born out of ideas like these,"" she wrote.

Brand Hiddleston,"Hiddleston was nominated for the Bafta Rising Star award in 2011 The last few months haven't been too easy for Tom Hiddleston. In September, he and girlfriend Taylor Swift broke up after three months together amid accusations their relationship was apublicity stunt. Then, in January, heapologisedfor an ""inelegantly expressed"" winner's speech at the Golden Globes in which he referred to aid workers in South Sudan ""binge-watching"" The Night Manager. This time last year, the actor was riding the crest of a wave. After starring in hugely successful BBC drama The Night Manager as well as the big-screen adaption of JG Ballard's High-Rise, he was a hot favourite to be the next James Bond. But have his off-screen actions since done damage to his brand? ""Some of the recent headlines have been unhelpful,"" admits Mark Borkowski, a strategic PR consultant. ""There are events that happen and they're not thought through properly, and the nature of being caught up with Taylor Swift's gang and not thinking it through strategically has undone him. Swift and Hiddleston dated for three months last year ""Sometimes people don't recognise the power of their brand, and often you can't conduct yourself in the way you think you can."" But Steven Gaydos, vice-president and executive editor of Variety, thinks Hiddleston is still a hot property, despite his recent PR mishaps. ""I don't think anything he's done to date has put any serious dent into his career,"" he told the BBC. ""He's a fantastic actor doing fantastic work. He has a fanbase and he's delivering the goods. ""These are just missteps - somebody doing something that causes chatter. In this case Tom Hiddleston made a speech and people thought it was silly, or he dated a woman and people thought it was a little bogus. ""He's not going to be hauled in front of the courts for any of this."" Hiddleston starred in BBC One's adaption of The Night Manager Nonetheless, it's fair to say HiddleSwift brought Tom a great deal ofnegative attention,external. Some fans thought the couple were being suspiciously open about their relationship, leading to accusations that all was not what it seemed. Hiddleston has now defended his relationship with Swiftin an interview with GQ,external, saying: ""Of course it was real."" He also said the 'I â¥ T.S. [Taylor Swift]' tank top he was photographed wearing was ""a joke"", explaining he was lent it by a friend to protect a graze from the sun. The actor said the pictures of him wearing the shirt were taken ""without consent or permission"", and that fans and the media had ""no context"". ""I was just surprised that it got so much attention,"" he said. ""The tank top became an emblem of this thing."" The series was directed by Susanne Bier (right) and adapted from a John le Carre novel So is this latest interview simply damage limitation? ""Absolutely,"" says Mark Borkowski. ""I don't think Tom Hiddleston knew at the time just how big a brand he was. Now he does know that and has to think carefully. ""This GQ interview is an example of putting the record straight and trying to get a narrative together to try and recover from some poorly judged moments."" Borkowski adds: ""There's a beautiful naivety about Tom Hiddleston that is projected through this interview where he's trying to talk directly to his fans. This is material you put there for them."" Hiddleston's acceptance speech at last month's Golden Globes was criticised Hiddleston himself admits in the interview: ""A relationship in the limelight takes work. And it's not just the limelight. It's everything else. ""And I'm still trying to work out a way of having a personal life and protecting it, but also without hiding."" Gaydos has a lot of sympathy for the 36-year-old on the Taylor Swift front. ""Imagine you just met someone and you're having a relationship and the whole world is watching. It's like snakes all around you,"" he says. ""I'd hate to to live in a fish bowl and have every move analysed, with people saying you're a fraud, your relationship is a fraud, everything you're doing is insincere and fake."" Hiddleston said his relationship with Taylor Swift wasn't a publicity stunt Hiddleston has two films coming out later this year  - Thor: Ragnarok and Kong: Skull Island. Gaydos says the film studios won't be particularly worried about Hiddleston's off-screen actions. ""They're worrying about the tracking. If the trailer goes out for Kong and the response isn't strong or the awareness of the movie isn't high, that's what they're really concerned about,"" he says. ""Tom has not ventured anywhere near the space where we've seen stars screw up their careers and really damage their star wattage."" Hiddleston will be seen in the new Kong and Thor films later this year Borkowski adds: ""Anything is recoverable in this day and age. ""Last week we were hearing about the death of theDavid Beckhambrand, but we'd forgotten about it by Thursday. ""Things move so quickly now, so it is always about recovery.""

Feisty FM,"It takes a special kind of person to run a radio station in an area controlled by Islamist militants in northern Syria. Music is forbidden, so are women presenters. But Raed Fares - manager of Radio Fresh FM - has come up with a creative response to the militants' demands. It is mid-day and almost time for the latest news from Radio Fresh FM in the rebel-held province of Idlib, in north west Syria. Suddenly the airwaves are filled with assorted sounds of tweeting birds, clucking chickens and bleating goats. As the newsreader gets under way, the cacophony continues beneath his voice. You might be forgiven for thinking that this is some sort of farming bulletin. It's not. It's simply that the station's manager, Raed Fares, has had enough of being told what to do by the powerful jihadist group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham or JFS - which until last July was linked to al-Qaeda and known as the al-Nusra Front. ""They tried to force us to stop playing music on air,"" says Fares. ""So we started to play animals in the background as a kind of sarcastic gesture against them."" In what appear to be further acts of sarcastic sabotage aimed at JFS's ban on music, Radio Fresh FM has introduced long sequences of bongs from London's Big Ben clock, endless ticking sounds, ringing explosions and the whistle of shells flying through the air. And instead of songs with melodies, the station now plays recordings of tuneless chanting football fans. Fares has been getting involved in confrontations of one kind or another for years now. He took part in hundreds of demonstrations against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime at the beginning of the uprising in 2011 and continues to see it as the biggest enemy. Many of his friends were killed or imprisoned, as the authorities responded with increasing violence. Raed Fares was one of many demonstrators in the town of Kafranbel in the early days of the Syrian uprising Then came the threats from fighters of the so called Islamic State. Like JFS, they said the station's music washaram, or offensive to Islam. Believing this to be totally wrong, Fares ignored the threats and carried on as before, but nearly paid with his life. Just over three years ago, when the 44-year-old former estate agent arrived home in the early hours of the morning, after finishing work at the radio station, two IS gunmen with Kalashnikovs were waiting for him. They fired a barrage of shots, leaving more than a dozen holes in his car, even more in the wall behind, and two in the right side of his body. These shattered several bones in his shoulder and ribs, as well as puncturing his right lung. Fares was left lying in a pool of blood and only narrowly survived after being rushed to hospital by his brother. ""I still have trouble breathing,"" he later said, ""but my doctor says my lungs should be no problem because of the size of my nose."" It's not that surprising that IS doesn't like Fares. After all, he did once design a poster depicting Syria as an alien with a monster called ISIS exploding out of its chest. The group has since been pushed out of Idlib province. President Assad, though, is his favourite target. He once got his friends to drape themselves in shrouds and then filmed them staggering out of graves calling for Assad to step down, as if even the dead want him gone. He posted it online and it was played on a number of Arabic television stations. Humour, it seems, is never far from the surface with Raed Fares. Take his response to another of JFS's demands, to get rid of women news readers - who are alsoharam, they say. Has he, I ask him, agreed to swap them for men? ""No, I have another solution for that issue. We simply put their voices through a computer software program which makes them sound like men."" Though having heard the resulting broadcasts, I would say the women now sound closer to Daleks or robots than men. This video can not be played Listen to a sample of Radio Fresh FM's wacky farmyard noises The feisty 6ft 2in station manager has also refused JFS's demands to allow their members into the radio station to monitor the behaviour of his staff. ""We said 'No,'"" he says. ""You have to monitor the transmissions, not what people are doing inside the radio station."" JFS are not the only extremist rebels in the area. There are about a dozen others, and even though some of the biggest factions have recently been forming new alliances, this still makes the area chaotic to govern. There is little more than two hours of mains electricity a day, water supplies are limited and food increasingly expensive in a region flooded with 700,000 refugees from elsewhere in the country. The fact that Fares's dispute with JFS has continued for so long is evidence that the group is a little more tolerant than IS. But as a family man with three children is he not worried that sooner or later one of these jihadist groups will kill him? ""They've tried that five times already,"" he says. ""If it happens, it happens. But they haven't succeeded yet. I try to survive, but if I can't, it's OK."" He tells me that the lowest point in his life came when one of his closest friends was killed and another severely injured by a bomb last summer. Fares admits that he nearly took his own life in the days that followed. But now, he says, he is more determined than ever to carry on. ""We started the revolution together and were all aware that we faced the same risks,"" he says. ""That means that my life isn't more expensive than my friends who lost their lives.""

"'Rich, thin and beautiful'","""It girls"" Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Tamara Beckwith partying in 1995 Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, found dead at the age of 45, was head girl in a band of ""It girls"" that sprinkled sparkle and glamour into the newspaper columns of the 1990s. Now, 20 years on, we ask whatever happened to the ""It girl""? They were Tara, Tamara, Amanda, Isabella - party-loving, bronzed socialites who drank fizz, travelled on private jets and wrestled with disastrous love-lives. They weren't the first of their breed. Nor will they be the last. But, after Tatler magazine put Tara and American socialite Normandie Keith on its front cover in 1996 and dubbed them the ""It girls"", the label stuck. Life in pictures: Tara Palmer-Tomkinson ""It girls"" in the 1990s were ubiquitous, says Wendy Holden, ghostwriter of Tara's witty Sunday Times column which ran in the late 1990s. ""You had to be rich, thin and beautiful. You didn't have a job because you had to spend nights in clubs and bars, and would never have made it into the office the next day. ""You never got upset, you had rich boyfriends, and lived a fairytale life."" ""You were socially aspirational, often quite posh and aristocratic."" Aristocratic, beautiful and charismatic - the Delevingne sisters fit the ""It girl"" mould, although today they are known as social influencers Kate Reardon who, as fashion director, designed Tatler's ""It girls"" front cover and now edits the magazine, agrees good looks, glamour and charisma were part of the package, but adds: ""It's the indefinable 'it' - you can't define it. ""If you could, everybody else would do it too."" She also believes a wild side helped. ""That's what made good copy. Well-behaved girls aren't that fascinating."" Wendy Holden tries to put her finger on why ""It girls"" struck such a chord in the decade that brought us Britpop, Tony Blair and the ""Rachel"" haircut. ""People could not get enough of them. I don't know why - maybe it was a reaction to the ball-breaking 1980s and the austere 1990s. ""People always like glamour. They like to see pictures of beautiful girls having lots of fun. Some admire them, some laugh at them."" Most of the girls, she says, acknowledged they were a side-shoot of the entertainment industry and ran with it. Tara was very intelligent but, says Holden, I never heard her utter a single political opinion. ""I think she thought it was slightly out of her remit - she was strictly entertainment."" With that came the assumption that all ""It girls"" were stupid, and it was a tag Tara struggled to shake off. Writing in the Spectator in 1996,externalat the height of her fame, she said: ""It is agreeable to wake in the morning and find a national newspaper praising one's beauty. ""It is far less agreeable to discover that this praise has been set in the sour old mould of 'beauty rather than brains'. ""As I grow older, I am convinced that the Restoration values of character and wit are what a woman needs to prosper, rather than book-learning."" Kate Reardon brought the ""It girl"" label to 90s Britain on the cover of Tatler Before Tara, there was Jane Asher, a one-time girlfriend of Paul McCartney, in the 1960s, and in the 1980s, it was Koo Stark, best known for her close friendship with Prince Andrew. Today's ""It girls"" are not so very different, says Reardon, although they've been rebranded. ""Social influencers"" - including party-going models Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse - are still very beautiful and like going out. The difference is they now tend to achieve a lot more, points out Reardon. In the past, they relied on the beneficence of newspaper editors. Now they can take control of their own destiny via Instagram and other social media platforms, she says. It's become more democratic and made it less likely that today's ""It girls"" will have royal or high society connections. But the appeal of these girls is, and always has been, the ""wonderful escapism"" they offer us, says Reardon. The ""It girls"" were always the people to be seen out with in their heyday, but what's happened to them in the years since? Tamara Beckwith Tamara Beckwith was a society model in 1996, and now owns a photography gallery in Chelsea Tamara Beckwith, a good friend of Tara's, was one of the best-known ""It girls"" of the 1990s. The London-born socialite went to Cheltenham Ladies' College but left after she became pregnant at 16, having a daughter, Anouska, with William Gerhauser, son of the former Playboy businessman Bill Gerhauser. She presented on The Big Breakfast and MTV, dated actors Sylvester Stallone and Charlie Sheen after moving to Los Angeles and later forged a career as a reality TV star, appearing on Dancing On Ice, CelebAir, and Come Dine With Me. Tamara married Italian property heir Giorgio Veroni in 2007 and the couple have two children of their own, daughter Violet and son Vero. Now 46, she co-owns The Little Black Gallery, a boutique gallery in Chelsea specialising in contemporary photography from around the world. Amanda de Cadenet Amanda de Cadenet has interviewed Hillary Clinton, a far cry from her days as a ""wild child"" Amanda de Cadenet was the original 1990s ""wild child"", a regular at nightclubs on London's King's Road, all while still a teenager. At 17, she dated Hollywood actor Jack Nicholson, a year later became a co-presenter on late-night Channel 4 show The Word and, at 19, married Duran Duran bassist John Taylor, before later divorcing. In 2006 she married Nick Valensi, the guitarist from The Strokes, with whom she has twins. Now 44 and living in America, Amanda became the host of US TV series The Conversation with Amanda de Cadenet in 2011, interviewing Lady Gaga, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jane Fonda. She even landed an hour-long interview with Hillary Clinton before her campaign to become US president. Normandie Keith Oil heiress Normandie Keith swapped all-night parties for early-morning yoga Normandie Keith's image as an ""It girl"" was secured when society bible Tatler featured her alongside Tara on the cover of its November 1996 issue. The American oil heiress was a huge hit on the London party scene, when she briefly dated industrialist Lord Hanson's son, Robert. She married polo player Lucas White, a friend of Robert Hanson, in 2000, and had a son, Finn. But after the couple separated, she moved back to America and trained as a yoga teacher in Los Angeles. She told the Daily Telegraph in 2014: ""I giggle when I think I now get up at 4am to practise yoga when I used to go to bed at 4am."" Lady Victoria Hervey Former Christian Dior model Lady Victoria Hervey has recently released her first book Lady Victoria Hervey and her sister Isabella, daughters of the Marquess of Bristol, were also well known figures in the 1990s and 2000s party set. As a socialite and aristocrat, Lady Victoria enjoyed a privileged life, boarding at Benenden girls' school in Kent. After turning down a place at university, she became a model for Christian Dior before opening the Akademi fashion boutique in Knightsbridge with a friend. Like many of her contemporaries she dabbled in TV, having a small part in Absolutely Fabulous before appearing on reality shows, The Farm, Love Island and on Channel 4's The Jump in 2015. Lady Victoria, 41, was also author of Victoria's Secrets, a London party diary column in the Sunday Times, and last year released her first book, Lady in Waiting, the first of a trilogy. Lady Isabella Hervey Fitness trainer Lady Isabella Hervey distanced herself from the party scene, saying she is now more of a ""home girl"" The younger Hervey sister, Lady Isabella, 34, has also been a model and actress, appearing on TV's Celebrity Love Island before becoming the face of Playboy UK and going on to compete on Celebrity Masterchef. In April 2004 she took part in Channel 4's mock Olympics, The Games, which reignited her love of sport and fitness. She released a workout DVD the following year and since 2007 has run her own business as a personal trainer. In an interview with Metro newspaper she distanced herself from the ""party scene"" and the ""socialite"" label. She said: ""A socialite is someone who goes to all those parties. I don't drink and I hardly ever go out. I'm more of a home girl."" In 2014 Lady Isabella married Belgian businessman Christophe de Pauw, and the couple have a son, Victor Michael Maurice.

Silver lining?,"Since his first day in office, Mr Trump has faced angry opposition - and it's making his opponents money Donald Trump's adversarial style during the election divided American voters like few campaigns in recent years. The president himself has referred to ""my many enemies"" - but it seems they're getting a substantial boost from the new president. Organisations that investigate, oppose, or lampoon the commander-in-chief are seeing a surge in support, in what's been dubbed ""rage donation"". From civil rights to media types, the effect is widespread. Planned Parenthood advocates for women's reproductive rights, including abortion - to which Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence are both opposed. Cecile Richards, who leads the family-planning group, told the BBC more than 400,000 people had donated since the election - ""an unprecedented outpouring of support"" - some of which has been given jokilyin Mike Pence's name. But, she said, no level of donations would be able to match the federal funding the group receives - something which may now be under threat. ""We will never back down, and we will never stop providing the care our patients need. These doors stay open, no matter what,"" she said. Pro-life supporters in the March for Life received open messages of support from both the president and vice president The Centre for Reproductive Rights, meanwhile, istrying to raise $1m,externalin Mr Trump's first 100 days ""We've had thousands of new donors in the last three months, many of whom have signed on to be monthly sustainers - donors who will be with us for the long haul,"" a spokeswoman said. One of American's biggest environmental protection groups, the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC), was singled out by popular comedian John Oliver late last year when hecalled on his viewers to donate,externalfollowing the election. Since then, ""we have seen an incredible response from the public,"" a spokeswoman said. The ""huge spike"" continued through November and December, she said, slowing slightly in early January - before picking right back up at the inauguration. ""It's definitely driven by concern over President Trump's anti-environmental rhetoric and actions,"" the NRDC said. The Sierra Club, another major environmental group,reported 11,000 new monthly donors,externalin the days following the election - nine times its previous record. SaturdayNightLive (and Alec Baldwin) It's not just charities and fundraising that are seeing a positive bump from Trump. This week, it emerged that the long-running satire show Saturday Night Live was celebrating its highest ratings in decades. Its numbers have grown by 22% overall - to 10 million viewers, the highest since 1995,according to Variety,external. Alec Baldwin's parody of Trump has become a weekly fixture on the revived SNL Alec Baldwin's portrayal of Mr Trump, which became wildly popular during the campaign, is now a weekly staple. Strident Trump critic Stephen Colbert also beat his late-night rival, Jimmy Fallon, for the first time in yearsin recent ratings,external- though there's not yet enough evidence to link late-night show ratings to politics.

In a single weekend - as they fought a legal battle against the president's controversial immigration order - the group clocked up $24m (Â£19.1m) in donations, six times what it usually receives in an entire year. The huge amountprompted the rights group to turn to Silicon Valley for helpmanaging the funds. The ACLU was inundated with record donations after it blocked part of Mr Trump's executive order, days into his term Groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Immigration Law Center have also benefited from social media campaigns. Comedian Josh Gondelman, for example, felt uncomfortable with Mr Trump's close ties to the Patriots American football team. So he came up with the ideaof donating $100 to the NAACP,externalevery time his team scored a touchdown during the Super Bowl. Coupled with a social-friendly hashtag (#AGoodGame), the idea took off, and brought in thousands of dollars in donations for civil rights groups across the US. President Trump likes totweet about,externalthe (""dishonest, lying"") media. Most news outlets would say they don't oppose the president - but by nature, question and hold authority to account. But amid outcry over ""alternative facts"" andtalk of non-existent massacres, many are reporting more readers and subscriptions. Non-profit public interest news organisation ProPublica said it had seen ""a dramatic increase in donations, beginning late on election night"". Donor numbers swelled from 3,400 in all of 2015 to more than 26,000 in 2016, the organisation's president Dick Tofel said. And recurring monthly donations jumped from $4,500 in October, just before the election, to $104,000 in January. ProPublica adopted a new slogan after White House strategist Stephen Bannon suggested the press ""keep its mouth shut"" ""It seems that the election has caused a large number of people to want to take various forms of civic action. We're very flattered that many of them think of ProPublica - and investigative journalism in the public interest generally - in that connection,"" Mr Tofel said. He stressed it was not clear that this was tied to ""particular steps"" taken by Mr Trump, but noted that donations picked up in January from inauguration day. But the same bump was seen in private newspapers too. The (""failing, wrong, so false"") New York Times, which the president said should fix its ""dwindling"" numbers, actually added 276,000 digital subscriptions in the last quarter - the biggest jump since it brought in a paywall. And the (""angry, boring"") Washington Post reported almost 100 million users on its website in both October and November last year, ""greatly exceeding previous traffic records"". Meanwhile, subscriptions to the Wall Street Journal jumped 300% on the day after the election, and it reported 70% growth in new digital subscriptions year on year. US voters chose Mr Trump - he won by a large margin in the electoral college system although he did not win the popular vote. Despite a slip in approval ratings, he appears to retain plenty of popular support. It's still too early to know if his policies have had a positive impact, but his supporters remain steadfast. Conservative news outletssuch as Breitbarthave surged in popularity, and Mr Trump's supporters have boycotted brandssuch as Kellogg'sorBudweiserwhich are perceived to have taken a political stance against the president. The president has directly criticised both people and companies through his Twitter account Mr Trump's unique style of Twitter diplomacy, however, has had a directnegativeimpact on some companies. Shortly after taking office, the new president tweeted thatBoeing's costs for Air Force Onewere ""out of control"", dropping their stock value. A similar tongue-lashing on fighter jetsdropped Lockheed Martin's stock by more than 4%. Now, that effect already seems to be waning -as Fortune magazine pointed out,external, when the presidentstruck out at retailer Nordstromfor dropping his daughter's fashion line, its stock actually rallied. It may be that Mr Trump's rhetoric is no longer having the effect it once did, and is becoming a normal part of politics. But with those opposed to the president's policies vowing they won't accept the new status quo, it remains to be seen if the ""rage"" effect will end up a steady revenue stream for the next four years.

The classic 'It girl',"Tara Palmer-Tomkinson - first identified as an It girl on a Tatler magazine front cover - was a firm favourite of event organisers and newspaper photographers, writes John Hand, because, whatever the occasion, she was ever-willing to throw on her best dress, flash her best smile and add a touch of glamour to proceedings. While the term âIt girlâ originally dated from 1927, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson (often shortened to TPT) embodied a new generation of socialites whose antics and pictures at Londonâs most exclusive clubs and events helped to fill and expand newspaper gossip columns from the 1990s onwards. And Tara was among the best connected â from a wealthy family with real connections to royalty. Tara was born in Hampshire in 1971. Her father Charles Palmer-Tomkinson is a wealthy landowner and philanthropist and her mother Patti is a former model. Prince Charles is a good friend of the family and was once photographed sharing a strictly platonic kiss with Tara at Kloster's ski resort in Switzerland. Tara grew up in Hampshire and attended Sherborne School for Girls before a short stint working at Rothschild bank in London. Here she is pictured aged 16 with family pet Wellington. Throughout her life, Tara (pictured second left with her sister Santa, Prince Charles and Prince Harry) remained loyal to the Royal Family and was a regular guest on ski-ing holidays. But she was never indiscreet about the times she spent watching the young princes William and Harry grow up. While her life as a London socialite in her early 20s was being documented in her own Sunday Times column, it was accompanied by a growing problem with cocaine use. It all came to a head with an appearance on the Frank Skinner Show in 1999, in which she slurred her words, struggled to remember her host's name and asked him ""Are you married or are you single and what are you doing later?"". The TV appearance was quickly followed by a spell in rehab. She discussed her many low moments during a memorable, but searingly honest, interview with Piers Morgan for his TV show Tabloid Tales. Redemption came in an unlikely setting for a glamorous girl-about-town. She flew to the Australian jungle in 2002 to take part in the first series of ITV's new show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Her sense of fun helped her become such a hit with viewers that she came second only to Tony Blackburn. Tara was back on top again and flavour of the month once more - landing a fun modelling assignment showing off the ""Cantonese Spring Onion"" skirt and bodice for Walkers Crisps All kinds of events were given a touch of TPT glamour, including the Fish and Chip Shop of the Year awards. Having been a big music fan all her life, Tara was given the chance to show a long-hidden talent when she competed on Comic Relief Does Fame Academy. She is seen here performing a group number with Tricia Penrose, Angellica Bell and Mel Giedroyc. And the series ended in triumph for Tara as she beat Colin Murray, Tricia Penrose and Shaun Williamson in the final. Finally the classic ""It girl"" had become a Hit girl. Having previously performed with the National Symphony Orchestra, she made a bid for pop stardom at the age of 40, writing her own single 5 Seconds. She performed the plaintive love song live on Loose Women but it did not make the charts. Through all her ups and downs, she remained close to the Royal Family and was among a select number of guests when Prince Charles married Camilla in Windsor in 2005. By the time of Prince William's wedding to Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey, Tara - pictured with her sister Santa - was confident enough to wear an outfit she had designed herself. Four years later, she launched her own fashion line, Desiderata London. She revealed in late 2016 that she had been receiving treatment for a brain tumour since the start of the year. Several months later, she was found dead at her home.

Pop gets political,"Jodie Abacus: ""We need to be a little bit more empathetic"" Up-and-coming soul star Jodie Abacus has just released a powerful song about the refugee crisis. He performed it live for the first time on Jo Whiley's BBC Radio 2 showon Wednesday night- but ahead of the session, he sat down with BBC News to talk about the story behind the song (and Elton John's helicopter). Pop is getting a long overdue dose of politics. Lady Gaga issued a subtle rebuke to Donald Trump atSunday's Super Bowl, singing the protest anthem This Land Is Your Land and quoting from the pledge of allegiance. Pop trio Muna were more explicit. Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel's chat show this week, theyadded a new verse,externalto their single I Know A Place. The final line? ""He's not my leader even if he's my president."" In the UK, Stormzy prompted an overhaul of the Brits after pointing out the ceremony's lack of diversity in his songOne Take Freestyle,external. CalledKeep Your Head Down,external, it tells the story of a family fleeing a war zone, only to be met with fear and suspicion in the country they had thought would provide safe harbour. ""I focused on Syria when I was writing,"" he says, ""but there's a load of places in the world that are going through the same thing."" This video can not be played Jodie Abacus performs Keep Your Head Down at the BBC's Maida Vale studios. Why did you decide to write about the refugee crisis? I was in LA for a session, and I saw something about refugees on the television in my hotel. That's what triggered it. I wanted to give a perspective of what it would be like to go from one country to another. I can only imagine it's a terrifying feeling. We need to be a little bit more empathetic. How did you write the lyrics? The beat of the song triggered the emotion in me. The first lyric was the chorus: ""We're moving on, but the road is long / Don't get your hopes up, you'd better keep your head down."" Don't get your hopes up is the father saying ""we're running out of chances"", and keep your head down was like, ""pray that we get out of this"". I'd assumed it was about having to keep a low profile in a new country. It's both. There's a lot of double meanings. It's also about keeping your head down to escape the bullets. The thing is, you do all this to save your life - then you're not accepted by the country where you thought you'd be safe. People hate you or they think you're going to steal their jobs or take their benefits. But there's a lot of people running away just to save their own souls. The singer has been championed by artists including Elton John, Usher and The Roots Your musical references are very eclectic. I hear Stevie Wonder, ELO, Steely Dan, even Hall & Oates in there. How did you get into music? I was born in south-east London in Lewisham Hospital. My dad used to be a DJ. He'd carry around these big speakers and play reggae, soul, funk. I was just surrounded by music. What was the first time you performed in public? I gave a foyer concert at college. What I'd done was reproduce the Jacksons'Show You the Way to Go,externalon a little computer, and I'd written my own lyrics to it. No one really knew I could sing - I wasn't one of the stand-out guys in college - but I thought, ""OK, I'll give it a go"". And all of a sudden there were people watching from on top, people crowding round the sides. At the end they were all like, ""Oh my gosh, he can sing!"". It sounds like a scene from a movie. It was actually quite nuts. This video can not be played Jodie Abacus performs She's In Love with the Weekend on the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury 2016 What inspired you to write your own music? There was a lot of trauma. My mum and dad divorced and I missed out on a lot of things because I had to go to court. Being creative took my mind off what was going on. So there was a custody battle? They were fighting over me and my younger brother and it got nasty. It was harsh. Not a lot of people, not even your parents, understand how the kids suffer, mentally. When you're that age you trust your parents and suddenly this black hole of chaos opens up. But that's what built my character, in terms of deciding I wanted to do music. But you studied acting at college, is that right? Yeah, I got my diploma in performing arts and I loved it. Why did you decide to pursue music instead? I literally decided on a notepad. I drew two big arrows in blue biro, one for music and one for acting. I wrote little notes about what I wanted to do... and I wanted to make great music. I didn't know any notes, I didn't know anything. I was just going with my feelings. You're in your mid-30s now, so it certainly hasn't been an overnight success. What happened? You leave college, you get a job, you get another job - but all that time you're taking the money you earn and you're investing it in the thing you want to do. There's always times where you think it's going to be your turn, but it just doesn't happen. How close did you come to giving up? You get tormented a lot. You get tormented to the point of thinking, ""why do I keep going?"" - but then you realign yourself. There's nothing worse than hearing an old person say, ""Oh, I wish I'd done this or that"". When I'm in my rocking chair eating apple crumble and custard, I want to say I had no regrets. This video can not be played Jodie Abacus performs I'll Be That Friend live on the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury 2016 Your big breakthrough was a song called I'll Be That Friend. How did that song arrive? Three years ago, I came down with pneumonia and almost died. I was bedridden for about three months and, in the middle of all that, I finished with my ex. She moved on to another dude, like, really quickly. I saw pictures of them kissing and, even though I'd broken up with her, it was still a shock. At the end of that year, I needed to be comforted. I needed someone to say, ""it's going to be alright'. It didn't matter who it was. I just needed someone. I'd never felt that way before, but I needed a hug. Those feelings all came out in the song. As I was writing it, I was crying and singing at the same time. And yet that song, like a lot of your music, is very positive. Was that something you felt pop was lacking? Yeah. I feel there's a fun element missing. Everyone's thinking about the formula of how to write a hit song. I don't. Music is such a spiritual thing, it has to move you. You've been getting a lot of support from Elton John on his Beats 1 show. What did you make of that? That's incredible. He's one of my heroes. He's given me a couple of proper big shout-outs. And you've covered Bennie and the Jets in concert. That was nuts. He was meant to show up - but he didn't because the cloud level was low and his helicopter couldn't land. Wow. First world problems. Haha. Right? So is there an album on the way? Yeah, it's called Take This and Grow Flowers - because I'm using every little traumatic memory as fertiliser, and then making it grow. All of these things, all of these problems I've had... every memory is like a seed. What's the best thing about success? I love travelling. I love the adventure. There's not a day where I'm not thankful. I'm happy that Radio 2 have supported me as much as they have done. Have you become a connoisseur of hotel rooms? I'm not that fussy. I get annoyed when there's no kettle. It's not just for tea - I use it to steam clothes, and it's useful for steaming your voice as well. But do you know what? I always get paranoid that someone's done a wee in it. I always wash it out, just in case. Jodie Abacus's single Keep Your Head Down is out now. His debut album follows later this year.

May's Commons victory and 'tragic' Tara,"Tara Palmer-Tomkinson might have been surprised by the amount of coverage, as well as the genuinely sad tone, afforded to her death, aged 45. The Guardian calls hers ""a life cut short"", but added that ""no-one could quite remember what she was famous for,external"". The Daily Telegraph sees her as having been ""the earliest incarnation of the C-list celebrities,externalthat now dominate our TV schedules"". She was one of the ""It girl"" crowd who were considered, the paper says, ""silly, inconsequential, sexy, effervescent, naughty - and incredible fun"". Referring to the socialite by her initials TPT, the Daily Mail says she""lit up the gossip columns of the 90s"",external. She simply ""loved being in the spotlight and the spotlight loved her back"", it says. The photo on the front of the Daily Mirror, dressed in a bikini, white boots, a fur coat and a snorkeling mask, presents her in her party-loving heyday. Theobituary in the Times,externalremembers her ""untiring glamour and her outgoing personality that fizzed like the bottles of Bollinger she enjoyed devouring"". But ""she never found contentment,external"", says the Daily Express, recalling her spiral into addiction and ill health. She ""desperately craved happiness yet rarely found it"", the paper adds. The political fall-out from Brexit so far is dealt within the Telegraph with a cartoon,external. Besides a bottle of ""Cameron's referendum elixir"", dubbed a ""cure for acute Euro-party splits"", stands a glowing Mrs May. She declares: ""I can't believe it actually worked for us!"" On the other side, Mr Corbyn and some red rosette-wearing aides are doubled up in pain, saying: ""It just made my lot worse."" The i newspaper highlights the resignation from the Labour front bench of Clive Lewis - someone it describes as a ""key Corbyn ally."" The Sun talks ofrenewed speculation about the Labour leader's future,external. However, party officials tell the Daily Mail he will not stand down - andhe will fight the next election,external. The Sun reports thatauditors have found a ""spike"" in thefts of public money,externalintended to be spent on foreign aid. The Times suggests thathundreds of millions of pounds,externalare lost every year. The Mail says the requirement to spend 0.7% of national income on aid has led ministers to""shovel bucket loads to corrupt regimes,externaland lorry-loads more to any agency willing to spend it."" Far better, says the Express, to make sure""sick and elderly people in this country are properly looked after."",external"". There are few things the papers enjoy more than a survey that is almost certain to provoke a family row. The Mail has got hold of an academic study that suggests""first born children are more likely to do better at school than their siblings"".,external The researchers think that's because ""their parents give them more stimulation in their early years"". However, the i points out that history does not prove that first-borns are brighter. While Albert Einstein and JK Rowling were, Charles Dickens was the second of eight, and Marie Curie the the youngest of five. Forget Brexit - says the Express -the latest issue to divide the nation is ketchup,external. Namely, should it be stored in the fridge, or not? Supermarkets including Aldi and Asda have been trying to find out what the customers prefer - and microbiologists have chipped in too. However, the Express ducks out of the debate, saying only that the Food Standards Agency advises people to follow the instructions on the label.

Did government go back on its word on child refugees?9 February 2017 (13:48:57),"The claim:The government had committed to taking 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, but it will now close the programme after taking in just 350. Reality Check verdict:The government previously referred to a goal to bring 3,000 unaccompanied children to the UK but eventually passed an amendment that did not commit to a specific figure. Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill says the 350 figure meets the ""intention and spirit"" of the Dubs Amendment, but Lord Dubs disagrees. Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Labour peer Lord Dubs spoke of his disappointment that the government had ""gone back on their word"" on how many unaccompanied asylum-seeking children would be brought to the UK from Europe. The 3,000 figure was originally put forward in a campaign run by charity Save the Children. And in January 2016, the then Immigration Minister, James Brokenshire, said the government would commit to resettling increasing numbers of refugees, most of whom would be children, mentioning the 3,000 figure as a goal but without giving any figure as a commitment. Then, in March 2016, Lord Dubs, who came to the UK himself as a child refugee fleeing the Nazis, tabled an amendment to the Immigration Bill, which would require the UK to take in 3,000 children who had been separated from their families. This had strong support from all opposition parties and a number of Conservative MPs. And it passed in the House of Lords by a significant margin at the end of March. But when it went to the Commons in April, the Conservative government's position was to vote against the amendment, and it was rejected by a narrow margin. It then went back to the House of Lords, where Lord Dubs reworded the amendment to read that the UK should take a ""specified number"" of unaccompanied children from Europe and that this number would be agreed later in discussion with local authorities. This again passed in the Lords with a significant majority. It then went back to the Commons and was expected to go to a vote on 9 May. But, on 4 May, ahead of the vote, Mr Cameron accepted the revised version of the amendment. Nearly a year later, on Wednesday, 8 February 2017, Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill announced that the government would transfer 350 unaccompanied children - about a 10th of the original figure - from refugee camps in Europe, which, he said, would meet the ""intention and spirit"" of Lord Dubs's amendment. Mr Goodwill said this would include about 200 children already brought to the UK under the terms of Lord Dubs's amendment and another 150 still to come. He said that more than 900 children had been brought here from Calais in total in 2016. The 700 brought to the UK but not under the terms of Lord Dubs's amendment were brought here under a different regulation, which allows unaccompanied minors to come to the UK if they already have immediate family here.

NHS in trouble10 charts that show whyHealth,"The NHS faces unrelenting pressure despite funding rising. Why? The sheer scale of the NHS can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world. This vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money. Last year Â£140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every Â£1 spent on services goes on health. Even during the years of deep austerity, extra money has been found for the health service - Â£8bn more this Parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams. The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. Which local services are under threat? Upfront charges for foreign patients When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours. But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year. The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering around the 90% mark in recent weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more. But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much. As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at Â£20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this. Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending. Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse. But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give. Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was closer to 7%. As you can see the period since 2010 has seen the tightest financial settlements. What is more, the spending squeeze is continuing during this Parliament at almost exactly the same rate, even with England's extra Â£8bn going in. Ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies believes over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population. But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC this week is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all. There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community. The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by a third in 12 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition. There are attempts to change this. To place more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less. But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state. However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at Â£60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. But none of them has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done? Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils?  Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other? Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention? But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do.

Manveen Rana: The holistic approach to health care,"Moor Park Health and Leisure Centre where you can swim and also see a doctor ""My colleagues think I'm mad,"" says Dr Andrew Weatherburn. As a consultant in geriatric medicine, he is an unlikely addition to the Moor Park Health and Leisure Centre, where schoolchildren queue for swimming lessons and people grab coffees between Zumba lessons. ""Moving out of the hospital and into the community is the best thing I've done as a consultant."" Dr Weatherburn works on the Fylde Coast, an NHS Vanguard area. The local health service here is pioneering a new model of working, which could become a blueprint for the rest of the NHS. Blackpool and Fylde suffer from many of the problems that plague the NHS nationally. With constantly increasing demand and a shortfall in supply, the local services have been under considerable strain for years. Add to that a higher than average elderly population, which is set to double by 2030, and the local health service begins to look unsustainable. ""It's about 3% of our population that use about 50% of the resources,"" says Dr Tony Naughton, the head of the clinical commissioning group in Fylde. As a part-time GP, he understands the need for an accurate diagnosis so their first innovation was to use patient data to work out who was actually using the services. They were predominantly elderly and tended to suffer from more than one long-term condition. Rather than waiting for these patients to arrive at A&E, the Fylde Coast district set up the Extensive Care system, targeting resources on actively trying to keep them healthier. Rather than providing temporary fixes every time a patient is in hospital, this model takes a more holistic approach. The Extensive Care clinic allows patients to have all their health needs addressed together ""These patients were going off to see a kidney specialist and then a diabetic specialist and then a heart specialist. They had a career in attending hospital, whereas this service wraps all of those outpatients appointments together and looks at each person as an individual, rather than as a heart or as a kidney."" Dr Naughton explains that to make this more joined up system work, it was taken out of the rigid departmental structure of the hospital and placed firmly in the community. Dr Weatherburn, at his clinic in the leisure centre, believes the benefits are obvious. ""I definitely know my patients much better now."" While in hospital, he would have had about 10 minutes to assess a patient's most urgent needs. Now every patient who is referred to them receives a thorough two-hour assessment with a group of medics, who then hold a meeting to come up with a co-ordinated treatment plan for each one. This system uses welfare workers as well as medics to manage each patients needs. ""Somebody may come in with a chest infection, but that maybe because they're not eating properly or they have a damp house. Now, I can't write a prescription for a dry house, but I can put them in touch with someone who can help with their housing problem,"" explains Dr Naughton. The welfare workers spend more time with the patients, helping them with broader social issues and finding ways of managing their illnesses at home. Their job is really to empower patients to take control of their own health. A thorough assessment means the team can come up with a co-ordinated treatment plan Dr Weatherburn says it is working. ""It's often the little things that made the big difference. It's not the big medical interventions and fancy tests, it's helping with loneliness, and helping the carers and families as well."" This may sound expensive, but the scheme should pay for itself. The new welfare workers are not medically trained so employment costs are lower, but their intervention can solve underlying problems which keep people coming back to A&E. The results are certainly impressive. After a year-and-a-half of trialling the scheme, the Fylde Coast has already seen 13% fewer attendances at A&E, and 23-24% fewer outpatient attendances. When Lily Greenwood's husband, Peter, left hospital after suffering from a stroke, they were referred to the Extensive Care service. ""The doctor sent us here. We didn't want to come, but it's been the best thing ever."" Although Lily wasn't the patient, the team's approach of looking at every aspect of the patient's well-being, meant that attention turned to 80-year-old Lily too, as Peter's sole carer. The team helped her to take control. ""It took its toll on me at the beginning, but now, I just feel that with coming here, we can cope with it."" The Extensive Care system helped look after Lily Greenwood's needs as well as those of her husband The team filled in all the forms that Lily had been baffled by, they helped her to apply for the extra benefits she was entitled to and, most importantly, they helped her to manage her husband's condition. They even introduced her to local support groups for carers so that she no longer feels alone or overwhelmed. ""The nurses to me are friends. They have time for you. We're a lot happier now. I feel I can cope with Peter now."" A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year. Video: What happens when a hospital clogs up The hospital keeping patients at home Iris Sibley's long wait to leave hospital Given their success in reducing pressure on A&E departments, Blackpool and Fylde applied a similarly local, holistic model of care to a broader section of the population. Every neighbourhood received its own dedicated team of therapists, nurses and welfare workers who could treat patients at home in order to reduce the pressures on GP surgeries. ""It's a cultural change. We don't just do the therapy and rush to the next appointment, we think about a patient's overall well-being."" Lucy Leonard is part of a neighbourhood team in Blackpool. Having been an occupational therapist for 17 years, she knows the NHS is notoriously resistant to change. Yet, she insists, this system is being embraced by patients and practitioners alike. ""Sometimes people can feel a bit frightened and threatened by change, especially when they worry about their professional identity and being asked to do new roles, but really, it's just about putting the patient at the heart of what we do."" This system has been a success on the Fylde Coast, and the principles could be replicated across the country. By investing in a more holistic approach, not only has the pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries been eased but, vitally, people are healthier and better able to manage their health too.

Will Brexit bill face trouble in the Lords?,"Sharpen your pencils. Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords. The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March. If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is ""hugely unpredictable"", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I'd put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.) The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons. MPs back Brexit bill as Lewis quits No 10 plays down Lords Brexit warning How did your MP vote on Brexit bill? Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest. Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as ""total BS"" - I'll leave you to work that out. The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to ""hold to account, not hold to ransom"". The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause. The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final ""meaningful vote"" for both Houses on the deal. It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as ""ping pong"" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end. The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble. It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.

Is Trump's cabinet facing historic obstruction?,"The claim:It has taken longer for Donald Trump to have his ""full cabinet"" confirmed than any president in US history. Reality Check Verdict:Democrats have slow-walked many of Mr Trump's presidential nominations. It has taken longer so far for him to get the majority of his choices confirmed, although part of that is due to the lateness of a few nominations and delays in submitting background-check paperwork. Mr Trump still has months to go, however, before he sets a record for how long it has taken to have all his cabinet positions filled. On 7 February Donald Trumptweeted,externalthat it was a ""disgrace"" that he did not have his full cabinet of top-level presidential appointments confirmed by the US Senate. He called it the ""longest such delay in the history of our country"" and blamed it on Democratic obstruction. His message echoed comments made by other prominent Republicans in Congress and his own administration. Press secretary Sean Spicer said the length of time it has taken to get Mr Trump's presidential nominations confirmed was ""ridiculous"". ""The Senate Democrats have done everything in their power to slow the work of the Senate, while the president continues to take decisive action, just like he promised,""he said,external. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnellsaid,external""Democrat obstruction has reached new extreme levels"", which he called a ""historic break with tradition"". ""It's time to finally accept the results of the election and move on,"" he added. Do as I say, not as I do? At its most basic level, Mr Trump's tweet about the historic nature of the delays in assembling his ""full cabinet"" is demonstrably false. As of 8 February, Mr Trump has had six of his 15 cabinet selections confirmed by the Senate, with several more awaiting final Senate approval. While he still has a way to go before his entire team is in place, it's hardly historic at this point. Bill Clinton didn't have his final spot filled until 11 March. Republican George HW Bush took until 17 March. Barack Obama holds the modern record, as his last pick - Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius - didn't get her Senate vote until 28 April. Only George W Bush, who like Mr Trump won the presidency without securing a plurality of the popular vote, had his full team in place within weeks of his inauguration, following John Ashcroft's confirmation as attorney general on 30 January. While Mr Trump's assertion is without basis in fact, he - and his fellow Republicans - are on firmer ground with a more general complaint about delayed confirmations. Of the past five presidencies, Mr Trump has by far the fewest confirmed cabinet selections at this point. Only two of his nominees - Secretary of Defence James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly - were approved on inauguration day. Mr Clinton had three, Mr Obama had six, and George W Bush had seven. By mid-February, Mr Obama had all but three of his picks seated. Mr Clinton had all but one. George HW Bush was missing four. Part of the reason it took so long to fit those last pieces into their cabinets is because those past presidents had to withdraw initial selections due to scandal or insurmountable political opposition. George HW Bush's defence pick, John Tower, was voted down by the Senate. Mr Clinton swung and missed twice on attorney general before settling on Janet Reno. Mr Obama withdrew commerce nominees twice and health and human services once. So far, Mr Trump has stuck with his original picks - although labour secretary nominee Andrew Puzder has yet to complete his ethics review and has had his confirmation hearing delayed four times. Puzder isn't the only one of Mr Trump's wealthy nominees who has had difficulty completing the Office of Government Ethics' vetting paperwork, which has contributed to confirmation delays. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross wereamong those,externalwho were tardy in complying with background-check requirements. Mr Trump was also remarkably slow to come up with several cabinet picks. He didn't announce Veterans Affairs nominee David Shulkin until 11 January. Agriculture pick Sonny Perdue was unveiled just two days before inauguration on 20 January - an astounding fact, considering of Mr Trump's four predecessors, only four original nominations came after New Year's Day (George HW Bush's energy pick James Watkins was the latest, on 12 January). Empty Democrat seats during a committee vote on two cabinet nominee This isn't to discount the obvious efforts Democrats have made to drag out the confirmation process for some Trump picks. They staged walk-outs at committee hearings for health and human services nominee Tom Price and treasury's Steven Mnuchin, delaying approval votes by a day. They gave long speeches that held up votes for Mr Sessions in committee vote and Ms DeVos on the Senate floor. They've used bits of arcane Senate procedure and parliamentary manoeuvres to gum up the works where they can - although, due to their minority status, they can only delay, not derail. Although the efforts have been futile, Democratic senators are voting ""no"" on Mr Trump's nominees at an increasingly higher rate. More Democrats cast votes against Ms Devos than all previous education secretaries combined, dating back to the position's creation in 1980. There have been a total of 111 no votes in the five nominees who have come up for a full Senate vote so far - compared with only 18 in the entirety of Mr Clinton's presidency. Mr Obama's choices had 406 no votes, but that was over the course of eight years and 31 nominations. Betsy DeVos confirmation took Vice President's Pence tiebreaker vote Democrats have also pumped up the anti-Trump rhetoric, throwing red meat to a Democratic base that is furious at any signs of compromise or accommodation. ""If not total unanimity, we're going to have near Democratic unity in opposing the remaining nominees for President Trump's cabinet,"" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said on Monday. ""This unity makes clear just how bad this cabinet would be for America's middle class and those struggling to get there."" While Republicans cite statements like Schumer's as examples of unprecedented Democratic intransigence, Democrats are quick to note that in the latter days of the Obama administration, conservatives were equally vigorous in their opposition to the president's selections. Merrick Garland, whose Supreme Court nomination languished for 10 months before expiring without a hearing, is foremost in their minds, but even Mr Obama's second-term cabinet picks faced record-breaking delays. His choice for labour secretary, Thomas Perez, took 121 days to be confirmed. John Bryson, his commerce pick, waited 126 days. Attorney General Loretta Lynch holds the modern record, as 161 days passed before getting Senate approval. If a Trump nominee had that sort of delay, he or she wouldn't assume office until well into June.

Can the FA deliver real change?,"FA chairman Greg Clarke has vowed to resign if his plans for reform are not backed by the government Reform of the FA? Haven't I heard this one before? Yes, we've been down this road many times. Does this sound familiar? ""We are making progress, albeit slowly. I intend to see that we continue to make progress by continuing to meet all the interested parties and bringing them together, if necessary, because all of us are concerned with the health of this great game which has given so much satisfaction, not only to us but to almost the whole nation over the years."" That quote comes from Denis Howell MP, Minister for Housing and Local Government, speaking in the House of Commons in 1968 about reform of the Football Association. Howell was taking part ina debate on the Chester Report,,externalcommissioned in 1966 to ""enquire into the state of association football at all levels, including the organisation, management, finance and administration, and the means by which the game may be developed for the public good; and to make recommendations"". Now, nearly half a century later, MPs are once more asking roughly the same questions - given the lack of any substantial change. On Thursday,a Commons debate,externalwill ask whether the FA has the ability to reform itself, or whether legislation is needed to force it to change. FA Council needs greater diversity - Bevington This video can not be played Damian Collins MP: 'We no longer have any confidence' The crises in governance at some global sports bodies, including football's world governing body Fifa, prompted a rethink over how organisations which receive government funding should operate. Last year, grassroots funding body Sport England set out required standards for transparency, accountability and financial integrity from those organisations which ask for government and National Lottery funding.The Code for Sports Governancewill come into force in April. It demands, for example, 30% gender diversity on boards, greater transparency and term limits. The FA is due to meet the Government in the spring to show its plans for achieving the required standards. But MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Select Committee have run out of patience and are exerting pressure on the FA to ensure it goes through with modernisation.Thursday's backbench debateis another method to do just that. The committee has previously published two reports which set out how its MPs think: The Premier League is dominant within English football and should have its influence diluted The FA's decision-making capabilities should change There should be greater representation for fans and the grassroots game The Premier League was known as the FA Premier League in its inaugural season, 1992-93 In a letter to the chairman of the CMS committee last December, five former FA chairmen and chief executives outlined howthey believe the governing body is incapable of changewithout external assistance in the form of government-backed legislation. The quintet - David Bernstein, David Davies, Greg Dyke, Alex Horne and Lord Triesman - also laid some of the blame for the failures within English football at the door of the Premier League. ""We can testify first-hand that the FA's decision-making structures are arcane and convoluted leading to a lack of clarity about the role and purpose of these structures,"" they wrote. ""The FA has neither the modernity of approach nor independence required to counter the [Premier League] juggernaut or to modernise its own governance."" In response, the Premier League said it had ""always supported the FA's governance reforms"" and had backed previous reform proposals. A statement at the time read: ""We have kept patience when past chairmen and chief executives at the FA have failed to deliver, but will continue to work with the current leadership team at the FA to progress their governance agenda."" The former executives also outlined how the FA board is effectively gridlocked, with members of the professional game and those of the national - or grassroots - game often representing their own interests rather than those of the wider sport. This video can not be played Former FA Chairman Greg Dyke tells Radio 4's Today FA is like travelling back to 1952 The board of directors, the FA Council and matters such as voting structures all need to change. If not, the FA's public funding - worth Â£30m over four years - is at risk. Ultimately, the government could also refuse to act as a financial guarantor if the FA wanted to bid to host a future World Cup or European Championship. Former FA chairman Dyke said he wanted the council, which is effectively English football's parliament, to be more representative and ""better reflect the balance of the modern game"". Of its current 122 members, only eight are women and four are black or ethnic minority. There is also representation from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, something many people see as anachronistic given there is only one representative each from fans and players. Oh, and 92 of them are aged over 60, while 12 are octogenarians. Dyke failed in his efforts for reform with some board members opposed, given they believe their roles would be watered down - and his successor must find a way to convince them otherwise. The FA board, meanwhile, has been amended in recent years with the addition of two independent directors. There are plans to add two female representatives this summer, bringing the total number of members to 14. It currently consists of four representatives of the national game and four representatives of the professional game, plus two non-executives, the chairman and the chief executive. This video can not be played Football changes 'not fast enough' says David Davies The FA is privately annoyed at the timing of the debate, believing it should be allowed to set forward its plans in April to Sports Minister Tracey Crouch. It is also keen to emphasise that it has invested record amounts in grassroots facilities, has led the way on promoting women's football and has developed St George's Park as a hub to improve the fortunes of the England national teams. But the spectre of legislation - essentially, having change forced upon them - awaits if the FA's reform plans fail. That would need government backing to bring forward, and there is no sign of that occurring just yet. FA chairman Greg Clarke hasthreatened to resignif his plans are not supported. That can probably be viewed as a signal of his confidence of delivering reform to both the board and council, thus satisfying the immediate requirements of the Code for Sports Governance. The glacial pace of the debate has left many involved frustrated, and believing the FA is unable to self-regulate. The five former executives wrote that meaningful reform ""may well move us to redressing the woeful lack of English players or managers and the embarrassing failures of our national team for the past 50 years"". And reform would also see those at the heart of the FA decision-making change to look more like those who actually play, watch and administer the game in 2017. Thursday's debate, though, is just the latest staging post on what is a very long journey.

Manveen Rana: The holistic approach to health care9 February 2017 (11:00:53),"Moor Park Health and Leisure Centre where you can swim and also see a doctor ""My colleagues think I'm mad,"" says Dr Andrew Weatherburn. As a consultant in geriatric medicine, he is an unlikely addition to the Moor Park Health and Leisure Centre, where schoolchildren queue for swimming lessons and people grab coffees between Zumba lessons. ""Moving out of the hospital and into the community is the best thing I've done as a consultant."" Dr Weatherburn works on the Fylde Coast, an NHS Vanguard area. The local health service here is pioneering a new model of working, which could become a blueprint for the rest of the NHS. Blackpool and Fylde suffer from many of the problems that plague the NHS nationally. With constantly increasing demand and a shortfall in supply, the local services have been under considerable strain for years. Add to that a higher than average elderly population, which is set to double by 2030, and the local health service begins to look unsustainable. ""It's about 3% of our population that use about 50% of the resources,"" says Dr Tony Naughton, the head of the clinical commissioning group in Fylde. As a part-time GP, he understands the need for an accurate diagnosis so their first innovation was to use patient data to work out who was actually using the services. They were predominantly elderly and tended to suffer from more than one long-term condition. Rather than waiting for these patients to arrive at A&E, the Fylde Coast district set up the Extensive Care system, targeting resources on actively trying to keep them healthier. Rather than providing temporary fixes every time a patient is in hospital, this model takes a more holistic approach. The Extensive Care clinic allows patients to have all their health needs addressed together ""These patients were going off to see a kidney specialist and then a diabetic specialist and then a heart specialist. They had a career in attending hospital, whereas this service wraps all of those outpatients appointments together and looks at each person as an individual, rather than as a heart or as a kidney."" Dr Naughton explains that to make this more joined up system work, it was taken out of the rigid departmental structure of the hospital and placed firmly in the community. Dr Weatherburn, at his clinic in the leisure centre, believes the benefits are obvious. ""I definitely know my patients much better now."" While in hospital, he would have had about 10 minutes to assess a patient's most urgent needs. Now every patient who is referred to them receives a thorough two-hour assessment with a group of medics, who then hold a meeting to come up with a co-ordinated treatment plan for each one. This system uses welfare workers as well as medics to manage each patients needs. ""Somebody may come in with a chest infection, but that maybe because they're not eating properly or they have a damp house. Now, I can't write a prescription for a dry house, but I can put them in touch with someone who can help with their housing problem,"" explains Dr Naughton. The welfare workers spend more time with the patients, helping them with broader social issues and finding ways of managing their illnesses at home. Their job is really to empower patients to take control of their own health. A thorough assessment means the team can come up with a co-ordinated treatment plan Dr Weatherburn says it is working. ""It's often the little things that made the big difference. It's not the big medical interventions and fancy tests, it's helping with loneliness, and helping the carers and families as well."" This may sound expensive, but the scheme should pay for itself. The new welfare workers are not medically trained so employment costs are lower, but their intervention can solve underlying problems which keep people coming back to A&E. The results are certainly impressive. After a year-and-a-half of trialling the scheme, the Fylde Coast has already seen 13% fewer attendances at A&E, and 23-24% fewer outpatient attendances. When Lily Greenwood's husband, Peter, left hospital after suffering from a stroke, they were referred to the Extensive Care service. ""The doctor sent us here. We didn't want to come, but it's been the best thing ever."" Although Lily wasn't the patient, the team's approach of looking at every aspect of the patient's well-being, meant that attention turned to 80-year-old Lily too, as Peter's sole carer. The team helped her to take control. ""It took its toll on me at the beginning, but now, I just feel that with coming here, we can cope with it."" The Extensive Care system helped look after Lily Greenwood's needs as well as those of her husband The team filled in all the forms that Lily had been baffled by, they helped her to apply for the extra benefits she was entitled to and, most importantly, they helped her to manage her husband's condition. They even introduced her to local support groups for carers so that she no longer feels alone or overwhelmed. ""The nurses to me are friends. They have time for you. We're a lot happier now. I feel I can cope with Peter now."" A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year. Video: What happens when a hospital clogs up The hospital keeping patients at home Iris Sibley's long wait to leave hospital Given their success in reducing pressure on A&E departments, Blackpool and Fylde applied a similarly local, holistic model of care to a broader section of the population. Every neighbourhood received its own dedicated team of therapists, nurses and welfare workers who could treat patients at home in order to reduce the pressures on GP surgeries. ""It's a cultural change. We don't just do the therapy and rush to the next appointment, we think about a patient's overall well-being."" Lucy Leonard is part of a neighbourhood team in Blackpool. Having been an occupational therapist for 17 years, she knows the NHS is notoriously resistant to change. Yet, she insists, this system is being embraced by patients and practitioners alike. ""Sometimes people can feel a bit frightened and threatened by change, especially when they worry about their professional identity and being asked to do new roles, but really, it's just about putting the patient at the heart of what we do."" This system has been a success on the Fylde Coast, and the principles could be replicated across the country. By investing in a more holistic approach, not only has the pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries been eased but, vitally, people are healthier and better able to manage their health too.

Deal or no deal on council tax rise?Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor8 February 2017 (21:32:03),"Surrey Council called off a referendum on a 15% tax rise Deal or no deal? Jeremy Corbyn unusually had the better of Theresa May in Prime Minister's Questions, brandishing leaked texts across the despatch box, claiming evidence that the Tories had given Surrey a special deal to avoid the chance of a damaging 15% council tax rise in a Conservative safe haven. The council, and ministers, denied there had been any stitch-up. But hours later, the government admitted they had agreed, in theory, that Surrey County Council could, like several others, try out keeping all of the business rates they raise from 2018, which could plug the gaps in funding in future. That change is due to be in force across in England by 2020. Technically therefore, Surrey County Council has not been offered any additional funding. But the prospect of more flexibility over their own income in future could help fill the council's coffers, and seems to have eased some of their concerns. But as a solution to easing the pressure in social care across the country now, the idea could fall far short. Where there is high need for care for the elderly, there is likely to be a lower local tax base. Conversely, in more prosperous areas where councils can raise a lot of tax, there is likely to be less need for financial help. One local government leader told me ""all that would do is to lock in the existing iniquity to the system"". And major changes to how councils pay their way could make a difference in the long term. Many argue, the social care crisis is now. Medics, NHS leaders, local government leaders, MPs, former ministers, and of course many members of the public are day after day reporting concerns about the creaks in the social care system, arguing for big changes or big extra money. There are though few signs of any extra cash on the way in the Budget next month. Privately ministers are hunting for solutions. The prime minister's allies say she is prepared to be ""radical"". A Tory council might have been appeased by a promise to change their future funding - others may not be so easily satisfied.

The genius behind some of TV's greatest comedies8 February 2017 (12:43:00),"Alan Simpson outside BBC Television Centre in 1970 Alan Simpson formed, with Ray Galton, one of the great television scriptwriting partnerships. Their early work with Tony Hancock pioneered what became known as situation comedy. They went on to create Steptoe and Son, which became the most watched comedy on TV over its 12-year run. But, although they continued to write, they failed to replicate the success of their early work. Alan Simpson was born in Brixton, London on 27 November 1929. After leaving school, he obtained a job as a shipping clerk before contracting tuberculosis. He became so ill that he was not expected to live and was given the last rites. However, he survived, and while a patient in a sanatorium in Surrey he found himself alongside another teenage TB sufferer named Ray Galton. Simpson (l) and Galton with Tony Hancock Galton never forgot his first sight of his future partner, 6ft 4in tall with a build to match. ""He was the biggest bloke I'd ever seen."" They discovered a shared love of American humorists such as Damon Runyon and had both listened to the BBC radio comedy programmes Take It From Here and The Goon Shows. Their first work together was for hospital radio. Have You Ever Wondered was based on their experiences in the sanatorium, which was played out in 1949. When Simpson left hospital he was asked by a local church concert party to write a show and he roped in Ray Galton to help. They also began sending one-liners to the BBC, which secured them a job writing for a struggling radio show called Happy-Go-Lucky. The pair also linked up with several other promising new comedy writers and performers  of the time, notably Eric Sykes, Peter Sellers, Frankie Howerd and Tony Hancock. They were quickly tiring of the format of radio comedy shows of the time which included music, sketches and one-liners, and hankered after something with more depth. They came up with the idea of comedy where all the humour came from the situations in which characters find themselves. Tony Hancock liked the idea and Hancock's Half Hour was born. Steptoe and Son carried elements of black comedy and social realism It is often credited as the first true radio sitcom, although two other shows of the time, A Life of Bliss and Life with the Lyons, were already using the format in 1954 when Hancock first aired. Over the following five years the writers developed the format, often taking cues from a new generation of playwrights such as John Osborne and Harold Pinter. The pace of each show became slow and more measured, in direct contrast to the speedy wise-cracking delivery of contemporary radio comedians such as Ted Ray. Simpson himself appeared in early episodes as the unknown man who had to suffer Hancock's interminable monologues. In 1956 the series transferred to TV and ran until 1961. The final series was just entitled Hancock and it was that run which featured the best-known shows including The Blood Donor (""It was either that or join the Young Conservatives"") and The Radio Ham, in which Hancock proves completely incapable of responding to a distress signal from a sinking yachtsman. Hancock, who was becoming increasingly self-critical and drinking heavily, sacked his writers in 1961. Unwilling to lose them, the BBC commissioned them to write scripts for Comedy Playhouse, a series of one-off sitcoms. One play, entitled, The Offer, spawned Steptoe and Son, the tale of two rag-and-bone merchants, a father and son, living in Oil Drum Lane, Shepherd's Bush. They remained close friends after their writing partnership ended The script relied on the clash between the two characters; Albert, the grasping father with none too hygienic personal habits and Harold, his aspirational son who yearns for a better life but never achieves it. The show was unusual in that the two performers, Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H Corbett, were actors rather than comedians. The original four series ran between 1962 and 1965 and the show was revived between 1970 and 1974, during which time two feature film versions were also released. It proved to be the high point for the duo. There was further work with Frankie Howerd and, in 1977, Yorkshire TV attempted to replicate the success of Comedy Playhouse with Galton & Simpson's Playhouse, although none of the episodes produced a series. Simpson quit writing in 1978 to pursue his other business interests although he and Galton remained close friends. In 1996 they reunited to update some of their best-known scripts for the comedian Paul Merton. Simpson blamed their later lack of popularity on the fact that shows were commissioned by armies of managers rather than producers. ""Fifty years ago,"" he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, ""if you had an idea, it could be going out in three weeks; the time it took to build the sets. Now it has to go through committees and the process takes years."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

How firms should react to a crisis8 February 2017 (23:58:55),"Ashley Madison was fined for not sufficiently protecting customers' data When infidelity website Ashley Madison was the victim of a hacking attack in 2015, the affected 36 million global users were suddenly very worried indeed. The business, a dating site for married people who wish to cheat on their spouse, had the data of its customers stolen and released on to the internet. All their names, passwords, phone numbers and addresses. While it was a very bleak time for Ashley Madison's users, the company itself faced a major crisis, and it was found to be lacking. As customer numbers and revenues plummeted, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - the US agency tasked with protecting consumers - ruled that the business had not done enough to protect people's information, both before and after the attack. The FTC fined Ashley Madison $1.6m,external(Â£1.3m), and said that the financial penalty was only that low because it didn't think that the business could afford to pay any more, such was the impact of the hack on its earnings. Where Ashley Madison failed was its insufficient crisis management - it hadn't prepared enough for something bad happening, and how it would react. All companies need to prepare for how they would react to a hack of their IT systems While the company tells the BBC it has subsequently overhauled all its systems, how should all firms best plan for and then respond to a crisis, be it a cyber-attack, financial scandal or other serious issue? With the UK government confirming last year that two-thirds of large British companies had experienced acyber-attack,externalin the previous 12 months alone, businesses who have an online presence anywhere in the world simply have to prepare for how they would react to a hack that breaches their system. A business can make its website as secure as possible, but being 100% protected is just not achievable, say IT experts. Page Group was ready to deal with the breach of its IT system Thankfully for UK employment agency Page Group it knew exactly how to react when it suffered a data breach of its cloud computing system in October last year. ""We have senior staff in place from across different parts of our organisation that form an issues management team who are well equipped to deal with a crisis, should it arise,"" says Eamon Collins, Page's group marketing manager. ""That is why when we were alerted to a data breach by our IT vendor Capgemini, this team was able to act fast, review the issue, and provide counsel on the best course of action. ""The most important part of the process is putting your customers' interests first."" He adds: ""Once we had sufficient information around what had happened, and the impact, we could undertake a transparent and open dialogue with the customer."" At former US mining group National Coal, the crisis it faced was repeated protests in the early 2000s by environmentalists who objected to its opencast mining in east Tennessee. Its then chief executive, Daniel Roling, said the company had plans in place for how it responded to everything it faced - from trespassers, to staff being threatened, entry roads being blockaded, and bomb threats. ""We held a number of run-throughs to test the effectiveness of both communications and operation responses,"" he says. ""The plan should, at a minimum, include an acceptable and effective means of communication, as well as an outline of who can and should provide direction."" Daniel Roling says National Coal had crisis management plans in place Mr Roling, who left National Coal before it was sold to Ranger Energy Investments in 2010, adds: ""We had everything planned right down to where we would hold a press conference, and how we would set it up. ""In crisis planning, you are looking to create an effective auto-response, so that everyone heads in the right direction, without too much deliberation."" At UK tourist attraction, the Jorvik Viking Centre, in York,its crisis was a major floodin December 2015 that caused significant damage. Director of attractions Sarah Maltby says the team worked hard to remove precious artefacts before they were damaged. ""Every company needs solid staff to assist, offer advice, and manage elements of disaster recovery,"" she says. Sarah Maltby says the Jorvik Viking Centre was saved by staff working together The centre is now due to finallyreopen in April this year. Crisis management expert Jonathan Bernstein says it is vital that a company responds quickly to a crisis. ""The crisis moves at its own pace, but you need to be faster."" He adds that firms should be honest about the crisis at hand, especially if it is something they are to blame for, such as a financial scandal. ""Be honest about how you screwed up, and illustrate how you are going to ensure this doesn't happen again,"" says Mr Bernstein. ""Provide clear information to customers on what happened exactly, and what new protocols will be in place."" Damon Coppola, founder of Shoreline Risk, a company that assists businesses with their risk management, says that when it comes to a firm preparing for a possible crisis ""the public might not necessarily expect perfection"". But he adds: ""[The public's] judgement will be hard if it is perceived that the company failed to act on an obligation to limit or prepare for a known risk, if they were dishonest in their communication, and perhaps in the worst case, if profits came before people."" These are views echoed by UK public relations expert Benjamin Webb, founder of media relations firm Deliberate PR, which specialises in Swedish start-ups. He says: ""At a time of fast-moving crisis, particularly when people's well-being is at stake, transparency to customers and their family members must exceed any responsibility to shareholders."" Rob Segal says that Ashley Madison has improved its systems since the hack At Toronto-based Ruby Corporation, the owner of Ashley Madison, chief executive Rob Segal, says the company has worked hard to rebuild trust since the 2015 hack. Mr Segal, who joined the firm after the attack, says: ""We partnered with Deloitte's world-leading security team following the breach, and they've been helping the company with privacy and security enhancements and 24/7 monitoring. ""The go-forward lessons for chief executives is to always stay vigilant about cybersecurity, and to continually invest in privacy and security safeguards.""

Who gets social care and who pays for it?8 February 2017 (16:18:23),"We know our population is ageing and, as we live longer, many of us will need support in old age. There has also been an increase in the numbers of people living with a disability who may rely on some level of social care. Niall Dickson, the head of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the system was trying to cope with ""huge amounts of extra demand"" as a result of there being ""many many more"" older people. Between 2005 and 2015, the number of people aged 65 and over in the UK increased by 21%, while the number aged 85 and over increased by 31%. More than a million more people were living with a disability in the UK in 2016 than 10 years earlier because people are living longer with disabilities than before. This is all good news. But at the same time, directors of adult social services in England say they have had to cut Â£4.6bn from their budgets since 2010. So who is getting care, what kind of care are they getting and who is paying for it? Unlike the NHS, in England social care is not free at the point of delivery - a lot of people have to pay for at least some of their care, and a lot of that care is delivered by private providers. That can be anything from someone coming to your house to help you get out of bed or washed, to full-time accommodation in a care home. It's a little different in the rest of the UK - home care is capped at Â£60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care, that is help with things such as washing and dressing, in both care homes and people's own homes. The UK Homecare Association estimates that more than 70% of homecare services in the UK are bought by local authorities, with the rest bought by people paying for their care themselves. In 2014-15, that equated to 646,000 people being cared for in their homes with the state paying. This doesn't necessarily mean 70% of people who need care at home are paid for by the state. In 2015, Age UK estimated that more than a million older people in England were living with unmet social care needs (such as not receiving assistance with bathing and dressing), a rise from 800,000 in 2010. People not eligible for funding may just be doing without the care they really need or relying on informal care from friends and family. When it comes to residential care, the latest figures from 2014 suggest local authorities across the UK paid for 37% of people, while the NHS funded 10% of care home places. The rest was made up of people who either paid for all of their care (41%), or topped it up with a contribution from their local council (12%). On 31 March 2016, in England, there were 199,305 people in nursing and residential home places and 452,990 people accessing long-term care in the community for whom the local council had some role in funding or providing care or assessing the needs of the person receiving it. The most recent data doesn't tell us how many people were cared for overall in England, but we can say that there were 1.8 million requests for support in 2015-16. Of those, 28% were from people aged 18-64 and the remaining 72% were aged 65 and over. But of these requests, 57% resulted in no direct support from the council. For the over-65 group, almost a quarter of requests for support were from people being discharged from hospital. Think tank the King's Fund says the number of older people getting state-funded help in England alone fell by 26% between 2009 and 2014. This is in the context of an ageing population. The government has said English councils' social care departments are getting an extra Â£3.5bn by 2020. Almost Â£2bn of this comes from council tax, which local authorities have been allowed to raise by 3% this year and next year provided they spend it on adult social care.

Mark Simpson: How Karen Matthews made a fool out of me8 February 2017 (16:19:18),"Karen Matthews came out of her house to talk to Mark Simpson Shannon Matthews's disappearance in a 2008 hoax-kidnapping is being recounted in a BBC drama.BBC News's Mark Simpson,external, who reported on the case, looks back at the deception. Karen Matthews made a fool out of me. I looked into her sunken eyes, saw that she was petrified and gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe my judgement was coloured by the fact that she chose to give me her first interview. Maybe it was clouded by seeing inside her small semi-detached house, and the grim conditions in which she and her seven children were living. Maybe I was so cold at the time, my brain froze. Karen's daughter Shannon, nine, disappeared on the coldest night of the year in February 2008. Shannon was missing for 24 days Police divers who searched a lake near her home in Dewsbury Moor in West Yorkshire had to break through ice to get into the water. The air temperature had dipped to -4C. The night Karen agreed to talk to me, I was shaking with cold after spending hour after hour talking live on the BBC News Channel (or BBC News 24 as it was then). Karen spotted me out of her front window and came out to talk. She was shaking too, but out of fear. She was scared - scared of being found out. She gave me no eye contact. She looked down the barrel of the BBC camera and said; ""Shannon if you're out there, please come home. We love you to bits, we miss you so much. Please, I'm begging you baby, come home."" Karen Matthews appeals for information on her daughter's disappearance When the police saw her interview on the BBC Ten O'Clock News, they were annoyed. They had advised her not to talk to the media. They were as surprised as me that she agreed to give me an interview. So was this erratic behaviour the first sign that all was not what it seemed? The kidnap hoax that shocked the UK BBC iPlayer: The Moorside, episode one In hindsight, it may seem so, but at the time, it seemed simply a desperate act by a desperate mother. Fresh in my mind were the Soham murders of schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells. When children disappeared for more than 48 hours, the outcome was usually not good. That is why there was such a huge community effort to try to find Shannon. People realised that time was short. Yes, I did wonder if Karen Matthews was telling the truth. Everyone did. However, I believed her. And I was not alone. As well as searching hedges and parkland, the police drew up a map showing where convicted paedophiles lived in the Dewsbury area. They checked, and double-checked. There was no sign of Shannon. As days turned to weeks, the more convinced detectives became that Shannon would not be coming home. However, Karen's friends and neighbours never gave up, and neither did the police. About 10% of the force's officers were put on the case and more than Â£3m was spent in what was one of the largest search operations since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper. Karen Matthews was jailed for eight years Shannon was eventually found, 24 days after she disappeared. A BBC colleague got a tip-off and phoned me. I was shopping in Ikea in Leeds at the time, and nearly dropped my phone on a multi-coloured Swedish rug when I heard the news. As I drove down the A6110 to Dewsbury, I wondered if Karen would give me an interview again. We could do it in the same spot where we had first spoken. The only difference would be that this time she would be with Shannon beside her. The tears would turn to cheers. For once, it would be a story with a happy ending. What a fool I was. It later emerged that Shannon had been kept drugged and hidden in the base of a divan bed by the very people appealing for her safe return. That September Karen, and Michael Donovan, the uncle of Karen's partner, went on trial for kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. They were jailed for eight years after the court heard about their plot to hide the child and claim a Â£50,000 reward that subsequently had been offered by the Sun.

A song for Syria,"Jodie Abacus: ""We need to be a little bit more empathetic"" Up-and-coming soul star Jodie Abacus has just released a powerful song about the refugee crisis. He performed it live for the first time on Jo Whiley's BBC Radio 2 showon Wednesday night- but ahead of the session, he sat down with BBC News to talk about the story behind the song (and Elton John's helicopter). Pop is getting a long overdue dose of politics. Lady Gaga issued a subtle rebuke to Donald Trump atSunday's Super Bowl, singing the protest anthem This Land Is Your Land and quoting from the pledge of allegiance. Pop trio Muna were more explicit. Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel's chat show this week, theyadded a new verse,externalto their single I Know A Place. The final line? ""He's not my leader even if he's my president."" In the UK, Stormzy prompted an overhaul of the Brits after pointing out the ceremony's lack of diversity in his songOne Take Freestyle,external. CalledKeep Your Head Down,external, it tells the story of a family fleeing a war zone, only to be met with fear and suspicion in the country they had thought would provide safe harbour. ""I focused on Syria when I was writing,"" he says, ""but there's a load of places in the world that are going through the same thing."" This video can not be played Jodie Abacus performs Keep Your Head Down at the BBC's Maida Vale studios. Why did you decide to write about the refugee crisis? I was in LA for a session, and I saw something about refugees on the television in my hotel. That's what triggered it. I wanted to give a perspective of what it would be like to go from one country to another. I can only imagine it's a terrifying feeling. We need to be a little bit more empathetic. How did you write the lyrics? The beat of the song triggered the emotion in me. The first lyric was the chorus: ""We're moving on, but the road is long / Don't get your hopes up, you'd better keep your head down."" Don't get your hopes up is the father saying ""we're running out of chances"", and keep your head down was like, ""pray that we get out of this"". I'd assumed it was about having to keep a low profile in a new country. It's both. There's a lot of double meanings. It's also about keeping your head down to escape the bullets. The thing is, you do all this to save your life - then you're not accepted by the country where you thought you'd be safe. People hate you or they think you're going to steal their jobs or take their benefits. But there's a lot of people running away just to save their own souls. The singer has been championed by artists including Elton John, Usher and The Roots Your musical references are very eclectic. I hear Stevie Wonder, ELO, Steely Dan, even Hall & Oates in there. How did you get into music? I was born in south-east London in Lewisham Hospital. My dad used to be a DJ. He'd carry around these big speakers and play reggae, soul, funk. I was just surrounded by music. What was the first time you performed in public? I gave a foyer concert at college. What I'd done was reproduce the Jacksons'Show You the Way to Go,externalon a little computer, and I'd written my own lyrics to it. No one really knew I could sing - I wasn't one of the stand-out guys in college - but I thought, ""OK, I'll give it a go"". And all of a sudden there were people watching from on top, people crowding round the sides. At the end they were all like, ""Oh my gosh, he can sing!"". It sounds like a scene from a movie. It was actually quite nuts. This video can not be played Jodie Abacus performs She's In Love with the Weekend on the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury 2016 What inspired you to write your own music? There was a lot of trauma. My mum and dad divorced and I missed out on a lot of things because I had to go to court. Being creative took my mind off what was going on. So there was a custody battle? They were fighting over me and my younger brother and it got nasty. It was harsh. Not a lot of people, not even your parents, understand how the kids suffer, mentally. When you're that age you trust your parents and suddenly this black hole of chaos opens up. But that's what built my character, in terms of deciding I wanted to do music. But you studied acting at college, is that right? Yeah, I got my diploma in performing arts and I loved it. Why did you decide to pursue music instead? I literally decided on a notepad. I drew two big arrows in blue biro, one for music and one for acting. I wrote little notes about what I wanted to do... and I wanted to make great music. I didn't know any notes, I didn't know anything. I was just going with my feelings. You're in your mid-30s now, so it certainly hasn't been an overnight success. What happened? You leave college, you get a job, you get another job - but all that time you're taking the money you earn and you're investing it in the thing you want to do. There's always times where you think it's going to be your turn, but it just doesn't happen. How close did you come to giving up? You get tormented a lot. You get tormented to the point of thinking, ""why do I keep going?"" - but then you realign yourself. There's nothing worse than hearing an old person say, ""Oh, I wish I'd done this or that"". When I'm in my rocking chair eating apple crumble and custard, I want to say I had no regrets. This video can not be played Jodie Abacus performs I'll Be That Friend live on the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury 2016 Your big breakthrough was a song called I'll Be That Friend. How did that song arrive? Three years ago, I came down with pneumonia and almost died. I was bedridden for about three months and, in the middle of all that, I finished with my ex. She moved on to another dude, like, really quickly. I saw pictures of them kissing and, even though I'd broken up with her, it was still a shock. At the end of that year, I needed to be comforted. I needed someone to say, ""it's going to be alright'. It didn't matter who it was. I just needed someone. I'd never felt that way before, but I needed a hug. Those feelings all came out in the song. As I was writing it, I was crying and singing at the same time. And yet that song, like a lot of your music, is very positive. Was that something you felt pop was lacking? Yeah. I feel there's a fun element missing. Everyone's thinking about the formula of how to write a hit song. I don't. Music is such a spiritual thing, it has to move you. You've been getting a lot of support from Elton John on his Beats 1 show. What did you make of that? That's incredible. He's one of my heroes. He's given me a couple of proper big shout-outs. And you've covered Bennie and the Jets in concert. That was nuts. He was meant to show up - but he didn't because the cloud level was low and his helicopter couldn't land. Wow. First world problems. Haha. Right? So is there an album on the way? Yeah, it's called Take This and Grow Flowers - because I'm using every little traumatic memory as fertiliser, and then making it grow. All of these things, all of these problems I've had... every memory is like a seed. What's the best thing about success? I love travelling. I love the adventure. There's not a day where I'm not thankful. I'm happy that Radio 2 have supported me as much as they have done. Have you become a connoisseur of hotel rooms? I'm not that fussy. I get annoyed when there's no kettle. It's not just for tea - I use it to steam clothes, and it's useful for steaming your voice as well. But do you know what? I always get paranoid that someone's done a wee in it. I always wash it out, just in case. Jodie Abacus's single Keep Your Head Down is out now. His debut album follows later this year.

Crisis management,"Ashley Madison was fined for not sufficiently protecting customers' data When infidelity website Ashley Madison was the victim of a hacking attack in 2015, the affected 36 million global users were suddenly very worried indeed. The business, a dating site for married people who wish to cheat on their spouse, had the data of its customers stolen and released on to the internet. All their names, passwords, phone numbers and addresses. While it was a very bleak time for Ashley Madison's users, the company itself faced a major crisis, and it was found to be lacking. As customer numbers and revenues plummeted, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - the US agency tasked with protecting consumers - ruled that the business had not done enough to protect people's information, both before and after the attack. The FTC fined Ashley Madison $1.6m,external(Â£1.3m), and said that the financial penalty was only that low because it didn't think that the business could afford to pay any more, such was the impact of the hack on its earnings. Where Ashley Madison failed was its insufficient crisis management - it hadn't prepared enough for something bad happening, and how it would react. All companies need to prepare for how they would react to a hack of their IT systems While the company tells the BBC it has subsequently overhauled all its systems, how should all firms best plan for and then respond to a crisis, be it a cyber-attack, financial scandal or other serious issue? With the UK government confirming last year that two-thirds of large British companies had experienced acyber-attack,externalin the previous 12 months alone, businesses who have an online presence anywhere in the world simply have to prepare for how they would react to a hack that breaches their system. A business can make its website as secure as possible, but being 100% protected is just not achievable, say IT experts. Page Group was ready to deal with the breach of its IT system Thankfully for UK employment agency Page Group it knew exactly how to react when it suffered a data breach of its cloud computing system in October last year. ""We have senior staff in place from across different parts of our organisation that form an issues management team who are well equipped to deal with a crisis, should it arise,"" says Eamon Collins, Page's group marketing manager. ""That is why when we were alerted to a data breach by our IT vendor Capgemini, this team was able to act fast, review the issue, and provide counsel on the best course of action. ""The most important part of the process is putting your customers' interests first."" He adds: ""Once we had sufficient information around what had happened, and the impact, we could undertake a transparent and open dialogue with the customer."" At former US mining group National Coal, the crisis it faced was repeated protests in the early 2000s by environmentalists who objected to its opencast mining in east Tennessee. Its then chief executive, Daniel Roling, said the company had plans in place for how it responded to everything it faced - from trespassers, to staff being threatened, entry roads being blockaded, and bomb threats. ""We held a number of run-throughs to test the effectiveness of both communications and operation responses,"" he says. ""The plan should, at a minimum, include an acceptable and effective means of communication, as well as an outline of who can and should provide direction."" Daniel Roling says National Coal had crisis management plans in place Mr Roling, who left National Coal before it was sold to Ranger Energy Investments in 2010, adds: ""We had everything planned right down to where we would hold a press conference, and how we would set it up. ""In crisis planning, you are looking to create an effective auto-response, so that everyone heads in the right direction, without too much deliberation."" At UK tourist attraction, the Jorvik Viking Centre, in York,its crisis was a major floodin December 2015 that caused significant damage. Director of attractions Sarah Maltby says the team worked hard to remove precious artefacts before they were damaged. ""Every company needs solid staff to assist, offer advice, and manage elements of disaster recovery,"" she says. Sarah Maltby says the Jorvik Viking Centre was saved by staff working together The centre is now due to finallyreopen in April this year. Crisis management expert Jonathan Bernstein says it is vital that a company responds quickly to a crisis. ""The crisis moves at its own pace, but you need to be faster."" He adds that firms should be honest about the crisis at hand, especially if it is something they are to blame for, such as a financial scandal. ""Be honest about how you screwed up, and illustrate how you are going to ensure this doesn't happen again,"" says Mr Bernstein. ""Provide clear information to customers on what happened exactly, and what new protocols will be in place."" Damon Coppola, founder of Shoreline Risk, a company that assists businesses with their risk management, says that when it comes to a firm preparing for a possible crisis ""the public might not necessarily expect perfection"". But he adds: ""[The public's] judgement will be hard if it is perceived that the company failed to act on an obligation to limit or prepare for a known risk, if they were dishonest in their communication, and perhaps in the worst case, if profits came before people."" These are views echoed by UK public relations expert Benjamin Webb, founder of media relations firm Deliberate PR, which specialises in Swedish start-ups. He says: ""At a time of fast-moving crisis, particularly when people's well-being is at stake, transparency to customers and their family members must exceed any responsibility to shareholders."" Rob Segal says that Ashley Madison has improved its systems since the hack At Toronto-based Ruby Corporation, the owner of Ashley Madison, chief executive Rob Segal, says the company has worked hard to rebuild trust since the 2015 hack. Mr Segal, who joined the firm after the attack, says: ""We partnered with Deloitte's world-leading security team following the breach, and they've been helping the company with privacy and security enhancements and 24/7 monitoring. ""The go-forward lessons for chief executives is to always stay vigilant about cybersecurity, and to continually invest in privacy and security safeguards.""

Not so balmy,"This video can not be played Balmy days: The Body Shop story ""A confused shop with a mish-mash of products with no emphasis on the fact that this is supposed to be a shop specialising in cruelty-free, fair trade toiletries and make-up,"" is Suzy Bourke's damning verdict on The Body Shop. The 42-year-old stage manager used to be a regular shopper at the High Street chain, but now she tends to go to Boots instead. And she's not alone. Its owner, cosmetics giant L'Oreal, wants to offload the High Street chain, which has been suffering slowing sales. The Body Shop, founded by Dame Anita Roddick in 1976, was a pioneer using natural ingredients for its beauty products when it started out. It initially thrived, expanding rapidly, and by the 1980s was one of the most well-known brands on the High Street. I remember the chain fondly from my youth, when it seemed to be an exciting shop full of affordable, fun and exciting products. Coloured animal soaps, banana shampoo, white musk perfume and strawberry shower gel were the height of 1980s beauty chic as far as I was concerned. But by the early 2000s, rivals had caught up, with firms such as Boots, for example, developing similar natural beauty ranges. New challengers such as Lush also emerged, encroaching on The Body Shop's market share. ""You never see a Body Shop busy any more, they always used to be packed,"" says Suzy Bourke The chain is still a sizeable High Street presence with more than 3,000 stores in 66 countries and employs 22,000 people, according to its website. The Body Shop's results for 2016 show total sales were 920.8m euros (Â£783.8m), down from 967.2m euros in 2015, which L'Oreal blamed on market slowdowns in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. The sales were a tiny proportion of L'Oreal's overall 25.8bn euros of sales for the same period. And arguably the chain - which L'Oreal bought for Â£652m ($1.14bn) in 2006 - remains a lower-end and insignificant part of its huge portfolio of brands, which include skincare specialists Kiehl's, Lancome and Garnier, as well as fragrance brands Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani. Veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman argues that L'Oreal overpaid for the chain and has failed to add any value to it. ""Frankly it's a bit of mystery them buying it in the first place. ""What they bought is a retailer and what they're good at is brands,"" he says. The Body Shop's use of natural ingredients made it a pioneer when it started out in 1976 He thinks The Body Shop's struggles are down to the same issues facing the retail sector as a whole: competition from an ever-increasing number of shops all muscling in on the same territory, from supermarkets to fashion chains the seemingly unstoppable popularity of online shopping the high cost of running a large number of shops ""Retailing in shops is becoming an increasingly challenging business. You've got to have a very compelling retail proposition as opposed to a brand or product proposition. ""Everyone that shops in The Body Shop spends most of their personal care budget somewhere else. They're constantly chasing their tail, having to work hard to attract people into a store,"" he says. When the 2006 deal was struck, founder Dame Anita - who died just a year later - was forced to reject claims that The Body Shop, known for its ethically sourced goods, was joining with ""the enemy"". There were concerns that some of the ingredients L'Oreal then used in its products had been tested on animals, while The Body Shop was publicly opposed to animal testing. The French firm insisted the brand would complement its existing offering, giving it increased presence in the ""masstige"" sector - mass market combined with prestige. But Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at consultancy GlobalData Retail, believes the firm has ""slightly lost its way"" under L'Oreal's ownership. ""While The Body Shop's heritage is strong, it needs to work on its brand perception. It's not known as a brand which is innovative and new, and it's failed to keep up with market trends - contour sticks, kits and palettes were a strong trend in 2016, and these are nowhere to be seen in The Body Shop's range,"" she says. Analysts say The Body Shop has lost its cachet as a fashionable brand These days the firm is not seen as ""a trendy brand"", but mostly as a shop for gifting and low-value items, such as its body butters and body lotions, she says. ""With premium retailers such as Jo Malone and Liz Earle offering in-store treatments, there is more that The Body Shop could be doing to raise its profile and improve the customer experience,"" she adds. Nonetheless, Prof John Colley from Warwick Business School believes there will still be plenty of interest from private equity funds. He expects the firm to be sold with its current separate management team, who he says are likely to have their own ideas for how to improve it. ""When a major corporate has decided it doesn't want a business, it will sell it, probably, whatever the price. ""They [L'Oreal] are trying to get rid of it because it's underperforming. But anyone bidding will see a clear turnaround. Independent ownership would probably serve the firm well. A refreshed image would almost certainly work,"" he says. Mr Hyman, too, believes a new owner could improve The Body Shop, particularly by selling the chain's products outside its own shops. But he says trying to offload the large store estate with long committed leases will be a hindrance to any buyer. ""That's not to say it isn't a business with potential, but it could perform much more strongly,"" he says. Dame Anita Roddick, who founded the firm in 1976 at the age of 34,said her original motivation,externalfor the firm was simply to make a living for herself and her two daughters while her husband was away travelling.

SportWinter Olympic medal chances 'exciting'9 February 2017 (00:17:38),"Could 2018 be a record-breaking Winter Olympics for Team GB? Great Britain should be excited about its medal chances at the 2018 Winter Olympics, according to chef de mission Mike Hay. It would be a record-breaking Games for Team GB in Pyeongchang if they win more than the four medals they have taken home on two occasions, in 1924 and 2014. UK Sport has doubled its investment in Olympic winter sports from Â£13.5m for the four-year cycle to the 2014 Sochi Games to Â£27.9m for the South Korea event. And with a year go until the 2018 Games begin, UK Sport has agreed a total target of between four and eight medals across the various Winter Olympic disciplines at their respective World Championship events this year. ""The money that UK Sport have put in is a real confidence boost to our winter athletes,"" Hay told BBC Sport. ""We've got to go in with high hopes and there are some early indicators that our athletes are going to be competing for podium places."" Great Britain may have won 67 medals in one Games at the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio but Winter Olympic medals have been harder to come by because of a lack of natural facilities and smaller talent pools to select from. In the 97-year history of the Winter Olympics, Great Britain have won only 26 medals but Hay believes the country is becoming more accepted on the world stage, especially in freestyle skiing and snowboarding, short track speed skating, curling and skeleton. ""It's very difficult to challenge the alpine nations but we're making progress into that second tier, if you like, and getting credibility,"" Hay said. Meanwhile, to mark a year to the event, British Ski and Snowboard has announced it plans to become one of the world's top five skiing and snowboarding nations by 2030. Great Britain will send about 60 athletes to the Games. Ski and snowboard:It took 90 years for Britain to win a first Winter Olympic medal on snow, courtesy ofJenny Jones' snowboard bronze in 2014but in Pyeongchang there could be podium ambitions for athletes in freestyle skiing, snowboarding and even alpine skiing. Snowboarder Katie Ormerod has been a model of consistency on the World Cup stage, winning the Moscow big air and claiming two other podiums as well as an X Games bronze medal. Her cousin Jamie Nicholls, Billy Morgan and Aimee Fuller have also won World Cup medals and could threaten the podium in slopestyle and big air in 2018. James Woods finished fifth in ski slopestyle in Sochi and will be a medal contender in South Korea. He won the season-opening World Cup slopestyle in New Zealand and just missed out on an X Games slopestyle medal, coming fourth. Woods did win the big air title in Aspen but only snowboard big air will make its debut in the Winter Olympics. In the alpine world, slalom specialist David Ryding became the first Briton for 36 years to claim a World Cup medal when he finished second in Kitzbuhel, Austria, in January and has backed that up with three other top 10s this season. British Ski and Snowboard has an ambitious target of being a top-five performing nation by 2030. It says it has a strategy to raise more funds and put a world-class coaching structure in place.

Skeleton:Since skeleton was reintroduced into the Winter Olympics in 2002, Great Britain have won a medal at each of the four Games. Lizzy Yarnold won gold in Russia and is aiming to become the first Briton to retain a Winter Olympic title. She took the 2016 season off but is back and building up to South Korea. Laura Deas has had World Cup success and will also be in contention. Curling: Great Britain won silver and bronze in Sochi and will again be challenging for the medal matches in 2018. The introduction of mixed doubles boosts GB's chances even more. Snowboard big air:Snowboarders will head down a ramp and perform a trick off a large jump called a kicker. The new addition is great news for Britain's medal aspirations as there are podium potential athletes in the men's and women's competitions. Meanwhile, it is goodbye to snowboard parallel slalom, which has been dropped from the Games. Curling mixed doubles: Each team is made up of a man and a woman and they play with six stones, rather than the usual eight and there are only eight ends, instead of the traditional 10. Great Britain finished fourth at the 2016 World Championships and compete in the 2017 competition at the end of April. Performances from the 2016 and 2017 World Championships will be taken into account with the top seven ranked nations, plus hosts South Korea, qualifying for the Games. Speed skating mass start: This will take place on the long track and will be a 16-lap race where all skaters start simultaneously. There will be four sprints where points are awarded. The first three athletes to cross the finish line will be awarded the medals. Alpine skiing team event.
