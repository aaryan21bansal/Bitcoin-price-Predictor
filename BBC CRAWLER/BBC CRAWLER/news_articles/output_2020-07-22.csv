US immunity 'loophole' closed after Dunn death,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The UK and the US have agreed to amend an ""anomaly"" that allowed Harry Dunn death suspect Anne Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity. Mrs Sacoolas - the wife of a diplomat at RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire - was able to leave the UKthanks to the ""secret agreement"". She has been accused of killing the 19-year-old in a crash near the base. Mr Dunn's mother said the change, which is not thought to be retroactive, was a ""huge step in the right direction"". Charlotte Charles told the BBC: ""We now need Dominic Raab to work with us to make sure that we get her back to the UK to face justice at some point soon."" This video can not be played 'I hope as a mum she will do the right thing' The foreign secretary has said relatives of US staff at the air base can face prosecution under the amended rules where they may have previously been immune. How the death of a teen became a transatlantic row Mr Raab said the new arrangements had ""closed the anomaly that led to the denial of justice in the heartbreaking case of Harry Dunn"". He said he appreciated the changes ""won't bring Harry back"" but hoped they may ""bring some small measure of comfort"" to his family. Under the amended rules, relatives of US staff at RAF Croughton can face prosecution Ms Charles vowed to continue the family's campaign to bring Mrs Sacoolas before a UK court. ""We always live with hope that one day she might just decide of her own accord to put herself on a plane and come back over here,"" she said. ""We definitely will keep the pressure up."" Timeline: Events after Harry Dunn crash death Make Harry Dunn 'top priority' at Pompeo visit US extradition refusal over Dunn crash 'final' Ms Charles said she wanted Mrs Sacoolas to ""see what her own country has agreed to with the anomaly they've now amended"". Northamptonshire Police said it understood the changes would not be retrospective but welcomed the move. Downing Street said the change meant ""in relation to the level of offence Anne Sacoolas is accused of, she could have been arrested by the police once they had obtained a warrant from the court"". Anne Sacoolas, the alleged killer of Harry Dunn, is never going to be extradited from the US because Washington is standing firm that she is entitled to diplomatic immunity. This claim of immunity was the product of a legal loophole that needed to be fixed - a loophole that nobody spotted until tragedy struck. Officials of foreign governments who are officially operating in another country have immunity from prosecution under long-standing international law. This legal principle of immunity has long been accepted by states as necessary to help foster good relations between them. But limits can be imposed by agreement. In the case of RAF Croughton, a deal between the two states allowed the potential prosecution of US staff for crimes committed beyond their duties - but their families had greater protections. In short, had a US official, rather than his or her spouse, been behind the wheel of the car that was involved in a crash, they may have had to face police questioning and potential criminal charge. This sad and bizarre legal mistake has now been corrected - and officials appear confident there are no other similar anomalies elsewhere that could stand in the way of justice. The US State Department said the amendment was a ""reflection of our especially close relationship"" with the UK. Northamptonshire Police said it would continue working with British prosecutors to ensure Mrs Sacoolas was returned from the US to face court proceedings. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said that Labour would ""push for a full inquiry"" into the case. She said: ""The foreign secretary has still not come to Parliament to explain how failings in his department allowed a US citizen to leave the country while their immunity was still in question."" Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton A Home Office extradition request was refused by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January, and American officials said thedecision was final. It is believed Mrs Sacoolas was driving on the wrong side of the road when Mr Dunn was killed. There have been reports of other vehicles spotted driving on the wrong side of the road near the base, including one which wasshown in a YouTube videoin February.

Care home visits allowed to resume in England,"Care home residents in England can begin to be reunited with one of their loved ones, the government has said, as it publishes new guidance. Visits will resume in care homes once local authorities and local public health directors say it is safe. Residents will be limited to seeing the same one visitor, where possible, the guidance says. Some providers began allowing outdoor, socially-distanced visits in June, in the absence of government guidelines. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was now possible to ""carefully and safely"" allow visits to care homes, while taking into account ""local knowledge and circumstances for each care home"". People in registered residential care and those in nursing homes for people with learning disabilities, mental health or other disabilities in England will also be able to welcome visitors under the same guidance. Can I visit care homes now? Older people's rights under Covid to be examined Dementia patients 'deteriorating' without family visits The government said visits could resume after the rate of community transmission of coronavirus had fallen, but staff, residents and visitors should observeits guidance,externalto minimise the risk of spreading the virus. It says care providers should consider whether visits could take place outside, without people having to go through a shared building, and visitors should stick to social distancing guidance and avoid hugs or handshakes. Ad hoc visits should be discouraged and providers should collect contact details of visitors to support NHS Test and Trace, the guidance says. Visitors should also be encouraged to wear a face covering and risk assessments must be carried out before homes reopen. Gifts for residents should be easy to clean by care home staff. ""It is unlikely that they will be able to bring flowers but a box of chocolates that could be sanitised with wipes would be allowed,"" the guidance says. Care England, the country's largest representative body for independent providers of adult social care, said it was ""disappointed"" the guidance had come so late. Chief executive Professor Martin Green said: ""This guidance should have been with care providers last month. ""We are at a loss to understand why the Department of Health and Social Care cannot act quickly in a crisis or why it is deaf to the comments and input from the sector."" It comes as the UK recorded the deaths of another 79 people who tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 45,501. Lesley Lightfoot says not being able to be with her mum Blumah, who has Parkinson's dementia, during lockdown has been ""the most painful thing I've ever been through"". For months, she stood outside her mum's north London care home, talking to her through a ground floor window. In recent weeks, the home has allowed some outdoor visits. But Ms Lightfoot wants clarity on whether the latest guidelines mean she'll be able to see her mum indoors. ""To be able to see her outside doesn't solve my problem. I need to get in and be with her in her room,"" she says, adding that her mum's mental state has deteriorated with the isolation of lockdown. ""She needs the reassurance, the love, the affection, the looking at things with her, the going through things with her."" The government said it will be down to individual care homes, working with public health officials, to decide whether visits can take place inside people's rooms. In Scotland, visits to virus-free homes resumed earlier this month. In Wales, outdoor visits are allowed and in Northern Ireland, one person can visit a resident, with a second person accommodated ""where possible"". Sue Parker from Ovingham, Northumberland, who has a 29-year-old son with autism and OCD, welcomed the guidance but said it would not help in her case as it isn't an option to visit her son in his residential care home. She explained he would not tolerate relatives visiting his care home and would only accept leaving to his family home - something he did most weekends before the pandemic. ""It seems throughout that it has been a blanket one-size-fits-all policy [for social care], with a focus on the elderly and frail,"" she said, adding that the new guidance seemed to be ""disproportionate"" for her son, given that he is young and physically fit.

PM says virus response shows 'might of UK union',"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson defends UK union on a visit to Scotland The response to the coronavirus pandemic has shown the ""sheer might"" of the UK union, Boris Johnson has said during a visit to Scotland. Mr Johnson was in Orkney and the north of Scotland one year on from the day he took office as prime minister. He said the work of the military and Treasury job retention schemes had proved the ""merits of the union"". But the SNP said the visit showed Mr Johnson was ""in a panic"" about rising support for Scottish independence. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon did not meet Mr Johnson during the trip but said she would continue to work with his government on the ""immediate priority"" of tackling coronavirus. Follow updates on Boris Johnson's visit to Scotland What's Boris Johnson worried about in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon said she did not think anyone should be ""championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives"" to make a constitutional argument. Mr Johnson said he ""pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom"" when he entered Downing Street one year ago, adding that the response to the pandemic had shown his government's commitment to the whole of the UK. The UK government has coordinated much of the country's economic response to the virus, including the coronavirus job retention furlough scheme. But devolved governments have had control over most public health measures and have been able to set more local timetables and messaging. Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""always happy to meet the prime minister"" Although the whole of the UK entered lockdown in the same week, each constituent part has eased restrictions at a different rate. Phase 3 of Scotland's""route map"" out of lockdownbegan last week, as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and barbers were allowed to reopen. They were allowed to reopen in England slightly earlier on 4 July, along with holiday accommodation - including hotels, B&Bs, cottages, campsites and caravan parks. Boris Johnson must have found recent opinion polls conducted in Scotland to be awkward reading. Surveys suggesting rising support for Scottish independence and a significant gap between his approval ratings and those of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, appear to have prompted him to make his first visit to Scotland since last year's general election. The prime minister wants to use the trip to remind people in Scotland just how much cash the UK treasury has spent in response to the coronavirus crisis. He is stressing that it is the Westminster government that has supported 900,000 people who might have otherwise lost their jobs and produced billions of pounds in extra spending for the NHS. The SNP don't look too worried about a prime ministerial trip denting support for their cause. On her 50th birthday, on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that a visit for Boris was the best birthday pressie she could hope for. Every time the PM tells voters that it is only as part of the UK that Scottish businesses and public services could afford to cope with the pandemic, the SNP will reply that they are sick of being told that Scotland is ""too wee, too poor and too stupid"" to be independent. Read more from Sarah Smith Speaking in Orkney, where he met local fishermen, Mr Johnson said the ""merits of the union"" had been ""proved throughout this crisis"", citing the work of the military and the Treasury's support for workers and firms. The UK government says the furlough and self-employment schemeshave supported 900,000 jobs in Scotland, and that Â£4.6bn of additional funding was being provided to the Scottish government. The prime minister also said not enough time had passed for another independence referendum to be held, saying the 2014 vote wasa ""once in a generation"" event. He said: ""What I'm saying is that the union is a fantastically strong institution. It's helped our country through thick and thin. ""It's very, very valuable in terms of the support we've been able to give to everybody throughout all corners of the UK, and we had a referendum on breaking up the union a few years ago - I think only six years ago. That is not a generation by any computation and I think what people really want to do is see our whole country coming back strongly together, and that's what we're going to do."" Ms Sturgeontweeted,externalthat the prime minister's visit to Scotland ""highlighted the argument for Scottish independence"". However she said politicians should remain focused on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and ""not use it as a political weapon"". At her coronavirus briefing on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""worked very hard to have a collaborative approach to the other governments of the UK"". She said financial support from the Treasury was ""very welcome"", but said it should be clear that ""this is borrowed money"" which would have to be repaid by Scottish taxpayers too - ""it's not some kind of favour that has been done"". The first minister said UK-wide actions by Mr Johnson's administration were a reflection of where powers lie, saying that ""if we held the powers we would be doing these things ourselves"". She added: ""I just don't think any of us should be championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political cases we want to make. ""This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we are not out of yet. Too many people people have died and all of us have a really solemn responsibility to focus on and get our countries through, and that's what I'm going to continue to do. ""Campaigning right now is not my priority. Boris Johnson has every right to be on a campaign visit but in his shoes it's not what I would do."" Mr Johnson was greeted by a small group of protestors during his visit to Orkney Mr Johnson also announced Â£50m of funding from the UK government for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles - the latest in a series of ""city and region deals"" which see Scottish and UK ministers each pledge cash to various areas for spending on new infrastructure and local development schemes. The Scottish government has also committed Â£50mto the ""Islands growth deal"", which will target sectors including tourism, energy and skills. The timing of Mr Johnson's visit comes amid a ""perfect storm"" over Scottish independence, according to Sir Tom Devine, an emeritus professor of Scottish history at Edinburgh University. Sir Tom told BBC Two's Newsnight the union is in its most fragile condition since 1745, and that opinion polling suggesting increasing support for independence in Scotland has been consistent for some time. Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt added that a senior SNP source had told him they believed the party's moment ""is at last arriving"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mr Johnson was visiting due to recent polls suggesting support for independence was on the rise. Mr Blackford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's message would go down ""particularly badly"" in Scotland. ""I think what we've demonstrated over the course of the last few months [is] that in the areas of devolved responsibility, in the areas of public health, the leadership that's been shown by our first minister is in sharp contrast to the bluster that we've seen from Boris Johnson,"" he said.

"Tesco asks staff to clean shelves, floors and loos","Retail staff will be asked to take on cleaning duties at Tesco's smaller stores after the chain ended contract cleaning services for those outlets. Shop workers will be expected to wipe shelves and fridges, mop floors and clean staff toilet facilities. They will be given training and extra time to complete the extra duties. Tesco said the cleanliness of its stores had ""never been more important"",  as the pandemic transforms the way UK grocers do business. ""Following a successful trial we have found that giving our stores more ownership and control over their cleaning results in better and more consistent standards,"" a spokesperson said. Tesco will bring cleaning in-house in its 1,920 Express stores and convenience Metro stores from 24 August. More hours would be given to cleaning in stores as a result of this change, Tesco said. While retail staff would be responsible for most cleaning duties around the stores, the firm said more ""specialist tasks"" such as pressure washing and cleaning high signs outside would still be completed by third party suppliers. UK supermarkets saw a big increase in sales between March and June as consumers stayed - and ate - at home to help contain the coronavirus. However retailers have had to reconfigure shop layouts and introduce new hygiene measures and protective equipment to protect staff and customers. On social media commentators expressed concern that Tesco staff would be forced to take on a role they hadn't expected and that it might compromise hygiene in stores. Allow Twitter content?

Tesco said the work would be split between colleagues but that no-one would be forced to undertake a role they didn't want to. If your boss asks you to clean the office or the toilets, can you say ""no""? Work contracts usually say employees can be asked to undertake ""other duties"" outside their normal role, according to the employment advice body Acas. Refusing to follow instructions could amount to a breach of contract. ""There is an expectation that employees should carry out reasonable requests from their employer,"" said Tom Neil, senior adviser at Acas. ""So even if cleaning or other duties are not explicitly included in their contract, unless it is clearly unreasonable or the employee is ill-equipped to be able to complete the task, they should carry out the request. If a reasonable request was refused, it could result in disciplinary action."" You can dispute with your employer what counts as ""reasonable"" and that may depend on what role you've been employed for in the first place. What is reasonable for bar staff and security personnel may be unreasonable for banking analysts and solicitors. Some online commentators suggest it has become fairly common to ask staff in workplaces and schools to undertake some cleaning duties to allow more frequent cleaning to minimise the spread of the virus. On the parenting site Mumsnet members said in other workplaces they had been asked to clean desks, meeting rooms, and toilets after their own use. Some said they'd been asked to use bleach and that managers had drawn up cleaning rotas. One Mumsnet member said staff should object to cleaning requests: ""I don't think it's a good use of professional staff time to be doing so, and would expect people to be pushing back. ""Professional cleaning is a skill (to do it quickly and effectively) and a genuinely viable business needs to recognise that - not some quick wipe down from someone who's unwilling and not best placed to be doing it."" Another Mumsnet member said: ""We have to clean the office, kitchen, toilets and public areas twice a day so there isn't much time left for actual work....Our cleaners were told they were no longer required!""

Dunn crash extradition refusal 'final',"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The US has said its decision to refuse an extradition request for Harry Dunn's alleged killer was final. It comes after an Interpol Red Notice was issued for US national Anne Sacoolas who is now""wanted internationally"". A US official said she had diplomatic immunity, but Downing Street branded the refusal ""a denial of justice"". Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire, with Mrs Sacoolas accused of death by dangerous driving. The shadow foreign secretary has accused the Foreign Office of ""clear and repeated failings"". Mrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international outcry. The Interpol Red notice means she can be arrested if she leaves the US. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles was notified by Northamptonshire Police about the Interpol notice. She said it was ""a huge step in the right direction"". Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton Motorcyclist Mr Dunn died in a crash with a car near US military base RAF Croughton on 27 August. A Home Office extradition request was refused by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January. On Tuesday, the state department's spokeswoman said that decision was final. She said that granting the extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas would have rendered the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity and would have set an ""extraordinarily troubling precedent"". She added that the US has a history of close law enforcement co-operation with the UK, and values that relationship. But the Prime Minister's official spokesman said Boris Johnson ""has been clear that he wants to see justice served for Harry and his family"". Mr Johnson had raised the case with Donald Trump ""on a number of occasions"", the spokesman said. ""The US refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas amounts to a denial of justice and she should return to the UK,"" the spokesman added. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has called for a parliamentary inquiry, in which the Foreign Secretary would have to explain ""failings"" with Mr Dunn's case. Road side banner supporting justice for Harry Dunn But the Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""The White House may feel that secretary Pompeo's refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas was final but that does not reflect the real position. ""In fact quite the contrary, as the US Embassy in London said in a recent letter to Andrea Leadsom, both countries recognise that the final decision will rest with the court following a judicial review."" An Interpol Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action. On its website, Interpol states a red notice ""is an international wanted persons notice, but it is not an arrest warrant"".

"PM claims virus response shows 'might of UK union'But the SNP say Mr Johnson's visit to Scotland shows he wis ""in a panic"" about support for independence.Scotland politics","This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson defends UK union on a visit to Scotland The response to the coronavirus pandemic has shown the ""sheer might"" of the UK union, Boris Johnson has said during a visit to Scotland. Mr Johnson was in Orkney and the north of Scotland one year on from the day he took office as prime minister. He said the work of the military and Treasury job retention schemes had proved the ""merits of the union"". But the SNP said the visit showed Mr Johnson was ""in a panic"" about rising support for Scottish independence. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon did not meet Mr Johnson during the trip but said she would continue to work with his government on the ""immediate priority"" of tackling coronavirus. Follow updates on Boris Johnson's visit to Scotland What's Boris Johnson worried about in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon said she did not think anyone should be ""championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives"" to make a constitutional argument. Mr Johnson said he ""pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom"" when he entered Downing Street one year ago, adding that the response to the pandemic had shown his government's commitment to the whole of the UK. The UK government has coordinated much of the country's economic response to the virus, including the coronavirus job retention furlough scheme. But devolved governments have had control over most public health measures and have been able to set more local timetables and messaging. Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""always happy to meet the prime minister"" Although the whole of the UK entered lockdown in the same week, each constituent part has eased restrictions at a different rate. Phase 3 of Scotland's""route map"" out of lockdownbegan last week, as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and barbers were allowed to reopen. They were allowed to reopen in England slightly earlier on 4 July, along with holiday accommodation - including hotels, B&Bs, cottages, campsites and caravan parks. Boris Johnson must have found recent opinion polls conducted in Scotland to be awkward reading. Surveys suggesting rising support for Scottish independence and a significant gap between his approval ratings and those of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, appear to have prompted him to make his first visit to Scotland since last year's general election. The prime minister wants to use the trip to remind people in Scotland just how much cash the UK treasury has spent in response to the coronavirus crisis. He is stressing that it is the Westminster government that has supported 900,000 people who might have otherwise lost their jobs and produced billions of pounds in extra spending for the NHS. The SNP don't look too worried about a prime ministerial trip denting support for their cause. On her 50th birthday, on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that a visit for Boris was the best birthday pressie she could hope for. Every time the PM tells voters that it is only as part of the UK that Scottish businesses and public services could afford to cope with the pandemic, the SNP will reply that they are sick of being told that Scotland is ""too wee, too poor and too stupid"" to be independent. Read more from Sarah Smith Speaking in Orkney, where he met local fishermen, Mr Johnson said the ""merits of the union"" had been ""proved throughout this crisis"", citing the work of the military and the Treasury's support for workers and firms. The UK government says the furlough and self-employment schemeshave supported 900,000 jobs in Scotland, and that Â£4.6bn of additional funding was being provided to the Scottish government. The prime minister also said not enough time had passed for another independence referendum to be held, saying the 2014 vote wasa ""once in a generation"" event. He said: ""What I'm saying is that the union is a fantastically strong institution. It's helped our country through thick and thin. ""It's very, very valuable in terms of the support we've been able to give to everybody throughout all corners of the UK, and we had a referendum on breaking up the union a few years ago - I think only six years ago. That is not a generation by any computation and I think what people really want to do is see our whole country coming back strongly together, and that's what we're going to do."" Ms Sturgeontweeted,externalthat the prime minister's visit to Scotland ""highlighted the argument for Scottish independence"". However she said politicians should remain focused on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and ""not use it as a political weapon"". At her coronavirus briefing on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""worked very hard to have a collaborative approach to the other governments of the UK"". She said financial support from the Treasury was ""very welcome"", but said it should be clear that ""this is borrowed money"" which would have to be repaid by Scottish taxpayers too - ""it's not some kind of favour that has been done"". The first minister said UK-wide actions by Mr Johnson's administration were a reflection of where powers lie, saying that ""if we held the powers we would be doing these things ourselves"". She added: ""I just don't think any of us should be championing and celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political cases we want to make. ""This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we are not out of yet. Too many people people have died and all of us have a really solemn responsibility to focus on and get our countries through, and that's what I'm going to continue to do. ""Campaigning right now is not my priority. Boris Johnson has every right to be on a campaign visit but in his shoes it's not what I would do."" Mr Johnson was greeted by a small group of protestors during his visit to Orkney Mr Johnson also announced Â£50m of funding from the UK government for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles - the latest in a series of ""city and region deals"" which see Scottish and UK ministers each pledge cash to various areas for spending on new infrastructure and local development schemes. The Scottish government has also committed Â£50mto the ""Islands growth deal"", which will target sectors including tourism, energy and skills. The timing of Mr Johnson's visit comes amid a ""perfect storm"" over Scottish independence, according to Sir Tom Devine, an emeritus professor of Scottish history at Edinburgh University. Sir Tom told BBC Two's Newsnight the union is in its most fragile condition since 1745, and that opinion polling suggesting increasing support for independence in Scotland has been consistent for some time. Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt added that a senior SNP source had told him they believed the party's moment ""is at last arriving"". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mr Johnson was visiting due to recent polls suggesting support for independence was on the rise. Mr Blackford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's message would go down ""particularly badly"" in Scotland. ""I think what we've demonstrated over the course of the last few months [is] that in the areas of devolved responsibility, in the areas of public health, the leadership that's been shown by our first minister is in sharp contrast to the bluster that we've seen from Boris Johnson,"" he said.

"Earliest evidence for humans in the AmericasHumans settled in the Americas much earlier than previously thought, according to new finds from Mexico.","One of the stone artefacts found at the cave Humans settled in the Americas much earlier than previously thought, according to new finds from Mexico. They suggest people were living there 33,000 years ago, twice the widely accepted age for the earliest settlement of the Americas. The results are based on work at Chiquihuite Cave, a high-altitude rock shelter in central Mexico. Archaeologists found nearly 2,000 stone tools, suggesting the cave was used by people for at least 20,000 years. During the second half of the 20th Century, a consensus emerged among North American archaeologists that the Clovis people had been the first to reach the Americas, about 11,500 years ago. The ancestors of the Clovis were thought to have crossed a land bridge linking Siberia to Alaska during the last ice age. This land bridge - known as Beringia - subsequently disappeared underwater as the ice melted. And these big-game hunters were thought to have contributed to the extinction of the megafauna - large mammals such as mammoth, mastodon and various species of bear that roamed the region until the end of the last ice age. As the ""Clovis First"" idea took hold, reports of earlier human settlement were dismissed as unreliable and archaeologists stopped looking for signs of earlier occupation. But in the 1970s, this orthodoxy started to be challenged. In the 1980s, solid evidence for a 14,500-year-old human presence at Monte Verde, Chile, emerged. And since the 2000s, other pre-Clovis sites have become widely accepted -including the 15,500-year-old Buttermilk Creek Complex in central Texas. The entrance to the rock shelter in Zacatecas, Mexico Now, Ciprian Ardelean, from the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Zacatecas, Mexico, Tom Higham, from the University of Oxford, and colleagues have found evidence of human occupation stretching back far beyond that date, at the Chiquihuite site in the central-northern Mexican Highlands. The results have beenpublished in the journal Nature.,external ""This is a unique site, we've never seen anything like it before,"" Prof Higham, the director of Oxford's Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, told BBC News. ""The stone-tool evidence is very, very compelling. ""Anyone can see that these are deliberately manufactured stone tools and there are lots of them. ""The dating - which is my job - is robust. ""And so, it's a very exciting site to have been involved in."" The team excavated a 3m-deep (10ft) stratigraphic section - a sequence of soil layers arranged in the order they were deposited - and found some 1,900 stone artefacts made over thousands of years. Researchers were able to date bone, charcoal and sediment associated with the stone tools, using two scientific dating techniques. The first, radiocarbon dating, relies on the way a radioactive form of the element carbon (carbon-14) is known to decay over time. The second, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), works by measuring the last time sediments were exposed to light. Scientists sampled the cave sediments for DNA Using two different techniques ""added a lot of credibility and strength, particularly to the older part of the chronology"", Prof Higham said. ""The optical dates and [radiocarbon] dates are in good agreement,"" he said. And the findings could lead scientists to take a fresh look at controversial early occupation sites elsewhere in the Americas. ""In Brazil, there are several sites where you have stone tools that look robust to me and are dated 26-30,000, similar dates to the Chiquihuite site,"" Prof Higham said. ""This could be an important discovery that could stimulate new work to find other sites in the Americas that date to this period."" Prof David Meltzer, from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, who was not involved in the research, said the findings were ""interesting"". But he explained: ""It is not enough to argue that the stone specimens could be cultural (artefacts), one has to show that they are not natural."" Natural processes could mimic some types of stone tool, Prof Meltzer said. Second, he explained: ""With a stone tool tradition that long-lasting, one expects it would have been far more widespread in the region, raising the question of why that technology hasn't been spotted elsewhere,"" adding: ""Perhaps more important, with modern humans one expects to see evidence of technological and cultural change over such a long span of time."" Finally, he said, ""the cave is 1,000 metres above the valley floor, but leaving aside the issue of why not camp closer to the valley floor, why keep coming back to that same place on 'a relatively constant basis' over such a long period of time? I find that curious. Not many sites have that kind of long term repeated occupation, unless there is something quite useful / available at the spot"". Between 26,000-19,000 years ago, sea levels were low enough for people to cross easily from Siberia to America via the Beringian land bridge. But what about during earlier times? ""Before 26,000 years ago, the latest data suggest that Beringia might have been a rather unattractive place for humans to be. It might well have been boggy and very difficult to traverse,"" said Prof Higham. ""We still think the most likely scenario is for people to have come on a coastal route - hugging a coast - perhaps with some kind of maritime technology."" While people seem to have been in the Americas before 26,000 years ago, they were probably thin on the ground. It's only much later, between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, that populations increase substantially. It coincides with the temperature spike at the end of the last Ice Age, when jumps of around 7C are seen in just a short space of time. The scientists also used ""environmental DNA"" techniques to look for human genetic material in the cave sediments. But they could not find a strong enough signal. Previous DNA evidence has shown the Clovis people shared many similarities with modern Native Americans. And scientists will now want to understand how these older populations relate to later human groups who inhabited the continent. In the same issue of Nature, Prof Higham and Lorena Becerra-Valdivia, also from Oxford,describe how they used ages from 42 archaeological sites,externalin North America and Beringia to explore how humans expanded. The results reveal the signal of a human presence stretching back thousands of years before the Clovis people.

Finally, he said, ""the cave is 1,000 metres above the valley floor, but leaving aside the issue of why not camp closer to the valley floor, why keep coming back to that same place on 'a relatively constant basis' over such a long period of time? I find that curious. Not many sites have that kind of long term repeated occupation, unless there is something quite useful / available at the spot"". Between 26,000-19,000 years ago, sea levels were low enough for people to cross easily from Siberia to America via the Beringian land bridge. But what about during earlier times? ""Before 26,000 years ago, the latest data suggest that Beringia might have been a rather unattractive place for humans to be. It might well have been boggy and very difficult to traverse,"" said Prof Higham. ""We still think the most likely scenario is for people to have come on a coastal route - hugging a coast - perhaps with some kind of maritime technology."" While people seem to have been in the Americas before 26,000 years ago, they were probably thin on the ground. It's only much later, between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, that populations increase substantially. It coincides with the temperature spike at the end of the last Ice Age, when jumps of around 7C are seen in just a short space of time. The scientists also used ""environmental DNA"" techniques to look for human genetic material in the cave sediments. But they could not find a strong enough signal. Previous DNA evidence has shown the Clovis people shared many similarities with modern Native Americans. And scientists will now want to understand how these older populations relate to later human groups who inhabited the continent. In the same issue of Nature, Prof Higham and Lorena Becerra-Valdivia, also from Oxford,describe how they used ages from 42 archaeological sites,externalin North America and Beringia to explore how humans expanded. The results reveal the signal of a human presence stretching back thousands of years before the Clovis people.

Many thanks for joining us today for our coverage of the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Today it has been brought to you by: Andreas Illmer, Anna Jones, Alice Cuddy, Krutika Pathi, Jay Savage, Thom Poole, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams, Josh Cheetham, Francesca Gillett, Mary O'Connor and Max Matza. As we wind down our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, here's a final round-up of the key headlines in the UK this Wednesday evening. Hello and thank you for following our coverage of the global pandemic, brought to you by our team of reporters in London and around the world. Here are some of the biggest global developments of the day: Simon JackBBC Business Editor Royal Bank of Scotland today loses its brand status and becomes part of NatWest Group plc The BBC has been speaking to Alison Rose, the head of the Royal Bank of Scotlandwhich has just renamed itself the NatWest Group. She warns that while the painful memories of the last great financial crisis had faded, the true extent of a new and graver threat to thousands of businesses was emerging. ""There are clearly tough times ahead. Not all businesses will survive and there are going to be losses,"" she said. We got a glimpse of the potential scale of the losses earlier this year when the then-RBS reported a nine-fold (833%) increase in the amount of money it set aside for bad loans compared to the same period a year ago. Bad loans are loans which are unlikely to be paid back. New accounting standards require companies to make their best guess of future bad loans - so RBS's best guess in the first quarter of this year was that bad loans would explode. We will get an update on their view next week. Read more here.

Ray Mwasaru ended up in an induced coma at Lister Hospital in Stevenage, where doctors told his wife he might only have hours left to live. Eventually the mental health nurse made a good recovery and wasclapped as he was moved out of intensive care. Speaking at home in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire, he said: ""I believe by next week I should be up and running around. I'll be fit as a fiddle."" Jack Goodman and Shayan SardarizadehBBC Anti-disinformation team Twitter has announced itâs banning thousands of accounts promoting QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that believes President Trump is battling a âdeep stateâ of global elites involved in child trafficking. Accounts linked to QAnon have also promoted misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic on Twitter, and other social media platforms, amplifying misleading content about Covid-19, particularly related to face coverings and vaccines. In April, QAnon accounts helped make a fake story claiming that an early participant of a UK vaccine trial had died go viral. Last month, a video uploaded by a well-known QAnon influencer which called the pandemic a âdeep state hoaxâ manufactured by the Democratic Party to hamper President Trumpâs re-election chances racked up millions of views. Misleading memes making claims about the health risks of face masks and the dangers of a âBill Gates-funded vaccineâ are widely-shared in QAnon-themed Facebook groups and quickly find their way onto Twitter, Reddit and TikTok. You can read more about QAnon here. US passengers, wearing blue ponchos, are packed together on a ferry boat which is allowing 50% of its normal capacity Photos of tour boats operating at Niagara Falls, which sits on the US-Canada border, have illustrated the starkly different social distancing policies between the two countries. Ferries operated from the Canadian side of the border, which normally can carry 700 tourists at a time, are only allowing six passengers per boat. The US ferries are operating at 50% capacity, meaning customers are still crowded rather closely together as they strain to get a good view of the massive waterfalls. âWe actually took a picture of the [American] boat,â Julie Pronovost, a  visitor from Quebec, told Reuters on Tuesday. âI donât find that itâs very safe to be on a boat like that. Itâs much better here.â The US coronavirus outbreak is far worse than Canada's. On Tuesday, the US reported 57,777 new Covid-19 cases, compared with 786 in Canada. Canadian customers wearing red ponchos are treated to a VIP experience with the boat all to themselves BBC OS This video can not be played Petrus Bosman says coronavirus restrictions mean the future is uncertain This empty table is being used to highlight the impact of coronavirus restrictions in South Africa, as part of a day of action to raise awareness of jobs lost in the tourist, hospitality and wine industries. Itâs 200 metres long and it was laid in Wellington, a small town outside Cape Town, next to a vineyard run by Petrus Bosman. âThe alcohol ban has not only affected our local wine sales in restaurants and retailers negatively, but the whole wine and tourism industry,âhe told BBC OS. Last week, South Africa introduced its second alcohol ban of the year and a night-time curfew to reduce the pressure on its healthcare system. Petrus, however, was not impressed with the renewed restrictions. âWe just feel that government could have consulted and worked in a more collaborative manner,"" said Petrus. ""The future is uncertain and so are the dreams we have as a community."" A man scans a restaurant menu in Miami There were 9,785 new infections recorded on Wednesday in Florida, according to health officials, raising the total number of coronavirus cases to 379,619. There were an additional 139 deaths on Wednesday. The state has now recorded 5,345 deaths of residents, and over 100 deaths of non-residents. According to the data, 47% of all deaths have occurred in long-term and elderly care homes. Florida has the third highest level of infections out of any US state, coming behind California and New York. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that researchers are making good progress on developing a coronavirus vaccine, but their first use cannot be expected until early 2021. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme told reporters that it was vital to ""not cut corners on safety"", even if this meant slowing the vaccine's development. ""We have to be able to look ourselves in the eyes, and we have to be able to look at our communities and ensure them that we have taken every precaution to make sure that these vaccines are safe and effective before we go giving them to general populations,"" said Dr Ryan. ""In order to make that happen, we can shorten that time, but realistically, it is going to be the first part of next year before we start seeing people vaccinated."" He added that several potential vaccines were in phase 3 trials and none had failed in terms of safety or their ability to generate an immune response. Maria McCannBBC News Northern Ireland A new Â£10.5m scheme to support the childcare sector in Northern Ireland will open for applications on Monday. The Department of Education said the financial package would ensure as many providers as possible can reopen or remain open following the lockdown. The Childcare Recovery Support scheme will be available for day care settings, playgroups and childminders. An earlier support package set up by Stormont was scrapped following criticism for how it was implemented. The new scheme will operate until 31 August and will be backdated to 1 July. Read more here. There have been nearly 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and more than 45,500 people have died, government figures show. Take a look at these three charts and read morehereto find out the key figures of the pandemic in the UK.  Catherine ByaruhangaBBC News, Kampala Madagascar hospitals warn they are 'overwhelmed' with cases Madagascar has reported another record day with 614 infections. At one government hospital in
Antananarivo, the director says they are already treating 46 patients and only
have space for four more. Another administrator at a different
facility said they were constantly overwhelmed. The World Health
Organisation representative in Madagascar has warned that hospitals are
saturated even before the peak of the pandemic in the country is reached. There are over 7,500 coronavirus
cases in Madagascar nearly 80% of them were diagnosed in the past month. With
the spike in positive results, the government reinstated a strict lockdown of
the capital and surrounding areas. On Monday, the Minister for Health
wrote to development partners asking for equipment like testing kits,
respirators and protective equipment for health workers. But thereâs been push
back from the governmentâs spokesperson who said it was not the ministerâs
place to make such a request. There is a lot of promising news on vaccine research this week.Oxford University announced first resultsbut itâs only one of around two dozen vaccines being tested on people in clinical trials - and there are around 140 others in development around the world. Some of you have sent in questions around what a future vaccine can and can not do. Click here to read our health editor Michelle Roberts answering all those questions and more. Some eight million children in England were sent home from school in March New research has found more than half of British children struggled to continue learning at home while schools were shut during the lockdown. Of the 52% who struggled, three-quarters of parents gave a lack of motivation as a reason, the Office for National Statistics research found. It also showed wide disparities in what families were able to do. Schools closed for most pupils at the end of March in England, Wales and Scotland, as the pandemic took hold. Some schools re-opened in England on or around 1 June for some year groups. The ONS researchers assessed surveys of more than 12,000 people in Great Britain between 3 April and 7 June about their experiences of home-schooling during the coronavirus pandemic.There's more on the findings here. Surfers in Los Angeles don masks After reopening on 4 July, England's restaurants have had to introduce strict hygiene and social distancing measures to protect staff and customers from coronavirus. But one restaurant in Buxton, Derbyshire, has taken its  responsibilities to an entirely new level - by introducing mannequins to help keep their customers socially distanced while dining. The smartly-dressed dummies are positioned at tables in La Brasserie De La Cour restaurant; with the owner, Thierry Le Port, saying they would stop people from sitting too close to others while also avoiding big, empty spaces. He added they also helped to create a ""good atmosphere"" with some diners not even realising they were mannequins at first. Customers of the French restaurant have described the mannequins as ""slightly creepy"" but effective. You can read morehere. Presidential candidate Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama - Biden's boss when he was vice-president for eight years - have sat down for their first in-person meeting of the 2020 election year. A one-minute clip teasing their interview, which will be released tomorrow, show them arriving at Obama's office in Washington DC wearing face masks and criticising Trump's handling of the pandemic. ""Can you imagine standing up when you were president and saying, âIt's not my responsibility',"" Biden says, quoting Trump in March when he was asked about testing delays. ""Those words didn't come out of our mouths when we were in office,"" Obama responds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Spanish Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto has said a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Catalonia was coming under control, and that she hoped there would be no need for neighbouring France to close its border. âWith the latest data we have in Aragon and Catalonia we are a bit more optimistic. Catalonia has already reduced the number of infections over the last three days,â said Ms Maroto. âLetâs hope that with these better data we donât have to close a border that for us is very important for mobility with our European partners.â The northeastern Spanish region has logged more than 7,000 new cases of Covid-19 over the last weeks - nearly half of the national total - although its infection rate has dropped in the recent days. Catalan leader Quim Torra has ruled out a return to lockdown, telling the regional parliament that ""Catalonia can't be closed."" But elsewhere, in Madrid the regional government said it might make face masks compulsory - even in situations where social distancing can be guaranteed - unless the national government imposed safety controls on people flying in to the capita's Barajas airport. Madrid and the Canary Islands are the only regions of Spain without such strict face mask rules in place. The global number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen to over 15 million, according to a tally byJohns Hopkins University,external. More than 617,000 deaths have also been reported by the US university. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Tesco asks staff to clean shelves, floors and loosRetail workers at smaller Metro and Express outlets will take on tasks after contract cleaners dropped.","Retail staff will be asked to take on cleaning duties at Tesco's smaller stores after the chain ended contract cleaning services for those outlets. Shop workers will be expected to wipe shelves and fridges, mop floors and clean staff toilet facilities. They will be given training and extra time to complete the extra duties. Tesco said the cleanliness of its stores had ""never been more important"",  as the pandemic transforms the way UK grocers do business. ""Following a successful trial we have found that giving our stores more ownership and control over their cleaning results in better and more consistent standards,"" a spokesperson said. Tesco will bring cleaning in-house in its 1,920 Express stores and convenience Metro stores from 24 August. More hours would be given to cleaning in stores as a result of this change, Tesco said. While retail staff would be responsible for most cleaning duties around the stores, the firm said more ""specialist tasks"" such as pressure washing and cleaning high signs outside would still be completed by third party suppliers. UK supermarkets saw a big increase in sales between March and June as consumers stayed - and ate - at home to help contain the coronavirus. However retailers have had to reconfigure shop layouts and introduce new hygiene measures and protective equipment to protect staff and customers. On social media commentators expressed concern that Tesco staff would be forced to take on a role they hadn't expected and that it might compromise hygiene in stores. Allow Twitter content?

Tesco said the work would be split between colleagues but that no-one would be forced to undertake a role they didn't want to. If your boss asks you to clean the office or the toilets, can you say ""no""? Work contracts usually say employees can be asked to undertake ""other duties"" outside their normal role, according to the employment advice body Acas. Refusing to follow instructions could amount to a breach of contract. ""There is an expectation that employees should carry out reasonable requests from their employer,"" said Tom Neil, senior adviser at Acas. ""So even if cleaning or other duties are not explicitly included in their contract, unless it is clearly unreasonable or the employee is ill-equipped to be able to complete the task, they should carry out the request. If a reasonable request was refused, it could result in disciplinary action."" You can dispute with your employer what counts as ""reasonable"" and that may depend on what role you've been employed for in the first place. What is reasonable for bar staff and security personnel may be unreasonable for banking analysts and solicitors. Some online commentators suggest it has become fairly common to ask staff in workplaces and schools to undertake some cleaning duties to allow more frequent cleaning to minimise the spread of the virus. On the parenting site Mumsnet members said in other workplaces they had been asked to clean desks, meeting rooms, and toilets after their own use. Some said they'd been asked to use bleach and that managers had drawn up cleaning rotas. One Mumsnet member said staff should object to cleaning requests: ""I don't think it's a good use of professional staff time to be doing so, and would expect people to be pushing back. ""Professional cleaning is a skill (to do it quickly and effectively) and a genuinely viable business needs to recognise that - not some quick wipe down from someone who's unwilling and not best placed to be doing it."" Another Mumsnet member said: ""We have to clean the office, kitchen, toilets and public areas twice a day so there isn't much time left for actual work....Our cleaners were told they were no longer required!""

'Make my son top priority at Pompeo visit',"This video can not be played Charlotte Charles said ""It's been nearly a year, please don't let this roll into a second year"" The mother of Harry Dunn has appealed to the government to make her son ""top priority"" during the US Secretary of State visit. Charlotte Charles asked Boris Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Mike Pompeo to ""please, please, discuss Harry"" at the visit on Monday. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash outside RAF Croughton, following which the suspect - Anne Sacoolas - fled the UK. Mr Raab said there are ""no measures"" to force the United States to comply. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton In a video message, Mrs Charles, said: ""Mr Raab, Mr Pompeo, Mr Johnson, when you get together next week with all of your families fully intact whilst mine is in complete tatters and my family has been ripped apart, can you please, please discuss Harry? ""We've been assured he's high on your list of priorities to discuss amongst all of the other important global issues that you have surrounding you but please, please make him top priority."" Motorcyclist Mr Dunn died in a crash with a car at the Northamptonshire US military base on 27 August. She said the past 11 months have been ""horrific"" and she would not wish what she has gone through ""on your worst enemy"". ""We've got his anniversary coming up which is going to be beyond painful for us"", she said. ""It's just about doing the right thing. It always has been, it always will be."" Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton Mrs Sacoolas - the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton - sparked an international row when she claimed diplomatic immunity after the crash. The 42-year-old was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December. A Home Office extradition request was refused by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January. A state department's spokeswoman said that decision was final. ""We've always agreed immunity does need to be in place for certain circumstances. This isn't one of them"", Mr Dunn's mother said. ""Bring Anne Sacoolas back to the UK, face the justice system."" ""My concern is to make sure justice is served and to make sure Harry's life is actually thought of and considered"", she added. Mr Raab told Sky News, ""there's a denial of justice here"". ""There's no measures that we could I think credibly, realistically take which is somehow going to force the US or indeed Anne Sacoolas to comply with this [the extradition]. ""I want to be realistic because I don't want to raise expectations which are then going to be dashed."" He said it has been ""raised"" in Washington, with the prime minister and President Trump. ""We will continue to make clear we're on the side of the family here, we think that she should return, she must return home, so that justice can be done.""

'Secret files' disclosure bid fails,"The campaign to see Harry Dunn get justice will return to the High Court later this year An application by Harry Dunn's parents for the Foreign Office to disclose evidence relating to a ""secret agreement"" between the UK and US governments has been rejected. The Dunns said the agreement had given diplomatic immunity to their son's alleged killer, Anne Sacoolas. The 19-year-old was killed in a crash in Northamptonshire.

Despite beingcharged with causing death by dangerous drivingin December, anextradition request was refusedby the US. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn are bringing legal action against Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Northamptonshire Police, claiming they acted unlawfully over Mrs Sacoolas' departure. At a preliminary hearing on Thursday, conducted by video call, the Dunns argued the Foreign Office ""acted unlawfully by proceeding as if Anne Sacoolas conclusively had immunity"". They said that action prevented Northamptonshire Police ""from reaching an informed view"" on immunity. Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity Dunn family in extradition plea to Donald Trump Dunn crash suspect 'wanted internationally' Geoffrey Robertson QC, representing the Dunns, told the court the Foreign Office had ""obstructed a criminal investigation, under pressure from the United States"". Mr Robertson said the case ""turns on the interpretation of a secret agreement made in 1995 between America and the UK, as a result of a US request to add up to 200 technical officers as diplomatic agents at RAF Croughton"". He said at the time the UK had been ""deeply concerned"" about the request and the danger of media interest if crimes - particularly road traffic-related crimes - were committed. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Sir James Eadie QC, for the Foreign Office, said Mr Raab ""has acted lawfully at all times"". He argued the Foreign Office had ""given extensive disclosure, well in excess of what is strictly required"". Mr Robertson asked the court to order the Foreign Office to disclose documents about the 1995 agreement, as well as notes of phone calls and messages about Mr Dunn's death involving Foreign Office officials. The application was rejected by Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini. A full hearing will take place in October or November.

"Tesco asks staff to clean shelves, floors and loosRetail workers at smaller Metro and Express outlets will take on tasks after contract cleaners dropped.Business","Retail staff will be asked to take on cleaning duties at Tesco's smaller stores after the chain ended contract cleaning services for those outlets. Shop workers will be expected to wipe shelves and fridges, mop floors and clean staff toilet facilities. They will be given training and extra time to complete the extra duties. Tesco said the cleanliness of its stores had ""never been more important"",  as the pandemic transforms the way UK grocers do business. ""Following a successful trial we have found that giving our stores more ownership and control over their cleaning results in better and more consistent standards,"" a spokesperson said. Tesco will bring cleaning in-house in its 1,920 Express stores and convenience Metro stores from 24 August. More hours would be given to cleaning in stores as a result of this change, Tesco said. While retail staff would be responsible for most cleaning duties around the stores, the firm said more ""specialist tasks"" such as pressure washing and cleaning high signs outside would still be completed by third party suppliers. UK supermarkets saw a big increase in sales between March and June as consumers stayed - and ate - at home to help contain the coronavirus. However retailers have had to reconfigure shop layouts and introduce new hygiene measures and protective equipment to protect staff and customers. On social media commentators expressed concern that Tesco staff would be forced to take on a role they hadn't expected and that it might compromise hygiene in stores. Allow Twitter content?

Tesco said the work would be split between colleagues but that no-one would be forced to undertake a role they didn't want to. If your boss asks you to clean the office or the toilets, can you say ""no""? Work contracts usually say employees can be asked to undertake ""other duties"" outside their normal role, according to the employment advice body Acas. Refusing to follow instructions could amount to a breach of contract. ""There is an expectation that employees should carry out reasonable requests from their employer,"" said Tom Neil, senior adviser at Acas. ""So even if cleaning or other duties are not explicitly included in their contract, unless it is clearly unreasonable or the employee is ill-equipped to be able to complete the task, they should carry out the request. If a reasonable request was refused, it could result in disciplinary action."" You can dispute with your employer what counts as ""reasonable"" and that may depend on what role you've been employed for in the first place. What is reasonable for bar staff and security personnel may be unreasonable for banking analysts and solicitors. Some online commentators suggest it has become fairly common to ask staff in workplaces and schools to undertake some cleaning duties to allow more frequent cleaning to minimise the spread of the virus. On the parenting site Mumsnet members said in other workplaces they had been asked to clean desks, meeting rooms, and toilets after their own use. Some said they'd been asked to use bleach and that managers had drawn up cleaning rotas. One Mumsnet member said staff should object to cleaning requests: ""I don't think it's a good use of professional staff time to be doing so, and would expect people to be pushing back. ""Professional cleaning is a skill (to do it quickly and effectively) and a genuinely viable business needs to recognise that - not some quick wipe down from someone who's unwilling and not best placed to be doing it."" Another Mumsnet member said: ""We have to clean the office, kitchen, toilets and public areas twice a day so there isn't much time left for actual work....Our cleaners were told they were no longer required!""

"UK's biggest lender warns of 'tough times ahead'Alison Rose, the chief executive of Natwest Group, warns not all firms will survive the current crisis.","This video can not be played 'We want to support businesses' On the very day that the name RBS was consigned to the annals of financial history, the boss of the UK's biggest business lender warned that while the painful memories of the last great financial crisis had faded, the true extent of a new and graver threat to thousands of businesses was emerging. Alison Rose, the chief executive of the renamed Natwest Group said: ""There are clearly tough times ahead. Not all businesses will survive and there are going to be losses"". We got a glimpse of the potential scale of the losses earlier this year when RBS (as was) reported a nine-fold (833%) increase in the amount of money it set aside for bad loans compared to the same period a year ago. New accounting standards require companies to make their best guess of future bad loans - so RBS's best guess in the first quarter of this year was that bad loans would explode. We will get an update on their view next week. Since that time, RBS has gone on to lend Â£10bn under various government schemes to businesses that they would not normally have done were it not for government guarantees, the vast majority of which were at 100%. However, as Alison Rose was keen to stress - those guarantees are to the lender not the borrower. If RBS predicts the default rate on loans rose by nine times on loans the bank was comfortable making without guarantees, how much higher will it be when that government backing meant the normal lending checks were accelerated or even effectively discarded? Banks urge 'student-type loans' to stop job cuts UK faces âexplosiveâ debt levels Given these loans are guaranteed, the financial problem is primarily the government's (and therefore the taxpayer) but these are loans not grants and Alison Rose accepted that the high street banks will be the ones to be knocking on the door for repayment. ""It's a very important point that we have made to businesses that they are 100% liable for repayment. We will be involved in collecting that money because they will need to pay it back but we will do that in a very considered and thoughtful way."" She added that a lot of businesses had secured the funds but many had not yet spent them. The decade or so since the last crisis was the most painful in the nearly 300-year history of a bank that went from solid and dependable and trusted Royal Bank of Scotland (a brand its branches will retain in Scotland) to a by word for reckless expansion, hubristic leadership and, in some cases, the brutal and unethical treatment of its small business customers after the crash. Ms Rose is determined to complete a transformation from that to a ""purpose driven, financially sustainable bank that works for all its stakeholders"". The name change may help to close the door on a horrible decade for a bank whose losses over ten years amounted to Â£60bn - wiping out am injection of Â£46bn in taxpayer money and then some. The shares in TBFKARBS (The bank formerly known as RBS), or Natwest Group, are trading at one quarter of the value at which the taxpayer bought its shares. We will probably never get that money back. That doesn't mean it was the wrong thing to do. A failure of a bank whose assets were worth more than the entire UK economy would have taken that economy down the plughole with it. Ms Rose insists that the bank will not airbrush events since 2009 out of its corporate memory: ""We don't want to forget the past, it's important we remember those lessons"" New name. New crisis.

UK citizenship test 'misleading' and 'false' on slavery,"The information about British history given to people who apply for citizenship is 'demonstrably false', according to a group of academics. In anopen letter,externalpublished in an academic journal, the historians and authors accuse the government document of misleading applicants about several aspects of British history. They claim the UK's role in the international slave trade is downplayed, and that the end of the British Empire is described as ""mostly peaceful"" when it was not. The letter calls for the history chapter of the pamphlet to be re-written urgently. The Home Office says it will consider any feedback, and does keep the handbook under review. The test is taken by foreign nationals who want to become UK citizens. The Home Office says it ""focuses on values and principles at the heart of being British"". It covers things like British culture, music and sport. But it's the section on Britain's history that this group of academics say needs to be addressed. The open letter singles out the sections dealing with slavery and the British Empire for its strongest criticism. It takes particular issue with the document's claim that ""while slavery was illegal within Britain itself, by the 18th century it was a fully established overseas industry"". ""In fact,"" the historians write, ""whether slavery was legal or illegal within Britain was a matter of debate in the eighteenth century, and many people were held as slaves."" The black British history you may not know about The letter accuses the test of ignoring violent independence struggles like the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya. The letter also questions a passage stating that ""there was, for the most part, an orderly transition from Empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their independence."" ""Decolonisation was not an 'orderly' but an often violent process,"" the historians argue. And they say people from the former Empire who made valuable contributions to British culture are ignored in favour of white figures like the poet Rudyard Kipling. ""The only individual of colonial origin named in the book is Sake Dean Mohamet,"" they point out, ""who co-founded England's first curry house in 1810."" Rudyard Kipling - who the letter says is 'celebrated' in the citizenship test. There are 181 signatories to the letter, including academics from many of the UK's most prominent universities. They argue that in its current form, the handbook creates a ""distorted view"" of Britain's past. ""The aim of the official handbook is to promote tolerance and fairness and facilitate integration,"" they state towards the end of the letter. ""In its current version, the historical pages do the opposite."" The Home Office sent Newsbeat the following statement: ""Given the breadth of British history, the Life in the UK handbook provides a starting point to explore our past and help those seeking to live permanently in the UK gain a basic understanding our society, culture and historical references which occur in everyday conversations. ""We have published several editions of the handbook since it was launched and will continue to keep its contents under review and consider any feedback we receive.""

US orders China to close Houston consulate,"This video can not be played Men are filmed using a hose and closing rubbish bins at China's consulate in Houston The US has ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, by Friday - a move described as ""political provocation"" by Beijing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the decision was taken because China was ""stealing"" intellectual property. China's foreign ministry condemned the move,externalon Twitter, saying its embassy in Washington had received death threats. Earlier, unidentified individuals were filmed burning paper in bins in the Houston building's courtyard. Tensions have been rising between the US and China for some time. President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as China's imposition of a controversial new security law on Hong Kong. Then on Tuesday,the US Department of Justice accused China of sponsoring hackers who had been targeting labs developing Covid-19 vaccines. Two Chinese nationals, who allegedly spied on US research companies and got help from state agents for other thefts, have been charged. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump said it was ""always possible"" he would order the closure of more Chinese consulates. Mr Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was stealing ""not just American intellectual property... but European intellectual property too... costing hundreds of thousands of jobs"". ""We are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave,"" he continued. ""And when they don't, we're going to take actions that protect the American people, protect our security, our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs."" The consulate is one of five in the US, not counting the embassy in Washington DC. It is unclear why this one was singled out. The US-China battle behind the scenes What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? FBI director: China is 'greatest threat' to US In a separate statement, the State Department accused China of engaging ""in massive illegal spying and influence operations"", interfering in ""domestic politics"" as well as having ""coerced our business leaders, threatened families of Chinese Americans residing in China, and more"". In a series of tweets, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying described the reasons given by the US for closing the consulate as ""unbelievably ridiculous"". She urged the US to reverse its ""erroneous decision"", or China would ""react with firm countermeasures"". This video can not be played Liu Xiaoming: China is not the enemy of the US ""While Chinese diplomats are promoting mutual understanding and friendship, the US embassy in China publicly attacks China's political system,"" she said. ""As a result of smears and hatred fanned up by the US government, the Chinese embassy has received bomb and death threats."" Chinese state media outletthe Global Times began running a poll,externalon which US consulate to close in response. Beijing officials said the US has far more staff at its missions in China than vice versa. The foreign ministry has posted a warning to Chinese students in the US, asking them to ""be on guard"" as ""US law enforcement agencies have stepped up arbitrary interrogations, harassment, confiscation of personal belongings and detention targeting Chinese international students in the US"". This is clearly a significant development in the diplomatic sparring between Washington and Beijing. The closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston comes soon after news emerged of the unsealing of a US indictment against two men accused of spying on US vaccine development on behalf of China's security services. It is not clear if the two episodes are linked. But it is clear that the Trump administration is determined to step up its very public calling out of Beijing. In the midst of a presidential re-election campaign and with the US economy and society battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Trump has determined that there is political advantage in playing the China card. It is hard to see how Beijing can avoid some equivalent response. The danger now is of a spiralling tit-for-tat battle, driven in part by US domestic considerations, which can only make the complex and developing tensions between the US and China even worse. The first signs something unusual may be happening at the Houston consulate emerged on Tuesday, when people overlooking the building's courtyard noticed several bins on fire. Footage shows people throwing what appears to be paper into the bins. It is not known who they were. People were later filmed appearing to pour water on the bins. Emergency services were called to the building on Tuesday evening. However, theHouston police force said on Twitter officers ""were not granted access to enter the building"",external, but did see smoke. Mr Wang did not directly address the fires in the consulate's courtyard, simply saying it was operating as normal. Meanwhile, China's consulate in San Francisco has also come under scrutiny after the FBI alleged that a Chinese researcher accused of visa fraud for hiding her affiliation with the military had taken refuge there. According to court documents filed this week, Juan Tang claimed she had not served in the Chinese military when trying to obtain a US visa, but an open source investigation uncovered photos of the University of California researcher wearing military uniform and a search of her home found further evidence of her affiliation with the People's Liberation Army. ""The FBI assesses that at some point following the search and interview of Tang on June 29, 2020, Tang went to the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, where the FBI assesses she has remained,"" readsthe court filing, first reported on by the Axios news site.,external China has not commented on the claims. There are a number of flashpoints between Beijing and Washington currently. Some of the most serious are: Coronavirus: President Trump has repeatedly referred to Covid-19, the first cases of which were reported in Wuhan in late 2019, as the ""China virus"". He has also alleged it originated from a Chinese laboratory, despite his own intelligence officers saying it ""was not manmade or genetically modified"". In response, Chinese officials have suggested that Covid-19 might have originated in the US, without evidence. Trade: Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft, but in Beijing there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. The US and China have engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war since 2018 as a result of the dispute. Hong Kong: China's imposition of a sweeping new national security law in Hong Kong in June led the US to revoke the region's preferential economic treatment. Mr Trump has also signed a law to impose sanctions on officials who cracked down on rights. Beijing has accused the US of ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs, promising it would retaliate.

The photo that began the search for my slave roots," By Malik Al Nasir, as told to Ed Thomas By Malik Al Nasir, as told to Ed Thomas Malik al Nasir Malik al Nasir It started with a photograph from the 19th Century of a man who could have been my double. It was one o’clock in the morning and I was watching a TV documentary about 100 years of black footballers. This was 2002, and there weren’t many programmes about black people, so it was worth staying up for. Then a face appeared that made me catch my breath. A Victorian footballer. He looked comfortable, he didn’t look out of place, he looked like a boss. Very much a black British gentleman. Andrew Watson (centre, standing), 19th Century Scottish footballer Andrew Watson (centre, standing), 19th Century Scottish footballer His name was Andrew Watson - the same surname as my Dad. And he was from Demerara in Guyana, just like my Dad. [Malik changed his name from Mark Watson after converting to Islam]. There was another image of him in the documentary, but this time as a young boy at a grammar school in Halifax. Above my Mum’s TV set was a picture of me at about the same age - we were identical. Andrew Watson as a schoolboy Andrew Watson as a schoolboy Minutes later, the phone rang. It was my Mum. She said, “Turn on the BBC.” I said, “Mum, I’m already watching it.” “He looks just like you,” she said. Watson was born in 1856 in Demerara. He came from money, he was well-educated at private schools and at university in Glasgow, Liverpool and London. He was a significant footballer in the 19th Century. In the 1880s he played for Queens Park, winning three Scottish cups. At the time they were one of the biggest clubs in the world. He also played three games for Scotland at international level. He was described as an inspiration, captaining the national side during their 6-1 win over England. We looked identical. But Andrew Watson’s life was very different to mine. Warning: This chapter contains racial slurs The first time I was racially abused was in school. It was 1972. I was six years old and sitting in school assembly. The head teacher was playing a taped story called The Story of Little Black Sambo. I could hear every offensive line booming out at the morning assembly. Other kids were laughing, giggling and pointing at me. It made me feel like I didn’t belong, that there was something wrong with me. But we were told not to take offence because it was the teachers who were playing it. In England in the 70s it was normal to see books with titles like Ten Little Nigger Boys or The Proud Golliwog. Nobody seemed to think this was a problem. 1968: Malik Al Nasir aged two 1968: Malik Al Nasir aged two I was already living in a poor neighbourhood, but I was also dealing with racism - in the classroom, from friends, on the TV in my house. I had to fight most days in school. I was attacked on a daily basis, in and out of school but it was always me who had to see the head teacher for punishment. I was considered the troublemaker for being bullied by the kids the teachers were egging on. And life was about to get a lot worse. My Dad had a stroke, it was Christmas 1974. He was paralysed and stayed in hospital until he died. My Mum, a white woman, was now a single parent with four black kids. She couldn’t cope with living in a poor white area at a time of heightened racial tension. She was a target of a lot of hostility. She was a very strong woman but even she was powerless against this toxic background. I was expelled from school at the age of nine and taken into care. Malik aged nine Malik aged nine I remember everything about that first night, as if it was now. It was the most traumatic event of my life. I was stripped, washed and placed in a locked room. I spent 14 days in isolation there, in solitary confinement. I remember the bars on the windows, nobody spoke to me, food was pushed through a hole in the door like a prison. I still remember banging on the windows, screaming and begging to be let out. It was called the Liverpool Children’s Admission Unit. It was on Acrefield Road in Woolton. Thank God it’s been knocked down now. It was a dilapidated old Victorian mansion, run by a man who looked like Gomez from The Addams Family. He had a mynah bird in the office, a big black thing that used to talk. The place was always musty, stinking of damp. Plaster was falling off the walls and in the communal lounge there was a huge block that had fallen off - the hole was so big, kids could fit inside. I was moved from one children’s home to another, suffering physical abuse and racism. In many of the homes, staff would beat us, but nothing was done because the reports to social workers were written by the people beating us. One home in Warrington had a farm, so we had to dig foot-deep trenches a  couple of hundred metres in length, and plant potatoes. The social workers would sell them to the public. It was forced labour. I missed 18 months of primary education and had less than two years in secondary school. I also spent time in an approved school in Manchester, which was brutal - I had a tooth knocked out and I was stabbed. I left the care system in 1984 at the age of 18, semi-literate, and was placed in a hostel for homeless black youths. I had no qualifications to get a job, no social structures to support me, not a penny to my name. I was on my own on the streets, at a time of racial tensions. The Toxteth riots were only a recent memory. The Toxteth riots, July 1981 The Toxteth riots, July 1981 I was totally lost – I did not know who I was, where I belonged, or what would become of me. But that year, things started to change. Gil Scott-Heron, singer, poet and civil rights activist, writer of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised and I Think I'll Call It Morning, was playing in Liverpool. I sneaked into a gig he was playing at the Royal Court Theatre. Gil Scott-Heron on stage at Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool (photographer: Penny Potter) Gil Scott-Heron on stage at Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool (photographer: Penny Potter) The atmosphere was something else - it was electric, and Gil was in perfect unison with his audience. Afterwards I made my way backstage, and we got talking. We never stopped. Gil became my mentor. It completely changed my life. Malik with the singer and poet Gil Scott-Heron Malik with the singer and poet Gil Scott-Heron Whenever he was in the UK, I’d be on tour with him. I learned to set up the drums. I did the laundry, the merchandise, anything. But more than that, Gil inspired me to write poetry, and this allowed me to heal and confront my past. But what was my history? All I knew was that I was probably descended from a slave. I knew about the Vikings, the Romans, World Wars One and Two, the Empire. But the black figures were savages or else they were Uncle Ben on the rice packets or the gollywog on the marmalade jar. Andrew Watson, illustrated in the Scottish Athletics Journal Andrew Watson, illustrated in the Scottish Athletics Journal Andrew Watson was the first historical black role model I could be proud of. I wanted to know about his life. I dug deeper and started two family trees - one for me and one for him. Andrew Watson’s marriage certificate named his father as Peter Miller Watson. Peter’s job title was “sugar planter”. He was born to a prosperous family in northern Scotland in 1805. By the 1830s he owned, and was running, sugar plantations in Demerara. Andrew Watson's marriage certificate names his father as ""Peter Miller Watson, sugar planter (deceased)"" Andrew Watson's marriage certificate names his father as ""Peter Miller Watson, sugar planter (deceased)"" Peter Miller Watson’s mother, Christian Robertson Watson (1780-1842), was one of three sisters apparently known as the “three fair maids of Kiltearn”, a parish just north of Inverness. The eldest was Ann Robertson, who married Charles Stewart Parker. He was based in Glasgow, involved in insurance and shipbuilding, and he owned sugar plantations in Grenada. The youngest sister was Elizabeth Robertson who married a man from Cheshire called Samuel Sandbach. He dominated a company called Sandbach Tinne & Co, described at the time as trading “sugar, coffee, molasses, rum and prime gold coast negros”. A picture was emerging of families inter-marrying, with shared business interests in a slave-owning dynasty that lasted for generations, accumulating staggering amounts of money. At this point all I knew was that I looked similar to Andrew Watson. Our ancestors were born in the same country and we shared the same surname. But if we were related, did that mean that I was also descended from slave owners? My instinct said I was, but still it was an uncomfortable prospect. I remembered how my Dad once said to me, “One day I’m going to take you back to the sugar cane.” It never happened because he died when I was 13. It was time to go back to where my Dad had come from. In 2008 I headed for the South American country of Guyana, armed only with the name of a village - Weldaad - and the knowledge that my Dad, Reginald Wilcox Watson, had once lived there. I had no idea of what would unfold, but it felt like going home. Stepping foot on Guyanese soil at Cheddi Jagan Airport wasn’t like arriving at Heathrow. The airport was small and austere. Outside there were palm trees. The area had been carved out of a tropical rainforest. Malik arriving in Guyana, 2008 Malik arriving in Guyana, 2008 The first stop was Georgetown, to scan the national archives. Despite this being the capital, there were no high-rise buildings, and the older buildings were made out of timber. It didn’t take long to track down the information I needed. I couldn't find any marriage record, but the electoral roll confirmed there was a Peter Miller Watson in Guyana, who was eligible to vote because of his ownership of two sugar plantations -  Le’ Bonne Intention and Plantation Zeebrugge. His date of birth matched that of the sugar planter named in Andrew Watson’s marriage certificate - proof that the father of one of the world’s first black footballers owned plantations and slaves, and that he had a relationship with a black woman. It was time to head to the tiny village of Weldaad, along the coast from Georgetown. What should have been a straight 90-minute drive took three hours, as the car bounced around on bumpy roads, held up by donkeys, cows and goats - all this in oppressive humidity. But Weldaad was beautiful - the lushest of vegetation, 60ft high coconut palms, green undergrowth and fruit trees. Poking out between it all were telephone poles, the only thing that looked modern in the whole town. It was like stepping back in time. In Liverpool I was used to seeing flocks of seagulls but this place hummed to the noise of parakeets and macaws of blue and green with big long tails. The road to Weldaad The road to Weldaad The rainforest had been cut back to make way for cane fields and rice paddies with canals everywhere. They'd been built by slaves under Dutch colonists 200 years ago, to move goods around the fields to the processing plants - a tropical version of Holland. Cows were wandering freely around the coconut palms and timber frame houses. It struck me that whatever riches were gathered from these fields, none of it trickled down to the people remaining today. Weldaad was such a rural area and everyone was so kind to me, more than happy to help. The local people talked about a man long dead called Teacher Watson, who lived in the next village. Could that have been my grandfather? Yes, it was just a surname but it was all I had to grab onto. There was a man in the village called Mr White, who studied family history. Frustratingly he had never heard of any Watsons, but by a twist of fate, the day after talking to me, he heard two old ladies talking in a bank, one of whom mentioned that her maiden name was Watson. Mr White introduced himself and took her number to give to the “man from England looking for his family”. The lady lived in a timber house raised on stilts to protect it from the floods. It was evening by the time I was outside her home. At the top of the steep wooden steps, the door opened and I was greeted by a smiling old lady. Her name was Withyeline, she was 82 years old, and on the wall above her was a picture that was the spitting image of my father. “Reg Watson?” I asked. “Yes,” she replied. Did I have a sister twice my age? My heart was racing. “Reginald Wilcox Watson?” I asked again. She paused and said “No, that’s Reginald Daniel William Watson. Your father is my Uncle Reg.” I was confused but then it hit me - our fathers were half-brothers and both called Reg! So Withyeline was my first cousin. She told me she’d lived with my father before he left Guyana in the 1930s. Withyeline, Malik's cousin in Guyana Withyeline, Malik's cousin in Guyana We shared a grandfather, George Edward Watson. Withyeline confirmed that this was indeed Teacher Watson. He was an educated man, a schoolmaster who also taught my father to read and write. She revealed that my father was meant to inherit land, but because he’d left for England he never got his share. I wanted to know more about the land. Was it a connection to Andrew Watson? The next day I went back to the land registry, and looked at maps with plots carved out. The Watson family land, where Withyeline was now living, was in what was once called the Woodlands plantation, just north of the region's main sugar refinery. Frustratingly there was no clear connection between this plantation and Peter Miller Watson. But why did my side of the Watson family inherit acres and acres of plantation land? After five days of searching, it was time to head back to Liverpool. I had found family members. I knew the exact land where my ancestors lived, and confirmed the name of Andrew Watson’s father but there was still so much more I needed to know. It would be 10 years before I found the next clue. On eBay I spotted a collection of ephemera for sale - handwritten letters with wax seals and postmarks. Stamp dealers collect these items for their rare postmarks. There was little clue in the listing to what was in the letters, but the seller described them as 19th Century correspondence detailing the sugar and slave trade, specifically addressed to and from Liverpool, Demerara and Glasgow. Money was tight but I took a chance, and paid thousands of pounds for all of them. It was a gamble that paid off. There were more than 100 letters, mostly covering the mercantile slave-owner dynasty that began with Peter Miller Watson’s grandfather, George Robertson, in Grenada in the 1790s. George's partners were Samuel Sandbach and Charles Stuart Parker, Watson’s uncles by marriage. They moved operations from Grenada in 1795 after a slave revolt, and relocated in the Demerara region of Guyana. In 1813, the major trading arm of this family enterprise took on a Dutch partner, Phillip Frederick Tinne, and it became known as Sandbach Tinne. The papers were the complete accounts, profit and loss as well as balance sheets of the entire operation from 1808-1880. They detailed the names of the company’s plantations, the number of acres, the insurance, the fleet of cargo ships built and insured, and where the cargo was transported. It also confirmed that the company owned the plantations - and slaves - where my family lived in Guyana. I was shocked. The correspondence provided extensive written evidence of the company’s slave-trading operations, the numbers of slaves owned and the massive amount of money this operation brought in. The archive was a gold mine, but it was overwhelming too, looking at this dark sinister past, filled with centuries of suffering endured by black people. I was also trying to comprehend the fact that I too might be related to the exploiters, the slave owners. Here it was documented that Samuel Sandbach joined the company in Grenada as a low-level clerk, and moved to Demerara when the company relocated in 1796. Having married into the Robertson family, Sandbach became a full partner and rose to take over the whole enterprise. He went on to become one of the biggest slave owners and most important mercantile figures in the UK. A document dated 31 August 1822 details the “negro account” for the buying and selling of slaves. It shows that Sandbach Tinne had lost £6,000 - apparently because of the death of company slaves.  At that time, an epidemic was ravaging Demerara and the surrounding areas, and it was the most vulnerable - the slaves - who were dying. The documents reveal that in 1822 a fever or illness spread in what was then British Guiana, wiping out 5% of Georgetown’s population. A letter describes death everywhere: The slaves may have been dying, but the writer's chief worry is the almost complete collapse of production on the plantation, and how profits are down nearly 75%: The conditions of the slaves were outlined by a missionary, Reverend John Smith, who visited Demerara in 1823. He describes them being overworked to absolute exhaustion, up to 20 hours a day on the plantations. Some, he says, were not permitted to sleep, but had to cut sugar cane through the night. Looking back at my archive now, I try not to think about how the slaves must have suffered. It traumatises me to think about those who died. Black men, women and children were categorised as profit and loss, along with animals. In reality the horses would have been treated with more respect. The archive also provided the link I had been looking for. It showed that the Woodlands plantation, where my family lived, was owned by Sandbach Tinne, and that from the 1830s onwards - like all their plantations - it was managed by Peter Miller Watson. And this was the land inherited by Withyeline, and the rest of my family. Everything pointed in the same direction - I was related in some way to Andrew Watson. There were Watsons still on the land, modern-day Watsons, family members related to me. I felt a massive sense of validation - from starting off with just a picture of Andrew Watson and the family name, my instincts had been proved right. It gave me a sense of pride, in who I am and where I am from. I had a valid identity. At first this felt great - I was connected to an icon of black history. But through him, I was also linked to a dark chapter of Britain's colonial past and the slave trade. The discovery was bitter-sweet. 18th Century illustration of slaves arriving in Latin America 18th Century illustration of slaves arriving in Latin America My ancestors were owned by slave masters. After years of brutality, their descendants inherited small pieces of their land and their name. So many questions remain to be answered. I want to return to Demerara and find the birth certificate of my grandfather, George Edward Watson. It may well link him to Peter Miller Watson, or maybe one of his brothers, Henry or William, who were also in Demerara running the plantations. I also remember something Withyeline said. “The three white Scottish brothers - you’re related to them.” My journey was bringing me full circle. The wealth generated from the enslavement of my ancestors was brought by Samuel Sandbach to Liverpool - the city where I grew up and where I was always made to feel an outsider. Sandbach rose to become what would now be known as a CEO for Sandbach Tinne & Co. He was one of the most visible partners, the largest joint shareholder of all of their operations in Demerara, Glasgow and Liverpool. Off the back of thousands of slaves, numerous plantations and a fleet of ships, this son of a Cheshire farmer acquired a staggering amount of wealth. In Liverpool Sandbach became a man of incredible influence. He was appointed the city’s mayor in 1831 - one of the most important people in one of the most important cities in the British Empire.  From slaves, cotton and coffee, to sugar, rum and molasses, it all went through Liverpool. A memorial to Samuel Sandbach and his wife Elizabeth at the family mausoleum in Llangernyw A memorial to Samuel Sandbach and his wife Elizabeth at the family mausoleum in Llangernyw He retired from Sandbach Tinne in 1833, passing on his shares in the company to his two sons. He was leaving the business he helped build in the same year as the Abolition of Slavery Act. Under the terms of the act, £20m was paid out by the British government to slave owners in return for freeing their slaves (in fact this money, borrowed by the government, was not completely paid off until 2015). Sandbach was a member of the West Indian Association of Liverpool, a group which lobbied to receive compensation for the loss of their slaves. The association presented a silver salver to John Gladstone, MP, slave owner and father of the future prime minister, William Gladstone . It was recognition of Gladstone’s role in negotiating generous terms with Parliament on their behalf. The inscription on the salver reads: “Presented to John Gladstone, Esquire, by the West India Association of Liverpool in testimony of the high sense they entertain of the value of his services so actively and beneficially employed in setting the conditions of the emancipation of the slaves in the West India colonies” Silver salver presented to John Gladstone by the  West Indian Association of Liverpool Silver salver presented to John Gladstone by the  West Indian Association of Liverpool Incidentally, John Gladstone's second wife, Ann McKenzie Robertson, was also a cousin of Samuel Sandbach's wife Elizabeth Robertson. The end of slavery did nothing to dent Sandbach’s fortune or reputation. He allowed his mansion to be used as accommodation for high court judges arriving from London to hear cases in the city. By the mid-1840s Sandbach had acquired a significant stake in the recently founded Bank of Liverpool, becoming its deputy chairman, and overseeing the vast wealth he had built up. The Bank of Liverpool grew and grew. Eventually it bought Martins Bank in London in 1918, and took its name in 1928. By now it had hundreds of branches across the UK, quite a rise for a bank started by slave owners just decades before. In 1969 Barclays Bank took over Martins Bank, by now the sixth largest clearing bank in the UK. The role people like Samuel Sandbach played in its growth is now long forgotten, but it shouldn’t be. His legacy is still evident today. I see it all around Liverpool, in buildings built with money from the blood of my ancestors. When I walk past the former Martins Bank Building on Water Street in the city centre, I see the opulence of the British Empire. It amazes me that it was the local Barclays HQ until 2009. Martins Bank Building in Liverpool Martins Bank Building in Liverpool In the doorway, in sculpted stone panels, is King Neptune, lord of the waves, holding two young African slave boys. It’s a nod to the shipping lines and the exploited who formed the basis of the bank’s wealth. Above them is the grasshopper, the symbol of Martins Bank and to the side, the Liver bird, symbol of the Bank of Liverpool. The hierarchy is not lost on me - the slaves at the bottom, in the middle the sea, the slave routes and the money at the top. The chances are I am related to the slave owners and the slaves, just like the man who helped start this journey for me, Andrew Watson. It's my belief that his mother was a free black woman, possibly the daughter of one of Peter Miller Watson's business colleagues in Demerara. There were such black women in Guyana who were wealthy in their own right, usually the children of white merchants. But many more women in Demerara did not have a choice about having sex with the men working for Sandbach Tinne, any more than they had a choice about working on the plantation, or being shipped from West Africa. But the story of the slaves in Demerara isn’t over yet, and it won’t be until there has been restorative justice. Slave owners were compensated after slavery was abolished in Britain in 1834. They were paid an estimated £17bn in today's money. The slaves got nothing. That wealth flowed into British society. Sandbach Tinne existed as a company until the 1970s. Samuel Sandbach was a founding shareholder in the Bank of Liverpool, which went on to become part of Barclays Bank. Letter from Malik's archive addressed to Sandbach Tinne, Liverpool Letter from Malik's archive addressed to Sandbach Tinne, Liverpool Last year Glasgow University announced it would pay £20m in reparations to atone for its historical links to the slave trade. The pub chain and brewer Greene King has said it too will be paying reparations in some form, along with the insurance market, Lloyds of London. Caricom, the body representing 15 Caribbean nations, has called for meaningful reparations for the transatlantic slave trade. It’s a call that’s not going to go away. (A Barclays spokesperson told the BBC, “The history of Barclays, like other institutions, is being examined following recent events. We can’t change what’s gone before us, only how we go forward. We are committed as a bank to do more to further foster our culture of inclusiveness, equality and diversity, for our colleagues, and the customers and clients we serve.”) As for me, the journey that has taken me from Liverpool to Guyana and back again, will soon take me to the University of Cambridge. The boy who left school - and care - without qualifications will soon be studying for a PhD, researching Sandbach Tinne and the role it played in the slave trade. It started out as a family tree, but became a way of reasserting my dignity and my cultural identity. My archive details the workings of one company, but this was just one part of a crime against humanity, which involved the exploitation of millions of people. It’s important that nobody forgets that. This is a moment to understand what happened during the slave trade. Why were the slave owners allowed to treat my ancestors with such depravity, as less than human? There needs to be recognition and accountability. Organisations whose wealth originally derived from the barbaric trade in human flesh should be held accountable. There should  be meaningful restitution for past wrongs - not just a public relations exercise. Nearly 200 years have passed but the oppression is still here today. Racism is very much alive - just ask George Floyd’s family. So how can we heal? If we don’t look into our past we cannot understand today. As Gil Scott-Heron once said to me, “If you don’t know where you come from, you won’t know where you are going. You have to study your history.” This is mine.  "
Million spent on M4 road homes weeks before axe,"The M4 Relief Road was designed to replace the stretch of motorway in Newport A million pounds of taxpayers' cash was spent on two properties affected by the M4 relief road route just weeks before the scheme was axed. Since 1995 more than Â£15m has been spent on the compulsory purchase of 29 properties affected by the scheme to relieve congestion around Newport. Fourteen remain vacant. One house was bought 13 days before Welsh ministers decided the scheme was too costly. The Welsh Government said many will be sold when market conditions are right. It said it is require by law to purchase properties that meet certain criteria - which both properties did. Two houses in the Coedkernew district of south west Newport were bought by the Welsh Government in April 2019. The first purchase, for Â£575,000, was made on 9 April, while the second, for Â£462,162, was bought on 16 April, according to the Land Registry. On 29 April, the Welsh Government cabinet decided in a meeting that the cost of the road project was not acceptable. What is it like to live near the M4? Prime minister has 'no say' on the M4 relief road Is there One Direction for Â£1.4bn road? No announcement was made until 4 June - about two months after the purchase - when First Minister Mark Drakeford revealed that the scheme would be axed on cost and environmental grounds. The Welsh Conservatives said it suggested a ""shambolic decision-making process within the heart of the Welsh Government"". Russell George, the party's economy spokesman, said: ""The Welsh Labour-run Government has, once again, expected the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the vast sums of money spent on a project it later sank."" The M4 Relief Road was designed to reduce congestion around the Brynglas tunnels In response to a Welsh Conservative Freedom of Information request, the Welsh Government said: ""We are unable to tenant some properties due to their current condition, however where possible, these properties will be brought up to standard and advertised for rent this financial year."" Seven of the 29 properties bought over the last 25 years have been sold for around Â£2.1m and eight have been rented out so far. Six of the 29 properties were purchased prior to devolution in 1999. Mr George said millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been ""frittered away, and worse still there is nothing to show for it"". A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Many of these are assets with value that will be disposed of when market conditions are right. ""Land and buildings purchased before devolution would have been under the authority of the Wales Office as part of the UK government."" The Welsh Government later added: ""The purchase of properties is guided by legislation. We are bound to acquire properties that meet the relevant criteria and at both the point of application and point of purchase, the two properties referred to fulfilled the criteria.""

Elon Musk briefly becomes fifth-richest person,"Elon Musk runs both Tesla and the space exploration firm SpaceX Tesla chief Elon Musk briefly became the fifth richest person at the start of the week, thanks to the electric car-maker's soaring share price. His net worth reached $74bn (Â£58.5bn). Teslaâs share price has since fallen slightly, however, putting Mr Musk in eighth place,according to the Forbes World's Billionaires List,external. In a related development, his wealth could be further buoyed as he has just gained the option of buying and selling $2.1bn worth of Tesla shares. In a pay deal approved by shareholders in 2018, Mr Musk obtained the right to buy 1.69 million shares once Teslaâs stock had reached an average market capitalisation of $150bn over a period of six months. However, the electric-car companyâs board still has to certify the option and Mr Musk has not yet bought the shares in question. He would also have to wait several years before being allowed to sell them. Teslaâs share price has nearly quadrupled since the start of the year, from $430 to about $1,550. But the company has yet to turn a full-year net profit, leading some analysts to argue its stock is currently overvalued. On 1 May, Mr Muskhimself tweeted Teslaâs share price,externalwas too high. The entrepreneur has said the reasonhe seeks to acquire personal wealth is to fund,externalhis efforts to send people to Mars.

UK's biggest lender warns of 'tough times ahead',"This video can not be played 'We want to support businesses' On the very day that the name RBS was consigned to the annals of financial history, the boss of the UK's biggest business lender warned that while the painful memories of the last great financial crisis had faded, the true extent of a new and graver threat to thousands of businesses was emerging. Alison Rose, the chief executive of the renamed Natwest Group said: ""There are clearly tough times ahead. Not all businesses will survive and there are going to be losses"". We got a glimpse of the potential scale of the losses earlier this year when RBS (as was) reported a nine-fold (833%) increase in the amount of money it set aside for bad loans compared to the same period a year ago. New accounting standards require companies to make their best guess of future bad loans - so RBS's best guess in the first quarter of this year was that bad loans would explode. We will get an update on their view next week. Since that time, RBS has gone on to lend Â£10bn under various government schemes to businesses that they would not normally have done were it not for government guarantees, the vast majority of which were at 100%. However, as Alison Rose was keen to stress - those guarantees are to the lender not the borrower. If RBS predicts the default rate on loans rose by nine times on loans the bank was comfortable making without guarantees, how much higher will it be when that government backing meant the normal lending checks were accelerated or even effectively discarded? Banks urge 'student-type loans' to stop job cuts UK faces âexplosiveâ debt levels Given these loans are guaranteed, the financial problem is primarily the government's (and therefore the taxpayer) but these are loans not grants and Alison Rose accepted that the high street banks will be the ones to be knocking on the door for repayment. ""It's a very important point that we have made to businesses that they are 100% liable for repayment. We will be involved in collecting that money because they will need to pay it back but we will do that in a very considered and thoughtful way."" She added that a lot of businesses had secured the funds but many had not yet spent them. The decade or so since the last crisis was the most painful in the nearly 300-year history of a bank that went from solid and dependable and trusted Royal Bank of Scotland (a brand its branches will retain in Scotland) to a by word for reckless expansion, hubristic leadership and, in some cases, the brutal and unethical treatment of its small business customers after the crash. Ms Rose is determined to complete a transformation from that to a ""purpose driven, financially sustainable bank that works for all its stakeholders"". The name change may help to close the door on a horrible decade for a bank whose losses over ten years amounted to Â£60bn - wiping out am injection of Â£46bn in taxpayer money and then some. The shares in TBFKARBS (The bank formerly known as RBS), or Natwest Group, are trading at one quarter of the value at which the taxpayer bought its shares. We will probably never get that money back. That doesn't mean it was the wrong thing to do. A failure of a bank whose assets were worth more than the entire UK economy would have taken that economy down the plughole with it. Ms Rose insists that the bank will not airbrush events since 2009 out of its corporate memory: ""We don't want to forget the past, it's important we remember those lessons"" New name. New crisis.

Socially distanced holiday preparations under way,"This video can not be played One campsite says it has been ""inundated"" with enquiries from people wanting to book Preparations are under way to provide social distancing at holiday spots as tourism starts to reopen across Wales. Campsites are able to fully open from this weekend, with one saying they had been ""inundated"" with enquiries. However there are concerns over the volume of visitors coming in some places. North Wales is the second most popular destination for a UK break this summer, according to research carried out by a hotel chain. One council there has already issued a plea to visitors to stagger times for visiting one of its beauty spots after car parks were overwhelmed. New Quay is one of the towns to introduce coronavirus road closures Denbighshire council has had problems with people parking along roads leading to Moel Famau in the Clwydian Range hills, and has urged people to think carefully about the timing of their visit. Snowdonia also sawlong lines of illegally parked carsas the school holidays began at the weekend. Phillipa George has reduced numbers and followed Covid-19 social distancing and hygiene advice In Monknash, Vale of Glamorgan, Heritage Coast Camping owner Phillipa George has been making careful preparations to welcome back visitors when the site reopens. ""We're following Welsh Government guidelines and we are part of the Good to Go scheme,"" she told BBC Wales. ""So, we've been preparing to have all our signage, sanitation, social distancing, staff, PPE and everything that is to follow the guidance. ""We should hopefully be ready to open up at the end of the month."" Getting the social distancing right at Heritage Coast Camping in the Vale of Glamorgan She said the interest in coming had been ""amazing"", adding: ""We're very fortunate that we have a lot of visitors who come to us every year. ""But we have been inundated by enquiries from people who want to come. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that people are wanting staycations, and they love Wales."" She has reduced the number of pitches by increasing the distance between each one, both to reduce the overall number and to keep queues down for shared sanitary facilities. Mikey's Cafe Bar in Aberystwyth has been able to put out extra tables thanks to road closures to help social distancing In Aberystwyth, Nettie Brydon, of Mikey's CafÃ© Bar, said the announcement of measures to help with social distancing, including pedestrianisation on central streets, had caught some businesses cold. ""It was announced late on a Friday evening that it was going to happen on Monday. It didn't give really any of the businesses  time to prepare,"" she said. ""And then at the start of that week it was a complete washout, so it wasn't until the Wednesday afternoon that we could actually get any tables out and do it safely. ""To sum it up, it was a bit of disaster at first, but as it's going on I'm growing towards it and I'm starting to like it,"" she said. Campsites, beauty salons and cinemas get open date Playgrounds, outdoor gyms and funfairs reopen Reopening Wales 'step by step' right, says FM She is now able to serve seven tables on the road outside whereas they previously only had two. Nettie added: ""If it was to be a permanent thing we would have to invest in some kind of outdoor cover for when it rains. After all it is the Costa del Ceredigion."" Butcher Rob Rattray worries about customer access, but wants people to ""keep safe"" However butcher shop owner Rob Rattray, who has been operating a click and collect service, is worried it will have an impact on his local customers who have stuck with him through lockdown. ""We're trying to get our customers to come before 11 o'clock. On a nice day it's good for some businesses, like the cafes with the tables outside."" But he conceded: ""We've got to keep safe here. We've been good all through the lockdown in Ceredigion, and if this helps it, great."" Traders in New Quay initially criticised Ceredigion council's plan for vehicle-free safe zones Aberystwyth is one of four ""safe zones"" created by Ceredigion council to allow for a bigger flow of visitors to the towns. The others, in Aberaeron, New Quay and Cardigan, will also all close between 11am and 6pm, which the council says is the only way to accommodate social distancing on the narrow pavements in the area. Visitors to the town gave the closures a positive response, saying they understood the need for it and thought tourists ""had been respectful"" of the measures in place. ""Everyone is using it, and you can see they're all spaced out along the entire distance of it,"" one man commented. ""I definitely think it is helping with social distancing."" Councillor Dewi Wyn Roberts says people in Abersoch are worried about an influx of visitors Absersoch, in Gwynedd, is a small seaside village which is hugely popular with tourists during the summer months. Councillor Dewi Wyn Roberts said it has gone from being ""really, really quiet"" during lockdown, to seeing ""more visitors than ever"". ""People who have been shielding are really concerned about that,"" he said ""And not only that, but visitors who have come here and are used to coming here are realising it is going to be a really busy period, and they are so concerned about social distancing."" Mr Roberts called on people to respect social distancing guidelines and wear a mask if they were unable to do so. The council has introduced reminders throughout the village, but Mr Roberts said it was also considering other measures. These would be used on a trial and error basis, he added, and could include one-way pedestrian systems, reduced car parking and widening roads where possible. The end of the summer could see numbers coming to Wales increase, according to a survey by Travelodge. Out of 2,000 adults questioned, four out of five said they were planning a staycation in the UK, with most looking at the end of August and September in the hope restrictions may be further eased by then. North Wales was the second most popular destination behind Cornwall for a break, and two out of five were planning to take more shorter breaks rather than one two-week holiday.

UK considers tougher spy laws after Russia report,"This video can not be played Keir Starmer questions Boris Johnson on the Russia report in parliament Ministers are considering strengthening security laws aftera report,externalby MPs accused them of underestimating the threat of Russian interference. Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said foreign agents could be required to register in the UK in future. He told MPs that this and other ""new offences and powers"" for dealing with foreign spies were being looked at. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of complacency and leaving a ""serious gap in our defences"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said the government had ""delayed"" legislation to help counter Russian interference, despite acknowledging 18 months ago that existing powers were insufficient. ""The PM sat on this report for 10 months and failed to plug a gap in our law in national security,"" he said. ""How is the PM going to address that gap and meet the threat with the joined-up, robust response it deserves?"" UK 'badly underestimated' Russian threat Russia report: The unanswered questions Russia report: What would tougher spy laws mean for UK? Boris Johnson said there was no other country in the Western world that was more ""vigilant"" about Russian interference, pointing to recent sanctions against Russian officials involved in human rights abuses and proposed laws to protect critical infrastructure and intellectual property. ""Let us be in no doubt about what this is all about,"" he said. ""It is about pressure from the Islingtonian remainers who have seized on this report to try and give the impression that Russian interference was somehow responsible for Brexit. ""The people of this country did not vote to leave the EU because of pressure from Russia."" The Intelligence and Security Committee report claimed the government made no effort to investigate claims of Russian interference in the EU referendum and criticised intelligence agencies for not prioritising the issue. The government has said an inquiry is not necessary as it has ""seen no evidence of successful interference"". But ministers are listening to calls from all parties to do more to counter Russian espionage and subversion after the UK was described the main target after the US and Nato. Plans to make foreign agents register were mentioned in the government'slegislative agenda,externallast December, and werepreviously announcedby former home secretary Sajid Javid in May last year. In response to an urgent question from Labour in the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the UK would consider strengthening the Official Secrets Act and tightening rules on investment visas. ""Let there be no doubt, we are unafraid to act where necessary to protect the UK and our allies."" If you do not seek, you do not find. Whether deliberate or deficient, the Intelligence and Security Committee's very long-awaited report outlines gaping holes in the UK's handling of the threat from Russia. For years, it seems a lack of priority, and a lack of curiosity, allowed the risks to go unmonitored, if not to go unchecked. The UK government has now stiffened its attitude to Putin's Russia. Read Laura's full blog But shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the ""conscious"" decision not to consider whether they was any attempt to manipulate the Brexit vote spoke volumes. Urging ministers to treat the issue with the ""seriousness it deserves"", he added: ""I thank the security services for the work they do but they need help. This report makes clear they have not received the strategic support, legislative tools or resources necessary to defend our interests."" In its 50-page report, the ISC said the UK was ""clearly a target"" for disinformation campaigns around its elections, but that the issue was described as a ""hot potato"", with no one organisation taking a lead to tackle it. Russia has dismissed the report as Russophobia The committee suggested a new Espionage Act could help prevent individuals acting on behalf of a foreign power from concealing their links with that country. It said an obligation similar to that in the US - where agents are required to register with the Justice department - would ""clearly be valuable in countering Russian influence in the UK"". ISC member Kevan Jones said he was concerned that the Law Commission, which was asked last year to look at the legal issues regarding such a move, had yet to release its findings. ""Can I urge the minister to make sure we actually gets this legislation in place because it is needed,"" he said. ""Let's hope it is not just some spin to get the headlines."" Downing Street was accused of holding back the ISC report ahead of December's UK election and for delaying its nominations to set up the new committee - both claims it has denied. Its chair Julian Lewis, who was stripped of the Conservative whip after defying No 10 by standing for its leadership, sought reassurances that Downing Street special advisers would not be able to interfere with its work PANORAMA:Lifting the lockdown in Salford I MAY DESTROY YOU:The groundbreaking drama making headlines in lockdown 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

UK citizenship test 'misleading' and 'false' on slaveryA group of historians and academics is calling for the test to be urgently updated.Newsbeat,"The information about British history given to people who apply for citizenship is 'demonstrably false', according to a group of academics. In anopen letter,externalpublished in an academic journal, the historians and authors accuse the government document of misleading applicants about several aspects of British history. They claim the UK's role in the international slave trade is downplayed, and that the end of the British Empire is described as ""mostly peaceful"" when it was not. The letter calls for the history chapter of the pamphlet to be re-written urgently. The Home Office says it will consider any feedback, and does keep the handbook under review. The test is taken by foreign nationals who want to become UK citizens. The Home Office says it ""focuses on values and principles at the heart of being British"". It covers things like British culture, music and sport. But it's the section on Britain's history that this group of academics say needs to be addressed. The open letter singles out the sections dealing with slavery and the British Empire for its strongest criticism. It takes particular issue with the document's claim that ""while slavery was illegal within Britain itself, by the 18th century it was a fully established overseas industry"". ""In fact,"" the historians write, ""whether slavery was legal or illegal within Britain was a matter of debate in the eighteenth century, and many people were held as slaves."" The black British history you may not know about The letter accuses the test of ignoring violent independence struggles like the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya. The letter also questions a passage stating that ""there was, for the most part, an orderly transition from Empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their independence."" ""Decolonisation was not an 'orderly' but an often violent process,"" the historians argue. And they say people from the former Empire who made valuable contributions to British culture are ignored in favour of white figures like the poet Rudyard Kipling. ""The only individual of colonial origin named in the book is Sake Dean Mohamet,"" they point out, ""who co-founded England's first curry house in 1810."" Rudyard Kipling - who the letter says is 'celebrated' in the citizenship test. There are 181 signatories to the letter, including academics from many of the UK's most prominent universities. They argue that in its current form, the handbook creates a ""distorted view"" of Britain's past. ""The aim of the official handbook is to promote tolerance and fairness and facilitate integration,"" they state towards the end of the letter. ""In its current version, the historical pages do the opposite."" The Home Office sent Newsbeat the following statement: ""Given the breadth of British history, the Life in the UK handbook provides a starting point to explore our past and help those seeking to live permanently in the UK gain a basic understanding our society, culture and historical references which occur in everyday conversations. ""We have published several editions of the handbook since it was launched and will continue to keep its contents under review and consider any feedback we receive.""

"Prince George photos mark seventh birthdayThe future king flashes a smile at the camera in photos taken by his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge.UK","Prince George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 Two photographs of Prince George have been released to mark his seventh birthday on Wednesday. In both the photos, taken by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, the future king flashes a gap-toothed smile at the camera. She photographed her son earlier this month and the pictures are likely to have been taken at their Norfolk home. Kensington Palace said Prince William and Catherine were ""delighted"" to share the photos. Royal Family tree and line of succession In one of the pictures, George is dressed in a dark green polo shirt and in the other he stands side-on, dressed more casually in a T-shirt with a camouflage design. The prince is the great-grandchild of the Queen. He will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England in 1066 if, as is expected, he follows on as king from his grandfather, the Prince of Wales, and then his father, the Duke of Cambridge. Prince George was pictured several times during the coronavirus lockdown with his younger siblings, five-year-old Princess Charlotte and two-year-old Prince Louis, as they applauded heath and care workers during the weekly Clap for Carers. Prince George Alexander Louis - known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge - was born on 22 July 2013. He was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in central London and appeared in front of the world's media one day later, when Prince William and Catherine stood cradling him on the hospital steps. Earlier this year, the duke and duchess spoke about home-schooling George and his brother and sister while schools closed to most pupils during lockdown. ""The children have got such stamina I don't know how,""Catherine told the BBC. ""You pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake.

"Prince George photos mark seventh birthdayThe future king flashes a smile at the camera in photos taken by his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge.","Prince George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 Two photographs of Prince George have been released to mark his seventh birthday on Wednesday. In both the photos, taken by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, the future king flashes a gap-toothed smile at the camera. She photographed her son earlier this month and the pictures are likely to have been taken at their Norfolk home. Kensington Palace said Prince William and Catherine were ""delighted"" to share the photos. Royal Family tree and line of succession In one of the pictures, George is dressed in a dark green polo shirt and in the other he stands side-on, dressed more casually in a T-shirt with a camouflage design. The prince is the great-grandchild of the Queen. He will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England in 1066 if, as is expected, he follows on as king from his grandfather, the Prince of Wales, and then his father, the Duke of Cambridge. Prince George was pictured several times during the coronavirus lockdown with his younger siblings, five-year-old Princess Charlotte and two-year-old Prince Louis, as they applauded heath and care workers during the weekly Clap for Carers. Prince George Alexander Louis - known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge - was born on 22 July 2013. He was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in central London and appeared in front of the world's media one day later, when Prince William and Catherine stood cradling him on the hospital steps. Earlier this year, the duke and duchess spoke about home-schooling George and his brother and sister while schools closed to most pupils during lockdown. ""The children have got such stamina I don't know how,""Catherine told the BBC. ""You pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day and they have had a lovely time - but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure.""

US orders China to close Houston consulateUnidentified people were filmed burning paper in the consulate's courtyard after the order was made.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Men are filmed using a hose and closing rubbish bins at China's consulate in Houston The US has ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, by Friday - a move described as ""political provocation"" by Beijing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the decision was taken because China was ""stealing"" intellectual property. China's foreign ministry condemned the move,externalon Twitter, saying its embassy in Washington had received death threats. Earlier, unidentified individuals were filmed burning paper in bins in the Houston building's courtyard. Tensions have been rising between the US and China for some time. President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as China's imposition of a controversial new security law on Hong Kong. Then on Tuesday,the US Department of Justice accused China of sponsoring hackers who had been targeting labs developing Covid-19 vaccines. Two Chinese nationals, who allegedly spied on US research companies and got help from state agents for other thefts, have been charged. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump said it was ""always possible"" he would order the closure of more Chinese consulates. Mr Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was stealing ""not just American intellectual property... but European intellectual property too... costing hundreds of thousands of jobs"". ""We are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave,"" he continued. ""And when they don't, we're going to take actions that protect the American people, protect our security, our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs."" The consulate is one of five in the US, not counting the embassy in Washington DC. It is unclear why this one was singled out. The US-China battle behind the scenes What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? FBI director: China is 'greatest threat' to US In a separate statement, the State Department accused China of engaging ""in massive illegal spying and influence operations"", interfering in ""domestic politics"" as well as having ""coerced our business leaders, threatened families of Chinese Americans residing in China, and more"". In a series of tweets, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying described the reasons given by the US for closing the consulate as ""unbelievably ridiculous"". She urged the US to reverse its ""erroneous decision"", or China would ""react with firm countermeasures"". This video can not be played Liu Xiaoming: China is not the enemy of the US ""While Chinese diplomats are promoting mutual understanding and friendship, the US embassy in China publicly attacks China's political system,"" she said. ""As a result of smears and hatred fanned up by the US government, the Chinese embassy has received bomb and death threats."" Chinese state media outletthe Global Times began running a poll,externalon which US consulate to close in response. Beijing officials said the US has far more staff at its missions in China than vice versa. The foreign ministry has posted a warning to Chinese students in the US, asking them to ""be on guard"" as ""US law enforcement agencies have stepped up arbitrary interrogations, harassment, confiscation of personal belongings and detention targeting Chinese international students in the US"". This is clearly a significant development in the diplomatic sparring between Washington and Beijing. The closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston comes soon after news emerged of the unsealing of a US indictment against two men accused of spying on US vaccine development on behalf of China's security services. It is not clear if the two episodes are linked. But it is clear that the Trump administration is determined to step up its very public calling out of Beijing. In the midst of a presidential re-election campaign and with the US economy and society battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Trump has determined that there is political advantage in playing the China card. It is hard to see how Beijing can avoid some equivalent response. The danger now is of a spiralling tit-for-tat battle, driven in part by US domestic considerations, which can only make the complex and developing tensions between the US and China even worse. The first signs something unusual may be happening at the Houston consulate emerged on Tuesday, when people overlooking the building's courtyard noticed several bins on fire. Footage shows people throwing what appears to be paper into the bins. It is not known who they were. People were later filmed appearing to pour water on the bins. Emergency services were called to the building on Tuesday evening. However, theHouston police force said on Twitter officers ""were not granted access to enter the building"",external, but did see smoke. Mr Wang did not directly address the fires in the consulate's courtyard, simply saying it was operating as normal. Meanwhile, China's consulate in San Francisco has also come under scrutiny after the FBI alleged that a Chinese researcher accused of visa fraud for hiding her affiliation with the military had taken refuge there. According to court documents filed this week, Juan Tang claimed she had not served in the Chinese military when trying to obtain a US visa, but an open source investigation uncovered photos of the University of California researcher wearing military uniform and a search of her home found further evidence of her affiliation with the People's Liberation Army. ""The FBI assesses that at some point following the search and interview of Tang on June 29, 2020, Tang went to the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, where the FBI assesses she has remained,"" readsthe court filing, first reported on by the Axios news site.,external China has not commented on the claims. There are a number of flashpoints between Beijing and Washington currently. Some of the most serious are: Coronavirus: President Trump has repeatedly referred to Covid-19, the first cases of which were reported in Wuhan in late 2019, as the ""China virus"". He has also alleged it originated from a Chinese laboratory, despite his own intelligence officers saying it ""was not manmade or genetically modified"". In response, Chinese officials have suggested that Covid-19 might have originated in the US, without evidence. Trade: Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft, but in Beijing there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. The US and China have engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war since 2018 as a result of the dispute. Hong Kong: China's imposition of a sweeping new national security law in Hong Kong in June led the US to revoke the region's preferential economic treatment. Mr Trump has also signed a law to impose sanctions on officials who cracked down on rights. Beijing has accused the US of ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs, promising it would retaliate.

"UK considers tougher spy laws after Russia reportMinisters say ""new offences and powers"" may be needed as Labour warns of a ""serious gap"" in UK defences.UK Politics","This video can not be played Keir Starmer questions Boris Johnson on the Russia report in parliament Ministers are considering strengthening security laws aftera report,externalby MPs accused them of underestimating the threat of Russian interference. Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said foreign agents could be required to register in the UK in future. He told MPs that this and other ""new offences and powers"" for dealing with foreign spies were being looked at. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of complacency and leaving a ""serious gap in our defences"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said the government had ""delayed"" legislation to help counter Russian interference, despite acknowledging 18 months ago that existing powers were insufficient. ""The PM sat on this report for 10 months and failed to plug a gap in our law in national security,"" he said. ""How is the PM going to address that gap and meet the threat with the joined-up, robust response it deserves?"" UK 'badly underestimated' Russian threat Russia report: The unanswered questions Russia report: What would tougher spy laws mean for UK? Boris Johnson said there was no other country in the Western world that was more ""vigilant"" about Russian interference, pointing to recent sanctions against Russian officials involved in human rights abuses and proposed laws to protect critical infrastructure and intellectual property. ""Let us be in no doubt about what this is all about,"" he said. ""It is about pressure from the Islingtonian remainers who have seized on this report to try and give the impression that Russian interference was somehow responsible for Brexit. ""The people of this country did not vote to leave the EU because of pressure from Russia."" The Intelligence and Security Committee report claimed the government made no effort to investigate claims of Russian interference in the EU referendum and criticised intelligence agencies for not prioritising the issue. The government has said an inquiry is not necessary as it has ""seen no evidence of successful interference"". But ministers are listening to calls from all parties to do more to counter Russian espionage and subversion after the UK was described the main target after the US and Nato. Plans to make foreign agents register were mentioned in the government'slegislative agenda,externallast December, and werepreviously announcedby former home secretary Sajid Javid in May last year. In response to an urgent question from Labour in the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the UK would consider strengthening the Official Secrets Act and tightening rules on investment visas. ""Let there be no doubt, we are unafraid to act where necessary to protect the UK and our allies."" If you do not seek, you do not find. Whether deliberate or deficient, the Intelligence and Security Committee's very long-awaited report outlines gaping holes in the UK's handling of the threat from Russia. For years, it seems a lack of priority, and a lack of curiosity, allowed the risks to go unmonitored, if not to go unchecked. The UK government has now stiffened its attitude to Putin's Russia. Read Laura's full blog But shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the ""conscious"" decision not to consider whether they was any attempt to manipulate the Brexit vote spoke volumes. Urging ministers to treat the issue with the ""seriousness it deserves"", he added: ""I thank the security services for the work they do but they need help. This report makes clear they have not received the strategic support, legislative tools or resources necessary to defend our interests."" In its 50-page report, the ISC said the UK was ""clearly a target"" for disinformation campaigns around its elections, but that the issue was described as a ""hot potato"", with no one organisation taking a lead to tackle it. Russia has dismissed the report as Russophobia The committee suggested a new Espionage Act could help prevent individuals acting on behalf of a foreign power from concealing their links with that country. It said an obligation similar to that in the US - where agents are required to register with the Justice department - would ""clearly be valuable in countering Russian influence in the UK"". ISC member Kevan Jones said he was concerned that the Law Commission, which was asked last year to look at the legal issues regarding such a move, had yet to release its findings. ""Can I urge the minister to make sure we actually gets this legislation in place because it is needed,"" he said. ""Let's hope it is not just some spin to get the headlines."" Downing Street was accused of holding back the ISC report ahead of December's UK election and for delaying its nominations to set up the new committee - both claims it has denied. Its chair Julian Lewis, who was stripped of the Conservative whip after defying No 10 by standing for its leadership, sought reassurances that Downing Street special advisers would not be able to interfere with its work PANORAMA:Lifting the lockdown in Salford I MAY DESTROY YOU:The groundbreaking drama making headlines in lockdown 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Million spent on M4 road homes weeks before axeFigures reveal 14 properties bought by ministers for the axed M4 relief road remain vacant.Wales politics,"The M4 Relief Road was designed to replace the stretch of motorway in Newport A million pounds of taxpayers' cash was spent on two properties affected by the M4 relief road route just weeks before the scheme was axed. Since 1995 more than Â£15m has been spent on the compulsory purchase of 29 properties affected by the scheme to relieve congestion around Newport. Fourteen remain vacant. One house was bought 13 days before Welsh ministers decided the scheme was too costly. The Welsh Government said many will be sold when market conditions are right. It said it is require by law to purchase properties that meet certain criteria - which both properties did. Two houses in the Coedkernew district of south west Newport were bought by the Welsh Government in April 2019. The first purchase, for Â£575,000, was made on 9 April, while the second, for Â£462,162, was bought on 16 April, according to the Land Registry. On 29 April, the Welsh Government cabinet decided in a meeting that the cost of the road project was not acceptable. What is it like to live near the M4? Prime minister has 'no say' on the M4 relief road Is there One Direction for Â£1.4bn road? No announcement was made until 4 June - about two months after the purchase - when First Minister Mark Drakeford revealed that the scheme would be axed on cost and environmental grounds. The Welsh Conservatives said it suggested a ""shambolic decision-making process within the heart of the Welsh Government"". Russell George, the party's economy spokesman, said: ""The Welsh Labour-run Government has, once again, expected the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the vast sums of money spent on a project it later sank."" The M4 Relief Road was designed to reduce congestion around the Brynglas tunnels In response to a Welsh Conservative Freedom of Information request, the Welsh Government said: ""We are unable to tenant some properties due to their current condition, however where possible, these properties will be brought up to standard and advertised for rent this financial year."" Seven of the 29 properties bought over the last 25 years have been sold for around Â£2.1m and eight have been rented out so far. Six of the 29 properties were purchased prior to devolution in 1999. Mr George said millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been ""frittered away, and worse still there is nothing to show for it"". A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Many of these are assets with value that will be disposed of when market conditions are right. ""Land and buildings purchased before devolution would have been under the authority of the Wales Office as part of the UK government."" The Welsh Government later added: ""The purchase of properties is guided by legislation. We are bound to acquire properties that meet the relevant criteria and at both the point of application and point of purchase, the two properties referred to fulfilled the criteria.""

"Paint, wallpaper and compost sales soar in lockdown","Sales of paint, wallpaper, plants and compost have soared during lockdown, the owner of B&Q and Screwfix has said. Kingfisher said people had been doing more DIY than usual, as like-for-like sales jumped by 21.6% in the three months to 18 July. Store re-openings also boosted revenue, while online sales more than tripled. Kingfisher's UK stores, as well as those in France, were closed in mid-March due to lockdown measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. Although B&Q's UK stores only started reopening in late April, online sales continued to see a huge increase, it said. The retailer made click-and-collect and home delivery options available and the group saw online sales surge more than 200% in both May and June. DPD and B&Q owner to hire 7,500 as demand surges DIY spending splurge helps May sales recover According to the Office for National Statistics,external, retail sales across the UK partly recovered in May driven by DIY stores and garden centres reopening. Sales were boosted by a 42% rise at household goods stores, such as hardware, furniture and paint shops, it said. Kingfisher said that good weather had also helped demand - in addition to people having more time to spend on DIY improvements while they spent more time at home. In June,the group saidit would recruit 3,000 to 4,000 more workers to meet the rising demand, about half of them in the UK. Kingfisher boss Thierry Garnier said the firm's new recruits would be ""temporary"" during the summer, depending on what happened to demand after coronavirus measures were eased. The DIY group is one of the few large retailers to add to its workforce instead of cutting jobs amid the pandemic. DIY is one area that has done well during lockdown. Other businesses that have seen buoyant sales include supermarkets and online-only fashion stores. Sainsbury's, for example, saw grocery sales up 10.5% during the lockdown, fuelled by online orders.Online fashion firm Asos also reportedan increase in group sales of 10% to Â£1bn in the four months to 30 June. Despite Kingfisher's strong performance, the group said in a statement on Wednesday that it would not give guidance for the second half of the year due to ""uncertainty around Covid-19 and the wider economic outlook"". It also said its sales over the six months to 18 July were down 3.7% compared with the same period last year.

The photo that started a search for my slave roots," By Malik Al Nasir, as told to Ed Thomas By Malik Al Nasir, as told to Ed Thomas Malik al Nasir Malik al Nasir It started with a photograph from the 19th Century of a man who could have been my double. It was one o’clock in the morning and I was watching a TV documentary about 100 years of black footballers. This was 2002, and there weren’t many programmes about black people, so it was worth staying up for. Then a face appeared that made me catch my breath. A Victorian footballer. He looked comfortable, he didn’t look out of place, he looked like a boss. Very much a black British gentleman. Andrew Watson (centre, standing), 19th Century Scottish footballer Andrew Watson (centre, standing), 19th Century Scottish footballer His name was Andrew Watson - the same surname as my Dad. And he was from Demerara in Guyana, just like my Dad. [Malik changed his name from Mark Watson after converting to Islam]. There was another image of him in the documentary, but this time as a young boy at a grammar school in Halifax. Above my Mum’s TV set was a picture of me at about the same age - we were identical. Andrew Watson as a schoolboy Andrew Watson as a schoolboy Minutes later, the phone rang. It was my Mum. She said, “Turn on the BBC.” I said, “Mum, I’m already watching it.” “He looks just like you,” she said. Watson was born in 1856 in Demerara. He came from money, he was well-educated at private schools and at university in Glasgow, Liverpool and London. He was a significant footballer in the 19th Century. In the 1880s he played for Queens Park, winning three Scottish cups. At the time they were one of the biggest clubs in the world. He also played three games for Scotland at international level. He was described as an inspiration, captaining the national side during their 6-1 win over England. We looked identical. But Andrew Watson’s life was very different to mine. Warning: This chapter contains racial slurs The first time I was racially abused was in school. It was 1972. I was six years old and sitting in school assembly. The head teacher was playing a taped story called The Story of Little Black Sambo. I could hear every offensive line booming out at the morning assembly. Other kids were laughing, giggling and pointing at me. It made me feel like I didn’t belong, that there was something wrong with me. But we were told not to take offence because it was the teachers who were playing it. In England in the 70s it was normal to see books with titles like Ten Little Nigger Boys or The Proud Golliwog. Nobody seemed to think this was a problem. 1968: Malik Al Nasir aged two 1968: Malik Al Nasir aged two I was already living in a poor neighbourhood, but I was also dealing with racism - in the classroom, from friends, on the TV in my house. I had to fight most days in school. I was attacked on a daily basis, in and out of school but it was always me who had to see the head teacher for punishment. I was considered the troublemaker for being bullied by the kids the teachers were egging on. And life was about to get a lot worse. My Dad had a stroke, it was Christmas 1974. He was paralysed and stayed in hospital until he died. My Mum, a white woman, was now a single parent with four black kids. She couldn’t cope with living in a poor white area at a time of heightened racial tension. She was a target of a lot of hostility. She was a very strong woman but even she was powerless against this toxic background. I was expelled from school at the age of nine and taken into care. Malik aged nine Malik aged nine I remember everything about that first night, as if it was now. It was the most traumatic event of my life. I was stripped, washed and placed in a locked room. I spent 14 days in isolation there, in solitary confinement. I remember the bars on the windows, nobody spoke to me, food was pushed through a hole in the door like a prison. I still remember banging on the windows, screaming and begging to be let out. It was called the Liverpool Children’s Admission Unit. It was on Acrefield Road in Woolton. Thank God it’s been knocked down now. It was a dilapidated old Victorian mansion, run by a man who looked like Gomez from The Addams Family. He had a mynah bird in the office, a big black thing that used to talk. The place was always musty, stinking of damp. Plaster was falling off the walls and in the communal lounge there was a huge block that had fallen off - the hole was so big, kids could fit inside. I was moved from one children’s home to another, suffering physical abuse and racism. In many of the homes, staff would beat us, but nothing was done because the reports to social workers were written by the people beating us. One home in Warrington had a farm, so we had to dig foot-deep trenches a  couple of hundred metres in length, and plant potatoes. The social workers would sell them to the public. It was forced labour. I missed 18 months of primary education and had less than two years in secondary school. I also spent time in an approved school in Manchester, which was brutal - I had a tooth knocked out and I was stabbed. I left the care system in 1984 at the age of 18, semi-literate, and was placed in a hostel for homeless black youths. I had no qualifications to get a job, no social structures to support me, not a penny to my name. I was on my own on the streets, at a time of racial tensions. The Toxteth riots were only a recent memory. The Toxteth riots, July 1981 The Toxteth riots, July 1981 I was totally lost – I did not know who I was, where I belonged, or what would become of me. But that year, things started to change. Gil Scott-Heron, singer, poet and civil rights activist, writer of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised and I Think I'll Call It Morning, was playing in Liverpool. I sneaked into a gig he was playing at the Royal Court Theatre. Gil Scott-Heron on stage at Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool (photographer: Penny Potter) Gil Scott-Heron on stage at Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool (photographer: Penny Potter) The atmosphere was something else - it was electric, and Gil was in perfect unison with his audience. Afterwards I made my way backstage, and we got talking. We never stopped. Gil became my mentor. It completely changed my life. Malik with the singer and poet Gil Scott-Heron Malik with the singer and poet Gil Scott-Heron Whenever he was in the UK, I’d be on tour with him. I learned to set up the drums. I did the laundry, the merchandise, anything. But more than that, Gil inspired me to write poetry, and this allowed me to heal and confront my past. But what was my history? All I knew was that I was probably descended from a slave. I knew about the Vikings, the Romans, World Wars One and Two, the Empire. But the black figures were savages or else they were Uncle Ben on the rice packets or the gollywog on the marmalade jar. Andrew Watson, illustrated in the Scottish Athletics Journal Andrew Watson, illustrated in the Scottish Athletics Journal Andrew Watson was the first historical black role model I could be proud of. I wanted to know about his life. I dug deeper and started two family trees - one for me and one for him. Andrew Watson’s marriage certificate named his father as Peter Miller Watson. Peter’s job title was “sugar planter”. He was born to a prosperous family in northern Scotland in 1805. By the 1830s he owned, and was running, sugar plantations in Demerara. Andrew Watson's marriage certificate names his father as ""Peter Miller Watson, sugar planter (deceased)"" Andrew Watson's marriage certificate names his father as ""Peter Miller Watson, sugar planter (deceased)"" Peter Miller Watson’s mother, Christian Robertson Watson (1780-1842), was one of three sisters apparently known as the “three fair maids of Kiltearn”, a parish just north of Inverness. The eldest was Ann Robertson, who married Charles Stewart Parker. He was based in Glasgow, involved in insurance and shipbuilding, and he owned sugar plantations in Grenada. The youngest sister was Elizabeth Robertson who married a man from Cheshire called Samuel Sandbach. He dominated a company called Sandbach Tinne & Co, described at the time as trading “sugar, coffee, molasses, rum and prime gold coast negros”. A picture was emerging of families inter-marrying, with shared business interests in a slave-owning dynasty that lasted for generations, accumulating staggering amounts of money. At this point all I knew was that I looked similar to Andrew Watson. Our ancestors were born in the same country and we shared the same surname. But if we were related, did that mean that I was also descended from slave owners? My instinct said I was, but still it was an uncomfortable prospect. I remembered how my Dad once said to me, “One day I’m going to take you back to the sugar cane.” It never happened because he died when I was 13. It was time to go back to where my Dad had come from. In 2008 I headed for the South American country of Guyana, armed only with the name of a village - Weldaad - and the knowledge that my Dad, Reginald Wilcox Watson, had once lived there. I had no idea of what would unfold, but it felt like going home. Stepping foot on Guyanese soil at Cheddi Jagan Airport wasn’t like arriving at Heathrow. The airport was small and austere. Outside there were palm trees. The area had been carved out of a tropical rainforest. Malik arriving in Guyana, 2008 Malik arriving in Guyana, 2008 The first stop was Georgetown, to scan the national archives. Despite this being the capital, there were no high-rise buildings, and the older buildings were made out of timber. It didn’t take long to track down the information I needed. I couldn't find any marriage record, but the electoral roll confirmed there was a Peter Miller Watson in Guyana, who was eligible to vote because of his ownership of two sugar plantations -  Le’ Bonne Intention and Plantation Zeebrugge. His date of birth matched that of the sugar planter named in Andrew Watson’s marriage certificate - proof that the father of one of the world’s first black footballers owned plantations and slaves, and that he had a relationship with a black woman. It was time to head to the tiny village of Weldaad, along the coast from Georgetown. What should have been a straight 90-minute drive took three hours, as the car bounced around on bumpy roads, held up by donkeys, cows and goats - all this in oppressive humidity. But Weldaad was beautiful - the lushest of vegetation, 60ft high coconut palms, green undergrowth and fruit trees. Poking out between it all were telephone poles, the only thing that looked modern in the whole town. It was like stepping back in time. In Liverpool I was used to seeing flocks of seagulls but this place hummed to the noise of parakeets and macaws of blue and green with big long tails. The road to Weldaad The road to Weldaad The rainforest had been cut back to make way for cane fields and rice paddies with canals everywhere. They'd been built by slaves under Dutch colonists 200 years ago, to move goods around the fields to the processing plants - a tropical version of Holland. Cows were wandering freely around the coconut palms and timber frame houses. It struck me that whatever riches were gathered from these fields, none of it trickled down to the people remaining today. Weldaad was such a rural area and everyone was so kind to me, more than happy to help. The local people talked about a man long dead called Teacher Watson, who lived in the next village. Could that have been my grandfather? Yes, it was just a surname but it was all I had to grab onto. There was a man in the village called Mr White, who studied family history. Frustratingly he had never heard of any Watsons, but by a twist of fate, the day after talking to me, he heard two old ladies talking in a bank, one of whom mentioned that her maiden name was Watson. Mr White introduced himself and took her number to give to the “man from England looking for his family”. The lady lived in a timber house raised on stilts to protect it from the floods. It was evening by the time I was outside her home. At the top of the steep wooden steps, the door opened and I was greeted by a smiling old lady. Her name was Withyeline, she was 82 years old, and on the wall above her was a picture that was the spitting image of my father. “Reg Watson?” I asked. “Yes,” she replied. Did I have a sister twice my age? My heart was racing. “Reginald Wilcox Watson?” I asked again. She paused and said “No, that’s Reginald Daniel William Watson. Your father is my Uncle Reg.” I was confused but then it hit me - our fathers were half-brothers and both called Reg! So Withyeline was my first cousin. She told me she’d lived with my father before he left Guyana in the 1930s. Withyeline, Malik's cousin in Guyana Withyeline, Malik's cousin in Guyana We shared a grandfather, George Edward Watson. Withyeline confirmed that this was indeed Teacher Watson. He was an educated man, a schoolmaster who also taught my father to read and write. She revealed that my father was meant to inherit land, but because he’d left for England he never got his share. I wanted to know more about the land. Was it a connection to Andrew Watson? The next day I went back to the land registry, and looked at maps with plots carved out. The Watson family land, where Withyeline was now living, was in what was once called the Woodlands plantation, just north of the region's main sugar refinery. Frustratingly there was no clear connection between this plantation and Peter Miller Watson. But why did my side of the Watson family inherit acres and acres of plantation land? After five days of searching, it was time to head back to Liverpool. I had found family members. I knew the exact land where my ancestors lived, and confirmed the name of Andrew Watson’s father but there was still so much more I needed to know. It would be 10 years before I found the next clue. On eBay I spotted a collection of ephemera for sale - handwritten letters with wax seals and postmarks. Stamp dealers collect these items for their rare postmarks. There was little clue in the listing to what was in the letters, but the seller described them as 19th Century correspondence detailing the sugar and slave trade, specifically addressed to and from Liverpool, Demerara and Glasgow. Money was tight but I took a chance, and paid thousands of pounds for all of them. It was a gamble that paid off. There were more than 100 letters, mostly covering the mercantile slave-owner dynasty that began with Peter Miller Watson’s grandfather, George Robertson, in Grenada in the 1790s. George's partners were Samuel Sandbach and Charles Stuart Parker, Watson’s uncles by marriage. They moved operations from Grenada in 1795 after a slave revolt, and relocated in the Demerara region of Guyana. In 1813, the major trading arm of this family enterprise took on a Dutch partner, Phillip Frederick Tinne, and it became known as Sandbach Tinne. The papers were the complete accounts, profit and loss as well as balance sheets of the entire operation from 1808-1880. They detailed the names of the company’s plantations, the number of acres, the insurance, the fleet of cargo ships built and insured, and where the cargo was transported. It also confirmed that the company owned the plantations - and slaves - where my family lived in Guyana. I was shocked. The correspondence provided extensive written evidence of the company’s slave-trading operations, the numbers of slaves owned and the massive amount of money this operation brought in. The archive was a gold mine, but it was overwhelming too, looking at this dark sinister past, filled with centuries of suffering endured by black people. I was also trying to comprehend the fact that I too might be related to the exploiters, the slave owners. Here it was documented that Samuel Sandbach joined the company in Grenada as a low-level clerk, and moved to Demerara when the company relocated in 1796. Having married into the Robertson family, Sandbach became a full partner and rose to take over the whole enterprise. He went on to become one of the biggest slave owners and most important mercantile figures in the UK. A document dated 31 August 1822 details the “negro account” for the buying and selling of slaves. It shows that Sandbach Tinne had lost £6,000 - apparently because of the death of company slaves.  At that time, an epidemic was ravaging Demerara and the surrounding areas, and it was the most vulnerable - the slaves - who were dying. The documents reveal that in 1822 a fever or illness spread in what was then British Guiana, wiping out 5% of Georgetown’s population. A letter describes death everywhere: The slaves may have been dying, but the writer's chief worry is the almost complete collapse of production on the plantation, and how profits are down nearly 75%: The conditions of the slaves were outlined by a missionary, Reverend John Smith, who visited Demerara in 1823. He describes them being overworked to absolute exhaustion, up to 20 hours a day on the plantations. Some, he says, were not permitted to sleep, but had to cut sugar cane through the night. Looking back at my archive now, I try not to think about how the slaves must have suffered. It traumatises me to think about those who died. Black men, women and children were categorised as profit and loss, along with animals. In reality the horses would have been treated with more respect. The archive also provided the link I had been looking for. It showed that the Woodlands plantation, where my family lived, was owned by Sandbach Tinne, and that from the 1830s onwards - like all their plantations - it was managed by Peter Miller Watson. And this was the land inherited by Withyeline, and the rest of my family. Everything pointed in the same direction - I was related in some way to Andrew Watson. There were Watsons still on the land, modern-day Watsons, family members related to me. I felt a massive sense of validation - from starting off with just a picture of Andrew Watson and the family name, my instincts had been proved right. It gave me a sense of pride, in who I am and where I am from. I had a valid identity. At first this felt great - I was connected to an icon of black history. But through him, I was also linked to a dark chapter of Britain's colonial past and the slave trade. The discovery was bitter-sweet. 18th Century illustration of slaves arriving in Latin America 18th Century illustration of slaves arriving in Latin America My ancestors were owned by slave masters. After years of brutality, their descendants inherited small pieces of their land and their name. So many questions remain to be answered. I want to return to Demerara and find the birth certificate of my grandfather, George Edward Watson. It may well link him to Peter Miller Watson, or maybe one of his brothers, Henry or William, who were also in Demerara running the plantations. I also remember something Withyeline said. “The three white Scottish brothers - you’re related to them.” My journey was bringing me full circle. The wealth generated from the enslavement of my ancestors was brought by Samuel Sandbach to Liverpool - the city where I grew up and where I was always made to feel an outsider. Sandbach rose to become what would now be known as a CEO for Sandbach Tinne & Co. He was one of the most visible partners, the largest joint shareholder of all of their operations in Demerara, Glasgow and Liverpool. Off the back of thousands of slaves, numerous plantations and a fleet of ships, this son of a Cheshire farmer acquired a staggering amount of wealth. In Liverpool Sandbach became a man of incredible influence. He was appointed the city’s mayor in 1831 - one of the most important people in one of the most important cities in the British Empire.  From slaves, cotton and coffee, to sugar, rum and molasses, it all went through Liverpool. A memorial to Samuel Sandbach and his wife Elizabeth at the family mausoleum in Llangernyw A memorial to Samuel Sandbach and his wife Elizabeth at the family mausoleum in Llangernyw He retired from Sandbach Tinne in 1833, passing on his shares in the company to his two sons. He was leaving the business he helped build in the same year as the Abolition of Slavery Act. Under the terms of the act, £20m was paid out by the British government to slave owners in return for freeing their slaves (in fact this money, borrowed by the government, was not completely paid off until 2015). Sandbach was a member of the West Indian Association of Liverpool, a group which lobbied to receive compensation for the loss of their slaves. The association presented a silver salver to John Gladstone, MP, slave owner and father of the future prime minister, William Gladstone . It was recognition of Gladstone’s role in negotiating generous terms with Parliament on their behalf. The inscription on the salver reads: “Presented to John Gladstone, Esquire, by the West India Association of Liverpool in testimony of the high sense they entertain of the value of his services so actively and beneficially employed in setting the conditions of the emancipation of the slaves in the West India colonies” Silver salver presented to John Gladstone by the  West Indian Association of Liverpool Silver salver presented to John Gladstone by the  West Indian Association of Liverpool Incidentally, John Gladstone's second wife, Ann McKenzie Robertson, was also a cousin of Samuel Sandbach's wife Elizabeth Robertson. The end of slavery did nothing to dent Sandbach’s fortune or reputation. He allowed his mansion to be used as accommodation for high court judges arriving from London to hear cases in the city. By the mid-1840s Sandbach had acquired a significant stake in the recently founded Bank of Liverpool, becoming its deputy chairman, and overseeing the vast wealth he had built up. The Bank of Liverpool grew and grew. Eventually it bought Martins Bank in London in 1918, and took its name in 1928. By now it had hundreds of branches across the UK, quite a rise for a bank started by slave owners just decades before. In 1969 Barclays Bank took over Martins Bank, by now the sixth largest clearing bank in the UK. The role people like Samuel Sandbach played in its growth is now long forgotten, but it shouldn’t be. His legacy is still evident today. I see it all around Liverpool, in buildings built with money from the blood of my ancestors. When I walk past the former Martins Bank Building on Water Street in the city centre, I see the opulence of the British Empire. It amazes me that it was the local Barclays HQ until 2009. Martins Bank Building in Liverpool Martins Bank Building in Liverpool In the doorway, in sculpted stone panels, is King Neptune, lord of the waves, holding two young African slave boys. It’s a nod to the shipping lines and the exploited who formed the basis of the bank’s wealth. Above them is the grasshopper, the symbol of Martins Bank and to the side, the Liver bird, symbol of the Bank of Liverpool. The hierarchy is not lost on me - the slaves at the bottom, in the middle the sea, the slave routes and the money at the top. The chances are I am related to the slave owners and the slaves, just like the man who helped start this journey for me, Andrew Watson. It's my belief that his mother was a free black woman, possibly the daughter of one of Peter Miller Watson's business colleagues in Demerara. There were such black women in Guyana who were wealthy in their own right, usually the children of white merchants. But many more women in Demerara did not have a choice about having sex with the men working for Sandbach Tinne, any more than they had a choice about working on the plantation, or being shipped from West Africa. But the story of the slaves in Demerara isn’t over yet, and it won’t be until there has been restorative justice. Slave owners were compensated after slavery was abolished in Britain in 1834. They were paid an estimated £17bn in today's money. The slaves got nothing. That wealth flowed into British society. Sandbach Tinne existed as a company until the 1970s. Samuel Sandbach was a founding shareholder in the Bank of Liverpool, which went on to become part of Barclays Bank. Letter from Malik's archive addressed to Sandbach Tinne, Liverpool Letter from Malik's archive addressed to Sandbach Tinne, Liverpool Last year Glasgow University announced it would pay £20m in reparations to atone for its historical links to the slave trade. The pub chain and brewer Greene King has said it too will be paying reparations in some form, along with the insurance market, Lloyds of London. Caricom, the body representing 15 Caribbean nations, has called for meaningful reparations for the transatlantic slave trade. It’s a call that’s not going to go away. (A Barclays spokesperson told the BBC, “The history of Barclays, like other institutions, is being examined following recent events. We can’t change what’s gone before us, only how we go forward. We are committed as a bank to do more to further foster our culture of inclusiveness, equality and diversity, for our colleagues, and the customers and clients we serve.”) As for me, the journey that has taken me from Liverpool to Guyana and back again, will soon take me to the University of Cambridge. The boy who left school - and care - without qualifications will soon be studying for a PhD, researching Sandbach Tinne and the role it played in the slave trade. It started out as a family tree, but became a way of reasserting my dignity and my cultural identity. My archive details the workings of one company, but this was just one part of a crime against humanity, which involved the exploitation of millions of people. It’s important that nobody forgets that. This is a moment to understand what happened during the slave trade. Why were the slave owners allowed to treat my ancestors with such depravity, as less than human? There needs to be recognition and accountability. Organisations whose wealth originally derived from the barbaric trade in human flesh should be held accountable. There should  be meaningful restitution for past wrongs - not just a public relations exercise. Nearly 200 years have passed but the oppression is still here today. Racism is very much alive - just ask George Floyd’s family. So how can we heal? If we don’t look into our past we cannot understand today. As Gil Scott-Heron once said to me, “If you don’t know where you come from, you won’t know where you are going. You have to study your history.” This is mine.  "
Met will enforce face masks 'as last resort',"Officers will only attend incidents where people not wearing a mask refuse to leave a shop or become ""aggressive,"" Police in London will only enforce the wearing of masks in shops ""as a last resort"", the Met Commissioner has said. Dame Cressida Dick said she hoped shoppers who refused to wear masks would be ""shamed"" into compliance. Officers will attend if people not wearing a mask refuse to leave a shop or become ""aggressive,"" Dame Cressida said. Thames Valley and Devon and Cornwall police forces say officers will attend incidents only if they turn violent. But Dame Cressida said if shop keepers were concerned and had ""tried everything else"", her officers would try to assist. She told LBC Radio: ""Calling the police should be a last resort for dealing with a mask issue. But of course the law is the law. ""My hope is that the vast majority of people will comply and that people who are not complying will be shamed into complying or shamed to leave the store by the store keepers or by other members of the public. ""If somebody is concerned about what is going on in their store, yes, of course they should call the police and we will try to assist."" Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory this week Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to Â£100, the government has announced. Dame Cressida said supermarkets had managed to maintain social distancing and queuing themselves and had only rarely needed to call the police. The move will bring England into line with Scotland and nations such as Spain, Italy and Germany. Since mid-May, members of the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet.

She warns that while the painful memories of the last great financial crisis had faded, the true extent of a new and graver threat to thousands of businesses was emerging. ""There are clearly tough times ahead. Not all businesses will survive and there are going to be losses,"" she said. We got a glimpse of the potential scale of the losses earlier this year when the then-RBS reported a nine-fold (833%) increase in the amount of money it set aside for bad loans compared to the same period a year ago. Bad loans are loans which are unlikely to be paid back. New accounting standards require companies to make their best guess of future bad loans - so RBS's best guess in the first quarter of this year was that bad loans would explode. We will get an update on their view next week. Read more here.

Ray Mwasaru ended up in an induced coma at Lister Hospital in Stevenage, where doctors told his wife he might only have hours left to live. Eventually the mental health nurse made a good recovery and wasclapped as he was moved out of intensive care. Speaking at home in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire, he said: ""I believe by next week I should be up and running around. I'll be fit as a fiddle."" Jack Goodman and Shayan SardarizadehBBC Anti-disinformation team Twitter has announced itâs banning thousands of accounts promoting QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that believes President Trump is battling a âdeep stateâ of global elites involved in child trafficking. Accounts linked to QAnon have also promoted misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic on Twitter, and other social media platforms, amplifying misleading content about Covid-19, particularly related to face coverings and vaccines. In April, QAnon accounts helped make a fake story claiming that an early participant of a UK vaccine trial had died go viral. Last month, a video uploaded by a well-known QAnon influencer which called the pandemic a âdeep state hoaxâ manufactured by the Democratic Party to hamper President Trumpâs re-election chances racked up millions of views. Misleading memes making claims about the health risks of face masks and the dangers of a âBill Gates-funded vaccineâ are widely-shared in QAnon-themed Facebook groups and quickly find their way onto Twitter, Reddit and TikTok.

US passengers, wearing blue ponchos, are packed together on a ferry boat which is allowing 50% of its normal capacity Photos of tour boats operating at Niagara Falls, which sits on the US-Canada border, have illustrated the starkly different social distancing policies between the two countries. Ferries operated from the Canadian side of the border, which normally can carry 700 tourists at a time, are only allowing six passengers per boat. The US ferries are operating at 50% capacity, meaning customers are still crowded rather closely together as they strain to get a good view of the massive waterfalls. âWe actually took a picture of the [American] boat,â Julie Pronovost, a  visitor from Quebec, told Reuters on Tuesday. âI donât find that itâs very safe to be on a boat like that. Itâs much better here.â The US coronavirus outbreak is far worse than Canada's. On Tuesday, the US reported 57,777 new Covid-19 cases, compared with 786 in Canada. Canadian customers wearing red ponchos are treated to a VIP experience with the boat all to themselves BBC OS This video can not be played Petrus Bosman says coronavirus restrictions mean the future is uncertain This empty table is being used to highlight the impact of coronavirus restrictions in South Africa, as part of a day of action to raise awareness of jobs lost in the tourist, hospitality and wine industries. Itâs 200 metres long and it was laid in Wellington, a small town outside Cape Town, next to a vineyard run by Petrus Bosman. âThe alcohol ban has not only affected our local wine sales in restaurants and retailers negatively, but the whole wine and tourism industry,âhe told BBC OS. Last week, South Africa introduced its second alcohol ban of the year and a night-time curfew to reduce the pressure on its healthcare system. Petrus, however, was not impressed with the renewed restrictions. âWe just feel that government could have consulted and worked in a more collaborative manner,"" said Petrus. ""The future is uncertain and so are the dreams we have as a community."" A man scans a restaurant menu in Miami There were 9,785 new infections recorded on Wednesday in Florida, according to health officials, raising the total number of coronavirus cases to 379,619. There were an additional 139 deaths on Wednesday. The state has now recorded 5,345 deaths of residents, and over 100 deaths of non-residents. According to the data, 47% of all deaths have occurred in long-term and elderly care homes. Florida has the third highest level of infections out of any US state, coming behind California and New York. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that researchers are making good progress on developing a coronavirus vaccine, but their first use cannot be expected until early 2021. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme told reporters that it was vital to ""not cut corners on safety"", even if this meant slowing the vaccine's development. ""We have to be able to look ourselves in the eyes, and we have to be able to look at our communities and ensure them that we have taken every precaution to make sure that these vaccines are safe and effective before we go giving them to general populations,"" said Dr Ryan. ""In order to make that happen, we can shorten that time, but realistically, it is going to be the first part of next year before we start seeing people vaccinated."" He added that several potential vaccines were in phase 3 trials and none had failed in terms of safety or their ability to generate an immune response. Maria McCannBBC News Northern Ireland A new Â£10.5m scheme to support the childcare sector in Northern Ireland will open for applications on Monday. The Department of Education said the financial package would ensure as many providers as possible can reopen or remain open following the lockdown. The Childcare Recovery Support scheme will be available for day care settings, playgroups and childminders. An earlier support package set up by Stormont was scrapped following criticism for how it was implemented. The new scheme will operate until 31 August and will be backdated to 1 July. Read more here. There have been nearly 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and more than 45,500 people have died, government figures show. Take a look at these three charts and read morehereto find out the key figures of the pandemic in the UK.  Catherine ByaruhangaBBC News, Kampala Madagascar hospitals warn they are 'overwhelmed' with cases Madagascar has reported another record day with 614 infections. At one government hospital in
Antananarivo, the director says they are already treating 46 patients and only
have space for four more. Another administrator at a different
facility said they were constantly overwhelmed. The World Health
Organisation representative in Madagascar has warned that hospitals are
saturated even before the peak of the pandemic in the country is reached. There are over 7,500 coronavirus
cases in Madagascar nearly 80% of them were diagnosed in the past month. With
the spike in positive results, the government reinstated a strict lockdown of
the capital and surrounding areas. On Monday, the Minister for Health
wrote to development partners asking for equipment like testing kits,
respirators and protective equipment for health workers. But thereâs been push
back from the governmentâs spokesperson who said it was not the ministerâs
place to make such a request. There is a lot of promising news on vaccine research this week.Oxford University announced first resultsbut itâs only one of around two dozen vaccines being tested on people in clinical trials - and there are around 140 others in development around the world. Some of you have sent in questions around what a future vaccine can and can not do. Click here to read our health editor Michelle Roberts answering all those questions and more. Some eight million children in England were sent home from school in March New research has found more than half of British children struggled to continue learning at home while schools were shut during the lockdown. Of the 52% who struggled, three-quarters of parents gave a lack of motivation as a reason, the Office for National Statistics research found. It also showed wide disparities in what families were able to do. Schools closed for most pupils at the end of March in England, Wales and Scotland, as the pandemic took hold. Some schools re-opened in England on or around 1 June for some year groups. The ONS researchers assessed surveys of more than 12,000 people in Great Britain between 3 April and 7 June about their experiences of home-schooling during the coronavirus pandemic.There's more on the findings here. Surfers in Los Angeles don masks After reopening on 4 July, England's restaurants have had to introduce strict hygiene and social distancing measures to protect staff and customers from coronavirus. But one restaurant in Buxton, Derbyshire, has taken its  responsibilities to an entirely new level - by introducing mannequins to help keep their customers socially distanced while dining. The smartly-dressed dummies are positioned at tables in La Brasserie De La Cour restaurant; with the owner, Thierry Le Port, saying they would stop people from sitting too close to others while also avoiding big, empty spaces. He added they also helped to create a ""good atmosphere"" with some diners not even realising they were mannequins at first. Customers of the French restaurant have described the mannequins as ""slightly creepy"" but effective. You can read morehere. Presidential candidate Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama - Biden's boss when he was vice-president for eight years - have sat down for their first in-person meeting of the 2020 election year. A one-minute clip teasing their interview, which will be released tomorrow, show them arriving at Obama's office in Washington DC wearing face masks and criticising Trump's handling of the pandemic. ""Can you imagine standing up when you were president and saying, âIt's not my responsibility',"" Biden says, quoting Trump in March when he was asked about testing delays. ""Those words didn't come out of our mouths when we were in office,"" Obama responds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Spanish Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto has said a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Catalonia was coming under control, and that she hoped there would be no need for neighbouring France to close its border. âWith the latest data we have in Aragon and Catalonia we are a bit more optimistic. Catalonia has already reduced the number of infections over the last three days,â said Ms Maroto. âLetâs hope that with these better data we donât have to close a border that for us is very important for mobility with our European partners.â The northeastern Spanish region has logged more than 7,000 new cases of Covid-19 over the last weeks - nearly half of the national total - although its infection rate has dropped in the recent days. Catalan leader Quim Torra has ruled out a return to lockdown, telling the regional parliament that ""Catalonia can't be closed."" But elsewhere, in Madrid the regional government said it might make face masks compulsory - even in situations where social distancing can be guaranteed - unless the national government imposed safety controls on people flying in to the capita's Barajas airport. Madrid and the Canary Islands are the only regions of Spain without such strict face mask rules in place.

US orders China to close Houston consulateUnidentified people were filmed burning paper in the consulate's courtyard after the order was made.,"This video can not be played Men are filmed using a hose and closing rubbish bins at China's consulate in Houston The US has ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, by Friday - a move described as ""political provocation"" by Beijing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the decision was taken because China was ""stealing"" intellectual property. China's foreign ministry condemned the move,externalon Twitter, saying its embassy in Washington had received death threats. Earlier, unidentified individuals were filmed burning paper in bins in the Houston building's courtyard. Tensions have been rising between the US and China for some time. President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as China's imposition of a controversial new security law on Hong Kong. Then on Tuesday,the US Department of Justice accused China of sponsoring hackers who had been targeting labs developing Covid-19 vaccines. Two Chinese nationals, who allegedly spied on US research companies and got help from state agents for other thefts, have been charged. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump said it was ""always possible"" he would order the closure of more Chinese consulates. Mr Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was stealing ""not just American intellectual property... but European intellectual property too... costing hundreds of thousands of jobs"". ""We are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave,"" he continued. ""And when they don't, we're going to take actions that protect the American people, protect our security, our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs."" The consulate is one of five in the US, not counting the embassy in Washington DC. It is unclear why this one was singled out. The US-China battle behind the scenes What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? FBI director: China is 'greatest threat' to US In a separate statement, the State Department accused China of engaging ""in massive illegal spying and influence operations"", interfering in ""domestic politics"" as well as having ""coerced our business leaders, threatened families of Chinese Americans residing in China, and more"". In a series of tweets, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying described the reasons given by the US for closing the consulate as ""unbelievably ridiculous"". She urged the US to reverse its ""erroneous decision"", or China would ""react with firm countermeasures"". This video can not be played Liu Xiaoming: China is not the enemy of the US ""While Chinese diplomats are promoting mutual understanding and friendship, the US embassy in China publicly attacks China's political system,"" she said. ""As a result of smears and hatred fanned up by the US government, the Chinese embassy has received bomb and death threats."" Chinese state media outletthe Global Times began running a poll,externalon which US consulate to close in response. Beijing officials said the US has far more staff at its missions in China than vice versa. The foreign ministry has posted a warning to Chinese students in the US, asking them to ""be on guard"" as ""US law enforcement agencies have stepped up arbitrary interrogations, harassment, confiscation of personal belongings and detention targeting Chinese international students in the US"". This is clearly a significant development in the diplomatic sparring between Washington and Beijing. The closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston comes soon after news emerged of the unsealing of a US indictment against two men accused of spying on US vaccine development on behalf of China's security services. It is not clear if the two episodes are linked. But it is clear that the Trump administration is determined to step up its very public calling out of Beijing. In the midst of a presidential re-election campaign and with the US economy and society battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Trump has determined that there is political advantage in playing the China card. It is hard to see how Beijing can avoid some equivalent response. The danger now is of a spiralling tit-for-tat battle, driven in part by US domestic considerations, which can only make the complex and developing tensions between the US and China even worse. The first signs something unusual may be happening at the Houston consulate emerged on Tuesday, when people overlooking the building's courtyard noticed several bins on fire. Footage shows people throwing what appears to be paper into the bins. It is not known who they were. People were later filmed appearing to pour water on the bins. Emergency services were called to the building on Tuesday evening. However, theHouston police force said on Twitter officers ""were not granted access to enter the building"",external, but did see smoke. Mr Wang did not directly address the fires in the consulate's courtyard, simply saying it was operating as normal. Meanwhile, China's consulate in San Francisco has also come under scrutiny after the FBI alleged that a Chinese researcher accused of visa fraud for hiding her affiliation with the military had taken refuge there. According to court documents filed this week, Juan Tang claimed she had not served in the Chinese military when trying to obtain a US visa, but an open source investigation uncovered photos of the University of California researcher wearing military uniform and a search of her home found further evidence of her affiliation with the People's Liberation Army. ""The FBI assesses that at some point following the search and interview of Tang on June 29, 2020, Tang went to the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, where the FBI assesses she has remained,"" readsthe court filing, first reported on by the Axios news site.,external China has not commented on the claims. There are a number of flashpoints between Beijing and Washington currently. Some of the most serious are: Coronavirus: President Trump has repeatedly referred to Covid-19, the first cases of which were reported in Wuhan in late 2019, as the ""China virus"". He has also alleged it originated from a Chinese laboratory, despite his own intelligence officers saying it ""was not manmade or genetically modified"". In response, Chinese officials have suggested that Covid-19 might have originated in the US, without evidence. Trade: Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft, but in Beijing there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. The US and China have engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war since 2018 as a result of the dispute. Hong Kong: China's imposition of a sweeping new national security law in Hong Kong in June led the US to revoke the region's preferential economic treatment. Mr Trump has also signed a law to impose sanctions on officials who cracked down on rights. Beijing has accused the US of ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs, promising it would retaliate.

Almost Â£1m spent on M4 road homes weeks before axe,"The M4 Relief Road was designed to replace the stretch of motorway in Newport A million pounds of taxpayers' cash was spent on two properties affected by the M4 relief road route just weeks before the scheme was axed. Since 1995 more than Â£15m has been spent on the compulsory purchase of 29 properties affected by the scheme to relieve congestion around Newport. Fourteen remain vacant. One house was bought 13 days before Welsh ministers decided the scheme was too costly. The Welsh Government said many will be sold when market conditions are right. It said it is require by law to purchase properties that meet certain criteria - which both properties did. Two houses in the Coedkernew district of south west Newport were bought by the Welsh Government in April 2019. The first purchase, for Â£575,000, was made on 9 April, while the second, for Â£462,162, was bought on 16 April, according to the Land Registry. On 29 April, the Welsh Government cabinet decided in a meeting that the cost of the road project was not acceptable. What is it like to live near the M4? Prime minister has 'no say' on the M4 relief road Is there One Direction for Â£1.4bn road? No announcement was made until 4 June - about two months after the purchase - when First Minister Mark Drakeford revealed that the scheme would be axed on cost and environmental grounds. The Welsh Conservatives said it suggested a ""shambolic decision-making process within the heart of the Welsh Government"". Russell George, the party's economy spokesman, said: ""The Welsh Labour-run Government has, once again, expected the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the vast sums of money spent on a project it later sank."" The M4 Relief Road was designed to reduce congestion around the Brynglas tunnels In response to a Welsh Conservative Freedom of Information request, the Welsh Government said: ""We are unable to tenant some properties due to their current condition, however where possible, these properties will be brought up to standard and advertised for rent this financial year."" Seven of the 29 properties bought over the last 25 years have been sold for around Â£2.1m and eight have been rented out so far. Six of the 29 properties were purchased prior to devolution in 1999. Mr George said millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been ""frittered away, and worse still there is nothing to show for it"". A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Many of these are assets with value that will be disposed of when market conditions are right. ""Land and buildings purchased before devolution would have been under the authority of the Wales Office as part of the UK government."" The Welsh Government later added: ""The purchase of properties is guided by legislation. We are bound to acquire properties that meet the relevant criteria and at both the point of application and point of purchase, the two properties referred to fulfilled the criteria.""

Breaking|Breaking newsImmunity rule changed in wake of Harry Dunn death,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The UK and the US have agreed to amend an ""anomaly"" that allowed Harry Dunn death suspect Anne Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity. Mrs Sacoolas - the wife of a diplomat at RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire - was able to leave the UKthanks to the ""secret agreement"". She has been accused of killing the 19-year-old in a crash near the base. Mr Dunn's mother said the change, which is not thought to be retroactive, was a ""huge step in the right direction"". Charlotte Charles told the BBC: ""We now need Dominic Raab to work with us to make sure that we get her back to the UK to face justice at some point soon."" This video can not be played 'I hope as a mum she will do the right thing' The foreign secretary has said relatives of US staff at the air base can face prosecution under the amended rules where they may have previously been immune. How the death of a teen became a transatlantic row Mr Raab said the new arrangements had ""closed the anomaly that led to the denial of justice in the heartbreaking case of Harry Dunn"". He said he appreciated the changes ""won't bring Harry back"" but hoped they may ""bring some small measure of comfort"" to his family. Under the amended rules, relatives of US staff at RAF Croughton can face prosecution Ms Charles vowed to continue the family's campaign to bring Mrs Sacoolas before a UK court. ""We always live with hope that one day she might just decide of her own accord to put herself on a plane and come back over here,"" she said. ""We definitely will keep the pressure up."" Timeline: Events after Harry Dunn crash death Make Harry Dunn 'top priority' at Pompeo visit US extradition refusal over Dunn crash 'final' Ms Charles said she wanted Mrs Sacoolas to ""see what her own country has agreed to with the anomaly they've now amended"". Northamptonshire Police said it understood the changes would not be retrospective but welcomed the move. Downing Street said the change meant ""in relation to the level of offence Anne Sacoolas is accused of, she could have been arrested by the police once they had obtained a warrant from the court"". Anne Sacoolas, the alleged killer of Harry Dunn, is never going to be extradited from the US because Washington is standing firm that she is entitled to diplomatic immunity. This claim of immunity was the product of a legal loophole that needed to be fixed - a loophole that nobody spotted until tragedy struck. Officials of foreign governments who are officially operating in another country have immunity from prosecution under long-standing international law. This legal principle of immunity has long been accepted by states as necessary to help foster good relations between them. But limits can be imposed by agreement. In the case of RAF Croughton, a deal between the two states allowed the potential prosecution of US staff for crimes committed beyond their duties - but their families had greater protections. In short, had a US official, rather than his or her spouse, been behind the wheel of the car that was involved in a crash, they may have had to face police questioning and potential criminal charge. This sad and bizarre legal mistake has now been corrected - and officials appear confident there are no other similar anomalies elsewhere that could stand in the way of justice. The US State Department said the amendment was a ""reflection of our especially close relationship"" with the UK. Northamptonshire Police said it would continue working with British prosecutors to ensure Mrs Sacoolas was returned from the US to face court proceedings. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said that Labour would ""push for a full inquiry"" into the case. She said: ""The foreign secretary has still not come to Parliament to explain how failings in his department allowed a US citizen to leave the country while their immunity was still in question."" Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton A Home Office extradition request was refused by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January, and American officials said thedecision was final. It is believed Mrs Sacoolas was driving on the wrong side of the road when Mr Dunn was killed. There have been reports of other vehicles spotted driving on the wrong side of the road near the base, including one which wasshown in a YouTube videoin February.

Many thanks for joining us today for our coverage of the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Today it has been brought to you by: Andreas Illmer, Anna Jones, Alice Cuddy, Krutika Pathi, Jay Savage, Thom Poole, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams, Josh Cheetham, Francesca Gillett, Mary O'Connor and Max Matza. As we wind down our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, here's a final round-up of the key headlines in the UK this Wednesday evening. Hello and thank you for following our coverage of the global pandemic, brought to you by our team of reporters in London and around the world. Here are some of the biggest global developments of the day: Simon JackBBC Business Editor Royal Bank of Scotland today loses its brand status and becomes part of NatWest Group plc The BBC has been speaking to Alison Rose, the head of the Royal Bank of Scotlandwhich has just renamed itself the NatWest Group. She warns that while the painful memories of the last great financial crisis had faded, the true extent of a new and graver threat to thousands of businesses was emerging. ""There are clearly tough times ahead. Not all businesses will survive and there are going to be losses,"" she said. We got a glimpse of the potential scale of the losses earlier this year when the then-RBS reported a nine-fold (833%) increase in the amount of money it set aside for bad loans compared to the same period a year ago. Bad loans are loans which are unlikely to be paid back. New accounting standards require companies to make their best guess of future bad loans - so RBS's best guess in the first quarter of this year was that bad loans would explode. We will get an update on their view next week. Read more here.

Ray Mwasaru ended up in an induced coma at Lister Hospital in Stevenage, where doctors told his wife he might only have hours left to live. Eventually the mental health nurse made a good recovery and wasclapped as he was moved out of intensive care. Speaking at home in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire, he said: ""I believe by next week I should be up and running around. I'll be fit as a fiddle."" Jack Goodman and Shayan SardarizadehBBC Anti-disinformation team Twitter has announced itâs banning thousands of accounts promoting QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that believes President Trump is battling a âdeep stateâ of global elites involved in child trafficking. Accounts linked to QAnon have also promoted misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic on Twitter, and other social media platforms, amplifying misleading content about Covid-19, particularly related to face coverings and vaccines. In April, QAnon accounts helped make a fake story claiming that an early participant of a UK vaccine trial had died go viral. Last month, a video uploaded by a well-known QAnon influencer which called the pandemic a âdeep state hoaxâ manufactured by the Democratic Party to hamper President Trumpâs re-election chances racked up millions of views. Misleading memes making claims about the health risks of face masks and the dangers of a âBill Gates-funded vaccineâ are widely-shared in QAnon-themed Facebook groups and quickly find their way onto Twitter, Reddit and TikTok.

US passengers, wearing blue ponchos, are packed together on a ferry boat which is allowing 50% of its normal capacity Photos of tour boats operating at Niagara Falls, which sits on the US-Canada border, have illustrated the starkly different social distancing policies between the two countries. Ferries operated from the Canadian side of the border, which normally can carry 700 tourists at a time, are only allowing six passengers per boat. The US ferries are operating at 50% capacity, meaning customers are still crowded rather closely together as they strain to get a good view of the massive waterfalls. âWe actually took a picture of the [American] boat,â Julie Pronovost, a  visitor from Quebec, told Reuters on Tuesday. âI donât find that itâs very safe to be on a boat like that. Itâs much better here.â The US coronavirus outbreak is far worse than Canada's. On Tuesday, the US reported 57,777 new Covid-19 cases, compared with 786 in Canada. Canadian customers wearing red ponchos are treated to a VIP experience with the boat all to themselves BBC OS This video can not be played Petrus Bosman says coronavirus restrictions mean the future is uncertain This empty table is being used to highlight the impact of coronavirus restrictions in South Africa, as part of a day of action to raise awareness of jobs lost in the tourist, hospitality and wine industries. Itâs 200 metres long and it was laid in Wellington, a small town outside Cape Town, next to a vineyard run by Petrus Bosman. âThe alcohol ban has not only affected our local wine sales in restaurants and retailers negatively, but the whole wine and tourism industry,âhe told BBC OS. Last week, South Africa introduced its second alcohol ban of the year and a night-time curfew to reduce the pressure on its healthcare system. Petrus, however, was not impressed with the renewed restrictions. âWe just feel that government could have consulted and worked in a more collaborative manner,"" said Petrus. ""The future is uncertain and so are the dreams we have as a community."" A man scans a restaurant menu in Miami There were 9,785 new infections recorded on Wednesday in Florida, according to health officials, raising the total number of coronavirus cases to 379,619. There were an additional 139 deaths on Wednesday. The state has now recorded 5,345 deaths of residents, and over 100 deaths of non-residents. According to the data, 47% of all deaths have occurred in long-term and elderly care homes. Florida has the third highest level of infections out of any US state, coming behind California and New York. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that researchers are making good progress on developing a coronavirus vaccine, but their first use cannot be expected until early 2021. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme told reporters that it was vital to ""not cut corners on safety"", even if this meant slowing the vaccine's development. ""We have to be able to look ourselves in the eyes, and we have to be able to look at our communities and ensure them that we have taken every precaution to make sure that these vaccines are safe and effective before we go giving them to general populations,"" said Dr Ryan. ""In order to make that happen, we can shorten that time, but realistically, it is going to be the first part of next year before we start seeing people vaccinated."" He added that several potential vaccines were in phase 3 trials and none had failed in terms of safety or their ability to generate an immune response. Maria McCannBBC News Northern Ireland A new Â£10.5m scheme to support the childcare sector in Northern Ireland will open for applications on Monday. The Department of Education said the financial package would ensure as many providers as possible can reopen or remain open following the lockdown. The Childcare Recovery Support scheme will be available for day care settings, playgroups and childminders. An earlier support package set up by Stormont was scrapped following criticism for how it was implemented. The new scheme will operate until 31 August and will be backdated to 1 July. Read more here. There have been nearly 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and more than 45,500 people have died, government figures show.

Catherine ByaruhangaBBC News, Kampala Madagascar hospitals warn they are 'overwhelmed' with cases Madagascar has reported another record day with 614 infections. At one government hospital in
Antananarivo, the director says they are already treating 46 patients and only
have space for four more. Another administrator at a different
facility said they were constantly overwhelmed. The World Health
Organisation representative in Madagascar has warned that hospitals are
saturated even before the peak of the pandemic in the country is reached. There are over 7,500 coronavirus
cases in Madagascar nearly 80% of them were diagnosed in the past month. With
the spike in positive results, the government reinstated a strict lockdown of
the capital and surrounding areas. On Monday, the Minister for Health
wrote to development partners asking for equipment like testing kits,
respirators and protective equipment for health workers. But thereâs been push
back from the governmentâs spokesperson who said it was not the ministerâs
place to make such a request. There is a lot of promising news on vaccine research this week.Oxford University announced first resultsbut itâs only one of around two dozen vaccines being tested on people in clinical trials - and there are around 140 others in development around the world. Some of you have sent in questions around what a future vaccine can and can not do. Click here to read our health editor Michelle Roberts answering all those questions and more. Some eight million children in England were sent home from school in March New research has found more than half of British children struggled to continue learning at home while schools were shut during the lockdown. Of the 52% who struggled, three-quarters of parents gave a lack of motivation as a reason, the Office for National Statistics research found. It also showed wide disparities in what families were able to do. Schools closed for most pupils at the end of March in England, Wales and Scotland, as the pandemic took hold. Some schools re-opened in England on or around 1 June for some year groups. The ONS researchers assessed surveys of more than 12,000 people in Great Britain between 3 April and 7 June about their experiences of home-schooling during the coronavirus pandemic.There's more on the findings here. Surfers in Los Angeles don masks After reopening on 4 July, England's restaurants have had to introduce strict hygiene and social distancing measures to protect staff and customers from coronavirus. But one restaurant in Buxton, Derbyshire, has taken its  responsibilities to an entirely new level - by introducing mannequins to help keep their customers socially distanced while dining. The smartly-dressed dummies are positioned at tables in La Brasserie De La Cour restaurant; with the owner, Thierry Le Port, saying they would stop people from sitting too close to others while also avoiding big, empty spaces. He added they also helped to create a ""good atmosphere"" with some diners not even realising they were mannequins at first. Customers of the French restaurant have described the mannequins as ""slightly creepy"" but effective. You can read morehere. Presidential candidate Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama - Biden's boss when he was vice-president for eight years - have sat down for their first in-person meeting of the 2020 election year. A one-minute clip teasing their interview, which will be released tomorrow, show them arriving at Obama's office in Washington DC wearing face masks and criticising Trump's handling of the pandemic. ""Can you imagine standing up when you were president and saying, âIt's not my responsibility',"" Biden says, quoting Trump in March when he was asked about testing delays. ""Those words didn't come out of our mouths when we were in office,"" Obama responds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Spanish Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto has said a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Catalonia was coming under control, and that she hoped there would be no need for neighbouring France to close its border. âWith the latest data we have in Aragon and Catalonia we are a bit more optimistic. Catalonia has already reduced the number of infections over the last three days,â said Ms Maroto. âLetâs hope that with these better data we donât have to close a border that for us is very important for mobility with our European partners.â The northeastern Spanish region has logged more than 7,000 new cases of Covid-19 over the last weeks - nearly half of the national total - although its infection rate has dropped in the recent days. Catalan leader Quim Torra has ruled out a return to lockdown, telling the regional parliament that ""Catalonia can't be closed."" But elsewhere, in Madrid the regional government said it might make face masks compulsory - even in situations where social distancing can be guaranteed - unless the national government imposed safety controls on people flying in to the capita's Barajas airport. Madrid and the Canary Islands are the only regions of Spain without such strict face mask rules in place. The global number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen to over 15 million, according to a tally byJohns Hopkins University,external.

Some eight million children in England were sent home from school in March New research has found more than half of British children struggled to continue learning at home while schools were shut during the lockdown. Of the 52% who struggled, three-quarters of parents gave a lack of motivation as a reason, the Office for National Statistics research found. It also showed wide disparities in what families were able to do. Schools closed for most pupils at the end of March in England, Wales and Scotland, as the pandemic took hold. Some schools re-opened in England on or around 1 June for some year groups. The ONS researchers assessed surveys of more than 12,000 people in Great Britain between 3 April and 7 June about their experiences of home-schooling during the coronavirus pandemic.There's more on the findings here. Surfers in Los Angeles don masks After reopening on 4 July, England's restaurants have had to introduce strict hygiene and social distancing measures to protect staff and customers from coronavirus. But one restaurant in Buxton, Derbyshire, has taken its  responsibilities to an entirely new level - by introducing mannequins to help keep their customers socially distanced while dining. The smartly-dressed dummies are positioned at tables in La Brasserie De La Cour restaurant; with the owner, Thierry Le Port, saying they would stop people from sitting too close to others while also avoiding big, empty spaces. He added they also helped to create a ""good atmosphere"" with some diners not even realising they were mannequins at first. Customers of the French restaurant have described the mannequins as ""slightly creepy"" but effective. You can read morehere.

Spanish Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto has said a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Catalonia was coming under control, and that she hoped there would be no need for neighbouring France to close its border. âWith the latest data we have in Aragon and Catalonia we are a bit more optimistic. Catalonia has already reduced the number of infections over the last three days,â said Ms Maroto. âLetâs hope that with these better data we donât have to close a border that for us is very important for mobility with our European partners.â The northeastern Spanish region has logged more than 7,000 new cases of Covid-19 over the last weeks - nearly half of the national total - although its infection rate has dropped in the recent days. Catalan leader Quim Torra has ruled out a return to lockdown, telling the regional parliament that ""Catalonia can't be closed."" But elsewhere, in Madrid the regional government said it might make face masks compulsory - even in situations where social distancing can be guaranteed - unless the national government imposed safety controls on people flying in to the capita's Barajas airport. Madrid and the Canary Islands are the only regions of Spain without such strict face mask rules in place. The global number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen to over 15 million, according to a tally byJohns Hopkins University,external.

Â£50m support package for universities and colleges,"Universities are facing uncertainty over student numbers in September Universities and colleges in Wales are to receive a Â£50m support package to soften the impact of coronavirus. The Welsh Government fund aims to safeguard teaching and research as well as helping students. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the institutions would play an ""important role"" in Wales' recovery from the pandemic. However the National Union of Students (NUS) said it ""falls short"" of helping students facing financial hardship. Of the money, Â£27m will be provided to higher education institutions with Â£23m to support students in further education colleges and sixth forms. Ms Williams said the full impact of the pandemic on universities would not be known until the new term in September. ""This funding will provide a vital support to our institutions in their preparations for the autumn,"" she added. ""Each one will be important in our recovery as they work with schools, business, international partners and public services. ""So we are supporting these major institutions in Welsh life, so they can support students of all ages, and keep playing their part in our recovery."" The funding aims to secure jobs at Welsh institutions, including Cardiff University The latest UCAS figures showed an increase in applications to Welsh universities from 18-year-olds, the Welsh Government said. However there are concerns many students may defer to the following year while international students may also be put off studying abroad due to coronavirus. Some UK universities have evenwarned they may ""go bust""without government help, with a potential fall in research investment from private and charitable sources. So the Higher Education Investment and Recovery Fund for Wales aims to help maintain jobs in teaching, research and student services, invest in economic recovery and support students suffering financial hardship. More than Â£15m will be provided for learners beginning their A-level or vocational course at an FE college or sixth form, to increase support following the closure of schools and help with their transition to post-16 learning. The funding will be provided for all full-time learners between 16 and 19 years of age and represents a 5% increase to funding-per-student, the Welsh Government said. Lectures might have to shift from lecture halls to online lessons to comply with social distancing Up to Â£5m will be provided to support vocational learners to return to college to complete licence-to-practice qualifications, without needing to re-sit the full year. An extra Â£3.2m will be used to provide digital equipment such as laptops for FE students. An additional Â£466,000 will be provided to support students undertaking Independent Living Skills programmes, to enable them to complete their transition from college into employment and independence. Universities 'may lose Â£98m' due to pandemic Students with no relatives 'may have to drop out' Uni admissions could see emergency controls Regional mental health and wellbeing projects and professional development will also receive Â£100,000. ""Our support for 16 to 19 age students aims to ensure students beginning courses in September are not disadvantaged by the disruption they faced earlier this year,"" said Ms Williams. ""It is [also] part of our wider measures to ensure we have a skilled workforce that will drive forward the economic recovery from the coronavirus."" Reaction to the announcement has been mixed. Universities Wales said the support was ""vital"" and comes at a ""crucial moment"" for universities and colleges. ""This [will] provide stability for our universities and will be reassuring for students who have consistently rated the student experience in Wales as excellent,"" said chairman Prof Julie Lydon. Becky Ricketts said it was ""regrettable"" students were still tied into tenancies However NUS Wales said while the announcement gave institutions ""much-needed certainty"" it had failed to help students directly. AnNUS survey,externalfound 78% of students in Wales were worried about their finances because of Covid-19 with almost half who work part-time having lost their income, while many wereforced to continue paying rentsince March despite returning home. ""It's disappointing that this package does not include ring-fenced funding for student hardship, demand for which has increased during the pandemic and will only worsen in the coming months,"" said NUS Wales President Becky Ricketts. However she added: ""The funding for FE colleges goes a long way to alleviating our concerns about the disproportionate impact of the virus on vulnerable and digitally excluded students.""

"Paint, wallpaper and compost sales soar in lockdownB&Q owner Kingfisher sees sales soar in lockdown as people do more DIY.Business","Sales of paint, wallpaper, plants and compost have soared during lockdown, the owner of B&Q and Screwfix has said. Kingfisher said people had been doing more DIY than usual, as like-for-like sales jumped by 21.6% in the three months to 18 July. Store re-openings also boosted revenue, while online sales more than tripled. Kingfisher's UK stores, as well as those in France, were closed in mid-March due to lockdown measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. Although B&Q's UK stores only started reopening in late April, online sales continued to see a huge increase, it said. The retailer made click-and-collect and home delivery options available and the group saw online sales surge more than 200% in both May and June. DPD and B&Q owner to hire 7,500 as demand surges DIY spending splurge helps May sales recover According to the Office for National Statistics,external, retail sales across the UK partly recovered in May driven by DIY stores and garden centres reopening. Sales were boosted by a 42% rise at household goods stores, such as hardware, furniture and paint shops, it said. Kingfisher said that good weather had also helped demand - in addition to people having more time to spend on DIY improvements while they spent more time at home. In June,the group saidit would recruit 3,000 to 4,000 more workers to meet the rising demand, about half of them in the UK. Kingfisher boss Thierry Garnier said the firm's new recruits would be ""temporary"" during the summer, depending on what happened to demand after coronavirus measures were eased. The DIY group is one of the few large retailers to add to its workforce instead of cutting jobs amid the pandemic. DIY is one area that has done well during lockdown. Other businesses that have seen buoyant sales include supermarkets and online-only fashion stores. Sainsbury's, for example, saw grocery sales up 10.5% during the lockdown, fuelled by online orders.Online fashion firm Asos also reportedan increase in group sales of 10% to Â£1bn in the four months to 30 June. Despite Kingfisher's strong performance, the group said in a statement on Wednesday that it would not give guidance for the second half of the year due to ""uncertainty around Covid-19 and the wider economic outlook"". It also said its sales over the six months to 18 July were down 3.7% compared with the same period last year.

Twitter cracks down on QAnon conspiracy theorists,"Followers of QAnon believe ""deep-state"" traitors are plotting against US President Donald Trump Twitter has announced sweeping measures aimed at cracking down on the QAnon conspiracy theory, including banning thousands of accounts. The social media giant said it would also stop recommending content linked to QAnon and block URLs associated with it from being shared on the platform. QAnon is a sprawling conspiracy theory whose followers support US President Donald Trump. Twitter said it hoped the action would help to prevent ""offline harm"". In a statement shared on the platform, Twitter said it would permanently suspend accounts that violate its policies while tweeting about QAnon. The suspensions will be applied to accounts that are ""engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, coordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension - something we've seen more of in recent weeks,"" it said. QAnon: What's the truth behind a pro-Trump conspiracy theory? US conspiracy theory shuts school festival Bill Gates and the lab targeted by conspiracy theorists The suspensions are expected to affect about 150,000 accounts worldwide. More than 7,000 accounts have been removed in recent weeks for violations, Twitter said. QAnon supporters have been linked to numerous other false claims that have spread online, including abizarre conspiracy theory involving a US furniture company and allegations of child trafficking. The FBI last year issued a warning about ""conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists"" and designated QAnon a potential domestic extremist threat. By Shayan Sardarizadeh and Jack Goodman,BBC Anti-disinformation team QAnon is a wide-ranging unfounded conspiracy theory that President Trump is battling a clandestine ""deep state"" network of political, business, media and entertainment elites, often involving Satanic plots and child trafficking. QAnon began in October 2017 on the anonymous message board 4chan. A user claimed to have top security clearance within the US government and signed off their posts as ""Q"" - hence the name QAnon. Q communicates in cryptic posts and claims to be directly involved in a secret Trump-led investigation of a global network of child abusers. QAnon followed on from the ""pizzagate"" saga in 2016 - a fake theory about Democratic Party politicians running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. QAnon influencers have big audiences on social media. They urge followers to ""do their own research"" - in other words, watch YouTube videos and talk to other supporters - to solve Q's puzzles. In its nearly three years of existence, the conspiracy has drawn huge traffic on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Reddit, attracting hundreds of thousands of dedicated followers. This includes celebrities and dozens of candidates running for Congress this year. During the coronavirus pandemic, Q influencers have spread unfounded theories about coronavirus, calling it a ""deep state"" hoax and have promoted misinformation about face masks and vaccines.

Nailcote Hall, which employed 80 staff before lockdown, was a popular venue for weddings, party nights and visitors to the nearby National Exhibition Centre (NEC). It plans to re-open on 24 August, but since Mr Cressman took the decision another big NEC event he was hoping would bring in business has been cancelled. ""We are taking a little bit of a punt,"" he says. Mr Cressman is hopeful his customers will return relatively quickly, saying many bookings ""haven't been cancelled, just pushed back"". Immediate mass return to work unlikely, say firms Plan for 'significant normality' by Christmas - PM Even so, the hospitality sector has strict distancing rules, so getting back to the days when the hotel had average wedding parties of 100 guests could be a long way off. His staff are gradually being brought back from furlough, with training underway and the re-arrangement of the hotel to make it Covid-19 compliant in progress. Mr Cressman said: ""We need to get up to 50% capacity within about two months. I've been in this business 40 years. I'm sure many people with less experience would find it overwhelming."" The BCC's survey of firms between 6 July and 10 July found that while demand is up since the depths of the lockdown, most firms are only operating at about half of their pre-virus capacity. Meanwhile, almost half said they had seen a slight or significant decrease in revenue from UK customers compared to June. And some 43% saw an increase in late payments from customers when compared with the last six months of 2019. Adam Marshall, BCC director general, said: ""Businesses are grappling with reduced customer demand, an on-going cash crunch, and the potential for further lockdowns during an uncertain autumn and winter ahead,"" Mr Marshall said. ""The prime minister's encouragement to return to workplaces and further updates to business guidance will not be enough on their own."" The survey was carried out before Boris Johnson's announcement last week that coronavirus restrictions will ease further in England under plans for what he called a ""significant return to normality"" by Christmas. Under the new guidelines, people may use public transport for journeys immediately and companies will have more discretion to bring staff back to work from 1 August. However, economists say that despite the easing of lockdown and hopes that the pace of staff being brought back from furlough will be pick up, the outlook for jobs was gloomy. Jack Kennedy, economist at Indeed, an employment website which helped produce the BCC's report, said: ""The slowdown in consumer activity mirrors hiring activity in the UK. ""Today, there are 60% fewer job postings than there were before the outbreak of Covid-19, and so far there are few signs of a V-shaped recovery in vacancies. ""The furlough scheme has been an important lifeline to millions of people but the fear is there will be a sudden rise in unemployment after that umbilical cord has been severed,"" he said.

Â£50m support package for universities and collegesThe Welsh Government says the fund will help safeguard teaching and research as well as students.Wales,"Universities are facing uncertainty over student numbers in September Universities and colleges in Wales are to receive a Â£50m support package to soften the impact of coronavirus. The Welsh Government fund aims to safeguard teaching and research as well as helping students. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the institutions would play an ""important role"" in Wales' recovery from the pandemic. However the National Union of Students (NUS) said it ""falls short"" of helping students facing financial hardship. Of the money, Â£27m will be provided to higher education institutions with Â£23m to support students in further education colleges and sixth forms. Ms Williams said the full impact of the pandemic on universities would not be known until the new term in September. ""This funding will provide a vital support to our institutions in their preparations for the autumn,"" she added. ""Each one will be important in our recovery as they work with schools, business, international partners and public services. ""So we are supporting these major institutions in Welsh life, so they can support students of all ages, and keep playing their part in our recovery."" The funding aims to secure jobs at Welsh institutions, including Cardiff University The latest UCAS figures showed an increase in applications to Welsh universities from 18-year-olds, the Welsh Government said. However there are concerns many students may defer to the following year while international students may also be put off studying abroad due to coronavirus. Some UK universities have evenwarned they may ""go bust""without government help, with a potential fall in research investment from private and charitable sources. So the Higher Education Investment and Recovery Fund for Wales aims to help maintain jobs in teaching, research and student services, invest in economic recovery and support students suffering financial hardship. More than Â£15m will be provided for learners beginning their A-level or vocational course at an FE college or sixth form, to increase support following the closure of schools and help with their transition to post-16 learning. The funding will be provided for all full-time learners between 16 and 19 years of age and represents a 5% increase to funding-per-student, the Welsh Government said. Lectures might have to shift from lecture halls to online lessons to comply with social distancing Up to Â£5m will be provided to support vocational learners to return to college to complete licence-to-practice qualifications, without needing to re-sit the full year. An extra Â£3.2m will be used to provide digital equipment such as laptops for FE students. An additional Â£466,000 will be provided to support students undertaking Independent Living Skills programmes, to enable them to complete their transition from college into employment and independence. Universities 'may lose Â£98m' due to pandemic Students with no relatives 'may have to drop out' Uni admissions could see emergency controls Regional mental health and wellbeing projects and professional development will also receive Â£100,000. ""Our support for 16 to 19 age students aims to ensure students beginning courses in September are not disadvantaged by the disruption they faced earlier this year,"" said Ms Williams. ""It is [also] part of our wider measures to ensure we have a skilled workforce that will drive forward the economic recovery from the coronavirus."" Reaction to the announcement has been mixed. Universities Wales said the support was ""vital"" and comes at a ""crucial moment"" for universities and colleges. ""This [will] provide stability for our universities and will be reassuring for students who have consistently rated the student experience in Wales as excellent,"" said chairman Prof Julie Lydon. Becky Ricketts said it was ""regrettable"" students were still tied into tenancies However NUS Wales said while the announcement gave institutions ""much-needed certainty"" it had failed to help students directly. AnNUS survey,externalfound 78% of students in Wales were worried about their finances because of Covid-19 with almost half who work part-time having lost their income, while many wereforced to continue paying rentsince March despite returning home. ""It's disappointing that this package does not include ring-fenced funding for student hardship, demand for which has increased during the pandemic and will only worsen in the coming months,"" said NUS Wales President Becky Ricketts. However she added: ""The funding for FE colleges goes a long way to alleviating our concerns about the disproportionate impact of the virus on vulnerable and digitally excluded students.""

Amazon-owned firm in Black Lives Matter legal claim,"Workers at Whole Foods are suing the US supermarket for punishing them for wearing Black Lives Matter masks. The federal lawsuit says the firm discriminated against black staff by selectively enforcing its dress code. Whole Foods, owned by tech giant Amazon, forbids staff from wearing clothes with messages that are not company-related. It denied firing a worker over the issue, but would not comment on the legal action. ""While we cannot comment on pending litigation, it is critical to clarify that no Team Members have been terminated for wearing Black Lives Matter face masks or apparel,"" the company said in a statement. The lawsuit says more than 40 Whole Foods employees at locations across the country have been punished for wearing the Black Lives Matter masks, which became popular amid the outcry over George Floyd's death at the hands of police. Staff wearing clothing with other messages, such as LGBTQ pins or sports team apparel, had not faced such discipline in the past, the lawsuit says. ""Whole Foods' selective enforcement of its dress code in disciplining employees who wear apparel expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement constitutes unlawful discrimination,"" the lawsuit says. The complaint asks the court to strike down Whole Foods' policy and bar the company from taking further action or retaliating against the workers. It also seeks back-pay for workers sent home for wearing the masks, The lawsuit was filed by 14 employees as a class action suit on behalf of all Whole Foods staff. One of the workers claims she was fired for organising mask wearing and leading protests against the company's response. In a statement, Whole Foods denied that claim, saying the employee, Savannah Kinzer, had been dismissed for ""repeatedly violating our time and attendance policy by not working her assigned shifts, reporting late for work multiple times in the past nine days and choosing to leave during her scheduled shifts. ""It is simply untrue that she was separated from the company for wearing a Black Lives Matter face mask. As an employer we must uphold our policies in an equitable and consistent manner. Savannah had full understanding of our policies and was given a number of opportunities to comply,"" the firm said. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lawyer representing the workers, said the firm was ""falsely attacking"" Ms Kinzer. ""Their decision to retaliate against employees expressing support for this racial justice movement was bad enough, but their efforts to disparage an amazing activist and leader are beyond the pale,"" she said. ""We look forward to making our argument in federal court."" Why firms are speaking out about George Floyd Amazon vice-president quits over virus firings Amazon workers strike over virus protection She told the BBC the workers who filed the suit were angry in part over apparent hypocrisy, after Amazon and Whole Foods expressed public support for the Black Lives Matter movement. ""So many companies today are doing everything they can to profess how progressive they are... but when it actually comes to letting their employees express these same sentiments they get muzzled,"" she said. The lawsuit is the latest clash involving Amazon and its workers. The firm has faced repeated calls to do more to protect its supermarket and warehouse workers during the pandemic and been accused of retaliating against staff speaking out over the firm's environmental policies and coronavirus protections. Earlier this year, an engineer quit, citing firings as evidence of a ""vein of toxicity running through the company's culture"".

UK 'badly underestimated' Russian threat,"UK government ""badly underestimated"" the Russian threat and the response it required, according to an inquiry. The Intelligence and Security Committee'slong-awaited report,externalinto Russian activity in the UK said the government was ""playing catch-up"" and needed to take ""immediate action"". The report also claimed the government made no effort to investigate Russian interference in the EU referendum. The Russian Foreign Ministry called the report ""Russophobia"". No 10 said the government was ""fully aware of the significant and enduring threat"" Russia posed. The ISC's inquiry covers a number of topics, including disinformation campaigns, cyber tactics and Russian expatriates in the UK. Much of the ""highly sensitive"" detail was not published due to fears Russia could use the evidence to threaten the UK. LIVE: Russia threat report published Russians sought to meddle in UK election â Raab The mystery of the Russia report The committee said Russian influence in the UK was now ""the new normal"", and the UK was a ""top Western intelligence target"" for the state, only behind Nato and US. ISC member, Stewart Hosie, told reporters the government ""took its eye off the ball, because of its focus on counterterrorism"", adding: ""The government had badly underestimated the response required to the Russian threat, and is still playing catch up."" In its report, the group said UK was ""clearly a target"" for disinformation campaigns around its elections, but that the issue was described as a ""hot potato"", with no one organisation taking a lead to tackle it. The report criticised intelligence agencies for not taking action during the EU referendum, despite there being ""credible open source commentary"" suggesting ""influence campaigns"" from the Russians during the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. And it said the government only ""belatedly realised the level of threat which Russia could pose"" after the so-called ""hack and leak"" operation against the Democrats in the 2016 US election, calling it a ""game changer"". The committee said: ""Had the relevant parts of the intelligence community conducted a similar threat assessment prior to the [EU] referendum, it is inconceivable that they would not have reached the same conclusion as to Russian intent, which might then have led them to take action to protect the process."" The report also said that social media companies ""hold the key and yet are failing to play their part"", adding that the government should ""name and shame those which fail to act."" This video can not be played Stewart Hosie MP says the government ""didn't take action to protect the UK"" Mr Hosie also said no-one in Government wanted to touch the issue of Russian interference when it came to elections with a ""10-foot pole"". He told reporters: ""The report reveals that no one in government knew if Russia interfered in or sought to influence the referendum, because they did not want to know. ""The UK government have actively avoided looking for evidence that Russia interfere."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab later told a press conference the government 'categorically rejected' the claim, saying it was ""the comment of one MP"" on the committee. The government also rejected the committee's call for a full assessment by intelligence agencies of potential Russian meddling in the 2016 referendum, saying it had ""seen no evidence of successful interference"". This report may not be what some expected, but it is still damning. Many expected the committee to have answered the question of whether there was interference in political events like Brexit. Instead, it says the problem was the government and the spy agencies failed to even look at this question. British intelligence has, at least in recent years, been reluctant to get involved in anything that looks ""political"" and treated the issue of trying to protect democracy like a ""hot potato"". But ultimately it's the government that the committee blames. More broadly, there are serious questions about the failure of the UK to confront the spread of Russian money and influence over a long period. And there is an urgent call for new legislation to deal with an ongoing challenge. The report also accused successive governments of welcoming Russian oligarchs ""with open arms"" due to the investments they brought with them. The committee said ""few questions if any were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth"", with particular issues around the UK's investment visa scheme, the housing market, the judicial system and PR firms. They said: ""A lot of Russians with very close links to Putin who are well integrated into the UK business and social scene, are accepted because of their wealth."" The report said it had concerns about links between these wealthy Russians and the House of Lords. ""It is notable that a number of members of the House of Lords have business interests linked to Russia, or work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state,"" it read. ""These relationships should be carefully scrutinised, given the potential for the Russian state to exploit them."" The reaction to the ISC's report from Russia has been a big collective shrug. The Russian foreign minister dismissed it out of hand and called it ""Russophobia"". And a Kremlin spokesman said Russia doesn't meddle in other countries elections. What this report has done is to present a broad picture of Russia as a powerful foe. And I don't think in the Kremlin they will be too unhappy at that. Committee members also criticised No 10 for the delay in the report's publication - seven months after it was submitted to No 10 to sign off. Downing Street was accused of holding back the report ahead of December's UK election and for delaying its nominations to set up the new committee - both claims it has denied. But speaking at a press conference to launch the report, one of the ISC's committee members, Kevan Jones, criticised Boris Johnson for not signing it off sooner, saying there was ""no reason for delay"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted: ""We've been clear that Russia must desist from its attacks on the UK and our allies. ""We will be resolute in defending our country, our democracy and our values from such Hostile State."" The ISC's former chair, Dominic Grieve - who pushed for the report to be published before the election - told BBC News his pleasure at seeing it come to light was ""mitigated by a sense of frustration and bluntly anger at the way the government behaved"". This video can not be played Dominic Grieve says there were âno valid reasonâ and no explanation for delaying its publication Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy accused the PM of taking a ""political decision"" to block the report. She added: ""The government has underestimated the response required to Russia and it is imperative we learn the lessons from the mistakes that have been made.""

Ministers consider new powers after Russia report,"This video can not be played Keir Starmer questions Boris Johnson on the Russia report in parliament Ministers are considering strengthening security laws aftera report,externalby MPs accused them of underestimating the threat of Russian interference. Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said foreign agents could be required to register in the UK in future. He told MPs that this and other ""new offences and powers"" for dealing with foreign spies were being looked at. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of complacency and leaving a ""serious gap in our defences"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said the government had ""delayed"" legislation to help counter Russian interference, despite acknowledging 18 months ago that existing powers were insufficient. ""The PM sat on this report for 10 months and failed to plug a gap in our law in national security,"" he said. ""How is the PM going to address that gap and meet the threat with the joined-up, robust response it deserves?"" UK 'badly underestimated' Russian threat Russia report: The unanswered questions Russia report: What would tougher spy laws mean for UK? Boris Johnson said there was no other country in the Western world that was more ""vigilant"" about Russian interference, pointing to recent sanctions against Russian officials involved in human rights abuses and proposed laws to protect critical infrastructure and intellectual property. ""Let us be in no doubt about what this is all about,"" he said. ""It is about pressure from the Islingtonian remainers who have seized on this report to try and give the impression that Russian interference was somehow responsible for Brexit. ""The people of this country did not vote to leave the EU because of pressure from Russia."" The Intelligence and Security Committee report claimed the government made no effort to investigate claims of Russian interference in the EU referendum and criticised intelligence agencies for not prioritising the issue. The government has said an inquiry is not necessary as it has ""seen no evidence of successful interference"". But ministers are listening to calls from all parties to do more to counter Russian espionage and subversion after the UK was described the main target after the US and Nato. Plans to make foreign agents register were mentioned in the government'slegislative agenda,externallast December, and werepreviously announcedby former home secretary Sajid Javid in May last year. In response to an urgent question from Labour in the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the UK would consider strengthening the Official Secrets Act and tightening rules on investment visas. ""Let there be no doubt, we are unafraid to act where necessary to protect the UK and our allies."" If you do not seek, you do not find. Whether deliberate or deficient, the Intelligence and Security Committee's very long-awaited report outlines gaping holes in the UK's handling of the threat from Russia. For years, it seems a lack of priority, and a lack of curiosity, allowed the risks to go unmonitored, if not to go unchecked. The UK government has now stiffened its attitude to Putin's Russia. Read Laura's full blog But shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the ""conscious"" decision not to consider whether they was any attempt to manipulate the Brexit vote spoke volumes.
