Sex cult leader found guilty in New York,"Nxivm leader Keith Raniere appearing in court in Brooklyn, New York Keith Raniere, a self-help guru accused of leading a sex cult that enslaved women, has been found guilty of all charges against him. Raniere, 58, was convicted by a jury after a six-week trial in Brooklyn, New York. He allegedly oversaw a ""slave and master"" system in his group, called Nxivm. He was convicted of all counts against him, including racketeering, sex trafficking and child pornography. Mr Raniere, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, could face life in prison. Keith Raniere's Nxivm trial: What we've learned 'Why I joined a cult - and how I left' US heiress pleads guilty in 'sex cult' case Associate pleads guilty in 'sex cult' case During the trial, the court heard how female recruits in the group were branded with his initials and coerced into having sex with Raniere. This video can not be played Raniereâs ex-girlfriend Toni Natalie made a statement outside court Raniere maintained that Nxivm (pronounced nexium) was a self-improvement organisation, but investigators said it was a sex-trafficking operation disguised as a mentoring group. Recruits were told it was an all-female group and were asked to hand over compromising materials that were later used to blackmail them, prosecutors said. Raniere was arrested by the FBI in Mexico last year. His defence team said the alleged sexual relationships were consensual. When the verdict was read outside court, former members of Nxivm gave the prosecution team a round of applause. Prosecutors claim Mr Raniere oversaw a ""slave and master"" system in the group According to Nxivm's tagline, Raniere and his organisation were ""working to build a better world"". But witnesses called to testify at his trial painted a starkly different picture of the man. Raniere, the court heard, ran a secret society within Nxivm called DOS. As the ""grandmaster"" of DOS, he was a ""predator"" who exploited and blackmailed women, including a 15-year-old girl, prosecutors alleged. Attorneys representing Nxivm leader Keith Raniere argued DOS was merely a ""social club"" Raniere forced his ""slaves"" to give him nude photos of themselves and other compromising materials, telling them they would be made public if they disobeyed him, the court heard. Every August, Nxivm members - called ""Nixians"" - would dole out $2,000 (Â£1,575) or more to gather in Silver Bay, New York to celebrate Raniere's birthday week, according to court documents. US actress pleads guilty in 'sex cult' case 'Sex-slave' group leader arrested by FBI A former member testified that the week included ""tribute ceremonies"" to Raniere, who was referred to as ""The Vanguard"" by his followers. Another former member of the alleged sex cult, identified by prosecutors as Daniela, testified she was ""groomed"" for weeks before she turned 18 for Raniere to take her virginity. The same women was allegedly confined to a bedroom for two years - all because she gained weight and asked to see a man other than Raniere. Photos from the FBI show the branding on one victim, with Mr Raniere's initials, KR, superimposed in white In her closing arguments, prosecutor Moira Penza said Raniere was a ""crime boss with no limits"" who ""tapped into a never-ending flow of women and money"". In his defence, his lawyer Marc Agnifilo told the court that no women were ever forced to do anything against their will. ""You may find him repulsive, disgusting and offensive. We don't convict people in this country for being repulsive or offensive,"" Agnifilo said. ""Unpopular ideas aren't criminal. Disgusting ideas aren't criminal."" A jury of eight men and four women dismissed his arguments, convicting Raniere for the catalogue of abuse, forced starvation and sexual exploitation he subjected his victims to. Raniere was at the top of this structure as the only man, but had a number of female deputies. Female recruits were allegedly branded with Raniere's initials and expected to have sex with him, as part of the system. Five female members of Nxivm - including a liquor heiress and an actress - have pleaded guilty to a series of charges for their involvement. The most high profile of these was former Smallville star Allison Mack. Smallville actress Allison Mack, reportedly a participant in the 'slave and master system' has already pleaded guilty to her involvement in Nxivm In April she pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges, despite previously denying the accusations. Mack admitted to recruiting women by telling them they were joining a female mentorship group. She is now scheduled to be sentenced in September and will face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each of the two charges. Clare Bronfman, the heir to the Seagram alcohol fortune, in April pleaded guilty to conspiracy to conceal and harbour illegal immigrants for financial gain, and fraudulent use of identification. She was accused of pumping more than $100m (Â£77m) into Nxivm. In March, the co-founder of the group, Nancy Salzman, pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering. She is due to be sentenced in July. Lauren Salzman, the daughter of Nancy, and Nxivm employee, Kathy Russell, also pleaded guilty over their involvement. On its website Nxivm describes itself as a ""community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human"". Based in Albany, New York, the group was founded as Executive Success Programs in 1998. Billed as a personal development company, it claims to have worked with more than 16,000 people. Members of the group are reported to include wealthy socialites and Hollywood actresses. According to the group's website, it has suspended enrolment and events because of the ""extraordinary circumstances facing the company at this time"".

Boohoo recycled range provokes scepticism,"Boohoo's first recycled range will be made with reclaimed plastics ""If someone really cared about buying ethically sourced, green clothes then they wouldn't shop at Boohoo,"" shopper Camilla tells the BBC on Oxford Street. She is commenting on the fast fashion retailer's first recycled clothing range - made with reclaimed plastics - which was unveiled this week. The 22-year-old's view is not surprising, given the millions of low cost, fast fashion clothes that Boohoo sells every year. But while it's easy to dismiss the move as a marketing gimmick, Boohoo claims it is planning other green initiatives, and others have welcomed the new collection as a ""starting point"". ""It is good for people to try recycled clothes and see that they are just like normal clothes,"" says shopper Esme, 16. Could ditching 'fast fashion' make us happier? Ideas to make fashion more eco-friendly turned down ""I'm glad they are engaging because they are unlikely to change their supply chain overnight,"" adds Dr Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion marketing at the University of Manchester. Boohoo says its34-piece range,externalis made with recycled polyester that had been destined for landfills and uses no environmentally unfriendly dyes or chemicals. The dresses, bodysuits, flares and crop tops have also been made entirely in the UK to cut air pollution. Zara is one of a growing number of retailers to launch recycled collections However, some have noted that the range was unveiled on the same day theEnvironmental Audit Committee (EAC) issued a critical reporton the fast fashion industry that mentioned Boohoo. The MPs warned companies were creating huge amounts of waste by selling cheap clothes designed only to be worn a few times. They also said the synthetic fabrics used to make such garments shed micro-fibres when washed, polluting waterways. ""The problem of clothing waste driven by rising volumes and lower prices in recent years are unlikely to be addressed by initiatives [like Boohoo's recycled range],"" says Stella Claxton of Nottingham Trent University, who gave evidence to the EAC. ""We know that too many garments that are disposed of through retailer take-back schemes or in charity collection bins will eventually find their way into landfill."" She also questions just how green Boohoo's recycled fabric will be, noting that even recycled polyester clothing can take hundreds of years to decompose. ""The garments are likely to shed microfibres into waterways when they're machine washed, just like the non recycled versions,"" she adds. In its report, the EAC made 18 proposals, including a 1p charge per garment on producers to fund better recycling of clothes, and a ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold stock that can be recycled instead. But the government has said already it will adopt none of the policies. In that light, Dr Perry thinks Boohoo - and others retailers that have launched green clothing ranges - should be encouraged for doing so voluntarily. ""The real test will be if Boohoo can make this financially viable,"" she says. ""Because if they don't carry on then it will seem like a token gesture and them getting on the bandwagon."" Boohoo says it takes its environmental responsibilities ""extremely seriously"" and is encouraging its customers to wear its clothes for longer. ""We have also launched a further consumer awareness programme around washing at lower temperatures, and avoiding ironing and tumble drying where possible.""

Spider fell on driver before fatal crash,"Tristan Silver's mother Cloud Younger (centre, long hair) was driving her children to school when the fatal crash happened An 11-year-old died in a head-on crash after a spider dropped on to his mother's hand while she was driving, an inquest has heard. Tristan Silver's mother Cloud Younger was driving him and his sister Branwen to school on 4 May 2018 when they crashed near Tregaron, Ceredigion. The inquest in Aberystwyth heard their car drifted on to the wrong side of the A485 and hit a 4x4 towing a trailer. A conclusion of misadventure was recorded by the coroner. Tristan - who was sitting in the back seat - suffered serious head injuries when Mrs Younger's blue Subaru hit a black Mitsubishi towing a trailer full of sheep in the village of Olmarch. It was being driven by farmer David Glyndwr Jones, who was on his way to Builth Wells livestock market. The inquest heard when Mrs Younger was interviewed by police in June 2018, she answered ""no comment"" to every question. After the first interview, her solicitor read a pre-prepared statement in which she told police her Subaru had recently passed its MOT and all three people in the car were wearing seat belts. Mrs Younger said the spider landing on her left hand caused eight-year-old Branwen - who was sitting in the front passenger seat - to become hysterical and start screaming. She said she turned her attention to Branwen to calm her down while still driving. When asked by police why she had not stopped, she replied: ""No comment."" Mrs Younger did not give evidence at the inquest, but when asked by the coroner if she had anything to add, she said: ""If I could remember more, I would have said more."" There was no evidence as to how fast the car was travelling on the 60 mph road, but Mr Jones said his vehicle was almost at a standstill at the point of impact. He added: ""At first it was straddling the white line, about a quarter of the vehicle on the wrong side. Then it came all the way over to my side and I could see it wasn't going to stop. ""All this happened in about six seconds - I just had enough time to warn my wife and brace myself. I feel devastated by what happened. I don't understand why she didn't see us and drive back to her side."" Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton said it had been ""an extremely sad and tragic inquest"". He added it all came down to the manner in which the Subaru was being driven during the ""catastrophic seconds"" when Mrs Younger turned to give attention to her daughter.Â He said it appeared the car travelled for a significant period of time on the wrong side of the road and Mrs Younger did nothing to slow down or to get the car on the correct side.

BBC defends debate imam vetting process,"This video can not be played Abdullah Patel asked the Tory leadership candidates if they agreed that ""words had consequences"" The BBC has defended its vetting process after it emerged a guest on its leadership debate show had shared allegedly anti-Semitic tweets. Imam Abdullah Patel said he was sure he had not criticised Jewish people but stood by criticism of Israeli policy. The broadcaster said: ""Had we been aware of the views he expressed he would not have been selected."" Mr Patel has been suspended as deputy head of a girls' school and also by the Masjid e Umar mosque in Gloucester. The BBC said the tweets had come to light after Mr Patel re-activated a previously inactive Twitter profile in the aftermath of Tuesday's debate, and had not been visible to its researchers before then. Separately, the BBC faced criticism on Wednesday for choosing as a guest on the programme a solicitor who has previously worked for Labour and once stood as a councillor for the party. It defended the decision, saying: ""A background in politics doesn't disqualify anyone from taking part in a debate show."" Five key moments from Tory leadership debate A screenshot of Mr Patel's Twitter feed from 2014posted on the Guido Fawkes website,externalshowed he shared a graphic of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"". Labour MP Naz Shah was temporarilysuspended from her partythree years ago after it emerged she had shared the same image on Facebook. Another screenshot showed a tweet from Mr Patel,apparently giving advice to women,externalon how to avoid being assaulted by men, saying: ""Generally men are the predators, but women need to realise this and be smarter. It takes two to tango, and if you put yourself in that position, don't expect every man to pass up the opportunity to take advantage of you. Don't be alone with a man!"" BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast presenter Nicky Campbell apologised for having Mr Patel as a guest on his show on Wednesday morning, after the imam had reactivated his controversial social media account, saying it contained ""extremely disturbing"" comments that should have been checked.

Al-Ashraf primary school in Gloucester released a statement saying Mr Patel had been suspended ""from all school duties"" while it investigated comments attributed to him in the media. It added: ""The 'school' and 'trust' do not share the views attributed to him."" A statement from the Masjid e Umar mosque said: ""We are fully aware of the allegations made against our Imam Maulana Abdullah Patel regarding the contents of historic tweets. We have decided to act immediately and have chosen to give him some time away to allow us the opportunity to conduct a detailed investigation into this matter."" Mr Patel, who has now deactivated the Twitter account again, told the BBC Asian Network the school was ""within its right"" to conduct an investigation. ""I don't wish to comment on their decision,"" he added. Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire earlier, Mr Patel said he had a very good relationship with the Jewish community. ""The criticism was not of the Jewish community because if you go through my tweets, you'd see support for the Jewish community,"" he said. ""They're our brothers and sisters, and the Jewish community and I - especially in Gloucester - work very closely together. We actually visited a synagogue just a while ago."" However, he said he stood by any criticism of ""Israel's policy"". Mr Patel was one of several members of the public who were invited to ask thefive Conservative leadership candidatesquestions during the televised debate. The BBC asked people to submit questions via email or an online form The call-out was made via social media and on air on the BBC - including the BBC News channel, local radio and Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme The questions were picked by the production team based on subject areas, with those they judged to be the strongest questions making the final selection They also aimed for a geographical spread of questions and a variety of ages and backgrounds to ensure voices were heard ""from people across the UK and outside the Westminster bubble"" He asked MPs about the Islamophobic rhetoric faced by members of the Muslim community and whether they agreed that ""words had consequences"". BBC presenter Emily Maitlis took responses from the Conservative leader candidates, with Sajid Javid taking the opportunity to ask all the candidates toagree to commit to an independent investigationinto Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, which they appeared to do. Responding to the controversy over Mr Patel's participation in the debate, Mr Javid tweeted that the imam should ""practise what he preaches"". Allow Twitter content?

""Are we really going to focus on the vile views of this insignificant questioner to undermine the significant answers on a serious issue from five powerful men, one of whom will become PM?""she asked on Twitter,external. In response to criticism about choosing a solicitor who had worked for the Labour Party as a guest on the debate programme, the BBC said: ""Last night's questioners held a range of political views and we did not specify these views nor their backgrounds although some chose to do so themselves. ""The last questioner on the debate is a solicitor who was seconded by his law firm to the Labour Party in the past, rather than being a Labour 'staffer'.

Hammond: Brexit war chest may disappear,"Philip Hammond is set to warn that a no-deal Brexit would harm the British economy, devour a Â£26.6bn Brexit war chest, and risk the break-up of the UK. The chancellor is expected to say that Conservative candidates who are vying to be the next prime minister must come up with a Brexit plan ""B"". If they do not, he will hint that a second referendum could be needed to break the Parliamentary deadlock. He will also pour cold water on tax and spending pledges by the candidates. Mr Hammond is set to say in a speech at the annual Mansion House dinner in the City of London on Thursday that a no-deal Brexit would soak up Â£26.6bn that has been set aside that could otherwise be spent by an incoming prime minister. In a BBC debate on Tuesday, leadership candidates promised tax cuts and increased spending on public services. However, a no-deal Brexit would mean that was not possible, and would also leave the UK economy ""permanently smaller"", Mr Hammond will say. In March, the chancellor pledged to spend the war chest to boost the economy,if MPs voted to leave the European Union with a deal. UK firms 'not even close to ready' for no deal No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? How the Brexit timetable could unfold Conservative candidates including Boris Johnson havepledged to leave the EU by 31 October, even if that means quitting without a deal. But a no-deal Brexit would ""risk the Union"", Mr Hammond is expected to say. ""I cannot imagine a Conservative and Unionist-led government, actively pursuing a no-deal Brexit; willing to risk the Union and our economic prosperity,"" he will say. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson told party members on Tuesday to ""take a long, hard look at themselves"" after a YouGov survey suggested 63% would back Brexit even if it meant Scotland leaving the UK. In April, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would push for a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021if the country, which voted Remain, is taken out of the EU. Mr Hammond is also expected to say that certain ""truths"" will not change no matter who is leader. Unless there is a general election, Parliament will not support a no-deal, and is unlikely to support the deal that has already been negotiated, he will say. So candidates need to spell out their ""Plan B"", he is expected to argue. The EU will not renegotiate Theresa May's Brexit deal, and the problem of the Irish border ""will not go away"", Mr Hammond will add, saying that Tory leadership candidates ""need to be honest with the public"". The chancellor will also caution the men vying to lead his party that they have to ""recognise and address the difficult trade-offs inherent in delivering Brexit"". Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? Quick Q&A: Tory candidates' Brexit plans Candidates will also need to say how they will bring about Brexit without harming the economy or breaking up the UK, he will say. The leadership contenders ""need realistic strategies for taking the UK economy out of the holding pattern in which it has been stuck for the last nine months and landing it safely on the runway marked 'prosperity Brexit'"". ""If the new prime minister cannot end the deadlock in Parliament, then he will have to explore other democratic mechanisms to break the impasse,"" Mr Hammond will add, hinting at a second referendum, or even a general election. However, Mr Hammond's expected speech was ""yet another example of how far the Tories are cut off from the real world,"" said Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell. ""Hammond's austerity policies have resulted in a near decade of suffering for hungry children, a surge in food bank use, rising in-work poverty, squeezed incomes for families and unprecedented cutbacks to public services,"" he said.

White hits double as England top groupEllen White scores twice as England beat Japan 2-0 to finish top of Group D with a 100% record at the Women's World Cup.,"This video can not be played England beat Japan 2-0 to top their group England face a favourable draw in the Women's World Cup last 16 after they beat 2011 winners Japan to finish top of Group D thanks to two Ellen White goals. Lionesses boss Phil Neville seemingly took a gamble by making eight changes to the side that beat Argentina in the second group game. But in White, who returned to the side, they have a finisher of real class as she scored her 30th and 31st England goals either side of the break from clever through balls. England still stuttered playing out from the back against the 2015 finalists, who beat the Lionesses in the semi-finals four years ago. Our style is non-negotiable says Neville as England top group Football Daily: Scotland dream over after cruel, cruel exit You rated White your player of the match Kumi Yokoyama's early 35-yard free-kick was tipped onto the bar by Karen Bardsley while Japan took control of midfield and peppered England's goal as Neville's side suffered a second-half dip. But they could not find the decisive touch and finished second in the group to face the winners of Group E, which includes the Netherlands and Canada. England will face a seemingly easier task - in the next round at least - as they travel to Valenciennes on Sunday to play a best third-placed team, which could be one of China, New Zealand, Cameroon, Chile or Thailand. However, topping the group does leave England in the half of the draw containing hosts France and potentially the holders the USA. Relive the action from Nice Fixtures and BBC coverage This video can not be played 'What a finish!' - White scores England's opener England started their World Cup campaign well by winning their opening two games for the first time, yet there had been questions about their link play in attack with Fran Kirby starting in the number 10 position. Georgia Stanway, who was making her first World Cup start, replaced the Chelsea forward but instantly looked at home by firing in two trademark shots, which were saved, before a clever through ball which allowed White to slot past Ayaka Yamashita. White, who will link up with Stanway at Manchester City having joined the club last month, also scored the opening goal against Japan in England's final group game of the 2011 World Cup, which they won before losing to France in the last eight. This video can not be played White gets the second England needed with a composed finish Rachel Daly impressed despite starting in an unfamiliar role on the right wing in place of Nikita Parris. While she is unlikely to replace the now Lyon forward in England's last-16 game, she was full of running and complemented Lucy Bronze on England's right-hand side. White's second came after Stanway's replacement, Karen Carney, slipped the ball through for the forward's third goal of the tournament. It proved how important the 30-year-old will be as England aim to go one better than their third-place finish four years ago. In the first half, England impressed on the counter-attack and in the final third, but they still showed signs of struggling to play their way out from the back at times, and also yielded possession too easily after the break. Neville has warned of playing 'stand-still football' before, and it almost cost them early on after Keira Wash gave the ball away, allowing Yokoyama to shoot over. The Japanese forward was more accurate after eight minutes when her 35-yard free-kick was superbly tipped onto the bar by Bardsley, who returned to the side after missing out against Argentina. Japan, who lost 3-0 to England in the SheBelieves Cup in March, were often more inventive in midfield, but lacked the cutting edge that England offered. Substitute Yuika Sugasawa twice came closest to an equaliser, firstly when she stretched to meet a left-wing cross but poked inches wide with Bardsley struggling to cover. Bardsley then made a superb last-ditch save to deny Sugasawa once more. Although England will need to tighten up in midfield, and have plenty to work on, in White and Bardsley they at least have two players at the most important ends of the pitch on top form. Three shots, two on target and two goals - an exceptional display from the England forward. Goalkeeper Karen Bardsley deserves a mention because her superb keeping kept Japan at bay England manager Phil Neville on BBC Radio 5 Live:""The objective before the game was to win the game, get the three wins and top the group - we've done that. ""We needed this game I think to have a different test and we got that. Some of our play in the first half was fantastic, but in the second half a few of the players that maybe hadn't played as much got a little bit tired. But it's job done and we're looking forward to the last 16. ""We don't need to do much work [on our sloppy passing] we just need to take care with our simple passes and need to keep it tight. My experienced players Stephanie Houghton, Lucy Bronze and Karen Bardsley did well and Ellen White is banging them in so it's a happy house. ""[White and Jodie Taylor] have scored four goals between them in three games. I love it when my centre-forwards are scoring goals."" Japan coach Asako Takakura:""England are a very good team, very powerful. Their attack was very quick and we were trying to respond to that. We conceded a goal in the first half because of an error, and then we backed off a little because of that. ""But in the second half we did manage to gain our composure but unfortunately we couldn't score. Then, again, England scored. We managed to get through to the knockout stage and the things we should do have been defined in our past matches."" England, who now progress as Group D winners, have won all three of their group stage matches at the Women's World Cup for the first time. England have now won each of their five final group stage games at the Women's World Cup - the Lionesses are the only side to have played at multiple tournaments and maintain a 100% win ratio. Japan have lost a group stage match at the Women's World Cup for the first time in six games, since they also lost to England 2-0 in 2011. However, the Japanese went on to win that tournament, beating the USA on penalties in the final. Only Fara Williams (five) has netted more Women's World Cup goals for England than White, whose second goal this evening was her fourth for the Lionesses in World Cups.

White hits double as England top group,"This video can not be played England beat Japan 2-0 to top their group England face a favourable draw in the Women's World Cup last 16 after they beat 2011 winners Japan to finish top of Group D thanks to two Ellen White goals. Lionesses boss Phil Neville seemingly took a gamble by making eight changes to the side that beat Argentina in the second group game. But in White, who returned to the side, they have a finisher of real class as she scored her 30th and 31st England goals either side of the break from clever through balls. England still stuttered playing out from the back against the 2015 finalists, who beat the Lionesses in the semi-finals four years ago. Our style is non-negotiable says Neville as England top group Football Daily: Scotland dream over after cruel, cruel exit You rated White your player of the match Kumi Yokoyama's early 35-yard free-kick was tipped onto the bar by Karen Bardsley while Japan took control of midfield and peppered England's goal as Neville's side suffered a second-half dip.

Corbyn warned over 'full Remain' stance,"More than 25 Labour MPs have written to Jeremy Corbyn to urge him not to go ""full Remain"" as the party reviews its stance on another Brexit referendum. They warn another referendum would be ""toxic"" and empower the ""populist right"" in many Labour heartlands. They call on the leadership to abandon their pursuit of a ""perfect deal"" and to back an agreement by 31 October. Mr Corbyn told colleagues on Wednesday afternoon it was ""right to demand any deal is put to a public vote"". Speaking at a shadow cabinet meeting, Mr Corbyn said he would be listening to colleagues and consulting with trade unions before officially setting out Labour's position next week. Deputy leader Tom Watson, a vocal advocate of another referendum, told ITV's Peston show what had yet to be decided was whether Labour would campaign to remain in a future vote. He warned that Labour ""could be electoral history unless it makes a clear statement of intent"" that it saw the UK's future lying within the EU. Labour had promised a vote in certain circumstances, specifically if it could not get its own deal with the EU passed by MPs or if there was no general election. Following the party's poor performance in the European elections last month, Mr Corbyn said there ""had to be a public vote"" on any deal agreed with Brussels. How could another referendum work? 'High price to pay' for Labour ambiguity Some senior figures, though, still want him to go further - to campaign for another referendum now and wholeheartedly fight to remain. In a speech on Monday, deputy leader Tom Watson said Labour's ""ambiguity"" over the issue had cost it votes in last month's European elections, with voters turning to the Lib Dems and other unashamedly pro-Remain parties. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said both Tom Watson and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, unsurprisingly, argued strongly for a shift to Remain at the shadow cabinet meeting. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell - Mr Corbyn's right-hand man - also said the party could no longer ""triangulate"" on the issue - attempting to find a third position somewhere between Leave and Remain. Earlier, Iain Watson said the MPs' letter reflected the ongoing tensions within the party on the issue. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Signatories to the letter include Caroline Flint, Lisa Nandy, Jim Fitzpatrick, Stephen Kinnock and Dan Jarvis. They say ""a commitment to a second referendum would be toxic to our bedrock Labour voters, driving a wedge between them and our party"". They warn the Brexit Party, which ran Labour a close second in the recent Peterborough by-election, poses a ""potent"" threat to Labour in many of its traditional heartlands. They point to the ""devastating"" losses the party suffered in the North East and the Midlands in last month's council elections and warn of serious electoral consequences for the party if the UK does not leave the EU ""without further undue delay"". Many of the MPs are in Leave-supporting constituencies, butas signatory Caroline Flint points out,external, even those who are not ""share concerns that a Stop Brexit referendum would drive a wedge between our bedrock support and our party"".

A large number of Labour MPs believe any deal on the terms of the UK's withdrawal needs to be put to a public vote, with the option to remain in the EU on the ballot paper. But Mr Corbyn has always been more cautious, and even after coming third in the European elections, he said another referendum was still ""some way off"". In his opening remarks to Tuesday's shadow cabinet meeting, he told his frontbench team Labour's evolving position on a referendum was ""in line"" with the stance agreed by party members last year that a public vote was ""an option"" if other avenues to prevent a no-deal exit were exhausted. ""I have already made the case... that it is now right to demand that any deal is put to a public vote,"" he said. ""A ballot paper would need to contain real choices for both Leave and Remain voters. This will, of course, depend on Parliament."" During the Soviet Union, the positioning of politicians on podiums and the placing of articles in Pravda were seized on by Western observers to prove what might be going on behind the scenes. And a certain sort of Kremlinology is required trying to work out where Labour's Brexit plan is heading next. I make no comparison between Mr Corbyn's Labour's party and the USSR, of course. I only mean statements and interviews are picked apart by journalists looking for clues and signs of a shift. Pro-referendum campaigners detect a small shift in Jeremy Corbyn's latest statement, saying a referendum on a deal should include options that satisfy Leave and Remain voters alike. Mr Corbyn's team insists he is only repeating what has been said before. What's clear is pressure within Labour is building. Those like Tom Watson in the shadow cabinet calling unequivocally for another public vote are competing with about two dozen Labour MPs representing Leave seats warning their leader another referendum would be a disaster. A view shared by the party's chairman and key Corbyn ally Ian Lavery. So for now, the talking and consulting continues. A decision is delayed. But very soon, Jeremy Corbyn is going to have to choose.

Tesco mulls high-end convenience stores,"Shares in supermarkets have fallen sharply after Tesco said it was considering plans for a new chain of high-end convenience stores. The proposal for a chain based on its Tesco Finest food range comes nine months after the supermarket giant openeddiscount retailer Jack's. Although Tesco has set no date for its latest venture, upmarket rivals Marks & Spencer and Ocado saw their shares fall 3.5% and 4% respectively. Tesco's own share price was volatile. It made gains at the start of the day, then went into reverse, but was up 0.25% by mid-afternoon. Sainsbury's shares were down 0.8%, while Morrisons' were up 0.7%. Tesco Bank to pull out of mortgage market Lidl expansion ramps up supermarket battle Can Tesco beat the discounters? The market reaction came after Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis unveiled the Finest stores plan to analysts and investors on Tuesday. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Lewis said: ""Tesco Finest as a brand is one of the largest food brands in the country. We have a very high percentage of more upmarket customers. ""The opportunity to curate that range and bring new things in a more convenient outlet is something that we have tested, is something we're interested in."" If it comes to fruition, the move has the potential to upset the plans ofM&S and Ocado, who confirmed in February that they were setting up a joint venture. Under that deal, M&S will buy a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for Â£750m. It will then deliver M&S grocery products from September 2020 at the latest, when Ocado's deal with Waitrose expires. But while Tesco mulls the possibility of high-end outlets to compete with the likes of M&S's Simply Food stores, there appears to be a question mark over the future of Jack's, which was designed to take on discount retailers Lidl and Aldi. Tesco has not announced any plans for adding to Jack's nine stores. Since the discount chain opened its first outlets in September last year, it has sold Â£24m of products.

Fact-checking candidates' claims,"The BBC Reality Check team has been checking claims made by the five remaining candidates to replace Theresa May in their live BBC debate. Here are the verdicts on one claim from each of them in the event chaired by Emily Maitlis. All the candidates were asked about their plan for the Irish border after Brexit (most want to change the Irish backstop plan negotiated by Theresa May to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Boris Johnson was challenged by Rory Stewart to detail what tariffs (taxes on imports) would be charged on agricultural goods crossing the border. He said there would be ""no tariffs or quotas"" because ""what we want to do is get a standstill in our current arrangements under GATT 24"" until a free trade deal had been negotiated. GATT 24 is an article of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  Supporters of a no-deal Brexit say it would allow the UK to continue to trade with the EU without tariffs for up to 10 years, while the two sides were negotiating a permanent future trade agreement. But you can't use it in this way - a trade agreement has to be agreed in principle before Article 24 can be used. It also needs the two sides to agree - the UK can't just impose it on the EU.You can read more about it here. Home Secretary Sajid Javid outlined his plan to keep the Irish border open after Brexit - he said he would use existing technology. Other borders between EU and non-EU countries do use technology - for example at the Sweden-Norway border cars go through unmanned border posts equipped with cameras that use an automatic number plate recognition system and goods are declared to customs before they leave warehouses. But there is still some physical infrastructure. The EU still requires physical checks of goods at the Swedish border, so this system alone wouldn't eliminate the need for checks at the border in Ireland - a key sticking point in negotiations. You can read more about the question oftechnology on the Irish border here. Michael Gove used a figure on good and outstanding schools that has been criticised by the UK Statistics Authority. You can read theletter to the secretary of state for education here,external. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was talking about schools. ""You have nearly 25% of primary school leavers unable to read - I want us to be the Conservative government that abolishes illiteracy,"" he said. While 25% of year 6 pupils in 2018 failed to meet the expected standard for reading, that does not mean they were unable to read. Last week, the governmentsaid it would pass a law,externalcommitting the UK to cutting net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 (that means any remaining emissions will be offset by investing in carbon reduction projects in other countries). Rory Stewart said that it was the most ambitious target so far set by any advanced industrial economy. The UK would indeed be the first major industrial economy to legislate in this way, and the first G7 country to set a net-zero emissions target by 2050. But, the Green Partyhas pointed out,externalthat Norway has a 2030 target for net-zero emissions, while Finland has committed to be carbon neutral by 2035.

They were 3-0 up and cruising into the last 16, only to chuck all that good work out the window. A truly spectacular collapse. From euphoria to despair in the space of 15 minutes, with late, late VAR drama thrown into the mix. At least they got there, that's something to be proud of, but to blow such a wonderful chance of progressing is going to hurt for a long, long time. The World Cup goes on but Scotland go home. Good night... FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Steven ThompsonFormer Scotland striker on BBC Sportsound It's difficult to be too harsh on the players just now but ultimately it's failure and disappointment. We threw it all away.  FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina During that gut-wrenching post-match interview,Scotland captain Rachel Corsietook a moment to appreciate the silver lining to the dark cloud currently looming over the Parc de Prince: ""I'm proud of everybody. We absolutely gave everything. I never questioned that. ""I thought tonight we were outstanding and deserved to be three goals ahead. And we'll be back. The girls are upset but we'll bounce back. We always do."" FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Scotland head coach Shelley Kerradds: âPeople will argue you canât concede three goals but it does
put you under pressure when you concede one. We didnât deal with the ball
around the edge of the box with the second one and obviously the third is a
penalty. âIâm gutted for the players, gutted for the support but I
have to say the officiating was really, really poor. âI canât really say any more about the decisions. We have
been a victim of them in every game. We still have to do better and see the game
out but right now itâs a bit raw.â FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Erin Cuthbert, who scored the third and set up the first of Scotland's goals, topped the voting. FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Scotland head coach Shelley Kerris asked to sum up her feelings and says: âI havenât got a clue. âWe were comfortable in the game. For 70 minutes we played
well. The bottom line is we have conceded three goals but the first goal is a free-kick and that changes the whole complexion of the game. ""Iâve watched the penalty again and Iâm not even sure after watching it numerous times. Some of the decisions were appalling to say the
least. There is a ball on the pitch and they play on, we try and make a substitution and we can't, itâs just an absolute farce but it doesnât take away the fact we were comfortable in the game and conceded three goals. ""We will look back. We are all gutted just now."" FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Tom EnglishBBC Scotland's chief sports writer on Sportsound It might be a stupid rule with the goalkeeper having a foot on the line at the penalty kick but all the players know it's the law.  FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Scotland goalscorer Jen Beattietells BBC Scotland: ""It's tough. To give away a three-goal lead is devastating. Some of the decisions we feel hard done by but we canât give away three goals and win. We're absolutely gutted with the way things have gone. ""I'm proud of the players and the journey and hopefully weâll be back in four years."" FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Tom EnglishBBC Scotland's chief sports writer The only grievance that was relevant was the added time. The referee was all over the place. That was just weird.

FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Emma BlackFormer Scotland international on BBC Sportsound It wasn't harshly taken away. It was thrown away  FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Scotland goalkeeper Lee Alexander says she is ""devasted"" after such a terrible, late collapse. ""We deserved to win the game,"" she tells BBC Scotland. ""Countless decisions went against us in the tournament. It's hard to put into words but we know we belong on this stage. ""It should have been three points. We're absolutely gutted. We feel very hard done by over the three games. I don't know how Argentina kept 11 players on the park.""  FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Scotland captain Rachel Corsieis beside herself with disbelief at full time. Speaking to the BBC, she says: ""I thought we were outstanding. We just weren't going to get the decisions and that was the bottom line. The third goal is ridiculous. It was clear for everyone to see that we were still making a substitution. I don't understand how that can be allowed at this level. ""They're making the rules really, really strict and we were making a substitution while we were defending a free-kick and for some reason the referee has allowed the play to continue. It's just really, really sore that that is what has ultimately cost us the tournament.""  FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina Where do we start the inquest? We could be here all night. Scotland have conceded a penalty in every match. The ones against England and Japan were soft but there was no doubt about this one. We can't grumble too much about the retake since Lee Alexander did have both feet off her line. However, there is cause to feel hard done by as the fourth official had just finished fussing over Fiona Brown's introduction when Argentina took the free kick which led to fellow sub Sophie Howard giving away the spot-kick away. There should also have been considerably more time added on after all the VAR delays but that's entering straw-clutching territory. It all boils down to a catastrophic lack of focus after going 3-0 up... FT: Scotland 3-3 Argentina The Scotland players are in a huddle, with captain Rachel Corsie delivering an impassioned message. A result like this is going to take a long time to recover from.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Prince Harry comments 'surprised' Fornite makers,"The makers of Fortnite say they were ""surprised"" when Prince Harry called the game ""irresponsible"". Back in April, the Duke of Sussex said the gameshould be banned. ""It's created to addict and keep you in front of the computer for as long as possible,"" he said at the time. Speaking in front of MPs about video game addiction today, Canon Pence - who works for Epic Games - said they were ""quite taken aback"" by Prince Harry's comments. ""The statements made could not be further from the truth in our designs and philosophy and multi-decade approach to developing a long-term and sustainable relationship with our audience,"" he added. Mr Pence's comments were made at a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee meeting. Fortnite has 200 million registered players Epic Games' Canon Pence and Matthew Weissinger were questioned alongside Shaun Campbell and Kerry Hopkins from Electronic Arts, who make games like Fifa and Battlefield. Both games companies were questioned as the government is currently looking into how harmful social media and online gaming can be for young people - its safety plans are known as the Online Harms White Paper. EA make the Fifa franchise Google, Instagram and YouTube have already given evidence to the committee about the effects of social media. Some of the questions at the DCMS meeting focused on whether games makers should offer a duty of care to players to ensure their welfare and whether there could be a better way to verify the ages of players. Matthew Weissinger, who is Epic's head of marketing, said Fortnite has ""a number of parental controls"" to stop young users from being exploited by spending lots of money on the game. ""We're not interested in maximising profit from our players, we want to have an open and honest relationship,"" he said, adding that the maximum someone could spend in their Battle Royale game was around $200 (Â£159). EA was asked by the committee about games addiction and how long users could spend playing things like Fifa. Fortnite's Battle Royale has several game add-ins Shaun Campbell, who is EA's UK manager, said he himself sometimes spent around half an hour a day playing, saying the game was designed ""to be engaging and fun to play"". ""We want players to take a healthy and balanced approach to playing games, just like anything else. ""If you look at Fifa players, they are competitive and some want a career in E-Sports so they practise and spend time playing the game. It's about what feels out of balance for an individual,"" he added. Both game-makers were also asked how closely they looked at the age of their players and whether they collected data on that. PlayStation is the most popular platform for FIFA users in the UK, EA says Kerry Hopkins, who runs EA's legal team, said it was the job of console makers like Sony to verify ages and was actually part of the sign-up process in creating an account. ""You can't create a PlayStation account if you are under 18. A parent has to set parental controls,"" she said. ""They can make choices about the time spent playing games and how much money is spent."" Canon Pence agreed saying: ""It's our intention to collect the minimum amount of player data - Sony already has that account information"".

There is intense national rivalry over the successors to Jean-Claude Juncker and other key figures. As Friday's newspaper front pages begin to be released, here is how some have covered the result of today's leadership ballots. This video can not be played 'Underdog' Hunt to 'prove people wrong' Jeremy Hunt says he is confident of winning the Tory Party leadership and succeeding Theresa May as prime minister ""As well as a sensible debate on Brexit, the country and the party want to hear about our vision beyond Brexit,"" he says. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Now, there's no doubt that Boris Johnson is, at this stage (and there's a long way to go), widely expected to end up in Number 10. But this result is an enormous relief to his camp, for the simple reason that they think Jeremy Hunt is easier to beat. Forget any differences in style between the two challengers and their comparative talents - Mr Hunt voted Remain in the EU referendum. And for many Tory members it is a priority for the next leader to have been committed to that cause, rather than a recent convert, however zealous. Of course, pay attention to recent political history. Upsets are the norm. Outsiders become insiders. Strange things happen, and that's before you price in Mr Johnson's ability to cause havoc for himself. But this result has left Mr Johnson's camp hugely relieved. Read more from Laura Jeremy Hunt oversaw the London Olympics as culture secretary and was the UK's longest-serving health secretary. Before entering Parliament, Mr Hunt had a career as an English teacher in Japan and as an entrepreneur. Take a closer look at his recordhere The frontrunner in the race to be Conservative leader and prime minister, Boris Johnson, is one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. But that high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy.

Jeremy Hunt has been speaking to reporters on camera after the result, again acknowledging his status as underdog but adding: ""I like to prove people wrong"". He says the way he will win the members' ballot is by persuading them that the best way to deliver Brexit is by choosing a prime minister the EU ""will engage with"", but who is also ""prepared to walk away"". Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson will take part in a series of hustings in front of Conservative members around the country ahead of a vote to decide who is the next Tory leader and PM. The Conservative Party says there have been 20,000 applications for places at the 16 members' hustings. Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis said: ""I'm delighted with the strong interest in our hustings to date, showing the vitality of our party in every nation and region of the UK. ""We are conscious that the Conservatives are not just selecting a new leader but also the next prime minister, and we take that responsibility extremely seriously at such an important time for our nation."" Who will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker at the Berlaymont? As one top job takes a step towards being filled, over in Brussels EU leaders are currently discussing who should be their candidate to fill another - the next president of the European Commission. The person replacing current incumbent Jean-Claude Juncker will take office in early November. They will play an important role in the future shape of Brexit regardless of what happens next, whether in managing the impact of a no-deal or overseeing future trade talks. Among those in the frame to be put forward is German MEP Manfred Weber - who once called for Boris Johnsonto be fired,externalback when he was the UK's foreign secretary. Other potential rivals include EU veteran Frans Timmermans, Danish EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager, and current EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Find out more here Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Boris Johnson's main connection to Northern Ireland used to be his fleet of red buses. In 2013, the thenmayor of London opened a Wrightbus plant in Ballymena, County Antrim, where parts for them are made. Few would have bet that within six years, he would be a front-runner to become PM. Battling him for the keys to Number 10 is Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary who insists he's best placed to strengthen the union of the United Kingdom. But what are their positions on central issues such as the ongoing political crisis in Stormont, the Tories' confidence-and-supply partners the DUP, and the Irish border question?

How will the campaign between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt play out? Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Mr Hunt will portray himself as a born again Brexiteer, who would contemplate no deal - and as an apparently more competent minister, someone who also has more chance of delivering a deal. The candidates' differences on Brexit seem in truth miniscule, each professing they want a deal that bins the backstop, or time limits it, despite likely opposition from Brussels. Beyond Brexit, Mr Hunt will suggest that he is a champion of the least well off, the better to contrast with Johnson's ambition to take more people out of the higher tax band. But Mr Johnson has two clear advantages with the members. First, he will cite polling to say only he has the chance of beating Labour if there is an early election. a distinct possibility for a leader of a minority government. Second, he has the ability to make the party feel good about itself. He paints a big picture in vivid primary colours. Read more from Iain BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

"Tesco mulls high-end convenience storesThe supermarket's plan rattles upmarket rival brands, sending their shares lower.BusinessComments","Shares in supermarkets have fallen sharply after Tesco said it was considering plans for a new chain of high-end convenience stores. The proposal for a chain based on its Tesco Finest food range comes nine months after the supermarket giant openeddiscount retailer Jack's. Although Tesco has set no date for its latest venture, upmarket rivals Marks & Spencer and Ocado saw their shares fall 3.5% and 4% respectively. Tesco's own share price was volatile. It made gains at the start of the day, then went into reverse, but was up 0.25% by mid-afternoon. Sainsbury's shares were down 0.8%, while Morrisons' were up 0.7%. Tesco Bank to pull out of mortgage market Lidl expansion ramps up supermarket battle Can Tesco beat the discounters? The market reaction came after Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis unveiled the Finest stores plan to analysts and investors on Tuesday. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Lewis said: ""Tesco Finest as a brand is one of the largest food brands in the country. We have a very high percentage of more upmarket customers. ""The opportunity to curate that range and bring new things in a more convenient outlet is something that we have tested, is something we're interested in."" If it comes to fruition, the move has the potential to upset the plans ofM&S and Ocado, who confirmed in February that they were setting up a joint venture. Under that deal, M&S will buy a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for Â£750m. It will then deliver M&S grocery products from September 2020 at the latest, when Ocado's deal with Waitrose expires. But while Tesco mulls the possibility of high-end outlets to compete with the likes of M&S's Simply Food stores, there appears to be a question mark over the future of Jack's, which was designed to take on discount retailers Lidl and Aldi. Tesco has not announced any plans for adding to Jack's nine stores. Since the discount chain opened its first outlets in September last year, it has sold Â£24m of products.

Brexit plans in 50 words?,"The Conservative leadership candidates all know that solving the Brexit conundrum is their number one task. But how do they propose to solve the problems? And if they can't, what are their contingency plans? BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asked the remaining leadership candidates to outline their Brexit proposals. The catch? To answer the questions in 50 words or less. See how they did... How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? First, I'll negotiate a full stop to the backstop - a guarantee it can never be permanent. Second, I'll secure a Union Guarantee in international law so that our United Kingdom cannot be undermined. Third, I'll secure a Canada-style Free Trade Agreement which takes back control of our laws, borders and money. How would you get the deal through Parliament? I would involve Conservative MPs in shaping our negotiating stance and install a negotiating team led by politicians. My Union Guarantee will help me secure the support of the DUP. I also have a track record working across political divides, and would work with opposition MPs committed to Brexit. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I want to deliver Brexit as soon as possible and before 31 October. However, I have said that if it will take a few more days or weeks to finalise a deal, I would be prepared to contemplate a short delay. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? I will always choose Brexit over no Brexit. So if it ultimately came to a choice, I would choose no deal over no Brexit. I led the Vote Leave campaign. I am determined to finish what I started and ensure we leave the EU. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? This is a false choice. We need to honour the referendum and deliver Brexit before there is an election. We must not blunder into a confidence vote which we could lose. I am categorically opposed to a second referendum, which is only advocated for by people who want to remain. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? To leave. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? We are not pretending it's going to be easy but the EU doesn't want no deal and there is a deal to be done if the right team is sent to negotiate it. I will present Brussels with a credible plan and a new negotiating team so they have confidence it can get through Parliament. How would you get the deal through Parliament? We have to deal with the biggest issue Parliament has which is the backstop that could leave the UK permanently trapped in the customs union against its will. Changing the deal to address this concern, while maintaining support from across the Conservative Party and DUP, will get Brexit delivered. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I have always believed that if the only way to deliver Brexit was through no deal, then I would pursue that. But I would not pursue no deal, with all the risks it involves, if there was the chance of a good deal. What I would not do is set a hard stop on 31 October by which we would be forced into no deal, even if it meant an election and Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? I started my own business and negotiated for every day of my professional life -  I am wholly focused on making sure it succeeds. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We have to give the country better choices than these, and as an experienced negotiator who understands European leaders, I am best placed to do that. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? We don't want another referendum, but if there was one I would vote to leave. The people have decided and the democratic risk of not delivering their decision is colossal. We have to get on with it and that's exactly what I would do. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? We need to focus on the one thing that's needed to get a deal through Parliament: alternative arrangements to the backstop. And we need to work with Ireland - the key player in this - to deliver those arrangements, beginning with a bold offer to pick up their costs for technological solutions. How would you get the deal through Parliament? Parliament has already voted for the current withdrawal agreement with changes to the backstop. That's why it's what I'd focus on securing with the EU. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? We need to leave the EU on 31 October. I am confident we can agree a deal - and Parliament will support what it has already voted for in the past. But if it comes to a choice between no deal, and no Brexit, I would have to back no deal. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? No deal is the default if Parliament cannot agree a deal - and I would make sure we are fully prepared for it. But we have to be honest about what the choice is. We cannot accept no Brexit as an outcome. So either we agree a deal, or leave without one on 31 October. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We can't reduce this debate to false choices. We've asked the public too many times already for their views on Brexit. Once should have been enough. They want us to get on with it now. Asking yet again would risk irreparable damage to trust in our democracy. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? I've been clear we need to get on with Brexit - no second referendum. The people delivered a clear instruction to the British people, and as I said at the time it is our job as elected politicians to deliver it, however we voted at the time. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? It's clear that the prime minister's deal is dead - having been rejected by Parliament three times. We should have come out by March and both of the main political parties are paying the price for failing to do so. We now need to make sure we come out on 31 October, come what may, and we need to show that we are serious about leaving with no deal. To be clear, I don't want no deal, but it's only by being serious you can be confident of getting a new, better deal. How would you get the deal through Parliament? Parliament has already made clear that it is willing to vote for a better deal, and last week made clear that it wasn't willing to take no deal off the table. I am confident that, so long as we can address MPs' concerns with the old withdrawal agreement, we can strike a new deal that Parliament will want to vote for. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? I am not planning for failure. Politics has changed since 29 March, and I believe that MPs now realise they need to deliver on the result of the referendum, or risk a devastating breach in public confidence in our politics. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? Again, I am not planning for failure. We must deliver on the democratic wishes of the British people. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? Neither. It's clear that the public doesn't want to us to force them to vote again. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? Leave, but there isn't going to be another referendum if I become prime minister. How will you get a deal agreed with the EU? I would not negotiate a new deal with the EU. I would take through the deal we have already got. Pretending that we can get a different deal out of Brussels is simply a recipe for more uncertainty and delay. How would you get the deal through Parliament? All deals have to go through Parliament. The current deal has 270 votes. We need 45 more. The European Elections are an electric shock which will make MPs determined to get Brexit done. There is only one door - Parliament. And one key - getting a majority. If Parliament votes the deal down, what is your contingency plan? My plan B would be a Brexit Assembly. It worked in Ireland to resolve the impasse on abortion. While Parliament will always remain sovereign, the Assembly would present a clear recommendation on the best way forward to break the deadlock. What would you do if your contingency plan fails? In the end I - like everyone else - would have to return to getting a deal through Parliament. Parliament is sovereign. It is the only law-making body in the country. If you had to make a choice between an election and another referendum, which would you choose? We will only have to face that hideous choice in the future if we fail to engage with reality now. As leader I would avoid both by getting a deal through Parliament. I do not want to see a general election until 2022, and I think a second referendum would be deeply damaging to this country as well as to faith in our democracy. Would you campaign to leave or stay in the EU in another referendum? It's because I am the only candidate engaging with the reality of delivering on the result of the first referendum that I can confidently say we won't be having a second.

"Flats out of fashion with first-time buyersFirst-time buyers are keen to jump straight to a house, leading to cheaper apartment prices, experts say.BusinessComments","First-time buyers are bypassing flats and moving straight into houses - leading to a fall in the cost of apartments, official figures suggest. The cost of a typical apartment or maisonette in England has fallen by 2.1% in a year, while other types of property have become more expensive. Experts suggest people are buying their first home later and are happy to rent a flat, but not necessarily buy one. Many apartments being built in cities are designed specifically for rental. The cost of detached homes has been rising fastest, with semi-detached and terraced homes also going up in England,figures from the Land Registry,externalshow. In Wales, prices of all types of property are going up, but rises are slowest among flats and maisonettes. First-time buyers want to buy a home to live in for longer than their predecessors, according to Richard Donnell, insight director at Zoopla. This meant they were more likely to push themselves to buy something bigger and wanted to ""leapfrog"" flats, he said. He said that the fall in demand from investors, many of whom have pulled out of the market, had affected demand for flats. Primarily the slowdown in the market in London and the South East of England had meant lower demand for flats, as there was a heavy concentration of apartments in the capital. Major housing projects from the old Battersea Power Station in London to plans for the Metalworks in Liverpool suggest that developers still see plenty of demand for city flats. The overall trend suggests that apartments are becoming more affordable. Research for online estate agents Housesimple suggests buyers can purchase a flat for less than Â£80,000 in 17 towns and cities in the UK.

Alcohol sales drop as minimum price kicks in,"Scots bought less alcohol in 2018 than any year since records began in the early 1990s, according to a new report. Analysis by NHS Health Scotland found Scottish adults still bought more alcohol than people in England and Wales on average but the gap narrowed. A minimum price per unit of alcohol was introduced on 1 May last year in a bid to tackle Scotland's drink culture. The authors of the report said it was not possible to quantify the impact but ""early indicators were encouraging"". Examples of prices Â£14Whisky (70cl bottle at 40% ABV) Â£13.13Vodka (70cl bottle at 37.5% ABV) Â£1Lager (500ml can at 4% ABV) Â£2.50Cider (1 litre bottle at 5% - normal strength) Â£4.69Red wine (75cl bottle at 12.5% ABV) Scotland was the first country in the world to introduce minimum unit pricing (MUP), although others places operate different forms of price control. Minimum pricing was largely aimed at raising the cost of cheap lager, cider and spirits sold in supermarkets and off-licences to reduce consumption. The 2019 MESAS (Monitoring and Evaluating Scotland's Alcohol Strategy) report said: The average Scottish adult bought 19 units of alcohol per week (The UK recommended limit was 14 units a week for men and women). The annual volume of ""pure alcohol"" in drinks sold in Scotland was 9.9 litres per adult, down about 3% from 10.2 litres in 2017. The volume of alcohol is 9% higher than in England and Wales (9.1 litres) - the smallest difference since 2003. Since 2010 the volume of pure alcohol sold per adult through supermarkets and off-licences has fallen by 9% in Scotland. It has risen by 3% in England and Wales over the same period. The report said alcohol continued to be a leading cause of illness and early death in Scotland, with an average of 22 people dying of alcohol-related illness every week. The Scottish government brought in minimum unit pricing to target the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol, which it said attracted problem drinkers. The new law looked at the amount of alcohol in a drink and set a minimum price of 50p for each unit. Under the rules, a 70cl bottle of vodka, at a strength of 37.5% abv, would be 26.25 units and cost Â£13.13. Scotland ends cheap booze as minimum price starts Has new alcohol law changed drinking habits? Lucie Giles, public health intelligence adviser at NHS Health Scotland, said the minimum pricing law led to the biggest rise in the average price of alcohol for a decade and a ""substantial"" fall in the volume of alcohol sold at very low prices. For the first time, less alcohol was sold below 50p per unit in Scotland than south of the border. Following Scotland's introduction of the policy,members of the Welsh Assembly passed legislation to introduce a minimum price for alcohol- the plans are yet to be implemented. Similar legislation has been considered for England but is not currently on the table. Ms Giles said: ""From the data in this report it's not possible to quantify the full contribution of MUP (minimum unit pricing) on alcohol prices and sales, but these are encouraging early indicators."" She said alcohol was still a ""significant public health issue"" and people in Scotland's poorest areas continued to experience the most harm. Cheap supermarket vodka was one of the drinks most affected by the minimum pricing Shopkeepers say they have seen a shift in the type of drinks people are buying and doctors say that is reflected on the wards. The official figures show a fall in sales but no real change in what we are choosing to drink. It is a small percentage of people who are the most problematic drinkers, a significant proportion of those live in poverty. Most who work in this area say there needs to be a much wider package of support to really address the country's unhealthy relationship with alcohol. One man I spoke to said minimum pricing will make no difference for this group. ""If they can't afford it, they'll steal it"" he said. We have been seeing a steady decline in alcohol sales over the past decade or so, hence the optimism today, but not a rush to claim success. The truth is, it is too early to tell whether minimum pricing is having an impact on Scotland's health. No other country in the world has tried it so a full analysis will take years to complete. The MESAS report looks at alcohol sales for 2018 but data on harm caused by drinking was for the previous year, before minimum pricing was introduced. It shows that alcohol-specific death rates were consistently higher in Scotland than in England and Wales. In 2017, rates were twice as high in men and 55% higher in women. In the most deprived areas, rates of alcohol-specific death were more than seven times higher than in the least deprived. Dr Ewan Forrest, a liver specialist at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, told BBC Scotland it was ""probably too early to say"" if there had been a reduction in alcohol harm. ""We are still seeing a lot of alcohol-related liver disease so I'm not thinking the measures taken have solved the problem but I'm hoping they have moved us in the right direction,"" he said. Liver disease specialist Dr Ewan Forrest said he thought minimum pricing was a move in the right direction Dr Forrest said he hoped to see a reduction in alcohol-related liver deaths over the next five years. He said: ""By reducing the overall consumption of alcohol and pushing some people towards stopping alcohol I hope we can prevent people who have liver disease developing full-blown liver failure."" In response to the MESAS report, BMA Scotland chair Dr Lewis Morrison said minimum pricing was ""still very much in its infancy"" but the results from the first year were ""extremely encouraging"". Alison Douglas, from Alcohol Focus Scotland, said the figures suggested the policy was ""having a real impact on the way we drink in Scotland"". The Scottish government's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said it was a ""promising start"" and the fall in sales was ""moving in the right direction"". The MESAS report shows that while Scots buy more alcohol in pubs than people in England and Wales, it is off-licences and supermarkets where the biggest difference lies. The rates of sales of spirits from off-licences were 37% higher in Scotland than in England and Wales, with sales of vodka per adult being 87% higher. Since 1994 off-trade sales in Scotland have increased by 36% while sales in pubs, clubs and restaurants have fallen by 44%. Abdul Majid, who runs a small supermarket in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, said his turnover had not been affected by the minimum pricing rules but his customers had changed what they bought. Abdul Majid said high-strength ciders had been most affected by minimum pricing He said they had moved away from high-strength (7.5% abv) ciders, which used to cost as little as Â£4 for three litres but could not now be sold for less than Â£11.25. Mr Majid said people were buying more alcopops or small bottles of spirits such as vodka. He said people had not understood the new law when it was first introduced. ""They know now that it is a minimum unit price so no matter which retailer they go to the minimum price doesn't change. ""It means that my prices and the bigger supermarket prices are now on a level playing field."" According to Mr Majid, another consequence of the price rise has been a sharp rise in shoplifting. ""We are always really surprised at the people we catch,"" he said. ""It's not always who you would expect."" Has new alcohol law changed drinking habits?

The countries that trust vaccines the least,"This video can not be played It's a numbers game... if some people are not vaccinated, it can cause a big problem for us all Public mistrust of vaccines means the world is taking a step backwards in the fight against deadly yet preventable infectious diseases, warn experts. Thebiggest global study,externalinto attitudes on immunisation suggests confidence is low in some regions. The Wellcome Trust analysis includes responses from more than 140,000 people in over 140 countries. The World Health Organization lists vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health. You need a modern browser (with JavaScript support) to view this interactive. Search for a country: Search for a country: People were asked how much they agree with the statement. Totals may not sum to 100% due to rounding  Wellcome analysed responses to five key survey questions and calculated a ""trust in scientists"" index of high, medium or low trust. Source: Wellcome Global Monitor, Gallup World Poll 2018 Sorry, there is no data for this location No internet connection. Please try again. If you can't see the interactive toolclick or tap here,external. The global survey reveals the number of people who say they have little confidence or trust in vaccination. When asked if vaccines were safe: 79% ""somewhat"" or ""strongly"" agreed 7% somewhat or strongly disagreed 14% neither agreed nor disagreed When asked if they believed vaccines worked: 84% agree either strongly or somewhat 5% either strongly or somewhat disagree 12% neither agreed nor disagreed There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against deadly and debilitating infections, such as measles. Measles can be deadly Vaccines protect billions of people around the world. They have completely got rid of one disease - smallpox - and are bringing the world close to eliminating others, such as polio. But some other diseases, such as measles, are making a resurgence and experts say people avoiding vaccines, fuelled by fear and misinformation, is one of the main causes. Dr Ann Lindstrand, an expert in immunisation at the WHO, said the current situation was extremely serious. ""Vaccine hesitancy has the potential, at least in some places, to really hinder the very real progress the world has made in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases,"" she said. ""Any resurgence we see in these diseases are an unacceptable step backwards."" What are vaccines and how do they work? Debunking vaccination myths for parents Vaccine deniers gaining traction says NHS boss Measles: How a preventable disease returned from the past Countries that were close to eliminating measles have been seeing large outbreaks. Data shows a rise in cases in almost every region of the world, with 30% more cases in 2017 than 2016. A decision not to vaccinate, for whatever reason, poses a risk to others as well as the individual from being infected themselves. If enough people are vaccinated, it stops the disease from spreading through a population - something experts call ""herd immunity"". Imran Khan, from the Wellcome Trust, said: ""We are really concerned at the moment because for measles, anything less than 95% coverage can lead to outbreaks and that is what we are seeing."" Some people living in several higher-income regions were among the least certain about vaccine safety. In France - a country among several European ones now experiencing outbreaks of measles - one in three disagreed that vaccines were safe, according to the survey. That was the highest percentage for any country worldwide. People in France were also among the most likely to disagree that vaccines were effective, at 19%, and to disagree that vaccines were important for children to have, at 10%. How smallpox claimed its final victim Measles - experts call for compulsory vaccination How anti-vaccine movements threaten global health The French government has now addedeight more compulsory vaccinations,externalto the three children in the country already receive. Neighbouring Italy - where 76% agreed vaccines were safe - recently passed a law that allows schools toban unvaccinatedchildren, or fine their parents, after immunisation rates dwindled. The UK has yet to go this far but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he ""won't rule out"" the idea of introducing compulsory vaccinations if necessary. The US has also been experiencing its ownmeasles outbreak- the biggest to hit the country in decades, with more than 980 confirmed cases in 26 states in 2019 to date. In Northern America, and Southern and Northern Europe, just over 70% of people agreed that vaccines were safe. The figure was as low as 59% in Western Europe, and 50% in Eastern Europe. In Ukraine, which reported thehighest number of measles cases in Europelast year (53,218 in total) - only 50% of people agreed vaccines were effective. This figure was 46% in Belarus, 49% in Moldova, and 62% in Russia. Most people in lower-income areas agreed vaccines were safe. The highest number was in South Asia, where 95% of people agreed, followed by Eastern Africa, where the figure was 92%. Bangladesh and Rwanda had nearly universal agreement about the safety and effectiveness and have achieved very high immunisation rates despite many challenges in physically getting vaccines to people. Rwanda became the world's first low-income country to provide young women universal access to the HPV vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. Mr Khan said: ""It shows what can be achieved with concerted effort to improve vaccine uptake."" This video can not be played One Filipino mother's worst fears were realised when her unvaccinated children caught measles In the survey, people with more trust in scientists, doctors and nurses tended to be more likely to agree that vaccines were safe. Conversely, those who had sought information about science, medicine or health recently appeared to be less likely to agree. The Wellcome report does not explore all of the reasons behind low confidence but researchers say there are likely to be many factors involved. Some of it may be complacency - if a disease has become less common, then the need to get immunised may feel less pressing when weighing the benefits against any possible risk. All medicines, vaccines included, can have side-effects. But vaccines are thoroughly tested to check they are safe and effective. The internet means beliefs and concerns about vaccines can be shared in an instant, spreading information that isn't necessarily based on fact. In Japan,concerns about the HPV vaccine and a reported link with neurological problems were widely publicised, which experts think knocked confidence in immunisation in general. Similarly, in France, there was controversy about a pandemic influenza vaccine - accusations that the government boughthigh quantities of the vaccine,externaland unsubstantiated claims that it had been made too quickly and couldn't be safe. In the UK, there has been misinformation circulating about the MMR jab and autism. Dr Lindstrand said: ""One of the most important interventions to counteract doubts and worries about vaccines is to have health workers really well trained and able and ready to recommend vaccinations based on scientific truth and to be able to respond correctly to questions and concerns that parents have and communities have.""

"MH17, Khashoggi and impunity","Do we live in a world governed by international law, or one where an individual state's interests hold sway? If people are murdered as a result of a state's actions or by actions taken by individuals associated with that state, what recourse should there be? And does it matter if that state is a strategic ally â or a potential foe? The reports fromthe Dutch-led investigation into the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner (MH17) over Ukraineand that of the special rapporteur appointed by the UN's Human Rights Council toinvestigate the unlawful death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, raise all these questions and more. These are two very different documents. One - the report on the death of the Saudi journalist in the country's consulate in Istanbul - is a document commissioned by a UN body, the Human Rights Council, and is an attempt by a specially appointed investigator to try to get to grips with the facts. It is â though hugely embarrassing and indeed critical of the Saudi authorities â not an indictment in a legal sense. The other document, on the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 with the deaths of 298 people, has the status of a legal inquiry. It has sought to develop a case strong enough to be put to a court of law. Four suspects have been identified and named: three Russian nationals and a Ukrainian. Their trial is to begin in a Dutch court in March of next year, where they will face murder charges. They are held to be responsible for transporting the Russian BUK surface-to-air missile system responsible for shooting down the airliner. MH17 plane crash in Ukraine: What we know What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? In one sense, the publication of today's two reports in part confirms what we already know. The charge is that senior members of the Saudi ruling elite, stretching up to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself, hatched and then had carried, out a plot to lure Mr Khashoggi into the Saudi consulate and brutally murder him there. In Ukraine, separatist groups - whose security forces were closely allied to those of Russia - are accused of employing a Russian-supplied air defence missile to shoot down the airliner. This video can not be played Investigators say the suspects will be charged with causing the crash and murder But what these new documents do is ensure that neither controversy is going to go away â and this will have consequences, not least of which is further complicating relations between the West and Moscow on the one hand, and with Riyadh on the other. Both episodes have already prompted some action. The US and many of its allies applied economic sanctions against Russia because of the MH17 incident. And sanctions have also been imposed against a number of named individuals in Saudi Arabia thought to be implicated in the plot against Mr Khashoggi. The dilemmas in the Saudi case are the most pressing. Saudi Arabia is, after all, a key ally of the West. The revival of the Khashoggi saga comes at a time of mounting tensions with Iran in the Gulf and also when Saudi Arabia's military's role in the Yemen conflict is once again under scrutiny. There is already a tussle between the US Congress and the administration about future arms sales to the kingdom and British weapons sales are also currently under judicial review. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Saudi Arabia has insisted that Mr Khashoggi's murderers were not acting on the Crown Prince's orders. And Britain, for example, has so far rejected any direct sanctions against him. But it is the debate in Washington that matters most. The initial murder prompted a fundamental debate about the relationship between the two countries which is far from resolved. President Trump himself has revelled in US-Saudi ties, not least their importance for the US arms industry.  But at least one seasoned diplomat has taken a very different view; a reflection of the growing tone of sentiment on Capitol Hill. The former State department official and Middle East negotiator Aaron David Miller noted recently that, in his view, Saudi Arabia isn't a strategic ally of the United States at all. In a damning assessment, he said that ""at best it's an unreliable partner that episodically shares US interests and none of its values."" Russia is clearly no friend of the West and has embarked upon a course of challenging western interests wherever possible. It is accused of intruding into national elections in several countries; the attempted murder of one of its former intelligence agents in Britain, which resulted in the death of a woman. It too has long rejected the accusations made against it and its pro-Russian Ukrainian allies. A trial is only likely to make matters worse for the Kremlin, reviving the episode in every painful detail.  And if the charges are proved, it could prompt calls for substantial further action against Moscow. None of the individuals who face charges in the Dutch courts are likely ever to appear for their trial. It is even more unlikely that the Saudi Crown Prince will face an independent legal investigation. MH17 plane crash in Ukraine: What we know What happened to Jamal Khashoggi?

Special needs pupils 'kept out of school',"This video can not be played Alex was diagnosed with autism when he was two years old More than 1,500 children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are without a school place in England, with some waiting up to two years for provision. The figures, collated by Newsnight, cover 46 English councils (25%), which suggests the real figure may be higher. One mother told the programme her son had been ""squeezed out"" of school as a ""quick cost-cutting solution"". The government said responsibility lay with local authorities. Local authorities do not routinely publish data but a series of Freedom of Information requests made over the past six months show 1,580 children with education and health care plans (EHCPs), which used to be called statements of special educational needs, have no education provision. The highest numbers came from Kent (348) and Surrey (93). Special needs shortfalls 'causing misery' The colourful 'pods' helping children go to school Special needs support 'a national scandal' Alex Palmer, six, who has autism, has not had a school place for two years, having been excluded just weeks after starting at a mainstream school in 2017. ""It just became too overwhelming for Alex and within five days of being at school full time, I had that that phone call that I knew was coming... there's issues and that ultimately your son is facing exclusion,"" his mother, Rachel, said. ""Alex shut down completely. He used to write his name and draw and paint and then following how emotionally traumatic he felt that experience wasâ¦ he wouldn't hold a pencil, he wouldn't write"". And children such as Alex could be just the tip of the iceberg. They are the ones who have an EHCP - but not all children with Send do. Last year, there were more than 285,000 children with EHCPs in England - but the number of Send children is higher. Parents can spend months, or even years, trying to get their child assessed for an EHCP and in the meantime there is no statutory requirement for local authorities to keep a register of these children. In Birmingham, where Alex and Rachel live, a Freedom of Information request revealed 66 children with EHCPs were without education provision- but sources told the BBC's Newsnight programme there were actually about 250 Send children waiting for a school place. Birmingham Council said it did not ""recognise"" this latter figure. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, was not surprised by the numbers across England. ""They reaffirm my concern that this is actually really widespread and there's a lot of children in this situationâ¦ lots of children and parents I've met who are spending 18 months, two years looking for that right school, or pinballing between applications to different schools,"" she said. Send provision is split between specialist and mainstream schools. Earlier this year, the government announced an additional Â£250m to support high needs and an extra Â£100m for new special school places - but the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the funding gap for Send education will hit Â£1.6bn by 2021. Charlotte Stubbs, the head teacher at Uffculme Special School, in Birmingham, which supports children on the autistic spectrum, said: ""This year, we had 19 spaces available for September 2019 [in Year 7] - we had 86 requests for placement. ""In our primary provision, specifically at Years 1 and 2, the class sizes are about seven or eight pupils per class size. ""We've had 130 referrals for primary placements this year and we're full"". Send places at mainstream schools are also coming under pressure. The first Â£6,000 of support for a Send child has to come from the school's core budget and, put simply, pupils who need specialist help typically cost more than the funding they bring in. Aaron, 10, says he likes being in a mainstream school Schools such as Kings Heath Primary, in Birmingham, which has a high proportion of pupils with complex needs, have long subsidised Send support from other parts of the budget. But because of financial pressure, they may have to close places for pupils such as Aaron. ""We don't want this to happen,"" the 10-year-old told Newsnight. ""If this doesn't stop, then people will get split up from each other, friendships will be broken and I really don't want that to happen, because I like my school and what it's doing for me."" The Department for Education said EHCPs had meant more than a quarter of a million children with complex educational needs ""are receiving the tailored support they need to thrive"". ""We know that a number of children with EHC plans are waiting for a place in school, having moved to a new local authority area, or waiting for their first primary school place,"" a spokesman said.

Flats out of fashion with first-time buyers,"First-time buyers are bypassing flats and moving straight into houses - leading to a fall in the cost of apartments, official figures suggest. The cost of a typical apartment or maisonette in England has fallen by 2.1% in a year, while other types of property have become more expensive. Experts suggest people are buying their first home later and are happy to rent a flat, but not necessarily buy one. Many apartments being built in cities are designed specifically for rental. The cost of detached homes has been rising fastest, with semi-detached and terraced homes also going up in England,figures from the Land Registry,externalshow. In Wales, prices of all types of property are going up, but rises are slowest among flats and maisonettes. First-time buyers want to buy a home to live in for longer than their predecessors, according to Richard Donnell, insight director at Zoopla. This meant they were more likely to push themselves to buy something bigger and wanted to ""leapfrog"" flats, he said. He said that the fall in demand from investors, many of whom have pulled out of the market, had affected demand for flats. Primarily the slowdown in the market in London and the South East of England had meant lower demand for flats, as there was a heavy concentration of apartments in the capital. Major housing projects from the old Battersea Power Station in London to plans for the Metalworks in Liverpool suggest that developers still see plenty of demand for city flats. The overall trend suggests that apartments are becoming more affordable. Research for online estate agents Housesimple suggests buyers can purchase a flat for less than Â£80,000 in 17 towns and cities in the UK. Based on Land Registry figures, it said the average flat in Burnley was the cheapest at Â£54,161, followed by Hartlepool (Â£57,659), Middlesbrough (Â£63,100), Durham (Â£63,638), Blackpool (Â£67,670), and Preston (Â£74,084). In contrast, the average price of a flat in Kensington and Chelsea in London was more than Â£1m, and - despite house price falls - the cheapest London boroughs of Havering, Barking and Dagenham, and Bexley still saw the average cost of a flat totalling more than Â£230,000. Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? 'We've been caught in a leasehold trap' In general,Office for Statistics (ONS) figures,externalshowed UK property prices were continuing to rise but at a slower rate than a year ago. The average UK house price was Â£229,000 in April, the data shows, which is Â£3,000 higher than the same period a year earlier. The cost of renting a home has accelerated slightly, according to separate ONS figures. Rental prices paid by tenants to private landlords went up by 1.3% in the UK in the 12 months to May.

There is intense national rivalry over the successors to Jean-Claude Juncker and other key figures. As Friday's newspaper front pages begin to be released, here is how some have covered the result of today's leadership ballots. This video can not be played 'Underdog' Hunt to 'prove people wrong' Jeremy Hunt says he is confident of winning the Tory Party leadership and succeeding Theresa May as prime minister ""As well as a sensible debate on Brexit, the country and the party want to hear about our vision beyond Brexit,"" he says. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Now, there's no doubt that Boris Johnson is, at this stage (and there's a long way to go), widely expected to end up in Number 10. But this result is an enormous relief to his camp, for the simple reason that they think Jeremy Hunt is easier to beat. Forget any differences in style between the two challengers and their comparative talents - Mr Hunt voted Remain in the EU referendum. And for many Tory members it is a priority for the next leader to have been committed to that cause, rather than a recent convert, however zealous. Of course, pay attention to recent political history. Upsets are the norm. Outsiders become insiders. Strange things happen, and that's before you price in Mr Johnson's ability to cause havoc for himself. But this result has left Mr Johnson's camp hugely relieved. Read more from Laura Jeremy Hunt oversaw the London Olympics as culture secretary and was the UK's longest-serving health secretary. Before entering Parliament, Mr Hunt had a career as an English teacher in Japan and as an entrepreneur. Take a closer look at his recordhere The frontrunner in the race to be Conservative leader and prime minister, Boris Johnson, is one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. But that high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy.

Jeremy Hunt has been speaking to reporters on camera after the result, again acknowledging his status as underdog but adding: ""I like to prove people wrong"". He says the way he will win the members' ballot is by persuading them that the best way to deliver Brexit is by choosing a prime minister the EU ""will engage with"", but who is also ""prepared to walk away"". Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson will take part in a series of hustings in front of Conservative members around the country ahead of a vote to decide who is the next Tory leader and PM. The Conservative Party says there have been 20,000 applications for places at the 16 members' hustings. Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis said: ""I'm delighted with the strong interest in our hustings to date, showing the vitality of our party in every nation and region of the UK. ""We are conscious that the Conservatives are not just selecting a new leader but also the next prime minister, and we take that responsibility extremely seriously at such an important time for our nation."" Who will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker at the Berlaymont? As one top job takes a step towards being filled, over in Brussels EU leaders are currently discussing who should be their candidate to fill another - the next president of the European Commission. The person replacing current incumbent Jean-Claude Juncker will take office in early November. They will play an important role in the future shape of Brexit regardless of what happens next, whether in managing the impact of a no-deal or overseeing future trade talks. Among those in the frame to be put forward is German MEP Manfred Weber - who once called for Boris Johnsonto be fired,externalback when he was the UK's foreign secretary. Other potential rivals include EU veteran Frans Timmermans, Danish EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager, and current EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Find out more here Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Boris Johnson's main connection to Northern Ireland used to be his fleet of red buses. In 2013, the thenmayor of London opened a Wrightbus plant in Ballymena, County Antrim, where parts for them are made. Few would have bet that within six years, he would be a front-runner to become PM. Battling him for the keys to Number 10 is Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary who insists he's best placed to strengthen the union of the United Kingdom. But what are their positions on central issues such as the ongoing political crisis in Stormont, the Tories' confidence-and-supply partners the DUP, and the Irish border question?

How will the campaign between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt play out? Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Mr Hunt will portray himself as a born again Brexiteer, who would contemplate no deal - and as an apparently more competent minister, someone who also has more chance of delivering a deal. The candidates' differences on Brexit seem in truth miniscule, each professing they want a deal that bins the backstop, or time limits it, despite likely opposition from Brussels. Beyond Brexit, Mr Hunt will suggest that he is a champion of the least well off, the better to contrast with Johnson's ambition to take more people out of the higher tax band. But Mr Johnson has two clear advantages with the members. First, he will cite polling to say only he has the chance of beating Labour if there is an early election. a distinct possibility for a leader of a minority government. Second, he has the ability to make the party feel good about itself. He paints a big picture in vivid primary colours. Read more from Iain BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Bookmakers pledge ÃÂ£100m to avoid crackdownThe UK's biggest gambling firms have offered to increase the voluntary levy they pay on gambling profits.,"The UK's biggest gambling firms are offering the government a significant increase in the money they contribute to tackling problem gambling. The owners of William Hill, Coral Ladbroke, Betfair Paddy Power, Skybet and Bet 365 will offer to increase the voluntary levy on their gambling profits, the BBC has learnt. They have offered to up the levy from 0.1% to 1% over the next five years. The new level would eventually raise Â£100m per year for gambling charities. Last year, the voluntary levy raised Â£10m. The firms made the pledge in a letter to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) seen by the BBC. The Gambling Commission recently said the need for more staff, research and treatment required an annual contribution from the industry of Â£70m. The firms said they would also consider increasing the amount of safer gambling messaging and reviewing the ""tone and content"" of its advertising. The pre-emptive offer is part of an effort by the industry to improve its image after what insiders acknowledge was a reputation-damaging battle over Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which eventually saw the maximum stake in any one spin reduced from Â£100 to Â£2. Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State at the DCMS, said: ""I want the gambling industry to step up on social responsibility and keep their players safe, including through making more funding available for research, education and treatment to tackle problem gambling. ""I have met the major players in the sector recently and my department is in discussions with them on a strong package to increase their financial contribution, as well as make meaningful commitments on other measures to help ensure people gamble safely. ""Protecting people and their families from the risks of gambling-related harm is a priority for this government and I am encouraged that the sector now recognises that they need to do more."" One source told the BBC: ""The industry is on a precipice - if we don't get ahead of this, we will end up where the alcohol industry was 10 years ago and tobacco 30 years ago. The fear is that we face a ban on touchline advertising or football shirt sponsorship."" The gambling firms have already agreed to a voluntary ""whistle to whistle"" ban on advertising during sporting events from August of this year. In an extract of the letter to Jeremy Wright, the firms say that as companies representing half of the gambling industry, ""we are committing to collaborate to address gambling-related harm with the priority of protecting the young and vulnerable."" Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has described Britain's ""gambling epidemic"" as a public health crisis, as it can lead to debt, loneliness and suicide. He has called for all gambling firms to be forced to reapply for their licence to review their commitment to corporate responsibility. He has also recommended the establishment of a gambling ombudsman to provide redress for customers who are treated poorly. A recent report published in the British Medical Journal found that the economic and social harms of problem gambling have been underestimated. The Gambling Commission estimates there are 430,000 people with a serious gambling addiction in the UK. If you include those they deem at risk of addiction, the number rises to more than two million.

BBC defends imam vetting process,"This video can not be played Abdullah Patel asked the Tory leadership candidates if they agreed that ""words had consequences"" The BBC has defended its vetting process after it emerged a guest on its leadership debate show had shared allegedly anti-Semitic tweets. Imam Abdullah Patel said he was sure he had not criticised Jewish people but stood by criticism of Israeli policy. The broadcaster said: ""Had we been aware of the views he expressed he would not have been selected."" Mr Patel has been suspended as deputy head of a girls' school and also by the Masjid e Umar mosque in Gloucester. The BBC said the tweets had come to light after Mr Patel re-activated a previously inactive Twitter profile in the aftermath of Tuesday's debate, and had not been visible to its researchers before then. Separately, the BBC faced criticism on Wednesday for choosing as a guest on the programme a solicitor who has previously worked for Labour and once stood as a councillor for the party. It defended the decision, saying: ""A background in politics doesn't disqualify anyone from taking part in a debate show."" Five key moments from Tory leadership debate A screenshot of Mr Patel's Twitter feed from 2014posted on the Guido Fawkes website,externalshowed he shared a graphic of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"". Labour MP Naz Shah was temporarilysuspended from her partythree years ago after it emerged she had shared the same image on Facebook. Another screenshot showed a tweet from Mr Patel,apparently giving advice to women,externalon how to avoid being assaulted by men, saying: ""Generally men are the predators, but women need to realise this and be smarter. It takes two to tango, and if you put yourself in that position, don't expect every man to pass up the opportunity to take advantage of you. Don't be alone with a man!"" BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast presenter Nicky Campbell apologised for having Mr Patel as a guest on his show on Wednesday morning, after the imam had reactivated his controversial social media account, saying it contained ""extremely disturbing"" comments that should have been checked.

Mr Patel, who has now deactivated the Twitter account again, told the BBC Asian Network the school was ""within its right"" to conduct an investigation. ""I don't wish to comment on their decision,"" he added. Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire earlier, Mr Patel said he had a very good relationship with the Jewish community. ""The criticism was not of the Jewish community because if you go through my tweets, you'd see support for the Jewish community,"" he said. ""They're our brothers and sisters, and the Jewish community and I - especially in Gloucester - work very closely together. We actually visited a synagogue just a while ago.""

Flats out of fashion with first time buyers,"First-time buyers are bypassing flats and moving straight into houses - leading to a fall in the cost of apartments, official figures suggest. The cost of a typical apartment or maisonette in England has fallen by 2.1% in a year, while other types of property have become more expensive. Experts suggest people are buying their first home later and are happy to rent a flat, but not necessarily buy one. Many apartments being built in cities are designed specifically for rental. The cost of detached homes has been rising fastest, with semi-detached and terraced homes also going up in England,figures from the Land Registry,externalshow. In Wales, prices of all types of property are going up, but rises are slowest among flats and maisonettes. First-time buyers want to buy a home to live in for longer than their predecessors, according to Richard Donnell, insight director at Zoopla. This meant they were more likely to push themselves to buy something bigger and wanted to ""leapfrog"" flats, he said. He said that the fall in demand from investors, many of whom have pulled out of the market, had affected demand for flats. Primarily the slowdown in the market in London and the South East of England had meant lower demand for flats, as there was a heavy concentration of apartments in the capital. Major housing projects from the old Battersea Power Station in London to plans for the Metalworks in Liverpool suggest that developers still see plenty of demand for city flats. The overall trend suggests that apartments are becoming more affordable. Research for online estate agents Housesimple suggests buyers can purchase a flat for less than Â£80,000 in 17 towns and cities in the UK. Based on Land Registry figures, it said the average flat in Burnley was the cheapest at Â£54,161, followed by Hartlepool (Â£57,659), Middlesbrough (Â£63,100), Durham (Â£63,638), Blackpool (Â£67,670), and Preston (Â£74,084). In contrast, the average price of a flat in Kensington and Chelsea in London was more than Â£1m, and - despite house price falls - the cheapest London boroughs of Havering, Barking and Dagenham, and Bexley still saw the average cost of a flat totalling more than Â£230,000. Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? 'We've been caught in a leasehold trap' In general,Office for Statistics (ONS) figures,externalshowed UK property prices were continuing to rise but at a slower rate than a year ago. The average UK house price was Â£229,000 in April, the data shows, which is Â£3,000 higher than the same period a year earlier. The cost of renting a home has accelerated slightly, according to separate ONS figures. Rental prices paid by tenants to private landlords went up by 1.3% in the UK in the 12 months to May.

Bookmakers pledge ÃÂ£100m to avoid crackdown,"The UK's biggest gambling firms are offering the government a significant increase in the money they contribute to tackling problem gambling. The owners of William Hill, Coral Ladbroke, Betfair Paddy Power, Skybet and Bet 365 will offer to increase the voluntary levy on their gambling profits, the BBC has learnt. They have offered to up the levy from 0.1% to 1% over the next five years. The new level would eventually raise Â£100m per year for gambling charities. Last year, the voluntary levy raised Â£10m. The firms made the pledge in a letter to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) seen by the BBC. The Gambling Commission recently said the need for more staff, research and treatment required an annual contribution from the industry of Â£70m. The firms said they would also consider increasing the amount of safer gambling messaging and reviewing the ""tone and content"" of its advertising. The pre-emptive offer is part of an effort by the industry to improve its image after what insiders acknowledge was a reputation-damaging battle over Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which eventually saw the maximum stake in any one spin reduced from Â£100 to Â£2. Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State at the DCMS, said: ""I want the gambling industry to step up on social responsibility and keep their players safe, including through making more funding available for research, education and treatment to tackle problem gambling. ""I have met the major players in the sector recently and my department is in discussions with them on a strong package to increase their financial contribution, as well as make meaningful commitments on other measures to help ensure people gamble safely. ""Protecting people and their families from the risks of gambling-related harm is a priority for this government and I am encouraged that the sector now recognises that they need to do more."" One source told the BBC: ""The industry is on a precipice - if we don't get ahead of this, we will end up where the alcohol industry was 10 years ago and tobacco 30 years ago. The fear is that we face a ban on touchline advertising or football shirt sponsorship."" The gambling firms have already agreed to a voluntary ""whistle to whistle"" ban on advertising during sporting events from August of this year. In an extract of the letter to Jeremy Wright, the firms say that as companies representing half of the gambling industry, ""we are committing to collaborate to address gambling-related harm with the priority of protecting the young and vulnerable."" Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has described Britain's ""gambling epidemic"" as a public health crisis, as it can lead to debt, loneliness and suicide. He has called for all gambling firms to be forced to reapply for their licence to review their commitment to corporate responsibility. He has also recommended the establishment of a gambling ombudsman to provide redress for customers who are treated poorly. A recent report published in the British Medical Journal found that the economic and social harms of problem gambling have been underestimated. The Gambling Commission estimates there are 430,000 people with a serious gambling addiction in the UK. If you include those they deem at risk of addiction, the number rises to more than two million.

I'm in work 'but struggling to get by',"As care worker Liam Doherty knows all too well, if you're in a low-paid job, the slightest setback can capsize your finances. The Irishman moved to the UK in September 2013, bringing his wife Debbie and four children from County Limerick to take up a job in Dawlish in Devon. ""We were struggling to get by,"" he says. With his wife unable to work because of ill-health, he was the sole provider in the family. ""Sometimes friends would help us out. They would just arrive with food. ""You want to work, but low-paid work can sometimes make it harder financially."" Liam is far from an isolated example. Poverty among people who are working has risen sharply since the mid-1990s, partly driven by higher housing costs and lower earnings growth, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The proportion has risen from 13% in 1994-95 to 18% in 2017, meaning that about eight million people living in working households are in relative poverty, according to the IFS research, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. ""In the mid-1990s, 37% of those in poverty lived in a working household. That has reached 58%,"" said the IFS. But the rise also reflected the fact that many more people were now in work, it added. ""They are better off than they would have been had they stayed out of work, but they remain in poverty. In addition, pensioner incomes have risen faster than working-age incomes - pushing up the relative poverty line,"" the IFS said. A household is defined as being in relative poverty when its income is less than 60% of the average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. The IFS said the rapid growth in pensioners' incomes over the past 25 years had pushed up median income and therefore the relative poverty line. More worryingly, the institute said that fast growth in housing costs for lower-income working households had pushed up the in-work poverty rate since the mid-1990s by 2.4 percentage points, equivalent to one million people. At the same time, increased earning inequality had caused in-work poverty to rise by 1.4 percentage points, or 600,000 people. As well as relative poverty, the research also looked at ""severe"" poverty, defined as having living standards meaningfully below those on the poverty line. ""Severe poverty is a clear policy concern, but it is hard to measure. We find little evidence that there are significant rises in it,"" said Tom Waters, a research economist at the IFS and one of the authors of the research. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ""Our economy should work for everyone, but the rise of working poverty across the UK shows that success in increasing employment isn't always a reliable route to a better living standard. ""High housing costs, low pay and insecure hours are holding many people back, despite more people moving into work. ""Our next prime minister must further reform Universal Credit so that it helps more people get on, and bring forward an ambitious plan to rebalance the economy by investing in places where low employment and widespread low pay trap people in poverty."" The issues spelt out in the IFS report are ones that Liam Doherty knows only too well. In an effort to make ends meet, they were advised to claim tax credits and housing benefit, but that was when their problems really began. The benefits were worth Â£400 a month to them, but then they were told that they had been given too much and had to repay Â£3,000. Liam remembers the authorities asking for Â£50 a month, but he pleaded that he couldn't afford that. ""Then we got a letter asking for more."" Other bills started to mount up. Finally, thanks to the aid of charityChristians Against Poverty,external, the Doherty family were able to get out of debt. Now aged 64, Liam says he can't see himself retiring any time soon. ""I have to keep going,"" he says. ""But at least we're not in debt and we live within our means. All our bills are paid each month and then we manage what's left, for food and other things."" Firms face pressure over zero-hours In-work poverty hits 2.9 million children Poverty 'tightens grip on poorest children' Housing crisis 'creates in-work poverty' 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Government 'not doing enough' on venue security,"Nick Aldworth was chief superintendent with the Met Police A former National Counter Terrorism Co-ordinator has told the BBC the government is not doing enough to ensure that venues are secure. Nick Aldworth has warned new legislation is needed to reduce the impact of any future attack. He is supporting a campaign for more rigorous checks at venues, under the name Martyn's Law, after Martyn Hett, a victim of the Manchester Arena attack. He said such a law could have prevented the spate of attacks in the UK in 2017. At the time, Mr Aldworth was a Metropolitan Police chief superintendent in charge of keeping Londoners safe. ""People died on my watch when I was responsible for trying to keep London and, more subsequently, the UK secure,"" he said. ""That's a burden that I will carry."" He said new legislation would help to stop that happening in the future. ""I think without it we have the potential for places to be attacked and for the potential for the effect of those attacks to be far worse than they need to be."" At the moment, venues such as theatres, cinemas, and concert halls do not have any legal obligation to put counter terrorism security in place, or to plan for what they would do in the event of an attack. ""I think that without being specific - because there are coroners' inquests under way at the moment - I think there are definitely some places that could have benefitted from some infrastructure,"" Mr Aldworth continued. ""But one of the things I was told after one of the attacks by a survivor... was she was in a restaurant and nobody knew what to do."" Many places do have bag checks and security screening but Mr Aldworth said it was not the case everywhere, and that some venues were ""reckless and negligent"". Figen Murray launched a campaign in memory of her son Martyn Hett's motherFigen Murray started a petition last year demanding more security at venuesand has attractedmore than 23,000 signatures,external. She wants it to be compulsory for every venue to assess the risk of an attack, and put appropriate measures in place. Mrs Murray does not suggest there should be a security arch in front of every door, or that the country should become ""Barrier Britain"". ""When I think of people like Martyn who enjoyed music festivals and all these events without having to go through lots and lots of security, we're talking about common sense here,"" she said. ""It could just be people trained in recognising suspicious behaviour - it can be even as basic as that."" Martyn Hett was one of 22 people killed in the attack on 22 May 2017 Mrs Murray already has the support of some venues that say they do not see extra legislation as a problem. Shaun Hinds, chief executive of the Manchester Central Convention Centre, said: ""I'd actually flip it on its head and look at it as a business opportunity and say, 'Well, actually if we can demonstrate that we're putting the appropriate measures in place to ensure the security of the visitors, the venue, the employees, then actually that's got to be a good thing'."" Responding to the calls for Martyn's Law, security minister Ben Wallace said: ""Going to concerts, exhibitions, shopping centres, watching sport and other events are part of the fabric of life, things that should be enjoyed without fear. ""Just as we share enjoyment of these communal places and spaces, we need to share concern and responsibility for keeping them as safe as possible. ""That means owners, operators and public authorities stepping up and making full use of the wide range of information and advice available to support them. ""Government is also considering whether and how further legislation could support, or indeed compel, effective and proportionate protective security. ""We would very much welcome input from Figen Murray and others campaigning for Martyn's Law in this work and I look forward to discussing it with her soon."" ""Security against terror attacks should be mandatory,"" says Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham At an event to launch the Martyn's Law campaign, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said: ""Security against terror attacks at venues should be mandatory not discretionary."" Mr Burnham said Manchester was ready to be the first city to endorse the new legislation and become a pilot area. At the event, attended by Mrs Murray and Mr Aldworth, he said venues were ready to sign up to the measures required. All five Tory leadership candidates have tweeted their support for Martyn's Law and a requirement for improved security measures at public venues.

Raab out of Tory leadership race,"This video can not be played Dame Cheryl Gillan announces the result of Tuesday's Tory leadership vote - with five going through the next round Dominic Raab has been knocked out of the Tory leadership race in the latest ballot of MPs, leaving five candidates in the battle to be the next PM. Boris Johnson once again came top of the ballot, with 126 votes - 12 more than in the first round. Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart also got enough votes to make it into the next round. Mr Raab was eliminated after coming last with 30 votes, three fewer than the minimum needed to progress. The former Brexit secretary had called for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October if necessary. He also caused controversy by refusing to rule out suspending Parliament to thwart attempts by MPs to block a no-deal Brexit. Tory leadership: Who will be the next prime minister? Tory debate clash over Brexit deadline The next ballot will take place on Wednesday, with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated. On leaving the contest, Mr Raab wished the remaining candidates good luck in the forthcoming BBC debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Hunt again came second in the latest ballot of 313 Tory MPs, with 46 votes - three more than in last week's first vote. Mr Gove and Mr Javid also increased their level of support - by four and 10 votes to 41 and 33 votes respectively. But it was Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, who made the biggest stride forward, nearly doubling his backing from 19 to 37 votes. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was likely that most of Mr Raab's supporters would transfer their votes to Mr Johnson, but, she said, ""there will certainly be a scrap for them."" And she pointed out how close the result was for the other candidates, adding: ""In tomorrow's vote a couple of moves here and there could make all the difference."" Tory MP Gillian Keegan said Mr Stewart was appealing to his colleagues because of his ""realistic plan"" for Brexit and his progress showed there was a ""market for honest politicians"". ""I think Rory is extraordinary. He has star quality you don't often see in politics."" Johnny Mercer, a supporter of Mr Johnson, said he was pleased by his performance but conceded the contest ""was not done yet"". Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who is backing Mr Hunt for the top job, said he remained in a ""strong"" second place. She told the BBC the foreign secretary remained ""a serious candidate for a serious job"". The BBC's Nicholas Watt said he had been told by a source close to Mr Javid that he would not be dropping out of the race even though he secured the lowest number of votes. Simon Hoare, one of Mr Javid's backers, said he was ""delighted"" the home secretary had made it through to the next stage. He said ""barring emergencies"" Mr Johnson would make it into the final two candidates and appealed to Tory MPs to think ""tactically"" about who should join him. Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Guy Opperman, who is backing Michael Gove, said a frontrunner ""had never won"" a Tory leadership contest and he believed MPs would ultimately ""coalesce"" around an alternative to Mr Johnson. He said Mr Gove had ""clawed his way"" back into the contest after days of negative newspaper headlines at the start of the campaign following his admission he had taken cocaine while working as a journalist in the late 1990s. As ""a committed Brexiteer"", he said he expected Mr Gove would pick up the overwhelming share of Mr Raab's 30 supporters in the next round. The remaining candidates will face up to three further ballots later this week, where the lowest-ranked MP will be knocked out until only two are left. The final two names will then be put to a postal vote of the 160,000 Tory party members, beginning on 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later.

Rising levels of poverty in working families,"As care worker Liam Doherty knows all too well, if you're in a low-paid job, the slightest setback can capsize your finances. The Irishman moved to the UK in September 2013, bringing his wife Debbie and four children from County Limerick to take up a job in Dawlish in Devon. ""We were struggling to get by,"" he says. With his wife unable to work because of ill-health, he was the sole provider in the family. ""Sometimes friends would help us out. They would just arrive with food. ""You want to work, but low-paid work can sometimes make it harder financially."" Liam is far from an isolated example. Poverty among people who are working has risen sharply since the mid-1990s, partly driven by higher housing costs and lower earnings growth, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The proportion has risen from 13% in 1994-95 to 18% in 2017, meaning that about eight million people living in working households are in relative poverty, according to the IFS research, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. ""In the mid-1990s, 37% of those in poverty lived in a working household. That has reached 58%,"" said the IFS. But the rise also reflected the fact that many more people were now in work, it added. ""They are better off than they would have been had they stayed out of work, but they remain in poverty. In addition, pensioner incomes have risen faster than working-age incomes - pushing up the relative poverty line,"" the IFS said. A household is defined as being in relative poverty when its income is less than 60% of the average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. The IFS said the rapid growth in pensioners' incomes over the past 25 years had pushed up median income and therefore the relative poverty line. More worryingly, the institute said that fast growth in housing costs for lower-income working households had pushed up the in-work poverty rate since the mid-1990s by 2.4 percentage points, equivalent to one million people. At the same time, increased earning inequality had caused in-work poverty to rise by 1.4 percentage points, or 600,000 people. As well as relative poverty, the research also looked at ""severe"" poverty, defined as having living standards meaningfully below those on the poverty line. ""Severe poverty is a clear policy concern, but it is hard to measure. We find little evidence that there are significant rises in it,"" said Tom Waters, a research economist at the IFS and one of the authors of the research. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ""Our economy should work for everyone, but the rise of working poverty across the UK shows that success in increasing employment isn't always a reliable route to a better living standard. ""High housing costs, low pay and insecure hours are holding many people back, despite more people moving into work. ""Our next prime minister must further reform Universal Credit so that it helps more people get on, and bring forward an ambitious plan to rebalance the economy by investing in places where low employment and widespread low pay trap people in poverty."" The issues spelt out in the IFS report are ones that Liam Doherty knows only too well. In an effort to make ends meet, they were advised to claim tax credits and housing benefit, but that was when their problems really began. The benefits were worth Â£400 a month to them, but then they were told that they had been given too much and had to repay Â£3,000. Liam remembers the authorities asking for Â£50 a month, but he pleaded that he couldn't afford that. ""Then we got a letter asking for more."" Other bills started to mount up. Finally, thanks to the aid of charityChristians Against Poverty,external, the Doherty family were able to get out of debt. Now aged 64, Liam says he can't see himself retiring any time soon. ""I have to keep going,"" he says. ""But at least we're not in debt and we live within our means. All our bills are paid each month and then we manage what's left, for food and other things.""

Firm agrees $1bn payout over California fires,"The heavily damaged city of Paradise will receive some of the money Pacific Gas & Electric Corp (PG&E) has agreed to pay $1bn (Â£800m) to local California authorities for wildfire damage blamed on the firm. The settlements will be paid out to 14 different bodies as part of the utility company's bankruptcy reorganisation. The claims stem from the 2015 Butte Fire, the 2017 North Bay Fires and the 2018 Camp Fire. The city of Paradise, which was all but destroyed in a wildfire in November, receives $270m. The Camp Fire, which started in Butte County, claimed 85 lives - the deadliest in state history. Californian fire investigators said in May that the blaze was sparked by transmission lines owned by PG&E. California wildfire leaves town in ruins The day Paradise burned down Why the California wildfires are so deadly The county's district attorney is considering possible criminal charges in relation to the fire. This video can not be played Rebuilding Paradise: 'Our town is gone' The San Francisco-based utility company filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing billions of dollars in liabilities from lawsuits it is facing. The settlements announced on Tuesday do not include hundreds of individual claims made by businesses and homeowners. Because of its bankruptcy reorganisation, any financial agreements PG&E reaches still need to be approved in court. ""What we hope is that PG&E can come out of bankruptcy as soon as possible so these funds can be paid,""John Fiske, a lawyer from a firm representing the agencies told Bloomberg,external. PG&E told the Reuters news agency in a statement that the settlement marked an ""important first step"" for ""orderly, fair and expeditious resolution"" of wildfire claims against it.

Government 'not doing enough' on venue securityA former police chief says the government is not doing enough to ensure public venues are secure.Manchester,"Nick Aldworth was chief superintendent with the Met Police A former National Counter Terrorism Co-ordinator has told the BBC the government is not doing enough to ensure that venues are secure.

Male pill a step closer in ScotlandScientists in Dundee will test thousands of drug combinations to find a way to stop sperm working.,"This video can not be played Researchers are using robots to test thousands of drug combinations In a laboratory in Dundee, two huge robotic arms test thousands of chemical compounds looking for a drug to stop sperm in its tracks. ""Sperm move very quickly in humans,"" says Prof Christopher Barratt, head of the Reproductive Medicine Group at the city's university. ""It's the speed of Usain Bolt if you want to get an analogy. And what we're trying to do is get chemicals to stop that type of movement. So stop them in the starting blocks, rather than letting them get to the 100m line."" The team at the University of Dundee have begun work to develop a male contraceptive pill thanks to a grant of about $900,000 (Â£716,670) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. If successful, it could help to prevent millions of unwanted pregnancies across the world. The team say a male pill could help to prevent millions of unwanted pregnancies across the world Prof Barratt believes innovation in this field is long overdue. ""If you look back at the principles of male contraception then the last development was in 1450BC, which is effectively the development of the condom,"" he says. ""So there's been absolutely nothing for men and that's a key issue if we're trying to deal with many of the issues that face the world."" The two-year project is a collaboration between the university's schools of medicines and life sciences. They hope to find a drug to mimic male infertility. Dr Paul Andrews, director of operations at the National Phenotypic Screening Centre, says it could already exist. ""We have to sift through hundreds of thousands of chemicals, some of which might be drugs that are already in patients and where we find new uses for old drugs. Or we might want to find new drugs,"" he says. Previous attempts to create a male pill had unwanted side effects and failed to attract the attention of pharmaceutical companies. But Dr Andrews hopes the support of the Gates Foundation might make this research a success. ""Big pharma companies are not interested in this area, even though there's potentially a large market,"" he says. ""And so the Gates Foundation wanted to plug that gap."" Sociologist Kristina Saunders believes attitudes will need to change The female pill was first made available on the NHS in 1961, revolutionising the lives of women. Kristina Saunders, a sociologist at the University of Glasgow, believes attitudes will need to change before another major transformation in contraception. ""I don't think it would be as simple as here's this pill or this new contraceptive you can take it,"" she says. ""I think much deeper work needs to be done because these are really ingrained, gendered norms and ideas and expectations around, not just contraceptive use but reproduction more generally. ""So I think conversations need to be opened up within wider society between couples and health care professionals and with service providers. ""And starting with education from a young age to include men and young boys and everybody in discussions around contraceptive responsibility."" The team in Dundee hope to identify a suitable compound within five years. After that, men could start testing the pill. A season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world.

When asked if vaccines were safe: 79% ""somewhat"" or ""strongly"" agreed 7% somewhat or strongly disagreed 14% neither agreed nor disagreed When asked if they believed vaccines worked: 84% agree either strongly or somewhat 5% either strongly or somewhat disagree 12% neither agreed nor disagreed There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against deadly and debilitating infections, such as measles. Measles can be deadly Vaccines protect billions of people around the world. They have completely got rid of one disease - smallpox - and are bringing the world close to eliminating others, such as polio. But some other diseases, such as measles, are making a resurgence and experts say people avoiding vaccines, fuelled by fear and misinformation, is one of the main causes. Dr Ann Lindstrand, an expert in immunisation at the WHO, said the current situation was extremely serious. ""Vaccine hesitancy has the potential, at least in some places, to really hinder the very real progress the world has made in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases,"" she said. ""Any resurgence we see in these diseases are an unacceptable step backwards."" What are vaccines and how do they work? Debunking vaccination myths for parents Vaccine deniers gaining traction says NHS boss Measles: How a preventable disease returned from the past Countries that were close to eliminating measles have been seeing large outbreaks. Data shows a rise in cases in almost every region of the world, with 30% more cases in 2017 than 2016. A decision not to vaccinate, for whatever reason, poses a risk to others as well as the individual from being infected themselves. If enough people are vaccinated, it stops the disease from spreading through a population - something experts call ""herd immunity"". Imran Khan, from the Wellcome Trust, said: ""We are really concerned at the moment because for measles, anything less than 95% coverage can lead to outbreaks and that is what we are seeing."" Some people living in several higher-income regions were among the least certain about vaccine safety. In France - a country among several European ones now experiencing outbreaks of measles - one in three disagreed that vaccines were safe, according to the survey. That was the highest percentage for any country worldwide. People in France were also among the most likely to disagree that vaccines were effective, at 19%, and to disagree that vaccines were important for children to have, at 10%. How smallpox claimed its final victim Measles - experts call for compulsory vaccination How anti-vaccine movements threaten global health The French government has now addedeight more compulsory vaccinations,externalto the three children in the country already receive. Neighbouring Italy - where 76% agreed vaccines were safe - recently passed a law that allows schools toban unvaccinatedchildren, or fine their parents, after immunisation rates dwindled. The UK has yet to go this far but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he ""won't rule out"" the idea of introducing compulsory vaccinations if necessary. The US has also been experiencing its ownmeasles outbreak- the biggest to hit the country in decades, with more than 980 confirmed cases in 26 states in 2019 to date. In Northern America, and Southern and Northern Europe, just over 70% of people agreed that vaccines were safe. The figure was as low as 59% in Western Europe, and 50% in Eastern Europe. In Ukraine, which reported thehighest number of measles cases in Europelast year (53,218 in total) - only 50% of people agreed vaccines were effective. This figure was 46% in Belarus, 49% in Moldova, and 62% in Russia. Most people in lower-income areas agreed vaccines were safe. The highest number was in South Asia, where 95% of people agreed, followed by Eastern Africa, where the figure was 92%. Bangladesh and Rwanda had nearly universal agreement about the safety and effectiveness and have achieved very high immunisation rates despite many challenges in physically getting vaccines to people. Rwanda became the world's first low-income country to provide young women universal access to the HPV vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. Mr Khan said: ""It shows what can be achieved with concerted effort to improve vaccine uptake."" This video can not be played One Filipino mother's worst fears were realised when her unvaccinated children caught measles In the survey, people with more trust in scientists, doctors and nurses tended to be more likely to agree that vaccines were safe. Conversely, those who had sought information about science, medicine or health recently appeared to be less likely to agree. The Wellcome report does not explore all of the reasons behind low confidence but researchers say there are likely to be many factors involved. Some of it may be complacency - if a disease has become less common, then the need to get immunised may feel less pressing when weighing the benefits against any possible risk. All medicines, vaccines included, can have side-effects. But vaccines are thoroughly tested to check they are safe and effective. The internet means beliefs and concerns about vaccines can be shared in an instant, spreading information that isn't necessarily based on fact. In Japan,concerns about the HPV vaccine and a reported link with neurological problems were widely publicised, which experts think knocked confidence in immunisation in general. Similarly, in France, there was controversy about a pandemic influenza vaccine - accusations that the government boughthigh quantities of the vaccine,externaland unsubstantiated claims that it had been made too quickly and couldn't be safe. In the UK, there has been misinformation circulating about the MMR jab and autism. Dr Lindstrand said: ""One of the most important interventions to counteract doubts and worries about vaccines is to have health workers really well trained and able and ready to recommend vaccinations based on scientific truth and to be able to respond correctly to questions and concerns that parents have and communities have.""

Firm agrees $1bn payout over California firesPacific Gas & Electric Corp are facing billions of dollars worth of lawsuits over the fires.US & Canada,"The heavily damaged city of Paradise will receive some of the money Pacific Gas & Electric Corp (PG&E) has agreed to pay $1bn (Â£800m) to local California authorities for wildfire damage blamed on the firm. The settlements will be paid out to 14 different bodies as part of the utility company's bankruptcy reorganisation. The claims stem from the 2015 Butte Fire, the 2017 North Bay Fires and the 2018 Camp Fire. The city of Paradise, which was all but destroyed in a wildfire in November, receives $270m. The Camp Fire, which started in Butte County, claimed 85 lives - the deadliest in state history. Californian fire investigators said in May that the blaze was sparked by transmission lines owned by PG&E.

Alcohol sales drop as minimum price kicks inThe amount of alcohol per adult bought in Scotland last year fell to its lowest level since records began.Scotland,"Scots bought less alcohol in 2018 than any year since records began in the early 1990s, according to a new report. Analysis by NHS Health Scotland found Scottish adults still bought more alcohol than people in England and Wales on average but the gap narrowed. A minimum price per unit of alcohol was introduced on 1 May last year in a bid to tackle Scotland's drink culture. The authors of the report said it was not possible to quantify the impact but ""early indicators were encouraging"". Examples of prices Â£14Whisky (70cl bottle at 40% ABV) Â£13.13Vodka (70cl bottle at 37.5% ABV) Â£1Lager (500ml can at 4% ABV) Â£2.50Cider (1 litre bottle at 5% - normal strength) Â£4.69Red wine (75cl bottle at 12.5% ABV) Scotland was the first country in the world to introduce minimum unit pricing (MUP), although others places operate different forms of price control. Minimum pricing was largely aimed at raising the cost of cheap lager, cider and spirits sold in supermarkets and off-licences to reduce consumption. The 2019 MESAS (Monitoring and Evaluating Scotland's Alcohol Strategy) report said: The average Scottish adult bought 19 units of alcohol per week (The UK recommended limit was 14 units a week for men and women). The annual volume of ""pure alcohol"" in drinks sold in Scotland was 9.9 litres per adult, down about 3% from 10.2 litres in 2017. The volume of alcohol is 9% higher than in England and Wales (9.1 litres) - the smallest difference since 2003. Since 2010 the volume of pure alcohol sold per adult through supermarkets and off-licences has fallen by 9% in Scotland. It has risen by 3% in England and Wales over the same period. The report said alcohol continued to be a leading cause of illness and early death in Scotland, with an average of 22 people dying of alcohol-related illness every week. The Scottish government brought in minimum unit pricing to target the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol, which it said attracted problem drinkers. The new law looked at the amount of alcohol in a drink and set a minimum price of 50p for each unit. Under the rules, a 70cl bottle of vodka, at a strength of 37.5% abv, would be 26.25 units and cost Â£13.13. Scotland ends cheap booze as minimum price starts Has new alcohol law changed drinking habits? Lucie Giles, public health intelligence adviser at NHS Health Scotland, said the minimum pricing law led to the biggest rise in the average price of alcohol for a decade and a ""substantial"" fall in the volume of alcohol sold at very low prices. For the first time, less alcohol was sold below 50p per unit in Scotland than south of the border. Following Scotland's introduction of the policy,members of the Welsh Assembly passed legislation to introduce a minimum price for alcohol- the plans are yet to be implemented. Similar legislation has been considered for England but is not currently on the table. Ms Giles said: ""From the data in this report it's not possible to quantify the full contribution of MUP (minimum unit pricing) on alcohol prices and sales, but these are encouraging early indicators."" She said alcohol was still a ""significant public health issue"" and people in Scotland's poorest areas continued to experience the most harm. Cheap supermarket vodka was one of the drinks most affected by the minimum pricing Shopkeepers say they have seen a shift in the type of drinks people are buying and doctors say that is reflected on the wards. The official figures show a fall in sales but no real change in what we are choosing to drink. It is a small percentage of people who are the most problematic drinkers, a significant proportion of those live in poverty. Most who work in this area say there needs to be a much wider package of support to really address the country's unhealthy relationship with alcohol. One man I spoke to said minimum pricing will make no difference for this group. ""If they can't afford it, they'll steal it"" he said. We have been seeing a steady decline in alcohol sales over the past decade or so, hence the optimism today, but not a rush to claim success. The truth is, it is too early to tell whether minimum pricing is having an impact on Scotland's health. No other country in the world has tried it so a full analysis will take years to complete. The MESAS report looks at alcohol sales for 2018 but data on harm caused by drinking was for the previous year, before minimum pricing was introduced. It shows that alcohol-specific death rates were consistently higher in Scotland than in England and Wales. In 2017, rates were twice as high in men and 55% higher in women. In the most deprived areas, rates of alcohol-specific death were more than seven times higher than in the least deprived. Dr Ewan Forrest, a liver specialist at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, told BBC Scotland it was ""probably too early to say"" if there had been a reduction in alcohol harm. ""We are still seeing a lot of alcohol-related liver disease so I'm not thinking the measures taken have solved the problem but I'm hoping they have moved us in the right direction,"" he said. Liver disease specialist Dr Ewan Forrest said he thought minimum pricing was a move in the right direction Dr Forrest said he hoped to see a reduction in alcohol-related liver deaths over the next five years. He said: ""By reducing the overall consumption of alcohol and pushing some people towards stopping alcohol I hope we can prevent people who have liver disease developing full-blown liver failure."" In response to the MESAS report, BMA Scotland chair Dr Lewis Morrison said minimum pricing was ""still very much in its infancy"" but the results from the first year were ""extremely encouraging"". Alison Douglas, from Alcohol Focus Scotland, said the figures suggested the policy was ""having a real impact on the way we drink in Scotland"". The Scottish government's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said it was a ""promising start"" and the fall in sales was ""moving in the right direction"". The MESAS report shows that while Scots buy more alcohol in pubs than people in England and Wales, it is off-licences and supermarkets where the biggest difference lies. The rates of sales of spirits from off-licences were 37% higher in Scotland than in England and Wales, with sales of vodka per adult being 87% higher. Since 1994 off-trade sales in Scotland have increased by 36% while sales in pubs, clubs and restaurants have fallen by 44%. Abdul Majid, who runs a small supermarket in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, said his turnover had not been affected by the minimum pricing rules but his customers had changed what they bought. Abdul Majid said high-strength ciders had been most affected by minimum pricing He said they had moved away from high-strength (7.5% abv) ciders, which used to cost as little as Â£4 for three litres but could not now be sold for less than Â£11.25. Mr Majid said people were buying more alcopops or small bottles of spirits such as vodka. He said people had not understood the new law when it was first introduced. ""They know now that it is a minimum unit price so no matter which retailer they go to the minimum price doesn't change. ""It means that my prices and the bigger supermarket prices are now on a level playing field."" According to Mr Majid, another consequence of the price rise has been a sharp rise in shoplifting. ""We are always really surprised at the people we catch,"" he said. ""It's not always who you would expect."" Has new alcohol law changed drinking habits?

Male pill a step closer in Scotland,"This video can not be played Researchers are using robots to test thousands of drug combinations In a laboratory in Dundee, two huge robotic arms test thousands of chemical compounds looking for a drug to stop sperm in its tracks. ""Sperm move very quickly in humans,"" says Prof Christopher Barratt, head of the Reproductive Medicine Group at the city's university. ""It's the speed of Usain Bolt if you want to get an analogy. And what we're trying to do is get chemicals to stop that type of movement. So stop them in the starting blocks, rather than letting them get to the 100m line."" The team at the University of Dundee have begun work to develop a male contraceptive pill thanks to a grant of about $900,000 (Â£716,670) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. If successful, it could help to prevent millions of unwanted pregnancies across the world. The team say a male pill could help to prevent millions of unwanted pregnancies across the world Prof Barratt believes innovation in this field is long overdue. ""If you look back at the principles of male contraception then the last development was in 1450BC, which is effectively the development of the condom,"" he says. ""So there's been absolutely nothing for men and that's a key issue if we're trying to deal with many of the issues that face the world."" The two-year project is a collaboration between the university's schools of medicines and life sciences. They hope to find a drug to mimic male infertility. Dr Paul Andrews, director of operations at the National Phenotypic Screening Centre, says it could already exist. ""We have to sift through hundreds of thousands of chemicals, some of which might be drugs that are already in patients and where we find new uses for old drugs. Or we might want to find new drugs,"" he says. Previous attempts to create a male pill had unwanted side effects and failed to attract the attention of pharmaceutical companies. But Dr Andrews hopes the support of the Gates Foundation might make this research a success. ""Big pharma companies are not interested in this area, even though there's potentially a large market,"" he says. ""And so the Gates Foundation wanted to plug that gap."" Sociologist Kristina Saunders believes attitudes will need to change The female pill was first made available on the NHS in 1961, revolutionising the lives of women. Kristina Saunders, a sociologist at the University of Glasgow, believes attitudes will need to change before another major transformation in contraception. ""I don't think it would be as simple as here's this pill or this new contraceptive you can take it,"" she says. ""I think much deeper work needs to be done because these are really ingrained, gendered norms and ideas and expectations around, not just contraceptive use but reproduction more generally. ""So I think conversations need to be opened up within wider society between couples and health care professionals and with service providers. ""And starting with education from a young age to include men and young boys and everybody in discussions around contraceptive responsibility."" The team in Dundee hope to identify a suitable compound within five years. After that, men could start testing the pill. A season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world.
