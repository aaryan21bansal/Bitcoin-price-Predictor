Taylor Swift wins DJ assault case,"This photo of Taylor Swift (centre) and David Mueller (right) was a key piece of evidence in court Pop star Taylor Swift has won a sexual assault case against ex-radio DJ David Mueller, who she said had groped her at a 2013 concert. He assaulted her by grabbing her bottom beneath her skirt as a photo was taken, a jury in Denver, Colorado, found. She was awarded a symbolic $1 (77p) in damages that she had sought. Mr Mueller had originally tried to sue the pop star, saying that her claims had cost him his job. But that lawsuit was thrown out by a judge last week. On Monday, the jury also rejected similar claims Mueller had made against the singer's mother, Andrea Swift, and her radio liaison, Frank Bell. In a statement following the verdict, Ms Swift said: ""I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. Four reasons the case is significant Is courtroom sketch a good drawing of Taylor Swift? Pop star doesn't back down in court ""My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves."" The assault took place during a Denver stopover on the singer's Red tour. Taylor Swift (left) was present throughout the trial, often with her mother Andrea (second right) Mr Mueller, then a host on the radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet her before the show. The singer complained to KYGO and the station fired Mr Mueller two days later. 'He grabbed under my skirt' Taylor Swift's mum confronts DJ in court Last Friday, Ms Swift's former bodyguard gave evidence, supporting her sex assault claims by testifying that he saw the DJ reach under her skirt. Greg Dent told the Colorado court he ""did not see his hand touch her physically"", but ""saw his hand under her skirt"".

Jo Cox George Medal 'hero' Kenny dies,"Bernard Kenny paid tribute to Jo Cox at a Batley Bulldogs rugby match The man who was awarded the George Medal for trying to stop the murder of MP Jo Cox has died, his family says. Bernard Kenny was stabbed as he intervened when Thomas Mair attacked Mrs Cox in Birstall, West Yorkshire in 2016. Mr Kenny's son said the 79-year-old, who was honoured in June, had died on Monday morning. Mair stabbed Mrs Cox, the MP for Batley and Spen, 15 times and shot her three times. Mr Kenny was seriously injured in the attack, but the cause of his death is not believed to be related to the incident. During Mair's trial, Mr Kenny told the court he had been waiting for his wife by the library in Birstall when he saw right-wing extremist Mair going ""berserk"". He said he thought he could jump on his back and ""could take him down"" but was then stabbed in the stomach. After the attack more than 80,000 people signed an online petition calling for Mr Kenny to be awarded the George Cross for his bravery. Bernard Kenny was described as ""a true hero, a very brave man"" Former miner Mr Kenny is understood to have been part of the rescue operation duringa 1973 Yorkshire mining disaster., in which seven men died.

UK suggests 'temporary customs union',"The government says it will propose an ""innovative and untested approach"" to customs checks as part of its Brexit negotiations. The model, one of two being put forwardin a newly-published paper,external, would mean no customs checks at UK-EU borders. The UK's alternative proposal - a more efficient system of border checks - would involve ""an increase in administration"", it admits. A key EU figure said the idea of ""invisible borders"" was a ""fantasy"". On Twitter, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's negotiator, added that other issues had to be agreed before negotiations on trade could begin - views echoed by the EU's overall chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Government to unveil Irish border plan Analysis: Is UK leaving the customs union? Customs union, free trade area and single market - an explainer The UK has already said it will leave the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - after Brexit, and businesses have been calling for clarity on what the replacement system will involve. The UK's proposals, detailed in what it calls a ""future partnership paper"", also include the possibility of a ""temporary customs union"" after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business as they adapt to the new arrangements. Countries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries. A quick guide to the Brexit negotiations Farmers back temporary customs union According to the new paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a ""temporary customs union"" after it leaves the EU in March 2019. But during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member. Ministers said the use of interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements. Once this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a ""highly streamlined"" border with the EU, or a new ""partnership"" with no customs border at all. Reality Check: The UK's customs union proposals The ""partnership"" arrangement would be an ""innovative and untested approach"" which would remove the need for any customs checks between the UK and the EU. This would be because the UK's regime would ""align precisely"" with the EU's, for goods that will be consumed in the EU. However, the UK would continue to operate its own checks on goods coming from outside the EU - and the government said safeguards would be needed to prevent goods entering the EU that had not complied with its rules. These could include a repayment mechanism, which would see importers to the UK pay whichever is the higher tariff, Britain's or the EU's, and then face having to claim money back if their goods were sold to a customer in the region with a lower tariff. Brexit Secretary David Davis (left) and the EU Commission's Michel Barnier are leading the negotiations for the two sides An alternative scenario the government is proposing would involve the UK extending customs checks to EU arrivals - but under a ""highly streamlined arrangement"" to minimise disruption at ports and airports. It said it would seek to make the existing system of customs checks ""even more efficient"", for example using number plate recognition technology at ports, which could be linked to customs declarations for what the vehicles are carrying, meaning the vehicles do not have to be manually stopped and checked. The UK would also allow some traders to do self assessment, calculating their own customs duties. However, the government acknowledged this option would still involve ""an increase in administration"" compared with being in the existing customs union. All of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters. Other obstacles - including the size of the UK's ""divorce bill"" - need to be agreed first. The government will also set up its own ""standalone"" system in the event of no deal being reached, which would involve charging customs duty and VAT on imports from the EU, although it says it is keen to avoid this scenario. Previous estimates by HMRC have predicted a sudden increase in the number of customs declarations after Brexit - subject to any new arrangements agreed with the EU - from a maximum of 55 million to 255 million per year. Can technology offer frictionless borders? This video can not be played David Davis tells Today Brexit is going ""incredibly well"" David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, said he envisioned the interim customs system being ""as close as we can to the current arrangements"", but with the UK able to negotiate and sign its own international trade deals. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he did not rule out the UK paying to be part of the arrangement, saying he was not going to conduct negotiations on air. And he said he did not believe the European Court of Justice would be the arbiter of the temporary arrangement, adding that the government would publish proposals on ""international arbitration"" next week. Mr Davis said the transition period should be ""something like two years, maybe a bit shorter"" but that it had ""to be done by the election"", meaning 2022 at the latest. Analysis by the BBC's Eleanor Garnier Philip Hammond and Liam Fox were on opposite sides of last year's EU referendum debate These proposals are designed to demonstrate unity - after reported cabinet splits - and show the government has a plan in place. Chancellor Philip Hammond has got his way in seeking an interim customs arrangement as much like the status quo as possible. And Liam Fox could potentially win the right to negotiate international trade deals during the transition period. But this is about much more than domestic political battles - it's about whether the UK can succeed in getting Brussels negotiators to talk about trade at the same time as the so-called divorce arrangements, something they have steadfastly refused to do so far. The EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted that customs could not be discussed until the Irish border, citizens' rights and the UK's separation payment had been settled. A European Commission spokesman added: ""As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union."" Allow Twitter content?

Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were ""incoherent and inadequate"" and were designed to ""gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet"". But his party also faced questions on its position. Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 live, shadow international trade minister Bill Esterson would not say whether Labour would remain in the customs union after March 2019. Asked repeatedly, he said Labour would seek ""the same relationship that we have now"". ""The detail of whether it's defined as being membership or not isn't the point,"" he added. This video can not be played Shadow International Trade Minister asked five times about leaving customs union. Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon accused the UK of a ""daft have cake and eat it"" approach. Pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry said ministers were ""moving in the right direction"" with their proposals for an interim arrangement. But she said they should admit that ""no new agreement with the EU can fully replace the benefits of customs union membership"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable accused ministers of ""kicking the can down the road"" and argued for staying in the customs union. But the CBI, which represents British businesses, said the proposal was ""encouraging"". Its deputy director general, Josh Hardie, added: ""The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible."" Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said most businesses were more concerned about future customs arrangements with the EU than future trade deals. ""In the long term, we should aim to avoid imports and exports being subjected to two sets of customs checks, and to ensuring the smoothest possible future trade relationship between the UK and EU."" This video can not be played ""We need a much more hard nosed approach...as it's very difficult to see the EU from budging"" says ex UKIP leader MEP and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage attacked the government's proposals. ""We might find ourselves 10 years down the road from Brexit having not got what we wanted,"" he said. ""There's no doubt that during this transitional period, the free movement of people will continue, the European Court of Justice will go on having judgements over British business and, of course, we'll go on paying a membership fee.

Cyclist 'blamed victim' after fatal crash,"Kim Briggs died after being injured while crossing Old Street in Shoreditch in February A cyclist who knocked over and killed a woman posted on online forums the crash was ""her fault"", the Old Bailey heard. Charlie Alliston, of Trothy Road, Bermondsey, was 18 when he allegedly hit Kim Briggs while going 20mph in central London in February 2016. Mrs Briggs, 44, suffered brain injuries, including two skull fractures and died in hospital days later. In what is believed to be a legal first, Mr Alliston, now 20, is on trial for manslaughter, which he denies. He also denies causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving. HR consultant Mrs Briggs, of Lewisham, south London, had been on her lunch break when the crash happened. The jury heard Alliston had been riding a ""fixie"" - a fixed wheel track bicycle with no front brake used by track racing cyclists - which is not legal on the road without modification. A few days after the incident in Old Street, Shoreditch, Mr Alliston posted a comment online, claiming he had tried to warn Mrs Briggs but that she had ""ignored me"" and ""stopped dead"" in his path, the court heard. The jury was told he wrote: ""I feel bad due to the seriousness of her injuries but I can put my hand up and say this is not my fault."" Charlie Alliston said Mrs Briggs had ""ignored me"" and ""stopped dead"" in his path on online forums, the court heard On the forum he described how their heads collided and hers ""ricocheted"" into his, the trial heard. He wrote: ""It is a pretty serious incident so I won't bother saying she deserved it. It was her fault but she did not deserve it."" He went on to claim in the forum Mrs Briggs had been on her mobile phone at the time of the incident, the court heard. Jurors at the Old Bailey were shown CCTV footage of the collision on 12 February and were told the defendant had been riding a black PlanetX carbon frame fixed rear pedal cycle. That type of bike is more commonly seen racing at the Olympic velodrome, jurors were told. If Mr Alliston had been riding a bike with proper brakes, he would have been able to avoid the collision with Mrs Briggs, prosecutor Duncan Penny QC said. The trial continues.

Car rams French cafe killing girl,"The driver is thought to have rammed the car deliberately into the pizzeria A car has crashed into a pizzeria in a village east of the French capital Paris, killing a 13-year-old girl and injuring 13 other people. The driver of the BMW was arrested after the vehicle rammed the terrace of the cafe in Sept-Sorts, near the town of La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre. An interior ministry spokesman told the BBC the driver was 32 and French. While his actions are said to have been deliberate, the incident is not being treated as a terror attack. Five of the injured were said to be in a serious condition. The three-year-old brother of the girl who died was fighting for his life in hospital in Paris. Authorities said the driver had tried to kill himself on Sunday. It appears he had no previous criminal record. According to RTL radio, he told police he had weapons in the car. First reports gave the age of the dead girl as eight, but later she was said to be 13. The incident in Sept-Sorts, a small village 55km (34 miles) east of Paris, happened at around 20:15 (18:15 GMT). ""Half of the car entered the restaurant and knocked down all the customers and staff in its way,"" a soldier was quoted as saying by Le Parisien website. France and a number of other countries have seen deadly vehicle attacks on civilians, notably in the French city of Nice on Bastille Day 2016 when 84 people were killed. Last week, a man rammed a group of soldiers in Paris, injuring six of them, before being shot and wounded by police as he tried to escape.

Pineapples banned from music festivals,"The band was nominated for this year's Mercury Prize for its album How To Be A Human Being Pineapples have appeared on a list of items banned from this year's Reading and Leeds Festivals, alongside fireworks and weapons. Organisers said it was because fans of Oxford band Glass Animals bring hundreds of the fruit to its gigs, in a nod to song Pork Soda which includes the lyrics ""pineapples are in my head"". Drummer Joe Seaward said it would be a ""challenge"" to get in with pineapples. ""Anyone who wasn't bringing a pineapple definitely is now,"" he said. ""It's fruitist. Watermelons are fine, but not pineapples?"" Fans dressed up as pineapples at the band's Glastonbury performance When the group performed at Glastonbury in June the stage was decorated with pineapples and some fans came dressed as the exotic fruit. Other items banned from the festivals include weapons, fireworks, drones and glass. Frontman Dave Bayley said he overheard a conversation once between a homeless man and someone else on the street in which he thought the speaker said: ""Pineapples are in my head."" In retrospect he believes he misheard, but he liked the idea, which stuck with him and decided to include it in the song Pork Soda as a nod to the street scene environment.

Harry Potter's birthplace up for sale,"De Vere House in Lavenham was used as the fictional birthplace of Harry Potter The 14th Century cottage used as the fictional birthplace of Harry Potter is back on the market for almost Â£1m. De Vere House in Lavenham, Suffolk, featured in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One, as the house where the young wizard's parents were killed by Lord Voldemort. It is the second time in five years the Grade I-listed six-bedroom period home has been put up for sale. Estate agents Carter Jonas said it was a ""historically significant"" property.

The Grade I-listed house boasts many period features including a massive timber frame and fireplaces The listed asking price is Â£995,000 In the Harry Potter movie it was seen opposite a fictional graveyard with a Christmas tree in the window, with lights on and music emanating from the house. It takes its name from the De Vere family, known to be the second richest family in the county, after the king, in medieval times. The house is among about 340 listed buildings in Lavenham, which is considered to be the best preserved medieval village in England. In 1651, the sister and youngest brother of Charles II and James II were held under house arrest inside the property. Lavenham is famed as the best preserved medieval village in England with about 340 listed buildings Before it became famed for featuring in the Harry Potter film, De Vere House had royal connections And for a short period between 1649 and 1660, the young princes and princesses were placed under the custody of Mary de Vere, the wife of Lord Fairfax. The house has retained its period features, including a massive timber frame, fireplaces, wall paintings and a rare stone spiral staircase with a carved brick handrail.

Big Ben backlash and Brexit plan published,"The government's decision to try to negotiate a temporary customs relationship with the EU after Brexit is widely discussed. The Daily Mail,externalsays ""an eminently workable"" Brexit strategy is taking shape. According tothe Times,external, Chancellor Philip Hammond has won a cabinet battle for a business-friendly Brexit transition, which could see the current arrangement stay in place for up to three years. The paper says the government's proposals show Mr Hammond has the upper hand over Trade Secretary Liam Fox - who had wanted to be able to sign deals with non-EU countries straight away. But an analysis piece inthe Guardian,externalargues that it is Mr Hammond who has ""raised the white flag"", giving up his dream of an indefinite transition phase. John Springfield from the pro-European think tank, the Centre for European Reform, argues inthe Guardian,externalthat it is the EU that will decide the nature of any transition period Britain gets, and the type of deal put forward by the government is impossible to agree with the EU. There's simply not enough time left to negotiate it, he says. The Sun,externaldisagrees. The paper argues it is as much in Brussels' interest as the UK's to get a deal. The paper says that makes an agreement far more likely than not. CityUK, which represents the London financial sector, tellsthe Financial Times,externalit welcomes an interim customs period - calling it vital. Meanwhile, the CBI says the proposals are ""encouraging"" but both organisations say more is needed. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external There is criticism of plans to stop Big Ben's chimes because of concerns about the hearing of workers involved in a restoration scheme. The Daily Mail,externalbelieves health and safety has succeeded in silencing the bells where the Luftwaffe failed. The Sun,externalsays the project is ""all bong wrong"" and officials should have come up with a more imaginative solution to protect the workers. The Daily Telegraph,externalalso asks why a compromise was not possible to keep the bell in action. In its leader column, the paper says that the most famous emblem of the nation is being silenced at a crucial time as the UK negotiates the terms of its new identity. It asks ""if the ravens are also to be dispatched from the tower"" a reference to the superstition that if the ravens leave the Tower of London the Crown - and Britain - will fall. The Guardian,externalbids ""good riddance"" to the collapsed project to build a ""garden bridge"" in the heart of London. The paper says the scheme - which has cost Â£37m in public money - accentuated the north-south divide and may one day be judged as ""the peak of the capital's narcissistic hubris"". In contrast,the Times,externalsays the bridge would have been a fine addition, drawing people in as a symbol of a thriving city, and says the decision to abandon it ""suggests a distinct lack of ambition"". The main story inthe Daily Express,externalis about research which says a glass of wine or pint of beer a day can reduce the risk of early death. Scientists in China, who looked at the health of more than 300,000 Americans, said their findings showed light drinking may actually have ""protective"" health effects. The Mail,externalpoints out this directly contradicts official guidance from the UK's chief medical officer - but the experts argue the benefit to the heart outweighs the risk of cancers. The paper also reports that the way to make wine taste better is to put a high price tag on it, after volunteers who tasted the same wine with different price labels said the one thought to be most expensive tasted the best. BT is to cull about half of the 40,000 public phone boxes on the UK's streets,the Financial Times,externalreports, as it calls time on those which attract more visitors wanting to spend a penny than 60p on a call. Phone boxes still handle 33,000 calls a day and the telecoms company can't decommission boxes in suicide hotspots, or areas where mobile coverage is poor. But it says while those in prisons, hospitals and railway stations make money it often costs more to collect the money from others than they actually generate. And finally,the Sun,externalwarns that the price of a bacon butty is set to soar as the cost of pork has reached a four-year-high on international trading floors. It says demand is outstripping supply and butter is twice the price of a year ago, as farmers switch to making more profitable cheese. ""It's a hard-to-swallow hike for the classic butty"", the paper says.

Brexit: Back-to-school exam papers marked,"Traffic queues at the port of Dover in 2016 Exam results are out next week and there is a decidedly back-to-school feel about the papers the government is publishing this week on Brexit. Theresa May is back from her holidays and the cabinet is keen to show that it has been hard at work in her absence, not fighting with each other at all. I will leave it to my political colleagues to assess the substance and significance of Liam Fox and Phillip Hammond shaking hands in front of the whole class, and confine my efforts to marking their Brexit homework. The first paper they have submitted is on the customs union. This is a special club for EU members that allows them to move goods in and out of each others' countries without having to show special ID or empty their pockets (or trucks) at the door. Containers roll on and roll off at both ends with zero hassle. Many businesses and port authorities are worried that leaving the club will mean people are stopped at the border and that these delays will cause long backlogs, interrupt supply chains, increase costs and deter trade. As the head of the port of Dover has put it: ""If we don't get this right, we could face Operation Stack every day in perpetuity."" The answers to these customs questions are therefore important. Yes and no. The government document is very clear that the UK will leave the customs union at the end of March 2019. The UK will then seek to agree an ""interim period"". So what will that look like? There is a big clue in today's paper. The government is promising that businesses will only have to adjust once to our eventual customs relationship with the EU. Lorries pack the M20 motorway in Kent during Operation Stack in 2015 That must mean that the day after we leave the EU, and enter the interim period, there will be no change. So we are out of the customs union, but everything will pretty much stay the same until the interim period is over. The only difference is that because we are technically out of the customs union, we will be able to negotiate our own trade deals with non-EU countries, while enjoying the benefits of frictionless trade we have now. This approach will look to many like the ""having our cake and eating it"" that Boris Johnson was so keen on - and EU officials weren't. The cabinet now seems united that this interim period is finite. The time limit appears to be the next election in 2022. So what happens then? There are two answers. First answer: a brand new ""streamlined"" customs border with the EU. Some combination of technology, negotiation, unilateral rule changes would make for a whizzy low-friction border. Many will say that even if this new system works, it will find it hard to beat what we have now. Others will say that a tiny bit of extra work at the border is a price worth paying for freedom to cut new trade deals. Second answer: a new partnership based on a ""shared approach"" that would remove the need for a customs border altogether. That option has most experts scratching their heads. Whatever it is, it does not exist between the EU and anyone else right now (with the possible exception in a limited way of Turkey), and so is hard to analyse. Overall, what we learn from this document is that the government wants to leave the customs union, while leaving border arrangements identical for up to five years from now. After March 2019, it hopes to negotiate new trade deals, and there is nothing in reality to stop Liam Fox warming relations with prospective partners right now. What is still hard to see is how substantive those negotiations with third parties can really be when we, and they, still have no idea what our future relationship will be with the EU. The government is clearly trying to show the UK and the EU that it is getting its act together with these papers and I'm told this show of unity and effort will be welcomed by business. But it's worth remembering Liam Fox has always been clear that, in his mind at least, an interim agreement means a period of time to adjust from A to B - where B is known and understood by both parties. It is NOT an extra three years to figure out where B might be. The time available to define B - namely, the wider issues such as the financial settlement, trade, tariffs, immigration and rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa - continues to tick down.

Can celebrities change their name?,"Mo Farah wants to follow Andrew Cole and Katie Price by changing his public name What's in a name? Sir Mo Farah is about to find out. The four-time Olympic champion has announced he wants to be known as ""Mohamed"" when he starts the next chapter of his career. The 34-year-old,who won a silver medal in his last ever track raceat a major championships at the weekend, is switching his focus to road racing. And he's marking the fresh start by ditching ""Mo"" for ""Mohamed"". ""My road name is Mohamed,"" he said. ""I just feel like Mo is done. I need to forget about what I've achieved and what I've done."" Richard Fitzwilliams, a public relations consultant, says he's ""very surprised"" by the announcement. ""Everyone loves him as Mo,"" he said. ""You would perhaps write Mohamed if you were asked to. ""But Mo - it's shorter and it's also the way he became world famous, and it's how he has run his way into our hearts and minds. ""So (a change) is almost impossible. I think he's looking for something a little more formal. I don't think he probably expects people to actually use Mohamed in full. ""Another reason why he has got a tough task is there are millions of Mohameds - and only one Mo."" But Rebecca May, PR expert and managing director at Alliance PR, says it is possible to change your name and ""rebrand"". She said: ""Mohamed is not a name change, as such, he just wishes to be known now by his full name, not nickname. ""These intentions appear to reflect Mohamed's next sporting chapter and new career direction. It is the next evolution to his brand. Part of that next step is rebranding. ""Well thought-out and with the right intentions, I would fully support a client under the same circumstances."" The Duchess of Cambridge is still widely known as Kate despite attempts to become Catherine Farah is not the first famous person to attempt a name change - but some have been more successful than others. AfterKate Middleton'sengagement to Prince William, palace officials, members of the royal family, and her fiancÃ©, took to calling her Catherine. The rest of us stuck with Kate. Mr Fitzwilliams says this is partly down to newspapers' fondness for nicknames and familiarity. ""In the media, brevity is always preferable, that's why Catherine didn't catch on,"" he said. ""It's an attempt to be formal when in fact the informal had already taken hold on the popular imagination. ""We still call her Kate. People had warmed to her as Kate, they knew her as Kate."" Manchester United strikerAndy Coledecided that, at the age of 28, he wanted to be known as Andrew. Bearing in mind fans already had a long-standing chant with the original name, it wasn't the easiest request. Seventeen years on, and the media still haven't quite grasped it - recent newspaper articles show both versions of his name are still being used. Yusuf Islam and Muhammad Ali both changed their names after converting to Islam YetMuhammad Alihad no such problems. The American boxing legend had already made a name for himself as Cassius Clay, but in 1964 he dropped his birth name after converting to Islam. Mr Fitzwilliams said: ""That's a very good example of where he was big enough to change. ""He was huge, he didn't need marketing. He was a walking brand himself, backed up with all the talent he needed. He was his own mouthpiece."" British singer-songwriterYusuf Islamalso changed his name, but he found Cat Stevens harder to shake off. He has now incorporated both into hisTwitter handle,external- where he describes himself as ""Yusuf Islam the artist also known as Cat Stevens"". Model and TV presenterKatie Pricemade a concerted effort to rid herself of her glamour model alter ego Jordan. PR expert Mrs May described it as a ""successful and strategic rebrand to mark her new phase from glamour to mother and entrepreneur"". And one celebrity has almost made a career out of changing his name. American hip-hop star Sean Combs' various incarnations have includedPuff Daddy, Puffy, P. Diddy, Diddy and Swag (although the last one was just for a week). Mrs May said: ""P Diddy has the bank account to prove that changing his name has not been detrimental to his journey."" So can Mo pass the baton to Mohamed? His fans - and the world's PR experts - will watch the handover with interest. Why are more people changing their name?

Disruption is over - and Facebook won,"Snap's disappointing earnings report contrasted with strong figures from Facebook last month On Friday, another one bit the dust. As Snap's shares plunged following disappointing results, it became clear that the myth that a feisty young challenger to Facebook could topple the social media giant from its perch was just that - a myth. Of course, the company behind Snapchat is still a very impressive young business, building an audience of 173 million mostly young daily users in just five years and changing the way they communicate, in fun and inventive ways. But its future as an independent company looks uncertain, with talk of it being swallowed up by Google or another web giant. The deep pockets of Facebook, which bought Instagram and WhatsApp, and has relentlessly copied any challenger it couldn't buy, meant that Snap was always going to struggle to deliver on the vision of rapid growth it outlined when marketing its shares earlier this year. And that just adds to the growing sense that the days of creative destruction in the technology industry may be over, and that we are looking at a world where the big winners of the past decade - Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, or ""Gafa"" as this four-headed beast is sometimes described - will rule unchallenged. Instagram introduced its Snapchat-like Stories feature a year ago In its young life, Facebook has constantly been seen as under threat - and indeed it has fostered that view whenever there has been talk of curbing its power. Just as it had left Bebo, MySpace and Friends Reunited in the dust, the story went, it too could soon be heading for obsolescence as fickle users turned to the new, new thing. But the truth is the social media war is over and Facebook is the winner. A few smaller players such as LinkedIn and Twitter and, yes, Snapchat will have substantial audiences but struggle to make much money. But, apart from in China, the company that is now worth nearly $500bn (Â£385bn) will continue to be the biggest force in the way we communicate for the foreseeable future. The other members of the Gafa quadrumvirate also look secure in their dominance. Google won the battle for search on the desktop long ago, and has now become equally powerful on the mobile internet. Amazon is the undisputed champion of online retailing and logistics and has built a lead in cloud computing. And while Apple has a relatively small share of the global smartphone market, it has gobbled up most of the industry's profits for the past seven years. Snap shares plunge as losses mount Facebook introduces new video service Facebook Watch and the reinvention of TV Facebook flush with advertising money Now, key trends in technology mean the giants are poised to grow immeasurably richer. As advertising spending is aimed increasingly at phones, Google and Facebook already have most of the mobile ad revenue. But it is in the use of artificial intelligence that the technology giants aim to cement their technological lead. I was told recently that an AI researcher emerging from a top US university can command a salary of $500,000 a year in a first job. It is not start-ups paying that kind of money but Facebook and Amazon. Of course. you can find lots of brilliant artificial intelligence researchers in the UK - but many of them now work for American companies, with start-ups such as DeepMind and Swiftkey snapped up by Google and Microsoft respectively. So, should we worry about the huge and growing power of these businesses? Unsurprisingly, the companies still insist that at any moment they could be disrupted out of existence by a smart new start-up. But, so far, American competition regulators have also been pretty relaxed, because they tend to focus mainly on whether consumers are paying excessive prices because of a lack of competition. With social media and search giants offering excellent services for nothing, they see few causes for concern right now. In Europe, regulators tend to be somewhat more sceptical about whether companies with monopoly powers deliver for consumers in the long run. Mark Zuckerberg's social network is facing regulator scrutiny into its terms and conditions, but the investigation is at an early stage That is why we have seen the EU take action against first Microsoft and now Google, where American regulators have mostly left them alone. And while Europe's competition authorities insist that any action they take is based on law, not politics, there is undoubted concern among the continent's politicians about so much power over our lives being concentrated in  the hands of a handful of companies based on America's West Coast. So far, however, Facebook has been relatively untouched by this tougher regulatory approach, even if politicians complain about issues such as fake news and the presence of extremist content. In the past year, we have seen it, arguably, play a key role in electing an American president, its global audience has risen above two billion, and it has now moved into video content, taking on YouTube and Netflix. In an interview this weekend with the New York Times, the former Downing Street strategistturned Silicon Valley guru Steve Hilton said,external: ""A lot of the foundational philosophical approaches of tech leaders are actually all about decentralisation of power."" Mark Zuckerberg may tell us that Facebook - where, incidentally, Mr Hilton's wife is now a senior executive - is all about giving power back to communities. But increasingly it seems that wealth, influence and control of the key technology of our age, artificial intelligence, are being centralised at addresses in Menlo Park, Mountain View, Cupertino and Seattle.

Trump condemns 'evil racism' in Virginia,"This video can not be played Trump: ""Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs"" US President Donald Trump has spoken out against racist violence after the killing of a protester in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. ""Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs,"" he told reporters. He said the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists were ""repugnant"" to everything Americans held dear. Mr Trump was criticised for not specifically denouncing extremists in his initial comments on the violence. Heather Heyer, 32, died and 19 others were hurt when a car rammed into people protesting against a far-right march. This video can not be played Post-war US anti-Nazi film makes comeback James Alex Fields, 20, was formally charged on Monday with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. He was also denied bail during his appearance in court via video from jail. He is said to have harboured Nazi sympathies. The justice department is opening a civil rights investigation into the incident. Charlottesville victim was 'a strong woman' Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise White supremacists face backlash A reckoning in Charlottesville Who is the car-ramming attack suspect? On Monday, Mr Trump arrived back at the White House from his golf estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, to issue a comprehensive condemnation. This video can not be played Photojournalist Ryan M Kelly was covering the protest when the car ploughed into the crowd ""We condemn this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence,"" he said. ""It has no place in America."" ""Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America,"" He paid tribute to Ms Heyer as well as two police officers killed in a helicopter crash after helping to tackle the unrest. Why US right-wing groups are on the rise Ms Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, thanked the president for his ""words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred"". This video can not be played Marissa Blair, friend of Heather Heyer: ""It was an act of terror"" She told NBC News in a statement she also sent her condolences for the families of the two state troopers who were injured. But some felt Mr Trump's comments came too late. Civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton criticised Mr Trump for waiting 48 hours before issuing a full condemnation. ""We had the head of state of Germany speak before we had the president of this country,"" he told MSNBC. ""His silence spoke volumes to people. It was too little, too late."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Monday afternoon Donald Trump tried to put out yet another fire of his own making. The president prefaced his explicit condemnation of the KKK, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists with the words ""as I said on Saturday"" - but the problem was he had said nothing of the sort. In the hours after the violence in Charlottesville, Mr Trump had offered a broad condemnation of ""many sides"" - and caught hell for it from liberals and members of his own party, who felt compelled to break ranks with their leader. Two days later, the president was in front of cameras again, with words that should have been easy - and obvious to most in a nation that expects its presidents to be comfortable condemning racist extremism. Even on Monday, however, the president's strong words were undermined somewhat by his off-topic introductory boasts of the nation's economic strength and the fact that his obviously carefully crafted statement was read off teleprompters - a practice for which candidate Trump regularly mocked Barack Obama. After finishing his remarks, the president quickly exited the room, as reporters asked why he had not spoken sooner. The president did not answer, but such questions will follow him in the days ahead. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said earlier that the deadly violence in Charlottesville met ""the definition of domestic terrorism"" - a phrase which Mr Trump declined to use to describe the events. Mr Sessions announced on Saturday the Justice Department had opened a federal civil rights investigation into the deadly incident. Hundreds of white nationalists had convened in Charlottesville to protest against the removal of a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. They were challenged by anti-fascist and counter-protesters and the rally erupted into violent clashes. Shortly after, Ms Heyer and several others who were leaving the area were struck by the car. This video can not be played Holocaust survivor Marianne Rubin joins protests in Union Square Park, New York. Courtesy CBS News Protests and vigils in solidarity with the victims were held in many US cities on Sunday. In Seattle, police used pepper spray to stop protesters approaching a pro-Trump rally. Among those to criticise Mr Trump was Ken Frazier, CEO of drugs giant Merck, who announced on Mondayhe would resignfrom the president's American Manufacturing Council.

Garden Bridge officially abandoned,"A review of the project said more than Â£37m had already been spent A Â£200m plan to build a bridge covered with trees over the River Thames in central London has officially been abandoned. The Garden Bridge Trust said it had failed to raise private funds since losing the support of the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, in April. It comesafter a review of the project recommended it be scrapped. At least Â£37.4m of public funds has already been spent on the project and a further Â£9m is at risk. In total, an estimated Â£46.4m of taxpayers' money - calculated as direct grants of about Â£26m from the Department of Transport (DfT), around Â£11m in services in kind from Transport for London (TfL) and the remainder in cancellation costs - has been spent, according to the review by Dame Margaret Hodge. Mr Khan said it was his ""duty to ensure taxpayers' money was spent responsibly"". ""I have been clear since before I became mayor that no more London taxpayers' money should be spent on this project and when I took office I gave the Garden Bridge Trust time to try and address the multiple serious issues with it,"" he said. ""Londoners will, like me, be very angry that London taxpayers have now lost tens of millions of pounds - committed by the previous mayor on a project that has amounted to nothing.""

The mayor also refused to provide a financial guarantee to cover ongoing maintenance of the bridge, estimated to cost about Â£3m a year, which the trust said would be covered by closing the bridge to the general public for 12 days a year so it could be rented to corporate clients . Foreign Secretary and former London mayor Boris Johnson accused Mr Khan of killing the Garden Bridge out of spite. ""Labour has no vision for London and no ambition,"" he said. ""The Garden Bridge was a beautiful project and could have been easily financed."" The trust blamed losing the mayor's support for its inability to raise the necessary private funds to complete the project. It said all potential benefactors and trustees decided the project could not happen without the support of the mayor. But as early as January, the trust filed accounts for 2016 at Companies House in which its chairman Lord Davies admitted the project was not currently a ""going concern"" and that it had failed to raise any private funds since August 2016. The same accounts showed the trust had yet to secure the land on the South Bank of the Thames for the bridge's southern landing. By April, when the project lost Mr Khan's support, the trust had still not secured the land on the South Bank. In a letter to Mr Khan, Lord Davies said: ""We are incredibly sad that we have not been able to make the dream of the Garden Bridge a reality and that the mayor does not feel able to continue with the support he initially gave us."" He said the trust had raised Â£70m of private money towards the project and had satisfied most of the planning permission conditions. ""The Garden Bridge would have been a unique place; a beautiful new green space in the heart of London, free to use and open to all, showcasing the best of British talent and innovation,"" Lord Davies said. ""It is all the more disappointing because the trust was set up at the request of TfL, the organisation headed up by the mayor, to deliver the project.  It is a sad day for London because it is sending out a message to the world that we can no longer deliver such exciting projects."" This shambles is an embarrassing mess for the capital and it has already descended into finger pointing and a blame game over who is culpable for wasting Â£46.4m of public money. The trust blames the current mayor Sadiq Khan for not giving guarantees over maintenance. He blames the previous mayor Boris Johnson for backing a scheme financially that was not value for money, while Mr Johnson says it was up to the current mayor to make it work. Ultimately this project was not absolutely vital - it was more a tourist attraction - and was born in a different age when London's transport budget was not as constrained. And I think it got off to a dreadful start back in 2013 - when I started covering this - by crucially not asking locals if they wanted it. Infrastructure needs political consensus, as projects span many parties and leaders, and the Garden Bridge never enjoyed that. Monday'sLondon Evening Standard,,externaledited by former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, also blamed Mr Khan for the collapse of the Garden Bridge project. In October the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed former prime minister David Cameron had personally intervened to approve extra taxpayer funding for the controversial project,against the advice of his own civil servants. A ministerial direction - which a senior civil servant may ask a minister for to show  he or she is ignoring the advice offered - was issued after cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wrote to the Department for Transport expressing the ""frustration"" of both Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne at perceived hold-ups to the funding during 2015 and 2016. The NAO added an initial commitment to provide Â£30m of taxpayers' money was made by Mr Osborne to Mr Khan's predecessor, Boris Johnson, without any DfT involvement. Dame Margaret Hodge's review said the Garden Bridge's costs were spiralling out of control The idea of a ""floating paradise"" as a memorial to Princess Diana was suggested by Joanna Lumley as far back as 1998 The plan gathered momentum in 2012 and the following year then mayor Boris Johnson supported the scheme, pledging that Transport for London would help deliver it. It was also backed by then chancellor George Osborne Planning permission was granted in 2014 The scheme has been beset by problems over its funding andlacked support of some local residents In September 2016,Mr Khan ordered a reviewto find out if value for money was being achieved In October 2016, the National Audit Office revealed David Cameron ignored the advice of his own civil servants not to provide further taxpayer funds to the Garden Bridge Trust because of the risks of it not going ahead In January 2017 accounts filed with Companies House showa Â£56m shortfall in the trust's accounts In April, Dame Margaret Hodgeconcluded it would be better to ditch the projectrather than risk uncertain costs Following this report,Sadiq Khan withdrew his support A review of whether the Garden Bridge offered taxpayers value for money was launched at about the same time the NAO report was released. Conducted by Dame Margaret Hodge, the former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee and MP for Barking, the review recommended in April that theproject should be scrapped. Andrew Boff, Conservative London Assembly member, said Mr Khan had wasted Â£9m in taxpayers' money as he could have scrapped the project as early as May of last year. Thomas Heatherwick, who designed the bridge, said: ""Our cities need optimistic, amazing people (who supported the project) like this. And London needs new bridges and unexpected new public places. ""The Garden Bridge has not found its right moment, but I hope one day it will and that London continues to be open to ideas that make life here better.""

Ryanair urges two-drink airport limit,"Ryanair has called on UK airports to enforce a two-drink limit, after a BBC Panorama investigation suggested arrests of drunken passengers have risen by 50% in a year. The airline has already banned customers from drinking duty-free alcohol on board. A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year. The Home Office is ""considering"" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Ryanair already stops people flying from Glasgow Prestwick and Manchester to Alicante and Ibiza from bringing alcohol on board the aircraft at all. The company is urging airports to ban the sale of alcohol before 10am and to limit the number of drinks per boarding pass to a maximum of two. Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said: ""This is an issue which the airports must now address. ""We are calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, particularly with early morning flights and when flights are delayed."" This video can not be played Ally Murphy: ""Drunk passenger tried to open plane door"" Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. Meanwhile, more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: ""People just see us as barmaids in the sky. ""They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before."" Speaking to Radio 5live, DJ Judge Jules,said he witnessed the same sort of behaviour. ""People sort of stealing stuff from the drinks trolley, people groping the cabin crew, people groping one another. I mean the list is endless,"" he said. A House of Lords committee report called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntarycode of conduct on disruptive passengers,,externalwhich most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff were also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appeared drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. Entering an aircraft when drunk or being drunk on an aircraft is a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment Licensing laws which prevent the sale of alcohol outside permitted hours do not apply to airside sales of alcohol at UK international airports. Bars can remain open to serve passengers on the earliest and latest flights - from 04:00 in some cases About 270m passengers passed through UK airports last year* and about a fifth of all duty-free purchases involved wine and spirits** The Civil Aviation Authority reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016 with ""most involving alcohol"". They say the increase is partly down to improved reporting of incidents Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. ""I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. ""Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street. ""We can't allow it not to change."" ""One passenger was so drunk he had to have a member of crew do up his seat belt. During landing we had passengers standing up, despite repeatedly being told to sit down. I heard the most despicable things, totally racist and sexist and disgusting.""Nikki Webber ""There was one woman whose language was vile all through the flight with the hen party. The last straw was once the plane had landed, she walked up the aisle and shouted the vilest language in front of my son.""Sharon Richards ""As the plane is landing... the lads remove their (seatbelts) and start scrapping really badly. I looked around and I saw one lad kick the girl behind me. They kicked me and without thinking about it I heard myself shouting really loudly at them to sit down and put their seatbelts back on.""Tania Chambers ""One passenger was so drunk by the end of the flight, he was unable to leave the aircraft unaided by the time we arrived. The departure time was before 8am.""Paul Shah ""I was seated just behind a stag group who had been drinking in the airport and continued to drink duty free clear spirits from water bottles on the flight. The airline staff did not serve any alcohol that flight and moved a family with young children.""David Moult A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, ""and will respond in due course"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: ""I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. It's the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly."" She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.

S Leone mudslide kills at least 200,"People may have been asleep when mudslides occurred More than 300 people have been killed in mudslides and flooding near Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. A hillside in the Regent area collapsed early on Monday following heavy rains, leaving many houses covered in mud. A BBC reporter at the scene said many people may have been asleep when the mudslide occurred. The number of casualties is expected to rise. Locals were reportedly trying to recover bodies from the rubble and mud with their bare hands. The worst-hit area is thought to be the Regent district on the outskirts of Freetown, where dozens of houses were submerged when the hillside collapsed at about 06:00 GMT. This video can not be played Heavy rains have flooded Freetown's streets Red Cross spokesman Patrick Massaquoi told AFP news agency that 312 were confirmed dead and warned the toll could rise further. Another spokesman for the Red Cross, Abubakarr Tarawallie, told the BBC that at least 100 properties had been submerged and that some had collapsed after a section of Sugar Loaf mountain came down. People in Regent were wading through streets waist-deep in muddy water A Sierra Leonean disaster management official, Candy Rogers, said that ""over 2,000 people are homeless"" as a result of the mudslide in the Regent area, AFP reports. Mr Rogers said a huge humanitarian effort will be required to deal with the aftermath of the flooding. By Umaru Fofana, BBC Africa People are wailing uncontrollably; one woman told me she had lost more than 11 members of her family in the disaster, while another man said he had lost his wife, mother-in-law and children. Hundreds of people are still coming to the area to look for their loved ones. Some of them told me they have not been able to find them. In fact, there is no sign of the dozens of homes that were built at the foot of Sugar Loaf mountain. They are covered in mud, with large areas of mire in some parts. It looks strong, but it is flaky. The concern is that if people walk there they risk sinking in the mud. This video can not be played BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker explains why Sierra Leone has been hit with torrential rain and mudslides. Images posted on Twitter show people wading through streets, waist-deep in muddy water following the downpour in and around Freetown. Allow Twitter content?

Merck chief resigns from Trump council,"Donald Trump and Ken Frazier during a previous White House meeting The head of drugs giant Merck, Ken Frazier, has resigned from President Trump's American Manufacturing Council following Charlottesville. A woman was killed on Saturday when a car rammed into a crowd protesting against a white supremacist rally. Following the death, Mr Trump was criticised for not specifically denouncing the far right. Mr Frazier said: ""I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism."" ""America's leaders must honour our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal."" In response, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Frazier would now have ""more time to lower rip off drug prices"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In January, Mr Trump called on pharmaceutical companies to cut ""astronomical"" drug prices. In a meeting at the Oval Office, the president met Mr Frazier and other executives from companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly, and told them prices for drugs must come down. He said if they brought production back to the US, the administration would lower regulations and speed up approval for new medicines. One of only a handful of black heads of Fortune 500 companies resigns from a White House advisory board in protest at Donald Trump's tepid response to the Charlottesville attacks, and the president cannot resist kicking the man on the way out of the door. While it is a move that is in keeping with Mr Trump's reputation as someone who responds aggressively to any perceived slight, his tweet is politically risky. Pressure will mount on other corporate leaders to follow suit, lest they be viewed as being soft on racism. Leaders such as Thea Lee of the AFL-CIO, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo and  Mary Barra of General Motors are sure to feel the heat from members and shareholders. The White House has been scrambling since Saturday night to control the damage caused by Mr Trump's ""both sides"" comment, when ascribing blame for the Charlottesville violence. The president has faced sharp criticism from the left and the right, as conservative members of Congress show newfound willingness to distance themselves from Mr Trump on this matter. Once again, a Trump tweet complicates the press team's job. While they are busy bailing out the ship, the president is poking more holes in the hull. The White House has rejected criticism of President Trump's response to the violence at the weekend. Demonstrations and vigils have been held in cities across the United States in support of Charlottesville. The huge US conglomerate General Electric (GE) strongly condemned the events at Charlottesville, and said it was a ""proudly inclusive"" company. But it said its chairman, Jeff Immelt, would stay on the Presidential Committee on American Manufacturing. ""With more than 100,000 employees in the United States, it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the US,"" it said. Other company heads have previously stepped down from presidential advisory councils in protest at Mr Trump's policies. Former Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick left the Business Advisory Council in February over the Trump administration's immigration policies. Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney's chief executive Robert Iger left the President's Strategic and Policy Forum in June, after Mr Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Mr Musk also left the manufacturing council. Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive and chairman of Goldman Sachs, tweeted a quote from President Lincoln in response to Charlottesville. He said: ""Lincoln: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand'. Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.""

Big Ben's bongs to fall silent until 2021,"Big Ben's famous chimes will fall silent from next week until 2021 to allow essential repair works to take place. The bongs will sound for the final time at midday on Monday before being disconnected to allow the clock and surrounding tower to be restored. The Great Bell has sounded on the hour for 157 years. It last fell silent in 2007 and before that, for major refurbishments between 1983 and 1985. Parliamentary authorities said stopping Big Ben - the commonly used name for the Palace of Westminster's Elizabeth Tower - would protect workers carrying out the repairs. It will still sound for important events including New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday. The clock's keeper, Steve Jaggs, said Big Ben falling silent was a ""significant milestone"" in the project to restore the tower. ""This essential programme of works will safeguard the clock on a long term basis, as well as protecting and preserving its home - the Elizabeth Tower,"" he added. The Great Bell forms part of the Great Clock in the Elizabeth Tower - commonly known as Big Ben It weighs 13.7 tonnes and the Elizabeth Tower stands 96m (315ft) tall Every hour it strikes an E note, and every 15 minutes four ""quarter bells"" chime To stop the chimes, the striking hammers will be locked until 2021 The landmark Elizabeth Tower is said to be the most photographed building in the UK. Scaffolding is up and repair work has already started. The project's principal architect Adam Watrobski told the BBC the works would install new amenities in the tower, including a lift, toilet and kitchen. Essential maintenance will also be carried out and the building will be made more energy efficient. As well as conservation work to the tower, the Great Clock will be dismantled piece-by-piece and its four dials will be cleaned and repaired. The Ayrton Light, which shines when Parliament is sitting, will also be renovated. This video can not be played Parliament's Elizabeth Tower landmark and the famous clock are showing signs of wear and tear During the repair work, an electric motor will drive the clock hands until the main mechanism has been restored, so it will continue to tell the time. However, the faces will need to be temporarily covered while the clock is undergoing maintenance. The wider Parliamentary estate is also in need of repair, and a multi billion-pound programme involving MPs temporarily relocating has been put forward. Meanwhile BBC Radio 4, which broadcasts the chimes of Big Ben live, has announced it will broadcast a recording when the bells fall silent. Head of station management Denis Nowlan told the Today programme that various alternatives were considered, including the bells of Nottingham Council House. ""We came very close to using the sound of Nottingham's bells,"" he said. However, a spokesperson confirmed: ""After considering various options, we've decided that pre-recording Big Ben's chimes offers the most reliable and resilient option whilst the Palace of Westminster carries out its repairs.""

S Leone mudslide kills 179 - Red Cross,"People may have been asleep when mudslides occurred More than 300 people have been killed in mudslides and flooding near Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. A hillside in the Regent area collapsed early on Monday following heavy rains, leaving many houses covered in mud.

Another spokesman for the Red Cross, Abubakarr Tarawallie, told the BBC that at least 100 properties had been submerged and that some had collapsed after a section of Sugar Loaf mountain came down. People in Regent were wading through streets waist-deep in muddy water A Sierra Leonean disaster management official, Candy Rogers, said that ""over 2,000 people are homeless"" as a result of the mudslide in the Regent area, AFP reports. Mr Rogers said a huge humanitarian effort will be required to deal with the aftermath of the flooding. By Umaru Fofana, BBC Africa People are wailing uncontrollably; one woman told me she had lost more than 11 members of her family in the disaster, while another man said he had lost his wife, mother-in-law and children. Hundreds of people are still coming to the area to look for their loved ones. Some of them told me they have not been able to find them. In fact, there is no sign of the dozens of homes that were built at the foot of Sugar Loaf mountain. They are covered in mud, with large areas of mire in some parts. It looks strong, but it is flaky. The concern is that if people walk there they risk sinking in the mud.

Charlottesville car-ram suspect in court,"This video can not be played The events in Charlottesville were the culmination of months of protests by white supremacists A 20-year-old man accused of ramming his car into a crowd of protesters at a white nationalist rally in Virginia has appeared in court via video from jail. James Alex Fields was denied bail as he was arraigned for second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. Heather Heyer, 32, died and 19 were injured when a car hit demonstrators in Charlottesville on Saturday. Mr Fields is said to have harboured Nazi sympathies. President Donald Trump has been criticised for not specifically denouncing the far-right elements in the weekend's march. This video can not be played Jason Kessler was booed and chased away from his press conference, as the BBC's Joel Gunter reports But the White House has defended his remarks as explicitly condemning the white supremacy groups involved.

Mr Frazier, who is African American, tweeted he had ""a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism"". This video can not be played Photojournalist Ryan M Kelly was covering the protest when the car ploughed into the crowd James Alex Fields looked nervous and listless on the small monitor in the corner of the courtroom. Mostly he kept his head down, his eyes darting occasionally up towards the camera. He was wearing a striped jumpsuit and had the neat, buzzcut hairstyle favoured by many white supremacists and neo-nazis who have united under the banner of the so-called ""alt-right"". Judge Robert Downer read his charges - one count of murder, one count of hit and run, three counts of malicious wounding. Alex Fields spoke briefly to say he was employed by Securitas and Omni Ohio, could not afford a lawyer, and had no ties to Charlottesville. Judge Robert Downer denied him bail, and revealed he could not be appointed a public defender because someone in the public defender's office was directly affected by the crime. His appointed lawyer, Charles Webster, named in court by the judge, had yet to be contacted to inform him of his latest client. In 10 minutes it was over. Outside the court, known white nationalist Matthew Heimbach was shouting that the death of Heather Heyer was the fault of the police. ""Nazis go home,"" the crowd chanted back at him. ""I think I like it in Charlottesville,"" he said. ""I think I'll stay."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday said the deadly violence met ""the definition of domestic terrorism"", adding that the Justice Department was opening a civil rights investigation into the event. ""You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought because this is unequivocally an unacceptable evil attack,"" he said on ABC News' Good Morning America. In pictures: Charlottesville protest GoDaddy expels US neo-Nazi website He told the television programme that FBI agents from the terrorism and civil rights divisions were also investigating the matter. Hundreds of white nationalists convened in Charlottesville on Saturday to protest against the removal of a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. These groups, which include the Ku Klux Klan, Neo-Nazis and other white supremacy organisations, have coalesced under a banner of the so-called ""alt-right"" movement. They were challenged by anti-fascist and counter-protesters and the rally erupted into violent clashes. During the melee, Ms Heyer was struck by a car that rammed into a crowd of dispersing counter-protesters.

Hours after the violence erupted, Mr Trump said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"". ""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he told reporters in New Jersey, where he is on a working holiday. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation."" But his comments did not explicitly condemn the white extremist groups involved in the rally, an omission that was strongly criticised by Republicans and Democrats alike. This video can not be played The US president ignored questions over whether his response went far enough Many, including senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, echoed the sentiment of Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, who tweeted: ""Mr President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism."" The president's national security adviser, HR McMaster, went further by commenting: ""Anytime that you commit an attack against people to incite fear, it meets the definition of terrorism."" The mayor of Charlottesville, Democrat Mike Signer, drew a link between the events and the rhetoric of Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign,saying,externalthat ""these anti-Semites, racists, Aryans, neo-Nazis, KKK"" had come out of the shadows after having ""been given a key and a reason to come into the light"".

In response to the criticism, the White House issued a statement on Sunday clarifying that Mr Trump's condemnation had included white supremacists.

Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups,"" a spokesperson said.

Trump condemns 'evil racism',"This video can not be played Trump: ""Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs"" US President Donald Trump has spoken out against racist violence after the killing of a protester in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. ""Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs,"" he told reporters. He said the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists were ""repugnant"" to everything Americans held dear. Mr Trump was criticised for not specifically denouncing extremists in his initial comments on the violence. Heather Heyer, 32, died and 19 others were hurt when a car rammed into people protesting against a far-right march.

Charlottesville victim was 'a strong woman' Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise White supremacists face backlash A reckoning in Charlottesville Who is the car-ramming attack suspect?

""We had the head of state of Germany speak before we had the president of this country,"" he told MSNBC. ""His silence spoke volumes to people. It was too little, too late."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Monday afternoon Donald Trump tried to put out yet another fire of his own making. The president prefaced his explicit condemnation of the KKK, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists with the words ""as I said on Saturday"" - but the problem was he had said nothing of the sort. In the hours after the violence in Charlottesville, Mr Trump had offered a broad condemnation of ""many sides"" - and caught hell for it from liberals and members of his own party, who felt compelled to break ranks with their leader. Two days later, the president was in front of cameras again, with words that should have been easy - and obvious to most in a nation that expects its presidents to be comfortable condemning racist extremism. Even on Monday, however, the president's strong words were undermined somewhat by his off-topic introductory boasts of the nation's economic strength and the fact that his obviously carefully crafted statement was read off teleprompters - a practice for which candidate Trump regularly mocked Barack Obama. After finishing his remarks, the president quickly exited the room, as reporters asked why he had not spoken sooner. The president did not answer, but such questions will follow him in the days ahead. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said earlier that the deadly violence in Charlottesville met ""the definition of domestic terrorism"" - a phrase which Mr Trump declined to use to describe the events. Mr Sessions announced on Saturday the Justice Department had opened a federal civil rights investigation into the deadly incident. Hundreds of white nationalists had convened in Charlottesville to protest against the removal of a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. They were challenged by anti-fascist and counter-protesters and the rally erupted into violent clashes. Shortly after, Ms Heyer and several others who were leaving the area were struck by the car.

Lovefilm DVD rental service to close,"Lovefilm offered DVDs and Blu-rays to rent via post The Lovefilm By Post DVD rental service will cease to operate on 31 October this year, its owner Amazon has said. Amazon cited a ""decreasing demand"" for the discs and a growing number of customers who were streaming movies and TV series instead. The move has irritated some fans, who argue that a wider range of films is available to rent on DVD and Blu-ray. Lovefilm was founded in 2002 and acquired by Amazon in 2011, when it had more than 1.4 million subscribers. For a monthly subscription fee, Lovefilm customers could receive a DVD or Blu-ray disc of their choice via post that they would send back once watched. From 2010, some content could also be accessed via online streaming instead. A spokesman for Amazon told the BBC it planned to donate Lovefilm's thousands of discs ""to charity partners"". The spokesman did not say how many individual discs this amounted to, but he noted that Lovefilm's catalogue covers more than 80,000 titles. ""We have very much enjoyed delivering the Lovefilm By Post service to our customers,"" said Amazon in a statement. ""However, over the last few years we've seen a decreasing demand for DVD and Blu-ray rental as customers increasingly move to streaming. ""We are committed to finding alternative roles for all Lovefilm employees within Amazon."" Some fans of Lovefilm were left disgruntled by the decision. ""It's not great, to be honest,"" customer Michael Harrison told the BBC. He argued that there was a wider selection of films available to rent in physical form than with streaming services. ""You don't have to buffer it, or worry about pixelation,"" he added. ""I live in a small town and we don't have many shops around - it was great for me to get films posted to me."" Another customerwrote on Twitter:,external""Very sad at the demise of Lovefilm. ""We're old school in my house and still enjoy renting our DVDs."" Amazon has publisheda help page on its website,externalfor customers of Lovefilm, notifying them of the service's closure.

'Online trolls won't stop me boxing',"A survey suggests girls are more likely to be bullied online than boys A 14-year-old amateur boxer is fighting back after online trolls told her that boxing was ""not for girls"". Sophie, from Yorkshire, says girls should not be put off the ring - or other hobbies - even if it means they receive abuse on social media. ""People inbox us and say, 'You shouldn't be doing it, it's a boy's sport',"" she said. Girls are more likely to be harassed on social media than boys, according to arecent survey of 11-18 year olds,external. Sophie said that she and other girls in her boxing club had been bullied by social media trolls - people who leave upsetting and abusive messages online. ""It's purely because we're girls and 'should' be wearing make-up and stuff,"" she said. ""People started bullying me over it because of the way I dress."" Sophie admitted she has ""deleted quite a lot of photos off Facebook"" when people left negative comments about her wearing tracksuits in and outside the boxing ring. Nearly half of girls in the UK say they have experienced abuse online, according to a study of 1,002 people aged 11 to 18. This could be an upsetting message from a stranger, a bullying comment from a social media ""friend"", or an image being shared without their consent. Children's charityPlan International UK,external, which commissioned the survey, found that 48% of girls and 40% of boys had been harassed online. Sophie said girls get ""treated a lot differently on social media than lads"". ""People don't like that because I do wear quite a lot of boys trackies and tops and stuff like that,"" she said. Speaking of her local boxing club, she added: ""We post quite a lot of our photos on Facebook."" The recent success ofOlympic champion boxer Nicola Adamsand has in part helped shift attitudes towards girls and women boxing. ""Us girls we do quite a lot of boxing,"" Sophie said. ""More of us like to push ourselves to the limit that we can."" But 15-year-old Ambrin, from London, says girls are often left to ""protect themselves"" against social media bullies. She says she's modified her behaviour to try to avoid online abuse. ""I was always very careful if I was going to share a political opinion, I would do it under an account that didn't have my name,"" she said. She uses Snapchat and used to use Instagram - but stopped after someone in her school also set up an account threatening to post nude pictures of girls in her year. ""The school couldn't really do much about it because they didn't know who was posting them,"" she said. Ambrin says social media can put pressure on young people as ""everything's being shared"" Tanya Barron, Plan International UK's chief executive, said girls risked ""losing their voices"" if they avoided posting pictures or comments because of fear of being bullied. The survey found that 73% of girls and 59% of boys had chosen not to post pictures or comments for this reason. ""Girls are self-censoring on social media for fear of backlash from others,"" Ms Barron said. She says children should be allowed to express themselves - whether that is through their sport, or because they have an opinion - without feeling threatened. ""We're calling on every one to stand up for girls online, calling out abuse when we see it and encouraging a space in which girls can find their voice,"" she said. Advice from Childline's counsellors: Don't keep online bullying to yourself or try to deal with it alone - tell an adult you trust Don't reply to any nasty messages you receive, but keep it so you can show someone Don't share, comment, or like any bullying posts - this could make the bullying worse Tell the police if something is serious or talk to a Childline counsellor Try an alternative to social media, such as a writing a blog or short story. This could be anonymous if you don't want people to know you wrote it Someone might be making you feel bad by sending messages about you being different, but remember that being different is an amazing thing Instagram 'worst for young mental health' Porn site age verification from 2018 Adams wins on professional debut Plan International UK Childline At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Ryanair calls for two-drink limit,"Ryanair has called on UK airports to enforce a two-drink limit, after a BBC Panorama investigation suggested arrests of drunken passengers have risen by 50% in a year. The airline has already banned customers from drinking duty-free alcohol on board. A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year. The Home Office is ""considering"" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Ryanair already stops people flying from Glasgow Prestwick and Manchester to Alicante and Ibiza from bringing alcohol on board the aircraft at all. The company is urging airports to ban the sale of alcohol before 10am and to limit the number of drinks per boarding pass to a maximum of two. Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said: ""This is an issue which the airports must now address. ""We are calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, particularly with early morning flights and when flights are delayed."" This video can not be played Ally Murphy: ""Drunk passenger tried to open plane door"" Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. Meanwhile, more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: ""People just see us as barmaids in the sky. ""They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before."" Speaking to Radio 5live, DJ Judge Jules,said he witnessed the same sort of behaviour. ""People sort of stealing stuff from the drinks trolley, people groping the cabin crew, people groping one another. I mean the list is endless,"" he said. A House of Lords committee report called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntarycode of conduct on disruptive passengers,,externalwhich most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff were also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appeared drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. Entering an aircraft when drunk or being drunk on an aircraft is a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment Licensing laws which prevent the sale of alcohol outside permitted hours do not apply to airside sales of alcohol at UK international airports. Bars can remain open to serve passengers on the earliest and latest flights - from 04:00 in some cases About 270m passengers passed through UK airports last year* and about a fifth of all duty-free purchases involved wine and spirits** The Civil Aviation Authority reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016 with ""most involving alcohol"". They say the increase is partly down to improved reporting of incidents Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. ""I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. ""Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street. ""We can't allow it not to change."" ""One passenger was so drunk he had to have a member of crew do up his seat belt. During landing we had passengers standing up, despite repeatedly being told to sit down. I heard the most despicable things, totally racist and sexist and disgusting.""Nikki Webber ""There was one woman whose language was vile all through the flight with the hen party. The last straw was once the plane had landed, she walked up the aisle and shouted the vilest language in front of my son.""Sharon Richards ""As the plane is landing... the lads remove their (seatbelts) and start scrapping really badly. I looked around and I saw one lad kick the girl behind me. They kicked me and without thinking about it I heard myself shouting really loudly at them to sit down and put their seatbelts back on.""Tania Chambers ""One passenger was so drunk by the end of the flight, he was unable to leave the aircraft unaided by the time we arrived. The departure time was before 8am.""Paul Shah ""I was seated just behind a stag group who had been drinking in the airport and continued to drink duty free clear spirits from water bottles on the flight. The airline staff did not serve any alcohol that flight and moved a family with young children.""David Moult A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, ""and will respond in due course"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: ""I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. It's the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly."" She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.

S Korean leader in plea to avoid war,"Gen Dunford (L) met President Moon (R) during his tour of the region South Korean President Moon Jae-in has called on his US ally to help prevent a war, amid worsening tension over the North's nuclear threat. Mr Moon told the visiting top US military official that there must be a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Gen Joseph Dunford said the US priority was diplomacy but he added that it was committed to defending the South against a possible military attack. The North on Monday said any war could ""only be turned into a nuclear war"". Also on Monday, China's commerce ministry issued an order banning a slew of imports from North Korea, in line with additional UN sanctions that were announced earlier this month. The sanctions were introduced in response to a wave of missile tests and increased military rhetoric from North Korea. In another development, Ukraine has denied supplying North Korea with rocket engines from one of its factories. Areport in the New York Times,externalsuggests that Soviet-era engines made at the Yuzhmash factory in Dnipro (the city known until recently as Dnipropetrovsk) were supplied to the North illegally. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko visited the Yuzhmash factory in 2014 What does Kim Jong-un really want? What could North Korea do? North Korea's neighbours consider risk of war US President Donald Trump has warned North Korea against threatening the American territory of Guam. The US has 28,500 troops in South Korea. Speaking on Monday, Mr Moon said: ""Our top priority is the national interest of [South Korea] and our national interest lies in peace. ""I am confident that the US will respond to the current situation in a calm and responsible manner in line with our policy direction."" This video can not be played South Koreans give their views on Trump's strategy on North Korea He urged the North to ""stop all provocations and hostile rhetoric immediately, instead of worsening the situation any further"". Gen Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said after meeting Mr Moon that the US sought a peaceful resolution to the crisis with the North. ""Our job is to make sure our leadership has an option available to them,"" he added, as quoted by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. ""I believe there are two things we are clear about: one, our responsibility to defend against attack, two, our requirement to make sure we have a decisive response in the event of attack."" The US, he said earlier, had ""viable military options in the event that the diplomatic and economic pressurisation campaign fails"". This video can not be played President Trump says North Korea will be in ""big, big trouble"" if it acts against Guam The general is due to travel on to China and Japan. The North's news agency, KCNA, warned on Monday that a conflict could be sparked by ""a minor incident"". ""The problem is that if the war occurs, it can only be turned into a nuclear war,"" it said.+ On Sunday, US National Security Adviser HR McMaster said he did not think the sides were closer to war than a week ago, whileCIA Director Mike Pompeo saidhe saw no intelligence to suggest the sides were on the cusp of a nuclear war. Reality Check: Are Trump's assumptions right? Kim Jong-un, North Korea's supreme commander Trump administration's mixed messages Who said it: Trump or Kim? Meanwhile, China has signalled it will halt iron, iron ore and seafood imports from North Korea starting on Tuesday, following the UN resolution on sanctions. John Sudworth, BBC Beijing correspondent China's announcement today formally incorporates the new tougher sanctions into its customs regulations but then it has signed up to the previous rounds of sanctions, only to be seen to drag its feet. The big question is whether it's going to be any different this time. There are signs that the much tougher line coming from Washington is having some effect on Beijing. It has already stopped imports of North Korean coal and the total value of all imports is down compared with this time last year. But China has said all along that sanctions are for targeting North Korea's weapons programmes, not choking off the wider economy. Total trade, taking into account both imports and exports, has grown this year compared with  last. Importing coal, seafood, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore from North Korea is banned Countries cannot receive new North Korean workers No new joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals No new investment in existing joint ventures More individuals targeted with travel bans and assets freezes Member states to report to the UN Security Council within 90 days on how they have implemented resolution What S Koreans think of Trump.

China 'internet addict' death sparks fury,"Some internet addiction ""boot camps"" employ military-style discipline in treating patients A Chinese teenager has died days after he was sent to an internet addiction treatment centre, reigniting criticism of these controversial institutions. The 18-year-old had allegedly sustained multiple injuries, and the centre's director and staff members have been held by police, according to reports. The incident took place earlier this month in eastern Anhui province. China has seen a proliferation in so-called ""boot camps"" aimed at treating internet and gaming addictions. Some are known for their military-style discipline and have been criticised for overly harsh practices. In the latest incident in Anhui, the teenager's mother, surnamed Liu, said her son had developed a serious internet addiction which she and her husband were unable to help. The parents then decided to send their son to a centre in Fuyang city which touted to use a combination of ""psychological counselling and physical training"" to treat children for their internet addictions, reported the Anhui Shangbao newspaper. Chinese teen kills mother after being sent to internet boot camp Film shows how Chinese internet addicts are treated Ms Liu dropped off her son on the night of 3 August. Two days later, the parents were informed that their son had been rushed to the hospital, where he later died. The exact cause of the teenager's death is not known. But the parents said they were told by doctors who examined their son's body that he had sustained more than 20 external injuries, as well as several internal injuries. They were allowed to see his body in the mortuary. ""My son's body was completely covered with scars, from top to toe... When I sent my son to the centre he was still fine, how could he have died within 48 hours?"" Ms Liu was quoted as saying in Anhui Shangbao. State broadcaster CCTV said the centre's director and four teaching staff have been held by police, and authorities have shut down the centre while investigations are ongoing. In the wake of the incident, many online and in newspaper editorials called for tighter regulation of addiction treatment centres - but also criticised the teenager's parents. ""In the end this is due to a lack of family education,"" said one commenter on microblogging platform Sina Weibo. An editorial by the Mingguang Daily paper noted that ""some parents, upon discovering the problem, fail to reflect on their responsibility to educate, and instead want to seek third parties' help in solving the problem."" Some treatment centres, like this one in Beijing, do EEG tests to record the electrical activity in patients' brains Addiction ""boot camps"" have grown in number across China in recent years. Some are run out of government hospitals while others are private centres or schools. They remain popular despite growing controversy over some centres' practices, such as beating patients and electroshock therapy, and a string of shocking incidents. Last year, a teenager reportedlykilled her motherfor sending her to a centre where she was allegedly abused. Trent Bax of Ewha Womans University, who has researched Chinese internet addiction, says many centres use ""emotive power advertising"" which appeal to parents who want ""a 'quick fix' solution to their child's problems"". ""The parents are also acting in response to a very real fear that the only child's successful future may never be realised because they refuse to stop gaming and start studying,"" he told the BBC. In some cases, says Prof Bax, parents may also hold the ""'traditional' view of education that permits the use of violence to 'straighten out' a delinquent child"". Chinese authorities have begun cracking down, and earlier this yeardrafted laws,externalwhich, if passed, would explicitly prohibit abusive treatment of internet addicts such as electroshock therapy. Companies have also moved to limit minors' excessive online gaming. Last month, internet giant Tencent beganimposing restrictionson gaming hours for young users of one of its most popular games.

Why has the UK suddenly got the taste for Latin music?,"J Balvin has scored his first truly global smash with Mi Gente Earlier this summer, Luis Fonsi'sDespacitobecame the most-streamed song of all time - an incredible feat for a record that's predominantly in Spanish. But it increasingly looks like it won't be a one-off. Another Latin American song,Mi Gente,external, has replaced Despacito at the top of Spotify's Global Top 50. Here in the UK, it's just broken into the top 20. ""It's amazing. It's such a blessing,"" says singer J Balvin, the Colombian artist who's behind the song. Already a huge star in South America, Balvin has been credited with revitalising reggaeton - a hip-hop-infused blend of reggae and rap that originated in Puerto Rico in the late 1990s. Over the course of four albums, he's taken the genre once called ""reggae en Espanol"" and infused it with African, electronic and Caribbean flavours. Despacito breaks global streaming record The secrets of a hit summer song Gangnam Style loses YouTube crown More importantly, his lyrics trade reggaeton's gritty, underground roots for a more universal, romantic narrative. ""Mi mÃºsica no discrimina a nadie,"" he sings in Mi Gente, meaning ""my music doesn't discriminate against anybody"". ""Exactly!"" says the star, when we reference the lyric. ""I'm Latino but I don't do music for Latinos. My music is for everybody in the world. ""Music has to be a tool to unite people, to get people together. It doesn't matter the race, the language, the culture. So that's what I'm saying when I sing that line."" The colourful video for Mi Gente makes the most of J Balvin's idiosyncratic style The global perspective is evident on Mi Gente, which has its roots in a French track -Voodoo Song,external, by Willy William. That song, with its chopped-up vocals samples and hopscotch drumbeats, provides a bonkers backbone to Balvin's hit (which William also produced and sings on). ""We took a risk to make new music, new colours, new ways,"" says Balvin. ""It's crazy what we created."" So what lies behind this sudden explosion in music from Latin America? Aside from Luis Fonsi and J Balvin's megahits, there are five other Spanish-language songs in the Spotify top 50. Sir Lucian Grainge, head of Universal Records, says streaming is the key - giving Latin American artists a platform they would never have received on US (and UK) linguistically conservative radio stations. ""Streaming has changed the face of music discovery and music consumption,""he told the BBClast month. ""We're at the forefront of a new creative era [where] anyone who is good can find an audience."" ""The beautiful thing about streaming is that people arelookingfor this stuff,"" stresses Balvin. ""It's like, they really want to play this music. They're looking for it especially. It's the people talking."" This video can not be played Luis Fonsi's Despacito has become the most-streamed song of all time. Spotify itself has been actively promoting Latin American music in regions outside South America - not least because Mexico and Brazil are two of the streaming service's biggest markets. ""We're proactively trying to push its consumption in countries like Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the UK [and] obviously the US,"" said Rocio Guerrero, Spotify's head of Latin culture. ""There has been a domino effect,"" sherecently told Billboard magazine,external. ""The more songs that we put on the global chart, people are getting more used to listening to songs in a different language."" Balvin has his own take on the phenomenon: ""Well, I think right now kids and the whole world is more open minded,"" he tells the BBC on the phone from Uruguay. ""People are just more open to listening to good vibes, even though they don't understand the words. ""That's beautiful. That's amazing. It's like we're showing the world this is not luck... This is really down to good faith and hard work."" Energia, the singer's fourth album, won best urban album at the 2016 Latin Grammy Awards Balvin has certainly put in the hours since launching his music career 11 years ago. Born JosÃ© Ãlvaro Osorio Balvin, he grew up in Medellin, a striking, hilltop metropolis that was once branded ""the most dangerous city on earth"" - thanks largely to the cocaine-trafficking cartel run by Pablo Escobar. The young musician was largely insulated from that seedy side of the city, growing up in a large house with his well-off family - although they fell on hard times when his economist father went bankrupt in his teenage years. He wasn't particularly aware of reggaeton, sound-tracking his childhood with US rock bands like Metallica and Nirvana. ""Since I was eight, I started playing guitar and that's how I fell in love with Nirvana,"" says the star, who has the band's name tattooed on his knee. ""It's such amazing music. It's a big part of my life."" Aged 18, he went to the US as an exchange student, and discovered hip-hop culture - then spent the next few years bouncing between Medellin, Miami and New York, trying to launch a music career while working illegally in the US as a roofer. It wasn't until he settled back in Colombia and joined a production team called Infinity Music that he started to build a reputation locally, tirelessly promoting his music around the country. ""We travelled by bus, ate the cheapest fast food, spent hours and hours outside radio stations,"" Infinity Music's Juan Pablo Piedrahitarecalled to The Fader in 2015,external. ""We don't want to follow nobody,"" says the star. ""We just want to be us."" The grind paid off: Balvin was signed to EMI Colombia in 2009 and subsequently set up a 360 deal with Universal subsidiary Capitol Latin. All four of the singles from his second album La Familia charted in Colombia's top 10, and he was a featured vocalist on the Colombian version of Robin Thicke's hit singleBlurred Lines,external.  His break-up balladAy Vamos,external, meanwhile, racked up one billion views on YouTube - the first ""urban"" Latin track to do so. Now Balvin is edging on to the world stage. His last album, Energia featured collaborations with Pitbull, Camilla Cabello and Pharrell Williams, while the star found himself watching Kanye West record last year's Life Of Pablo album. ""I went to the studio the day Kanye was doing Ultralight Beams and it was just amazing to see how he works,"" the 32-year-old marvels. ""He would brainstorm with his crew, and they all wanted to find the best idea. It really opened up my mind -  I want to apply that to my own work."" The singer is already one of the biggest stars in Latin America One lesson he won't be taking from the famously mercurial Kanye, however, is how to handle his social media accounts. Balvin is an engaging, witty presence online, posting all of his own messages himself. He's even recorded a song calledSnapchat,externaland another,Ginza,external, which is named after an Instagram filter. ""I can't lie: the phone is like my right hand,"" he jokes. ""But right now the best way to keep connected with people, with your fanbase is through your cell phone. ""I'm on it all the time - but I'll turn it off when I'm going to sleep. I just want to get those frequencies out of my brain, so I turn it off and I take it outside."" When he's not posting photographs from the stage of his current tour, Balvin is ""working like crazy"" on his next album which, he says, will represent both sides of his musical personality - ""the global side and the Latino side"". And, despite having the world's most listened-to song, his ambition is undiminished. ""I want to go bigger,"" he says. ""Everything started with a dream. I dreamt about having one of the biggest Latin albums, I dreamt I'd be a global artist. ""And dreams do come true.""

Murdered teacher's family lose legal bid,"Ann Maguire taught Spanish at Corpus Christi Catholic College for more than 40 years The widower and children of a teacher murdered by a student have lost their legal challenge against a coroner's decision not to call pupils as witnesses at a forthcoming inquest. Ann Maguire, 61, wasstabbed to deathby Will Cornick at Corpus Christi Catholic College, Leeds, in April 2014. A High Court judge has ruled against the call for a judicial review of the coroner's decision. Her widower Don said the family were ""disappointed, not surprised"". He added: ""We've been pulled backwards and forwards through the proverbial hedge quite a few times in the last few years. ""We're still hopeful that somebody will examine the full circumstances surrounding the brutal and tragic murder of Ann and that proper lessons will be learned."" More on this and other Leeds stories The inquest is scheduled to begin at Wakefield Coroners' Court in November. Dismissing the claim for a judicial review, judge Mr Justice Holroyde said: ""I have much sympathy for the claimants, and I fully understand their reasons for wishing to pursue this line of inquiry. ""However, I am unable to accept the submission that the assistant coroner reached a decision which was so seriously flawed as to be unreasonable."" The request for a judicial review was opposed by others, including the sisters of Mrs Maguire. One of them, Sheila Connor, also a teacher, said she was worried about students being questioned as to their actions, or lack of action, before the killing, and the possibility of attaching blame to them. Her views were echoed by Dominic Kelly, the vice-principal of Notre Dame Sixth Form College in Leeds, who said in 2016 that some of its pupils had expressed ""concern that they could have prevented the tragedy"" and ""guilt that they had failed to protect their teacher"". In additional report in May, he added: ""The risk of formally and publicly asking the students involved questions that they have been asking themselves for three years is far greater than any perceived benefit that could be gained."" The Maguire family had wished the coroner to call former pupils, especially those interviewed by the police. Many of them heard Cornick make threats and claim to have knives in his bag on the day of the murder. Most did not take his comments seriously but he threatened a fellow student who said he would report him. Will Cornick is serving a life sentence for stabbing Ann Maguire in 2014 Mr Justice Holroyde said those recorded police interviews should be sufficient for the assistant coroner to consider. He said: ""The assistant coroner was entitled to conclude that there was a clear risk of harm to former pupils in calling them to give evidence, but that there was little prospect of their oral evidence assisting materially in ascertaining the circumstances of Mrs Maguire's death or in learning lessons for the future."" Cornick, who was 15 at the time, wasgiven a life sentence in 2014after he admitted murdering Mrs Maguire, who had taught Spanish at Corpus Christi for more than 40 years. In November 2016, areport by Leeds Safeguarding Children Board saidno-one could have predicted or prevented Mrs Maguire's murder.

Who is Charlottesville attack suspect?,"James Alex Fields Jnr's mother said she ""did not really talk to him about his political views"" A picture has been emerging of the main suspect in the killing of a woman near a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. James Alex Fields Jnr, who is 20 years old and originally from Kentucky, was arrested and charged after a car was deliberately driven into a crowd of anti-fascism protesters. His mothertold local media,externalthat he did not openly express extreme views. But evidence is emerging of a ""very misguided and disillusioned"" young man. This video can not be played Footage captured the moment a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville Mr Fields' former teacher characterised him as such to theCincinnati Enquirer,external, and said his high school research made it clear he had beliefs that were ""very much along the lines of the neo-Nazi movement"". ""A lot of boys get interested in the Germans and Nazis because they're interested in World War II. But James took it to another level."" His mother, Samantha Bloom, had not yet been contacted by authorities when reporters informed her of her son's arrest. She told journalists that she and her son had moved from Kentucky to Maumuee, Ohio, a few years ago for her job. Fields is currently held in Albermarle County Jail, facing charges for killing one and injuring 19 Mrs Bloom, who is paraplegic, said that her son moved out of her home ""five or six months ago"", and that she had been watching his cat while he was in Virginia. She said she did not know the nature of the event he was attending, telling reporters: ""I try to stay out of his political views... I don't get too involved."" ""I thought it had something to do with [US President] Trump."" ""I told him to be careful,"" Mrs Bloom said she advised her son before he departed, adding ""if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully."" Mr Field's father was killed by a drink driver months before he was born, his uncle told the Washington Post, adding that he had left money in a trust for his child to access when he turned 18. ""When he turned 18, he demanded his money, and that was the last I had any contact with him,"" the unclesaid,external. Charlottesville victim was 'a strong woman' Are US right-wing groups on the rise? Charlottesville white nationalist marchers face backlash During a brief court appearance on Monday, he told a judge that he could not afford to hire a lawyer, and identified his employers as Securitas and Ohio Omni. The group call themselves the ""face of American fascism"" The Toledo Blade reports that in June he was found guilty of ""having expired or unlawful licence plates"" on his Dodge Challenger. The newspaper also reports that while living in Florence, Kentucky, his mother called 911 at least nine times ""to say she was fearful of and needed help with her sometimes violent son"". According to ""calls for service"" records provided by the Florence Police Departmentto the Associated Press,,externalMrs Bloom said her son had stood behind her wheelchair wielding a long kitchen knife, and had hit her and locked her in a washroom after she told him to stop playing video games. She also told officers that her son was on medication to help control his temper. After enlisting in the military, Mr Fields was released in December 2015 for ""failing to make training standards"", the military confirmed. Buzzfeed reports,externalthat a now deleted Facebook account appearing to belong to him had overt references to Nazism and a ""Make America Great again"" banner. It also had a photograph of the 20-year-old posing with a car resembling the one used in the attack and a variety of memes popular with white supremacists and neo-nazis who have coalesced under the banner of the so-called ""alt-right"", includingPepe the Frog. Buzzfeed also posted YouTube footage appearing to show Mr Fields chanting homophobic slurs at counter-protesters at the ""Unite the Right"" rally hours before the alleged attack. He was pictured at the event (second from left, above) carrying a shield with the logo of an openly fascist group: Vanguard America. The group's website declares ""America is under attack"" and says: ""If current trends continue, White Americans will be a minority in the nation they built. It's time to take a stand."" Theyreleased a statement on Twitter,externaldenying James Fields had been a member. He has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop after a hit and run. Republican Senator Ted Cruzcalled on the Department of Justice,externalto prosecute the suspect for domestic terrorism.

Scores killed in massive mudslide,"People may have been asleep when mudslides occurred More than 300 people have been killed in mudslides and flooding near Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. A hillside in the Regent area collapsed early on Monday following heavy rains, leaving many houses covered in mud. A BBC reporter at the scene said many people may have been asleep when the mudslide occurred. The number of casualties is expected to rise. Locals were reportedly trying to recover bodies from the rubble and mud with their bare hands. The worst-hit area is thought to be the Regent district on the outskirts of Freetown, where dozens of houses were submerged when the hillside collapsed at about 06:00 GMT. This video can not be played Heavy rains have flooded Freetown's streets Red Cross spokesman Patrick Massaquoi told AFP news agency that 312 were confirmed dead and warned the toll could rise further. Another spokesman for the Red Cross, Abubakarr Tarawallie, told the BBC that at least 100 properties had been submerged and that some had collapsed after a section of Sugar Loaf mountain came down. People in Regent were wading through streets waist-deep in muddy water A Sierra Leonean disaster management official, Candy Rogers, said that ""over 2,000 people are homeless"" as a result of the mudslide in the Regent area, AFP reports. Mr Rogers said a huge humanitarian effort will be required to deal with the aftermath of the flooding. By Umaru Fofana, BBC Africa People are wailing uncontrollably; one woman told me she had lost more than 11 members of her family in the disaster, while another man said he had lost his wife, mother-in-law and children. Hundreds of people are still coming to the area to look for their loved ones. Some of them told me they have not been able to find them. In fact, there is no sign of the dozens of homes that were built at the foot of Sugar Loaf mountain. They are covered in mud, with large areas of mire in some parts. It looks strong, but it is flaky.

Is this a good drawing of Taylor Swift?,"A court sketch and a photo of Taylor Swift Pop star Taylor Swift's lawsuit against ex-radio DJ David Mueller, who she alleges groped her, has raised awareness about sexual assault, and the questioning victims face when they take legal action. Perhaps inevitably, given her high profile and her legions of fans, it's also sparked a debate about the art of court sketches. Many have criticised the court art, arguing that the drawings look nothing like Taylor Swift - or joking that the artist must be a fan of her rival, Katy Perry. Allow Twitter content?

But actually, court sketches play an important role in modern trials - and the artists say there's a lot more to the job than just sketching a likeness. It's often the only way we can get a visual insight into how a trial looks. Whilecameras are allowed,externalin many US courts (and some trials are even televised), cameras are banned from federal courts. Instead, court artists are used to capture key moments of the trial - including a speaker's expressions, emotions and body language. Watch: The art of the court trial Artist William Hennessy Jr, who has covered high-profile trials including those of Chris Brown and Mike Tyson, says it's a challenge because ""nobody's there to pose for you"". Celebrity court cases are particularly tough because ""the more people know the individual, the more critical they're likely to be - so the pressure is on for you to get the likeness accurate"". Bill Hennessy sketched Donald and Melania Trump at Neil Gorsuch's investiture in the Supreme Court He likens the job to being a court reporter. ""You want to think journalistically - you're providing a visual for a story,"" he tells the BBC. ""You want to do it in context and provide a feeling of what a courtroom is like."" Jane Rosenberg was behind the 2015 sketches of Tom Brady that went viral. After they sparked dozens of memes online,she apologised,externalfor ""not making him as good-looking as he is"" and said she had been ""under a lot of pressure to work very quickly"". She did try again - and people were pretty happy with her follow up effort - withone newspaper,externalsaying she had nailed it. Sketch of US footballer goes viral Christine Cornell, a court artist who sketched the Bill Cosby trial, agrees the job involves ""hideous deadlines"". ""You have to get it down very fast - essentially [the moment] the hearing's over is when they want the drawing,"" she tells the BBC. A photojournalist takes a photo of a courtroom sketch of Taylor Swift She says the least amount of time she's had to do a sketch is about half an hour, although ""an hour is more typical"". As if the time pressure isn't bad enough - sometimes courtrooms are so crowded the artists can hardly see the person they're meant to be drawing. ""The best hearings are without a jury, when the judge may allow the artist to sit in the jury box - then you're actually looking at the faces of the people you're drawing,"" Ms Cornell says. ""However, if you're coming in for a hearing you're going to be put in the public area - in which case you're looking at the back of everyone's heads. A sketch of Mr Cosby during the opening proceedings In those cases, she says, court artists need to be good at capturing a person's face from quick glances. ""He may turn to speak to his attorney before the judge comes in, for 30 seconds - you may see his face when he walks in through the door and turns to face the front - those are the moments you wait for so you can capture their likeness."" In the case of the Bill Cosby trial, she was designated a seat behind a pillar - which she describes as ""drawing under the very worst of circumstances"". Luckily, she had practised drawing him during the pre-trial hearings where she was allowed in the jury box - ""so I could draw him very well with just brief glimpses"". A sketch of Mr Cosby watching as a witness gives testimony If you think US court artists have a tough job, spare a thought for their cousins across the pond. In the UK, most courtrooms ban cameras - andartists are prohibited,externalfrom sketching people in court as part of the 1925 criminal justice act. The artists have to make notes during the hearings - and then draw their impressions from memory. Julia Quenzler, a court artist in the UK,told the BBC,externalin a previous interview that she would write brief notes about the hair, facial features, clothing and body language of the main players, before scuttling off to the press room to commit the image to paper. Many judges are against the idea, arguing that that it will change how people behave in court, intimidate witnesses, and make judges and lawyers more likely to perform for the cameras. Others though argue that cameras would allow more transparency - and give the public a better insight into how the judiciary operates. A day in the life of a court artist,external When can you take notes in court? Ms Cornell argues that ""photos are very unfair in the courtroom, where there's supposed to be a presumption of innocence"". Sketches are less intrusive, and capture ""a combination of moments rather than one moment"", whereas a photo or still of someone's expression can be taken out of context, she says. Court sketches are like ""drawing with your heart - and a camera doesn't have a heart"". For journalists, there's one other benefit of knowing a courtroom artist. When the White House banned cameras from some of its press briefings,CNN sent Mr Hennessy,externalthere instead. His sketches of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer attracted a fair amount of media attention, and he said a lot of journalists ""kind of got a kick out of seeing me"" in a room where cameras weren't allowed. So it's fair to say that even though some court sketches go viral for all the wrong reasons, journalists will keep sending artists to places where cameras are forbidden. The art of the court trial.

"Charity founder paid herself Â£31,000","Wendy Watson founded a helpline for people seeking advice on breast cancer and its treatment A national breast cancer charity is being investigated after its founder paid herself Â£31,000, in breach of charity law. Wendy Watson, who launched the National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline in 1996, has resigned as a trustee. Financial irregularities were uncovered by the Charity Commission, which has issued an official warning for ""significant breaches of trust"". Lawyers for Mrs Watson and the charity described the payments as ""an error"". Mrs Watson, of Derbyshire, founded the charity four years after she became the first woman in the UK to have a pre-emptive mastectomy. Five years ago she wasappointed MBE for services to people with breast cancer. The pre-emptive mastectomy procedure was made famous in 2013 when American actress Angelina Joliehad the surgery. The organisation runs a network of charity shops around the country The charity was set up to raise awareness and fund a phoneline where people can speak to Mrs Watson for support and advice. By 2012, it was raising almost Â£1m a year from charity shops in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Humberside and London. Mrs Watson paid herself the sum over the 2014-15 financial year. Trustees cannot be paid without permission from theCharity Commission,external, which regulates registered charities in England and Wales. After looking at the accounts the Charity Commission found that the charity was in ""financial distress"". The accounts for the National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline for 2013, 2014 and 2015 showed it spent 6%, 3.4% and 2.8% respectively of annual donations on ""charitable activities"", such as running the helpline. The average spend for a charity is currently 83%, the Charity Commission said. The rest of the money was spent running the shops and paying staff. The Charity Commission noticed the financial irregularities and decided to investigate and discovered Mrs Watson had paid herself. Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the Charity Commission said it is ""quite normal"" for a charity's profits to fluctuate from year to year, and this affects the amount of money which will go to the charitable work. ""If you think of small charities that are getting off the ground, sometimes they won't make a profit until year three, year four, year five, so it's quite hard to put a thick-and-fast rule on how much money should go to the end cause every year,"" she said. Gina Miller, founder of theTrue and Fair Foundation,external, wants to set a minimum threshold so charities have to spend at least 65% of income on charitable activities. She described the matter as ""absolutely scandalous"". Mrs Miller, who is also known for challenging the government's Brexit plans, said: ""When most people give over their money they believe the majority of it should go towards the end charitable work. ""This charity's spending should have been picked up by the Charity Commission a long time ago."" Gina Miller wants charities to have to spend at least 65% of income on charitable activities It is the first time the commission has issued an official warning under new powers handed down by the government. It also raised concerns about the organisation's record keeping and ""improperly delegating"" management of the charity. The official warning was issued after points raised in a previous inspection last year were not addressed. The charity's shops are described as ""support centres"", but when a BBC reporter visited five of the outlets, the only support offered appeared to be adverts for the helpline number. Ms Russell said it was a ""serious"" case. ""As a trustee, as it says on the tin, you are trusted with other people's money as a volunteer to look after it,"" she said. ""When we found out there were some unauthorised payments to a trustee, we made it clear that it wasn't allowed to continue. ""But when we went back for the second inspection we found they'd continued to make payments in breach of charity law."" A statement from Mrs Watson's lawyers said she had been paid in ""error"" for ""a period while she was a trustee"". It added: ""Wendy Watson has worked full-time for the charity from August 2012 until now. ""She was paid for her work for one year (September 2014-15) [and] during that period, she was also a trustee. ""Neither Ms Watson nor the charity were aware that this was inappropriate until they were informed by the Charity Commission, at which point Ms Watson immediately resigned as a trustee and continued to work without payment. ""Ms Watson was also paid for three months' work at the end of 2016. ""Other than these periods, she has worked full-time on a voluntary basis.""

Web host expels US neo-Nazi website,"The Daily Stormer disparaged Heather Heyer after her death A notorious US neo-Nazi website is being forced to switch domain name providers for a second time in a day after it disparaged a woman who died during protests in Virginia. On Monday morning, the Daily Stormer was given 24 hours to move by GoDaddy. The site was then briefly registered via Google before it acted likewise. Heather Heyer was killed on Saturday after a car rammed into a crowd protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Registrars allows sites to lay claim to unique web addresses. These allow the public to type in easy-to-remember domain names - such as www.uniquename.com - rather than the strings of numbers that represent an owner's actual internet protocol (IP) address. ""The domain is no longer at GoDaddy and we don't host the site,"" theArizona-based company tweeted at,external17:51 BST. Just over an hour later Google issued its own statement: ""We are cancelling Daily Stormer's registration with Google Domains for violating our terms of service.""

Shortly after GoDaddy's initial announcement, a blog post  appeared on the Daily Stormer, claiming the site had been hacked by Anonymous. However, the main Twitter feed for Anonymous has said it has no confirmation that the hacker group is involved. Web giant GoDaddy had given the Daily Stormer 24 hours to move ""Social media sites and those hosting content are very alive to public pressure and perception,"" said Niri Shan, a media lawyer at Taylor Wessing. ""Now you've got politicians saying they'll intervene and legislate if they don't take more actions on the content on their sites, so I think this is part of a bigger picture."" Although freedom of speech was important, private firms had a responsibility to crack down on content that could spread ""extremist ideologies"", said Bharath Ganesh at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""I'm pleased GoDaddy did what they did but I'm a little disappointed they did it after public pressure, I would have liked them to have been more proactive,"" he told the BBC.

Australia deputy PM 'is also NZ citizen',"Barnaby Joyce will refer the matter to Australia's High Court New Zealand's government has confirmed that Australia's deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, is a dual citizen. Dual citizens are not allowed to run for public office under Australia's constitution. Mr Joyce revealed earlier that he may have New Zealand citizenship by descent, but said he will take his case to the nation's High Court. PM Malcolm Turnbull's government risks losing its grip on power if Mr Joyce is ruled ineligible. The office of New Zealand Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne confirmed to Australian media that under New Zealand law, a child born to a New Zealand national is automatically given citizenship. However, Mr Joyce told parliament he received legal advice that he is not in breach of rules. He will remain as deputy PM in the meantime. How a dual citizen crisis befell Australia Mr Joyce is the latest of several Australian politicians to be caught up in dual citizenship scandals. Two senators,Scott LudlamandLarissa Waters, were forced to resign last month over their citizenship status. Another two senators,Matt CanavanandMalcolm Roberts, will also have their eligibility decided by the High Court. This video can not be played Larissa Waters left the Senate over her Canadian citizenship He is the leader of the National Party, the junior partner in Mr Turnbull's conservative coalition. Mr Joyce entered the Senate in 2005, where he served for eight years, before moving to the lower House of Representatives in 2013. Known for his straight-talking comments, Mr Joyce gained international attention by clamping down onJohnny Depp's dogsandrebuking criticsof Australia Day. Speaking in parliament, Mr Joyce said he was contacted by the New Zealand High Commission last week and informed he could be a citizen by descent. ""Needless to say, I was shocked about this,"" he said on Monday. ""Neither I, nor my parents have ever had any reason to believe I may be a citizen of another country."" Mr Joyce's father was born in New Zealand and moved to Australia in 1947. The politician was born in the New South Wales town of Tamworth in 1967. He said: ""Neither my parents nor I have ever applied to register me as a New Zealand citizen. The New Zealand government has no register recognising me as a New Zealand citizen."" Mr Joyce said he had been advised by Australia's solicitor-general that he was not in breach of the constitution. The Section 44 (Disqualification) states that any person who ""is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power... shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives"". Mr Joyce says he is confident about his eligibility This is interpreted as meaning that people with dual citizenship are not permitted to run for office. However, experts have said there is uncertainty surrounding the rules, particularly on the issue of citizenship by descent. Currently, Mr Turnbull's government has only a slim one-seat majority in the House of Representatives. If Mr Joyce were to be ruled ineligible, it would force a by-election, and the government's hold on power would be at risk. However, Mr Turnbull could retain government with the support of independent MPs and minor parties. Treasurer Scott Morrison, a senior government minister, said it was important not to ""leap to conclusions"". Mr Turnbull responding by writing an open letter to Opposition Leader Bill Shorten asking for help in resolving the dual citizenship saga. He said it was time for the High Court to clarify the precise meaning of Section 44. ""With around half of all Australians having a foreign-born parent and with many foreign nations having citizenship laws which confer citizenship by descent, regardless of place of birth, the potential for many, possibly millions of Australians unknowingly having dual citizenship is considerable,"" he wrote in the letter. ""The Australian people must have confidence in our political system and resolving any uncertainty is vital.""

Waterloo works: What you wanted to know,"This video can not be played London Waterloo: Work on new platform underway The UK's busiest railway station is in the midst of a huge engineering project - but what does this mean for passengers? The Â£800m overhaul at London Waterloo has closed half of the platforms and diverted many of the 270,000 journeys made back and forth each day. The work, expected to last three-and-a-half weeks, is to expand the station to take 30% more passengers at peak times. Here are answers to some of the questions online readersasked us. South West Trains (SWT) said it did not offer compensation ahead of the work because it had putmeasures,externalin place to reduce the likelihood of major delays. During the engineering works all passengers are entitled to compensation as they are any other day of the year. But claims for delays will be judged against the published temporary timetable for August, not the standard timetable that season ticket holders may be used to travelling by. If disruption is particularly severe, SWT can declare a 'void day' when refunds are available for day tickets and season ticket holders will be compensated on renewal. The passenger's charter,externalhas all the details of how to make a compensation claim. Each platform will be extended by around 40 metres so that the number of carriages that can stop there can increase from eight to 10. These longer trains will run from the end of this year on platforms one to four. The whole project will put 30 new trains into service providing 150 extra carriages. They are. Work started at 01:00 on Saturday, 5 August and about 1,000 people are working 24 hours a day to get it finished in the early hours of Tuesday, 29 August. Transport for London said other buses and trains were ""busy but not significantly"" busier than expected during the school holidays. The answer is no, according to Owen Johns at Network rail. ""The country's railway network has been built over the last couple of centuries with different height platforms and it is not feasible to retro-fit the thousands of stations around the country,"" he said. It was not a simple case of just running trains into the platforms - the International Terminal has been completely redeveloped, said Mr Johns. Much of the work has now been completed and trains are able to run this August, but work will continue until December 2018, he said. Eurostar trains are 18 carriages long, but nothing that long runs on domestic services, and only six Eurostar trains were able to run to and from the International Terminal every hour, he said. ""So, we have already shortened the platforms and installed new sections of track which means we can now run 18 trains per hour into the International Terminal, which is much more suited to a high frequency metro-style service that runs between Waterloo and Windsor/Reading,"" he said.

Charity founder paid herself Â£31k,"Wendy Watson founded a helpline for people seeking advice on breast cancer and its treatment A national breast cancer charity is being investigated after its founder paid herself Â£31,000, in breach of charity law. Wendy Watson, who launched the National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline in 1996, has resigned as a trustee. Financial irregularities were uncovered by the Charity Commission, which has issued an official warning for ""significant breaches of trust"". Lawyers for Mrs Watson and the charity described the payments as ""an error"". Mrs Watson, of Derbyshire, founded the charity four years after she became the first woman in the UK to have a pre-emptive mastectomy. Five years ago she wasappointed MBE for services to people with breast cancer. The pre-emptive mastectomy procedure was made famous in 2013 when American actress Angelina Joliehad the surgery. The organisation runs a network of charity shops around the country The charity was set up to raise awareness and fund a phoneline where people can speak to Mrs Watson for support and advice. By 2012, it was raising almost Â£1m a year from charity shops in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Humberside and London. Mrs Watson paid herself the sum over the 2014-15 financial year. Trustees cannot be paid without permission from theCharity Commission,external, which regulates registered charities in England and Wales. After looking at the accounts the Charity Commission found that the charity was in ""financial distress"". The accounts for the National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline for 2013, 2014 and 2015 showed it spent 6%, 3.4% and 2.8% respectively of annual donations on ""charitable activities"", such as running the helpline. The average spend for a charity is currently 83%, the Charity Commission said. The rest of the money was spent running the shops and paying staff. The Charity Commission noticed the financial irregularities and decided to investigate and discovered Mrs Watson had paid herself. Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the Charity Commission said it is ""quite normal"" for a charity's profits to fluctuate from year to year, and this affects the amount of money which will go to the charitable work. ""If you think of small charities that are getting off the ground, sometimes they won't make a profit until year three, year four, year five, so it's quite hard to put a thick-and-fast rule on how much money should go to the end cause every year,"" she said. Gina Miller, founder of theTrue and Fair Foundation,external, wants to set a minimum threshold so charities have to spend at least 65% of income on charitable activities. She described the matter as ""absolutely scandalous"". Mrs Miller, who is also known for challenging the government's Brexit plans, said: ""When most people give over their money they believe the majority of it should go towards the end charitable work. ""This charity's spending should have been picked up by the Charity Commission a long time ago."" Gina Miller wants charities to have to spend at least 65% of income on charitable activities It is the first time the commission has issued an official warning under new powers handed down by the government. It also raised concerns about the organisation's record keeping and ""improperly delegating"" management of the charity. The official warning was issued after points raised in a previous inspection last year were not addressed. The charity's shops are described as ""support centres"", but when a BBC reporter visited five of the outlets, the only support offered appeared to be adverts for the helpline number. Ms Russell said it was a ""serious"" case. ""As a trustee, as it says on the tin, you are trusted with other people's money as a volunteer to look after it,"" she said. ""When we found out there were some unauthorised payments to a trustee, we made it clear that it wasn't allowed to continue. ""But when we went back for the second inspection we found they'd continued to make payments in breach of charity law."" A statement from Mrs Watson's lawyers said she had been paid in ""error"" for ""a period while she was a trustee"". It added: ""Wendy Watson has worked full-time for the charity from August 2012 until now. ""She was paid for her work for one year (September 2014-15) [and] during that period, she was also a trustee. ""Neither Ms Watson nor the charity were aware that this was inappropriate until they were informed by the Charity Commission, at which point Ms Watson immediately resigned as a trustee and continued to work without payment. ""Ms Watson was also paid for three months' work at the end of 2016. ""Other than these periods, she has worked full-time on a voluntary basis.""

Burkina Faso 'terror attack kills 18',"This video can not be played Gunmen attacked customers outside a restaurant in the capital Ouagadougou Gunmen have shot dead 18 people and injured others at a cafe in the centre of of the capital of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, the government says. At least eight foreigners and seven locals were among those killed in Sunday's evening attack on the Aziz Istanbul cafe, the government added. The gunmen, thought to be jihadists, fired on customers on the terrace before making their way inside. Two attackers were killed in a siege which lasted into the morning. President Roch Marc Christian KaborÃ© condemned the ""cowardly terror attack"", saying the people of Burkina Faso would not give in to terrorism. The foreigners killed include two Kuwaitis, and one each from Canada, France, Lebanon, Nigeria, Senegal and Turkey, Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Alpha Barry said. However, Canada's foreign minister said two Canadians had died. Three victims have not yet been identified, Mr Barry said. A jihadist attack on a nearby cafe in January of last year killed 30 people. There are fears that the latest attack is the work of one of the affiliates of al-Qaeda that are active in the Sahel region, the BBC's Alex Duval Smith reports. Burkina Faso profile Burkina Faso's new war against militant Islamists How Burkina Faso's different religions live in peace Africa Live: Latest news and reports This video can not be played Anonymous eyewitness: ""I heard a lot of shooting"" The shooting began shortly after 21:00 (21:00 GMT) at the cafe, popular with expatriates, on Ouagadougou's busy Kwame Nkrumah Avenue. Security forces launched a counter-assault at 22:15 and the shooting ended at about 05:00 on Monday. Police captain Guy Ye told the Associated Press news agency the attackers had arrived on motorcycles and had begun shooting randomly. A wounded restaurant customer sits on the ground after the attack One eyewitness told the BBC: ""I saw there were multiple trucks or jeeps driving through my street, with... local army/police officers with AK47s, deploying in front of my house. ""I heard a lot of shootings and then I was scared as hell and I went inside. I've been hearing quite a bit of shooting."" Analysis: Alex Duval Smith, BBC News, Dakar A terrorist attack in the Sahel had been expected. Residents of Burkina Faso's capital had noticed more police road blocks in the past few days. In neighbouring central Mali, the UN mission, Minusma, had requested that staff and contractors avoid using rural roads. Burkina Faso is part of the Sahel region, which includes Mali where Islamist groups have been active since 2012. For nearly two years now northern Mali's terrorist challenge has grown into a regional problem, with attacks by al-Qaeda affiliates in Burkina Faso, Niger and Ivory Coast. Even though the Ouagadougou attack was not prevented, the fact that Mali and Burkina Faso were on alert suggests Minusma's intelligence-gathering operation is bearing fruit. France is spearheading fundraising for a regional anti-terror force, the G5 Sahel, which will draw from the armies of Mauritania, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The force will not be operational until later this year. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the attack and discussed the situation with his Burkinabe counterpart, Roch Marc Kabore, his office said. The attack is similar to one in January 2016, when gunmen targeted the Splendid Hotel and the Cappuccino restaurant, only 200m further along Kwame Nkrumah Avenue from the scene of the latest attack. More than 170 people were taken hostage and 30 were killed. The al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) group said it had carried out that attack.

Why has the UK suddenly got the taste for Spanish songs?,"J Balvin has scored his first truly global smash with Mi Gente Earlier this summer, Luis Fonsi'sDespacitobecame the most-streamed song of all time - an incredible feat for a record that's predominantly in Spanish. But it increasingly looks like it won't be a one-off. Another Latin American song,Mi Gente,external, has replaced Despacito at the top of Spotify's Global Top 50. Here in the UK, it's just broken into the top 20. ""It's amazing. It's such a blessing,"" says singer J Balvin, the Colombian artist who's behind the song. Already a huge star in South America, Balvin has been credited with revitalising reggaeton - a hip-hop-infused blend of reggae and rap that originated in Puerto Rico in the late 1990s. Over the course of four albums, he's taken the genre once called ""reggae en Espanol"" and infused it with African, electronic and Caribbean flavours. Despacito breaks global streaming record The secrets of a hit summer song Gangnam Style loses YouTube crown More importantly, his lyrics trade reggaeton's gritty, underground roots for a more universal, romantic narrative. ""Mi mÃºsica no discrimina a nadie,"" he sings in Mi Gente, meaning ""my music doesn't discriminate against anybody"". ""Exactly!"" says the star, when we reference the lyric. ""I'm Latino but I don't do music for Latinos. My music is for everybody in the world. ""Music has to be a tool to unite people, to get people together. It doesn't matter the race, the language, the culture. So that's what I'm saying when I sing that line."" The colourful video for Mi Gente makes the most of J Balvin's idiosyncratic style The global perspective is evident on Mi Gente, which has its roots in a French track -Voodoo Song,external, by Willy William. That song, with its chopped-up vocals samples and hopscotch drumbeats, provides a bonkers backbone to Balvin's hit (which William also produced and sings on). ""We took a risk to make new music, new colours, new ways,"" says Balvin. ""It's crazy what we created."" So what lies behind this sudden explosion in music from Latin America? Aside from Luis Fonsi and J Balvin's megahits, there are five other Spanish-language songs in the Spotify top 50. Sir Lucian Grainge, head of Universal Records, says streaming is the key - giving Latin American artists a platform they would never have received on US (and UK) linguistically conservative radio stations. ""Streaming has changed the face of music discovery and music consumption,""he told the BBClast month. ""We're at the forefront of a new creative era [where] anyone who is good can find an audience."" ""The beautiful thing about streaming is that people arelookingfor this stuff,"" stresses Balvin. ""It's like, they really want to play this music. They're looking for it especially. It's the people talking."" This video can not be played Luis Fonsi's Despacito has become the most-streamed song of all time. Spotify itself has been actively promoting Latin American music in regions outside South America - not least because Mexico and Brazil are two of the streaming service's biggest markets. ""We're proactively trying to push its consumption in countries like Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the UK [and] obviously the US,"" said Rocio Guerrero, Spotify's head of Latin culture. ""There has been a domino effect,"" sherecently told Billboard magazine,external. ""The more songs that we put on the global chart, people are getting more used to listening to songs in a different language."" Balvin has his own take on the phenomenon: ""Well, I think right now kids and the whole world is more open minded,"" he tells the BBC on the phone from Uruguay. ""People are just more open to listening to good vibes, even though they don't understand the words. ""That's beautiful. That's amazing. It's like we're showing the world this is not luck... This is really down to good faith and hard work."" Energia, the singer's fourth album, won best urban album at the 2016 Latin Grammy Awards Balvin has certainly put in the hours since launching his music career 11 years ago. Born JosÃ© Ãlvaro Osorio Balvin, he grew up in Medellin, a striking, hilltop metropolis that was once branded ""the most dangerous city on earth"" - thanks largely to the cocaine-trafficking cartel run by Pablo Escobar. The young musician was largely insulated from that seedy side of the city, growing up in a large house with his well-off family - although they fell on hard times when his economist father went bankrupt in his teenage years. He wasn't particularly aware of reggaeton, sound-tracking his childhood with US rock bands like Metallica and Nirvana. ""Since I was eight, I started playing guitar and that's how I fell in love with Nirvana,"" says the star, who has the band's name tattooed on his knee. ""It's such amazing music. It's a big part of my life."" Aged 18, he went to the US as an exchange student, and discovered hip-hop culture - then spent the next few years bouncing between Medellin, Miami and New York, trying to launch a music career while working illegally in the US as a roofer. It wasn't until he settled back in Colombia and joined a production team called Infinity Music that he started to build a reputation locally, tirelessly promoting his music around the country. ""We travelled by bus, ate the cheapest fast food, spent hours and hours outside radio stations,"" Infinity Music's Juan Pablo Piedrahitarecalled to The Fader in 2015,external. ""We don't want to follow nobody,"" says the star. ""We just want to be us."" The grind paid off: Balvin was signed to EMI Colombia in 2009 and subsequently set up a 360 deal with Universal subsidiary Capitol Latin. All four of the singles from his second album La Familia charted in Colombia's top 10, and he was a featured vocalist on the Colombian version of Robin Thicke's hit singleBlurred Lines,external.  His break-up balladAy Vamos,external, meanwhile, racked up one billion views on YouTube - the first ""urban"" Latin track to do so. Now Balvin is edging on to the world stage. His last album, Energia featured collaborations with Pitbull, Camilla Cabello and Pharrell Williams, while the star found himself watching Kanye West record last year's Life Of Pablo album. ""I went to the studio the day Kanye was doing Ultralight Beams and it was just amazing to see how he works,"" the 32-year-old marvels. ""He would brainstorm with his crew, and they all wanted to find the best idea. It really opened up my mind -  I want to apply that to my own work."" The singer is already one of the biggest stars in Latin America One lesson he won't be taking from the famously mercurial Kanye, however, is how to handle his social media accounts. Balvin is an engaging, witty presence online, posting all of his own messages himself. He's even recorded a song calledSnapchat,externaland another,Ginza,external, which is named after an Instagram filter. ""I can't lie: the phone is like my right hand,"" he jokes. ""But right now the best way to keep connected with people, with your fanbase is through your cell phone. ""I'm on it all the time - but I'll turn it off when I'm going to sleep. I just want to get those frequencies out of my brain, so I turn it off and I take it outside."" When he's not posting photographs from the stage of his current tour, Balvin is ""working like crazy"" on his next album which, he says, will represent both sides of his musical personality - ""the global side and the Latino side"". And, despite having the world's most listened-to song, his ambition is undiminished. ""I want to go bigger,"" he says. ""Everything started with a dream. I dreamt about having one of the biggest Latin albums, I dreamt I'd be a global artist. ""And dreams do come true.""

'17 dead' in Burkina Faso attack,"This video can not be played Gunmen attacked customers outside a restaurant in the capital Ouagadougou Gunmen have shot dead 18 people and injured others at a cafe in the centre of of the capital of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, the government says. At least eight foreigners and seven locals were among those killed in Sunday's evening attack on the Aziz Istanbul cafe, the government added. The gunmen, thought to be jihadists, fired on customers on the terrace before making their way inside. Two attackers were killed in a siege which lasted into the morning. President Roch Marc Christian KaborÃ© condemned the ""cowardly terror attack"", saying the people of Burkina Faso would not give in to terrorism. The foreigners killed include two Kuwaitis, and one each from Canada, France, Lebanon, Nigeria, Senegal and Turkey, Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Alpha Barry said. However, Canada's foreign minister said two Canadians had died. Three victims have not yet been identified, Mr Barry said. A jihadist attack on a nearby cafe in January of last year killed 30 people.

Analysis: Alex Duval Smith, BBC News, Dakar A terrorist attack in the Sahel had been expected. Residents of Burkina Faso's capital had noticed more police road blocks in the past few days. In neighbouring central Mali, the UN mission, Minusma, had requested that staff and contractors avoid using rural roads. Burkina Faso is part of the Sahel region, which includes Mali where Islamist groups have been active since 2012. For nearly two years now northern Mali's terrorist challenge has grown into a regional problem, with attacks by al-Qaeda affiliates in Burkina Faso, Niger and Ivory Coast. Even though the Ouagadougou attack was not prevented, the fact that Mali and Burkina Faso were on alert suggests Minusma's intelligence-gathering operation is bearing fruit. France is spearheading fundraising for a regional anti-terror force, the G5 Sahel, which will draw from the armies of Mauritania, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The force will not be operational until later this year. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the attack and discussed the situation with his Burkinabe counterpart, Roch Marc Kabore, his office said. The attack is similar to one in January 2016, when gunmen targeted the Splendid Hotel and the Cappuccino restaurant, only 200m further along Kwame Nkrumah Avenue from the scene of the latest attack. More than 170 people were taken hostage and 30 were killed. The al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) group said it had carried out that attack.

Australia deputy PM 'may be NZ citizen',"Barnaby Joyce will refer the matter to Australia's High Court New Zealand's government has confirmed that Australia's deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, is a dual citizen. Dual citizens are not allowed to run for public office under Australia's constitution. Mr Joyce revealed earlier that he may have New Zealand citizenship by descent, but said he will take his case to the nation's High Court. PM Malcolm Turnbull's government risks losing its grip on power if Mr Joyce is ruled ineligible. The office of New Zealand Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne confirmed to Australian media that under New Zealand law, a child born to a New Zealand national is automatically given citizenship. However, Mr Joyce told parliament he received legal advice that he is not in breach of rules. He will remain as deputy PM in the meantime. How a dual citizen crisis befell Australia Mr Joyce is the latest of several Australian politicians to be caught up in dual citizenship scandals. Two senators,Scott LudlamandLarissa Waters, were forced to resign last month over their citizenship status. Another two senators,Matt CanavanandMalcolm Roberts, will also have their eligibility decided by the High Court. This video can not be played Larissa Waters left the Senate over her Canadian citizenship He is the leader of the National Party, the junior partner in Mr Turnbull's conservative coalition. Mr Joyce entered the Senate in 2005, where he served for eight years, before moving to the lower House of Representatives in 2013. Known for his straight-talking comments, Mr Joyce gained international attention by clamping down onJohnny Depp's dogsandrebuking criticsof Australia Day. Speaking in parliament, Mr Joyce said he was contacted by the New Zealand High Commission last week and informed he could be a citizen by descent. ""Needless to say, I was shocked about this,"" he said on Monday. ""Neither I, nor my parents have ever had any reason to believe I may be a citizen of another country."" Mr Joyce's father was born in New Zealand and moved to Australia in 1947. The politician was born in the New South Wales town of Tamworth in 1967. He said: ""Neither my parents nor I have ever applied to register me as a New Zealand citizen. The New Zealand government has no register recognising me as a New Zealand citizen."" Mr Joyce said he had been advised by Australia's solicitor-general that he was not in breach of the constitution. The Section 44 (Disqualification) states that any person who ""is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power... shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives"". Mr Joyce says he is confident about his eligibility This is interpreted as meaning that people with dual citizenship are not permitted to run for office. However, experts have said there is uncertainty surrounding the rules, particularly on the issue of citizenship by descent. Currently, Mr Turnbull's government has only a slim one-seat majority in the House of Representatives. If Mr Joyce were to be ruled ineligible, it would force a by-election, and the government's hold on power would be at risk. However, Mr Turnbull could retain government with the support of independent MPs and minor parties. Treasurer Scott Morrison, a senior government minister, said it was important not to ""leap to conclusions"". Mr Turnbull responding by writing an open letter to Opposition Leader Bill Shorten asking for help in resolving the dual citizenship saga. He said it was time for the High Court to clarify the precise meaning of Section 44. ""With around half of all Australians having a foreign-born parent and with many foreign nations having citizenship laws which confer citizenship by descent, regardless of place of birth, the potential for many, possibly millions of Australians unknowingly having dual citizenship is considerable,"" he wrote in the letter. ""The Australian people must have confidence in our political system and resolving any uncertainty is vital.""

Cassini to skim Saturn's atmosphere,"Cassini will ""dip its toes"" into the atmosphere during the final passes The Cassini probe has begun the final phase of its mission to Saturn. The satellite has executed the first of five ultra-close passes of the giant world, dipping down far enough to brush through the top of the atmosphere. It promises unprecedented data on the chemical composition of Saturn. It also sets the stage for the probe's dramatic end-manoeuvre next month when it will plunge to destruction in the planet's atmosphere. Cassini is currently flying a series of loops around Saturn that thread the gap between its atmosphere and its rings. Monday's swing-by saw the spacecraft go closer than ever before to the cloud tops - skimming just 1,600km (1,000 miles) above them, at 04:22 GMT (05:22 BST) on Monday. This low pass was designed to allow the probe to directly sample the gases of the extended upper-atmosphere. Saturn's bulk composition is thought to be about 75% hydrogen with the rest being helium (bar some trace components), explains Nicolas Altobelli, the European Space Agency's Cassini project scientist. ""It's expected that the heavier helium is sinking down,"" he told BBC News. ""Saturn radiates more energy than it's absorbing from the Sun, meaning there's gravitational energy which is being lost. And so getting a precise measure of the hydrogen and helium in the upper layers sets a constraint on the overall distribution of the material in the interior."" Cassini will send all the data back to Earth during its next contact on Tuesday. Dipping down into the atmosphere should create a drag on the spacecraft, requiring Cassini to use its thrusters to maintain a stable flight configuration and stop itself from tumbling. But the mission's scientists think any buffeting effects ought to be manageable. They are hopeful that when the post-pass analysis is done, the probe will be permitted to go even lower on the remaining four dip-downs before 15 September's goodbye plunge. Artwork: Cassini is running the narrow gap between the top of the planet's atmosphere and the rings The Cassini mission still has some big outstanding questions about Saturn. One of these relates to the length of a day on the planet. Researchers know it is roughly 10-and-a-half hours, but they would like a more precise number. The solution should come by looking for an offset between the magnetic field and the planet's rotation axis, but frustratingly all the probe's observations to date show these two features to be almost perfectly aligned. ""All magnetic field theory as we know it requires an offset,"" said Linda Spilker, the US space agency's Cassini project scientist. ""To generate a field, you need to keep the currents in the metallic hydrogen layer inside Saturn flowing, and without the offset the thinking is that the field would simply go away. ""What's going on? Is something shielding our ability to see the offset, or do we simply need a new theory? But without the tilt, without being able to see the tiny wobble, we cannot be more precise about the length of a day."" Dr Spilker said the mission team would continue to work on the problem. Cassini is a joint venture between the US, European and Italian space agencies. They are ending the probe's operations after 20 years because it is running low on fuel and will soon become uncontrollable. Scientists want to avoid the possibility of a future collision with Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus, which could conceivably support simple microbial life. And the only way to prevent that is to deliberately drive the probe to destruction in the atmosphere of the giant planet.
