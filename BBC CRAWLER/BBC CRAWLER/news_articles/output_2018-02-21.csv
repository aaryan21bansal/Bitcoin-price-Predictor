Stormzy steals the show at Brit Awards,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons South London grime superstarStormzy,externalbeatEd Sheeran,externalto the main prizes in a surprise result at theBrit Awards,external. Stormzy, who seemed overwhelmed when he won best British male and best British album for Gang Signs and Prayer, also closed the show andcriticised the PM's handling of the Grenfell tragedy. Sheeran didn't go home empty-handed - he was given the global success award. Dua Lipa,externalwon best British female and the breakthrough award, whileGorillaz,externalwere named best British group. Stormzy seemed to struggle to believe he'd won best British male But the night belonged to Stormzy, who held his head in his hands as he walked to the stage to accept best male, and fell to the ground when he was named winner of British album. Brit Awards 2018: Relive the ceremony Brits 2018: The real winners and losers Brit Awards 2018: The best pictures He told the crowd Gang Signs And Prayer was ""the hardest thing"" he had done and gave ""all the glory to God"". He said: ""I've never worked on something like this in my life. We made something I feel that is undeniable, that I can stand by today."" This video can not be played Brit Awards 2018: Stormzy explains why he spoke up about Grenfell The star also used a freestyle between songs at the end of the show to deliver a blistering criticism of the prime minister's handling of the Grenfell Tower fire. ""Yo, Theresa May, where's that money for Grenfell?"" he rapped. ""What, you thought we just forgot about Grenfell?"" A Downing Street spokesman said the government had committed more than Â£58 million to deal with the aftermath of the tower block blaze. Stormzy takes swipe at the PM over Grenfell Paloma Faith: More men should have worn white roses Jack Whitehall's best one-liners at the Brits Ed Sheeran had the biggest commercial success of 2017, but won't have begrudged Stormzy his wins - before the ceremony, he said he wanted the Croydon rapper to win best album. ""I think he made the album of the year, personally,"" Sheeran told BBC 5 live. The pair performed together at last year's show on a remix of Shape Of You. Gang Signs And Prayer was the first grime release to win the Brit for best album, 15 years after the genre - a British take on hip-hop - emerged from east London. British album: Stormzy - Gang Signs and Prayer British female: Dua Lipa British male: Stormzy British group: Gorillaz British single: Rag 'N' Bone Man - Human See the full list of winners and nominees Dua Lipa brought her younger sister and brother on stage so they could experience ""magic"" Dua Lipa, the 22-year-old British-Kosovan pop singer, was the only other artist to walk away with two awards at the ceremony, in London's O2 Arena. In one of the night's most touching moments, she took her younger brother and sister on stage as she accepted her award for best breakthrough and told them, with millions watching: ""I love you."" KFC shortages to continue all week Little Mix singer criticised for wearing dreads Stars (almost) unite in black at Baftas Dua Lipa told 5 live afterwards that it was ""a spur of the moment thing"", adding: ""Everything I do is to show my little brother and sister that they can do whatever they put their minds to, and I guess I want to be a good role model for them."" Earlier, she used her acceptance speech for best British female to send a message of female strength. ""I want to thank every single female who's been on this stage before me that has given girls like me - not just girls in the music industry but girls in society - a place to be inspired be, to look up to, and that have allowed us to dream this big,"" she said. This video can not be played Paloma Faith was among those asked about the symbol of solidarity with victims of harassment and abuse ""Here's to more women on these stages, more women winning awards and more women taking over the world."" Dua Lipa was raised in the UK but at the age of 13 she moved with her parents to their former home of Kosovo. Two years later, she returned to London alone to pursue music, while scraping a living in bars and pubs. Her efforts were rewarded with five Brit nominations. This video can not be played Dua Lipa says ""more female artists are on the rise"" She was one of many artists who wore white roses or rose badges on the red carpet as a mark of support for the Time's Up and Me Too movements. Ellie Goulding, who presented best international female, had a dig at the Grammy Awards and their boss Neil Portnow,who saidwomen needed to ""step up"" in the music industry. The British star said: ""We're very proud to be women and I think we can all agree we've been stepping up for years."" Meanwhile, in a poignant tribute to the victims of last May's Manchester Arena attack, Liam Gallagher performed a rendition of Oasis hit Live Forever, accompanied by cello and acoustic guitar. Liam Gallagher performed Live Forever as a tribute to the Manchester Arena victims He was introduced by fellow Mancunian Gary Barlow, who paid tribute to the 22 ""innocent, music-loving people"" who lost their lives. Ariana Grande had been due to perform that section of the show, butwas unable to travel to London ""on doctor's orders"". Gorillaz were named best British group and their leader Damon Albarn used his acceptance speech to send a message about Brexit. ""This country is - believe it or not - quite a small, little thing, right, but it's a lovely place and it's part of a beautiful world,"" he said. ""But what I want to say is, don't let it become isolated, don't let yourselves become cut off. ""Considering our size we do incredible things in music, we've got a real spirit and a real soul and don't let politics get in the way."" On the red carpet, Ed Sheeran said he wanted Stormzy to win best album. Lo and behold, the grime star crept up and stole the award off him. Not that Stormzy didn't deserve it. Gang Signs & Prayer is a huge, uncompromising album - one that redefined what grime could be as it veered from spittle-flecked free-styling on Big For Your Boots to the gospel-inspired devotional Blinded By Your Grace. The victory notably comes two years after he blasted the Brits as ""embarrassing"" and ""so white"", which led to a shake-up in the ceremony's voting committee. But it was his artistry, not politics, that swayed voters. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Met Police loses 'landmark' Worboys appeal,"This video can not be played Women need to be confident police will investigate - John Worboys' victim Victims of serious crime may be able to sue the police for failures in their investigations following a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court. The Metropolitan Police lost an appeal against two rape victims, who won compensation over its handling of the case of black cab rapist John Worboys. The women had argued their treatment by police breached their human rights. The Met said it accepted the ruling and that there was ""no doubt"" it would have implications for future investigations. Human rights organisation Liberty said it was a ""landmark"" decision. How the judgement helps victims of serious crime The women said their treatment by police had caused them mental harm, They brought their claims under article three of the Human Rights Act - the right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment. Worboys was convicted of 19 offences in 2009, when he was ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. But the Met believe he may have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. A woman known as DSD - the first of Worboys' victims to make a complaint to the police in 2003 - said: ""It has been an emotional day. Fifteen years."" In a question directed at the police, she added: ""Had you done your job properly, there wouldn't be 105 victims, there would be one. ""I can take the one. I can't take the 105."" Cabbie who preyed on young women Ministers won't challenge Worboys release Legal boost for Port victims' families Her lawyer Harriet Wistrich said: ""It's a very, very important judgment - very important for vindicating the rights of my two clients but also for the other victims of Worboys."" The women are also separately pursuing a judicial review of the Parole Board's decision to release the convicted rapist. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The ruling is highly significant, both for victims of serious violent crime and for the police forces that investigate it. It means that if a police force conducts an investigation into the crime which fails in a way which is deemed sufficiently serious, it will be liable to a human rights action brought by the victim. Successful claims will result in compensation to the victims. The ruling means that there is an additional rigour placed on police forces to ensure they properly investigate violent crime. The 2010 report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission disclosed many serious failings in the police investigation in Worboys. So the ruling is likely to lead to more claims by his victims. However there will be many other victims of violent crime who feel that they were let down by serious police failings, who will now want to consider bringing claims for breach of their human rights. Until now, police could not be found to be negligent for generally failing to identify and apprehend an unknown suspect. The police had appealed against the original judgement in favour of the women, arguing their duty was fulfilled simply by having in place practices and procedures to investigate. This video can not be played Police chief Craig Mackey responds to the Supreme Court's Worboys judgment But Supreme Court Justice Lord Kerr said: ""By a majority, we have held that failures in the investigation of the crimes, provided they are sufficiently serious, will give rise to liability on the part of the police. He continued: ""The important point to make is that, if the investigation is seriously defective, even if no systemic failures are present, this will be enough to render the police liable."" The Met Police said it ""unreservedly apologises"" to the victims it failed. Sir Craig Mackey, deputy commissioner of the Met Police, said in a statement that it had appealed because ""police forces needed absolute clarity on the boundaries of police responsibility and liability for their investigations"". He added: ""There is no doubt that it will have implications for how we resource and prioritise our investigations."" His views were echoed by Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, who said there was concern that the ruling would lead to ""a flood of claims, particularly from no-win, no-fee lawyers"". Speaking on Radio 4's the World at One, he said it would be important to see how the reference to ""serious crime"" is defined and which cases the ruling is applied to. He said resources may be shifted from community policing to serious crimes as forces felt they had to investigate more thoroughly and document all decisions about taking investigations forward. Repeated rulings have made clear the police are not under a general duty of care in relation to their investigation of crime Judges in key cases have ruled the police can't be liable for a crime committed by someone else There are legal duties to warn someone their life may be in danger if police have intelligence of a threat The Worboys case expands the law by saying that the police have a duty to act if a victim is going to become the victim of inhuman and degrading treatment The appeal followed a 2013 High Court ruling which found the Met was liable to the women - known as DSD and NBV - for failures in its investigation. DSD said she suffered a depressive disorder as a result of her treatment by officers during the 2003 investigation and was awarded Â£22,250. NBV claimed she suffered serious distress, anxiety, guilt and an exacerbation of post-traumatic disorder and depression because of her treatment by police. She was awarded Â£19,000. Martha Spurrier, director of Liberty, said:  ""Having already let these women down in the most horrific way, the Met could have accepted the High Court's ruling four years ago. ""Instead, they used taxpayers' money to drag them all the way to the highest court in the land."" The case comes a month afterthe government announced it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision to release Worboysafter he had served less than 10 years in prison.

Trump backs guns for teachers,"This video can not be played President Trump met pupils and parents affected by several US school shootings. US President Donald Trump has said arming teachers could prevent school shootings like that which left 17 people dead last week in Florida. Teachers carrying a concealed gun could end attacks ""very quickly"", he said. Mr Trump floated the proposal - long-championed by the powerful NRA gun lobby - as emotional survivors of the 14 February massacre urged him to take measures to stop similar attacks. The US leader called for improved background checks on gun buyers. ""It's not going to be talk like it's been in the past,"" he said. President Trump listened to pleas for gun reform on Wednesday from about 40 students, teachers and families in the executive mansion's state dining room. Hundreds of teenagers from the Washington DC suburbs rallied outside at the time - some voicing support for arming teachers. This video can not be played School shooting survivor's tearful plea Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow died in last week's attack - the second-deadliest shooting at a US public school - said: ""We, as a country, failed our children."" ""It should've been one school shooting and we should've fixed it. And I'm pissed. It's my daughter I'm not going to see again,"" he went on to say. This video can not be played Victim's father tells Trump of rage Mark Barden - whose son Daniel was killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut - said more guns was not the answer. ""Schoolteachers have more than enough responsibilities right now, than to have to have the awesome responsibility of lethal force to take a life,"" he said. 'Arm me with books' - the teachers saying no to guns Florida survivor: 'I'm not an actor' After Florida, some owners give up guns At his White House event, Mr Trump promised to look ""very strongly"" at calls for educators to be armed with guns - a position long held by the National Rifle Association (NRA). President Trump holds his notes at the listening session. Point five says: ""I hear you"" ""If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms,"" he said, ""they could very well end the attack very quickly."" ""Where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,"" he said, while acknowledging the plan was controversial, ""they would go for special training and they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone. America's gun culture in 10 charts On Thursday morning, Mr Trump criticised reporting of his remarks, stressing that he spoke of the need to train teachers properly. Allow Twitter content?

Stoneman Douglas High School had an armed guard on duty during last week's attack - but he never discharged his gun. The local sheriff told reporters the deputy never encountered the shooter. But putting an armed teacher in every classroom is a divisive topic - a 2013 poll by the National Education Association found only 22% of teachers said they approved of the idea of arming staff, while 68% of teachers said they were opposed. And 72% of teachers said they would not want to carry a gun even if the law allowed. Six radical ways to stop US school shootings Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? In Colorado, free training is provided for teachers who wish to arm themselves- part of which involves imagining one of their own students entering the classroom with a gun. This video can not be played Florida shooting survivor Lorenzo Prado mistaken for the gunman A ban on some types of weapons, advocated for by many students, is unpalatable for supporters of the second amendment - which governs the right to bear arms. Lawmakers in Florida's state legislature rejected a proposal on Tuesday to even debate banning such weapons. They said, however, that will consider raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles - like the one police say was used in the massacre - from 18 to 21. Mr Trump's listening session came a day after he directed his administrationto take steps to ban gun ""bump stocks"". The accessories - which enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute - were used by a gunman who killed 58 concert-goers in Las Vegas last October. The NRA - which contributed anestimated $30m (Â£21m) to help elect Mr Trump,external- opposes a total ban on bump stocks but supports some regulation of the devices and some changes to background check legislation. In Florida, survivors of the shooting poured into the state capital to demand lawmakers restrict sales of assault rifles. This video can not be played Florida students have lobbied for tighter gun control measures It was the first organised protest of the youth-led anti-gun movement that has swept the US since the attack in Parkland, Florida. Other students in Chicago, Illinois; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Phoenix, Arizona walked out of classes in solidarity. This video can not be played US students walk out to demand firearms control The issue formed a main part of a ""town hall"" debate staged by CNN on Wednesday night, where Florida Senator Marco Rubio felt the articulate anger of a bereaved parent. Mr Rubio was repeatedly booed and later said banning semi-automatic weapons was ""a position well outside the mainstream"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ways to stop school shootings,"Students from Stoneman Douglas High School attend a memorial following the shooting After 17 people were killed in Florida, could these measures stop US school shootings? In January 2014, Dr Sherry Towers went to a meeting at Purdue University, Indiana. On the same day, elsewhere on campus, Cody Cousins shot dead Andrew Boldt, a fellow student. After the killing, the meeting was cancelled. But Dr Towers - a statistician from Arizona State University - started thinking about shootings, and the relationship between them. ""It was the third school shooting I heard about in a 10-day period,"" she says. ""And that seemed - even for the US - an unusually large number."" Dr Towers and her team got to work, and found that school shootings and mass killings had anaverage ""contagious period"",externalof 13 days. That is - when one school shooting or mass killing happens, another becomes more likely. Dr Towers does not want the media to ignore mass killings. ""People have a right to know,"" she says. And, as a scientist, she cannot prove that withholding the killer's name will reduce contagion. ""It would be impossible [to prove] - there has never been a case where the killer wasn't named."" But she thinks that focusing on victims - rather than ""lurid"" details of the killer - could make shootings less likely. ""When I talk publicly, or to the media, I don't name the perpetrator unless there is a specific reason why,"" she says. This video can not be played Should we name school killers? Dr Towers' research has been used byAlerrt, a team at Texas State University,externalthat studies ""active shooter response"". They have a campaign calledDon't Name Them,external. ""A lot of shooters - not all of them - are driven by this desire for notoriety,"" says Dr Pete Blair from Alerrt. ""If we know that's one of the motivations, why are you giving them the reward?"" Dr Blair doesn't want a ban on naming shooters. But he thinks the media should focus on ""heroes, the community, and - where appropriate - the victims"". Some US journalists - such as CNN's Anderson Cooper - and websites nowchoose not to name mass killers,external. The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in December 2012, was reported to police at 9.35am. Officers arrived less than four minutes later; within a minute, they heard the gunman shoot himself. He had already killed 20 children and six adults inside the school. ""If schools' only solution is to rely on outside help, it will never get any better than we saw at Sandy Hook,"" says Joe Eaton. Eaton is from the Buckeye Firearms Association, a gun-owners' group in Ohio. After Sandy Hook, they set up Faster - a programme thattrains teachers to respond to mass shootings,external. The programme includes first aid, moving through crowds, and firearms training - that is, how to kill a school gunman. So far, Faster has trained 1,300 school staff, mostly on three-day courses. ""Teachers, administrators, superintendents, bus drivers, even the lunch lady,"" says Eaton. Teachers take part in the Faster active shooter training in Colorado in 2017 In the US, 10 statesban guns in schools, outright,external. Another eight allow them only in locked cars. But in the other 32 states, it is possible for teachers to carry guns, if the school allows it. Faster has trained staff from 225 districts in 12 states. Another 200 to 400 will be trained this year. ""Inside of every school, there are certain teachers who will willingly run towards the sound of gunfire,"" says Eaton. ""The schools identify these people, and tell them: 'Whatever tool and training you're comfortable with, we're going to give it to you'."" Eaton accepts that it's sad for teachers to need guns. ""When they started their teaching career, they never would have imagined carrying firearms to protect kids - or having their schools ask them to,"" he says. ""But I bet if you ask every airline pilot, they would have answered the same way until 9/11 happened [some pilots in the US carry guns,external]. ""Sandy Hook was the teachers' 9/11."" Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. When the gunman attacked Stoneman Douglas High School last week, David Hoggtook shelter in a cooking classroom. While hiding in the dark, the 17-year-old noticed the L-shaped room had two doors. ""If he [the gunman] came in one,"" he thought, ""we could go out the other."" His thinking - and his logic - is supported by experts. ""Attacks with high casualty counts [tend to have] people trapped in a small area, unable to protect themselves,"" says Dr Pete Blair from Alerrt. ""Simple things, like designing classrooms with another exit, could help. It might not necessarily stop the attack from happening - although it could - but it might mitigate the damage done."" He also suggests having locks on every door. ""I'm not big on trying to legislate things, but it's certainly something that would make sense,"" he says. This video can not be played A guide to the weapons available in the US and the rate at which they fire In May 2014, Elliot Rodger - a London-born 22-year-old - killed six people in Isla Vista, California. The local sheriff called him ""severely mentally disturbed"". Four months later, Californian lawmakers approved Gun Violence Restraining Orders. They allow family members, housemates, or police, to ask a judge to remove guns from people ""in crisis"". In California, there arethree types of order,external- two of them last 21 days, while another lasts a year. In the first year, 86 orders were issued. Federal law already stops people with mental health historiesbuyingguns - but the bar is lower. To buy a gun from a licensed dealer in the US, the purchaser must pass abackground check,external. If they have been judged ""mentally defective"", or committed to a mental institution, they fail. Between November 1998 and January 2018, there were33,569 denials for mental reasons,external- 2% of the total number of denials. TheCoalition to Stop Gun Violence,externalwants California's scheme to be introduced nationwide. So far, similar schemes have been approved in two more states - Oregon and Washington. A school shooting comes to 'paradise' Trump pushes for ban on modified guns Two days after the shooting in Florida, a lawyer in Corbin, Kentucky, posteda video on Facebook,external. Shane Romines offered $20,000 (Â£14,000) to buy five metal detectors - one for each school in the area. He also offered another $5,000 for tasers, firearms, and training, and called on other community leaders to contribute. Within three days, $75,000 had been pledged. Some US schools, mostly in big cities, already have metal detectors. In 2014, around8.7% of high schools,externalused ""random metal detector checks"". Butschool security expert Ken Trump,externaldoubts whether metal detectors will stop school shootings. ""It may meet an emotional need,"" he says. ""It's not going to meet a practical need."" He points out that schools are often open all day, every day. ""So you'd have to run a metal detector operation 24/7,"" says Trump. ""Or someone could come for a basketball game in the evening, stash the weapons in a locker, then come back the next morning."" Trump has worked in school security for 30 years. ""I'm a parent, I get it,"" he says. ""But there is no magic wand. This is complex."" Gun-owners' rights are protected by the US Constitution. The Second Amendment, adopted in 1791, gives Americans the right to ""keep and bear arms"". The Constitution, though, can be altered. Amendments can be proposed by Congress - when two-thirds of both houses are in favour - or by two-thirds of the states. The amendment must then be approved by three-quarters of states. For example, the Eighteenth Amendment prohibited alcohol. The Twenty-First Amendment repealed it. This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Since the Florida shootings, some commentators have called for the Second Amendment to be repealed. ""Most gun-control legislation is ineffective when most Americans have a guaranteed constitutional right to purchase deadly weaponry in nearly unlimited quantities,"" wrote Bret Stephens inthe New York Times,external. But it isn't just the national constitution that gives Americans gun rights. Forty-fourstate constitutions,externalalso give people the right to bear arms. And - even if the Second Amendment were repealed - it wouldn't mean that guns were banned. It would simply remove the constitutional right to ""keep and bear arms"".

Met Police loses 'landmark' Worboys appealVictims of serious crime may be able to hold police liable for failures in their investigations after a Supreme Court ruling.9h9 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played Women need to be confident police will investigate - John Worboys' victim Victims of serious crime may be able to sue the police for failures in their investigations following a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court. The Metropolitan Police lost an appeal against two rape victims, who won compensation over its handling of the case of black cab rapist John Worboys. The women had argued their treatment by police breached their human rights. The Met said it accepted the ruling and that there was ""no doubt"" it would have implications for future investigations. Human rights organisation Liberty said it was a ""landmark"" decision. How the judgement helps victims of serious crime The women said their treatment by police had caused them mental harm, They brought their claims under article three of the Human Rights Act - the right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment. Worboys was convicted of 19 offences in 2009, when he was ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. But the Met believe he may have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. A woman known as DSD - the first of Worboys' victims to make a complaint to the police in 2003 - said: ""It has been an emotional day. Fifteen years."" In a question directed at the police, she added: ""Had you done your job properly, there wouldn't be 105 victims, there would be one. ""I can take the one. I can't take the 105."" Cabbie who preyed on young women Ministers won't challenge Worboys release Legal boost for Port victims' families Her lawyer Harriet Wistrich said: ""It's a very, very important judgment - very important for vindicating the rights of my two clients but also for the other victims of Worboys."" The women are also separately pursuing a judicial review of the Parole Board's decision to release the convicted rapist. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The ruling is highly significant, both for victims of serious violent crime and for the police forces that investigate it. It means that if a police force conducts an investigation into the crime which fails in a way which is deemed sufficiently serious, it will be liable to a human rights action brought by the victim. Successful claims will result in compensation to the victims. The ruling means that there is an additional rigour placed on police forces to ensure they properly investigate violent crime. The 2010 report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission disclosed many serious failings in the police investigation in Worboys. So the ruling is likely to lead to more claims by his victims. However there will be many other victims of violent crime who feel that they were let down by serious police failings, who will now want to consider bringing claims for breach of their human rights. Until now, police could not be found to be negligent for generally failing to identify and apprehend an unknown suspect. The police had appealed against the original judgement in favour of the women, arguing their duty was fulfilled simply by having in place practices and procedures to investigate. This video can not be played Police chief Craig Mackey responds to the Supreme Court's Worboys judgment But Supreme Court Justice Lord Kerr said: ""By a majority, we have held that failures in the investigation of the crimes, provided they are sufficiently serious, will give rise to liability on the part of the police. He continued: ""The important point to make is that, if the investigation is seriously defective, even if no systemic failures are present, this will be enough to render the police liable."" The Met Police said it ""unreservedly apologises"" to the victims it failed. Sir Craig Mackey, deputy commissioner of the Met Police, said in a statement that it had appealed because ""police forces needed absolute clarity on the boundaries of police responsibility and liability for their investigations"". He added: ""There is no doubt that it will have implications for how we resource and prioritise our investigations."" His views were echoed by Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, who said there was concern that the ruling would lead to ""a flood of claims, particularly from no-win, no-fee lawyers"". Speaking on Radio 4's the World at One, he said it would be important to see how the reference to ""serious crime"" is defined and which cases the ruling is applied to. He said resources may be shifted from community policing to serious crimes as forces felt they had to investigate more thoroughly and document all decisions about taking investigations forward. Repeated rulings have made clear the police are not under a general duty of care in relation to their investigation of crime Judges in key cases have ruled the police can't be liable for a crime committed by someone else There are legal duties to warn someone their life may be in danger if police have intelligence of a threat The Worboys case expands the law by saying that the police have a duty to act if a victim is going to become the victim of inhuman and degrading treatment The appeal followed a 2013 High Court ruling which found the Met was liable to the women - known as DSD and NBV - for failures in its investigation. DSD said she suffered a depressive disorder as a result of her treatment by officers during the 2003 investigation and was awarded Â£22,250. NBV claimed she suffered serious distress, anxiety, guilt and an exacerbation of post-traumatic disorder and depression because of her treatment by police. She was awarded Â£19,000. Martha Spurrier, director of Liberty, said:  ""Having already let these women down in the most horrific way, the Met could have accepted the High Court's ruling four years ago. ""Instead, they used taxpayers' money to drag them all the way to the highest court in the land."" The case comes a month afterthe government announced it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision to release Worboysafter he had served less than 10 years in prison.

"Ancient Britons 'replaced' by newcomersBritain's Stone Age population was almost completely replaced some 4,500 years ago, a study shows.5h5 hours agoScience & Environment","Beaker pottery starts to appear in Britain around 4,500 years ago The ancient population of Britain was almost completely replaced by newcomers about 4,500 years ago, a study shows. The findings mean modern Britons trace just a small fraction of their ancestry to the people who built Stonehenge. The astonishing result comes from analysis of DNA extracted from 400 ancient remains across Europe. The mammoth study, published in Nature,,externalsuggests the newcomers, known as Beaker people, replaced 90% of the British gene pool in a few hundred years. Lead author Prof David Reich, from Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, US, said: ""The magnitude and suddenness of the population replacement is highly unexpected."" The reasons remain unclear, but climate change, disease and ecological disaster could all have played a role. People in Britain lived by hunting and gathering until agriculture was introduced from continental Europe about 6,000 years ago. These Neolithic farmers, who traced their origins to Anatolia (modern Turkey) built giant stone (or ""megalithic"") structures such as Stonehenge in Wiltshire, huge Earth mounds and sophisticated settlements such as Skara Brae in the Orkneys. But towards the end of the Neolithic, about 4,450 years ago, a new way of life spread to Britain from Europe. People began burying their dead with stylised bell-shaped pots, copper daggers, arrowheads, stone wrist guards and distinctive perforated buttons. Co-author Dr Carles Lalueza-Fox, from the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE) in Barcelona, Spain, said the Beaker traditions probably started ""as a kind of fashion"" in Iberia after 5,000 years ago. From here, the culture spread very fast by word of mouth to Central Europe. After it was adopted by people in Central Europe, it exploded in every direction - but through the movement of people. Prof Reich told BBC News: ""Archaeologists ever since the Second World War have been very sceptical about proposals of large-scale movements of people in prehistory. But what the genetics are showing - with the clearest example now in Britain at Beaker times - is that these large-scale migrations occurred, even after the spread of agriculture."" The genetic data, from more than 150 ancient British genomes, reveals that the Beakers were a distinct population from the Neolithic British. After their arrival on the island, Beaker genes appear to swamp those of the native farmers. Prof Reich added: ""The previous inhabitants had just put up the big stones at Stonehenge, which became a national place of pilgrimage as reflected by goods brought from the far corners of Britain."" He added: ""The sophisticated ancient peoples who built that monument and ones like it could not have known that within a short period of time their descendants would be gone and their lands overrun."" The newcomers brought ancestry from nomadic groups originating on the Pontic Steppe, a grassland region extending from Ukraine to Kazakhstan. These nomads moved west during the Neolithic, mixing heavily with established populations in Europe. The Beaker migration marks the first time this eastern genetic signature appears in Britain. Archaeologist and study co-author Mike Parker Pearson, from University College London (UCL), said Neolithic Britons and Beaker groups organised their societies in very different ways. The construction of massive stone monuments, co-opting hundreds of people, was an alien concept to Beakers, but the Neolithic British community ""has that absolutely as its core rationale"". ""[The Beaker people] are not prepared to collaborate on enormous labour-mobilising projects; their society is more de-centralised,"" said Prof Parker Pearson. ""We don't have a good expression for it, but the Americans do, and that is: nobody is willing to work for 'The Man'."" The Beaker folk seemed to favour more modest round ""barrows"", or earth burial mounds, to cover the distinguished dead. The group is also intimately associated with the arrival of metalworking to Britain. Prof Parker Pearson commented: ""They're the people who bring Britain out of the Stone Age. Up until then, the people of Britain had cut themselves off from the continent - 'Neolithic Brexit'. This is the moment when Britain re-joins the continent after 1,000 years of isolation - most of the rest of Europe was well out of the Stone Age by this point."" What triggered the massive genetic shift remains unclear. Buta paper published in PNAS journal last year,externalsuggested a downturn in the climate around 5,500 years ago (3,500 BC) pushed Neolithic populations into a thousand-year-long decline. Neolithic people built sophisticated settlements at Skara Brae in Scotland Dr Steven Shennan, from UCL, who co-authored that study, told BBC News: ""In Britain, after a population peak at around 3,500 or 3,600 BC, the population goes down steadily and it stays at a pretty low level until about 2,500 BC and then starts going up again. Around 2,500 BC the population is very low and that's precisely when the Beaker population seems to come in."" The reasons behind this slow population decline were probably complex, but the temporary downturn in the climate caused a permanent change in the way people farmed. One possibility is that the over-exploitation of land by Neolithic farmers applied pressure to food production. But disease may also have played a role in the population shift: ""We have some intriguing evidence that some of the Steppe nomads carried plague with them,"" said Lalueza-Fox. ""It could just be that the plague went with these migrants into Britain and the Neolithic population had not been in contact with this pathogen before."" Whatever did happen, Prof Parker Pearson is doubtful about the possibility of a violent invasion. The Beakers, he said, were ""moving in very small groups or individually"". He explained: ""This is no great horde, jumping in boats en masse... it's a very long, slow process of migration."" Furthermore, the incidence of interpersonal violence appears to be higher in Neolithic Britain (7%) than it was in the Beaker period (1%) The Nature study examines the Beaker phenomenon across Europe using DNA from hundreds more samples, including remains from Holland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Italy and France. Another intriguing possibility links the Beaker people with the spread of Celtic languages. Prof Reich commented: ""It's very exciting to think that maybe Celtic languages could have been spread by the Beaker phenomenon through Central Europe and into Britain, but that's not the only scenario."" Indeed, many archaeologists and linguists believe Celtic spread thousands of years later. But Dr Lalueza-Fox said: ""In my view, the massive population turnover must be accompanied by a language replacement.""

Labour denies ex-Czech agent's claimsJeremy Corbyn's spokesman denies he was an agent of the Czech regime in the 1980s after claims by former spy.2h2 hours agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Jan Sarkocy described Mr Corbyn as a ""very, very good source"" Labour has again denied allegations Jeremy Corbyn had been either a collaborator or agent of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia in the 1980s. The Labour leader's spokesman said the claims had come from a single source and were ""absurd and hallucinogenic"". It comes as the German authorities said it had found no records of a Stasi file on Mr Corbyn in ""recent searches,"" following press speculation. Ex-Czech agent Jan Sarkocy claims he met Mr Corbyn several times in London. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Corbyn attacks press over spy 'smears' Asked to describe the then backbench MP's relationship with the Czech secret police, the StB, Mr Sarkocy told BBC News: ""It's very hard to say, but he was open."" Pressed on whether Mr Corbyn knew Mr Sarkocy was a member of the secret police, he said: ""Yeah, absolutely, because at the time, you know, everyone knew who is who at the Embassy."" Mr Sarkocy, who was interviewed by the BBC in Bratislava, Slovakia, described Mr Corbyn as a ""very, very good source"". Mr Corbyn's spokesman said the Labour leader recalled one meeting with an unnamed Czech diplomat to discuss disarmament in the 1980s but disputed other reported encounters, accusing Mr Sarkocy of making a series of outlandish claims. He said claims he was ""sympathetic"" to the Soviet-backed Czechoslovak regime were false. This video can not be played Andrew Neil asks Steve Baker: ""In what sense has Mr Corbyn betrayed this country?"" Mr Corbyn has suggested a series of front page headlines over the past week about his contacts with Mr Sarkocy, who worked in the Czechoslovak embassy in London in the 1980s, were politically motivated. In a Facebook message on Tuesday, he suggested that the coverage, based on a file which the Communist-era Czech intelligence agency compiled on Mr Corbyn, was driven by right-wing newspaper owners who were ""worried"" about the prospect of a Labour government. The director of the Czech Security Service Archive has said the files suggest Mr Corbyn was seen as a possible ""contact"" for the authorities but there was no evidence to suggest he was an informant or collaborator. This was Jeremy Corbyn's reaction when Theresa May raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions The body which runs the archives of the former East Germany's secret police, the Stasi, said it had not found ""any records"" on the Labour leader in ""recent searches"". The Federal Commissioner for the Stasi records has now scotched press speculation that the much-feared secret police compiled a dossier on Mr Corbyn after he toured the country with his then girlfriend - Labour MP and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott - in the 1970s. In a statement, the Federal Commissioner said: ""The most recent researches in the written records of the Ministry for State Security of East Germany have not produced any records or any other information on Jeremy Corbyn or Diane Abbott."" It has been reported that East German agents targeted left-wing politicians and groups, infiltrating Labour Action for Peace, a group in which Mr Corbyn was active in during the 1980s. Speaking after Prime Minister's Questions, a Labour spokesman said there was nothing to indicate that Mr Corbyn had been aware of this. More broadly, he said the press had had ""creative fun"" with the spy stories but the claims were based on a single source and had been denied by the Czech intelligence archives. Mr Corbyn, who is said to have ""good records"" of his contacts from the period, remembered meeting one Czechoslovak official to discuss the prospect for peace and disarmament, a discussion that took place at a time when there were growing hopes of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Labour leader was ""not embarrassed"" to have met a wide range of people from both Warsaw Pact and Nato countries during the Cold War, his spokesman said, but some of the alleged meetings were ""demonstrably false"". The MP, he said, had been at a socialist conference in Chesterfield on 24 October 1987, one of the dates in which he was reported to have met Mr Sarkocy. The Labour leader, meanwhile, has called on Tory MP Ben Bradley to apologise or face legal action for a post on Twitter in which he claimed Mr Corbyn had ""sold British secrets to Communist spies"". Mr Corbyn's lawyers have sent a letter to the Mansfield MP urging him to confirm in writing that the ""defamatory statement"" - which they say is damaging and potentially harmful to the Labour leader's reputation - will not be repeated in any form. Mr Bradley, who had already deleted the tweet following criticism on social media, is also being urged to make a donation to a charity of Jeremy Corbyn's choice ""in lieu of damages"".

Plea to end 'hell on earth' Syria crisis,"This video can not be played Young children have been found buried in the rubble The UN Secretary General has demanded an immediate end to fighting in the Eastern Ghouta in Syria, describing the rebel enclave as a ""hell on earth"". ""I believe Eastern Ghouta cannot wait,"" Antonio Guterres told the UN Security Council on Wednesday. The council is being urged to consider a resolution which calls for a 30-day ceasefire in Syria. The Eastern Ghouta has been under fierce bombardment from government forces backed by Russian airpower. The region is the last major rebel-held area near the capital Damascus. The Syrian military says it is trying to liberate the area from what it terms terrorists - but it has also been accused of targeting civilians. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Why is there a war in Syria? ""This is a human tragedy that is unfolding in front of our eyes and I don't think we can let things go on happening in this horrendous way,"" Mr Guterres said. He said an end to the fighting would allow the evacuation of hundreds of people who require urgent treatment as well as allowing humanitarian aid to reach the region. The draft UN Security Council resolution, proposed by Kuwait and Sweden, is designed to facilitate medical evacuations and deliveries of humanitarian aid. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said immediate action was needed to save civilian lives from the ""barbaric Assad regime"". However the BBC's UN Correspondent Nick Bryant says Russia may not allow it to pass. Russia says it wants an urgent Security Council meeting to discuss the situation, but Western diplomats view this as a delaying tactic to give the Syrian military more time to continue its offensive, our correspondent says. Moscow, which supports the Syrian government, said peace talks with the rebels had failed on Wednesday. Meanwhile Iran, another Syrian government ally, says it is in close contact with Syria, Russia and Turkey to try to reduce tension in the Eastern Ghouta. This video can not be played Iran's deputy foreign minister: 'Everybody is worried about Ghouta' Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the BBC's Lyse Doucet that Iran believed in a political solution to the conflict, not a military one. UN human rights commissioner Zeid Raad Al Hussein has also joined calls for an end to the conflict in the region. ""How much cruelty will it take before the international community can... take resolute, concerted action to bring this monstrous campaign of annihilation to an end?"" he said in a statement. Pro-government forces, backed by Russia, intensified their efforts to retake the last major rebel stronghold on Sunday night. A doctor working in the region says the situation is ""catastrophic"" - and he believes the international community has abandoned the people living there. ""They targeted everything: shops, markets, hospitals, schools, mosques, everything,"" Dr Bassam told the BBC on Wednesday. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" ""Maybe every minute we have 10 or 20 air strikes... I will treat someone - and after a day or two they come again, injured again."" ""Where is the international community, where is (the UN) Security Council? ... they abandoned us. They leave us to be killed,"" he said. The UN says at least 346 civilians have been killed and 878 have been injured, mostly in airstrikes. A makeshift hospital was set up in Douma - one of the several towns under bombardment But they say precise figures are still difficult to establish. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which operates medical facilities in the Eastern Ghouta, says 70 people were killed on Wednesday, bringing the total to 366. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the total death toll since Sunday at 310. It said that barrel bombs - containers filled with explosives and shrapnel - were used in government strikes on the towns of Jisreen and Kfar Batna on Wednesday. It follows the bombardment on Tuesday of at least 10 towns and villages across the Eastern Ghouta. No. The government has allowed one humanitarian convoy into the Eastern Ghouta since late November, and there are severe shortages of food. A bundle of bread now costs close to 22 times the national average and 12% of children under five years old are said to be acutely malnourished. This video can not be played Father describes a 'miserable day for Eastern Ghouta' On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) joined the UN in calling for emergency humanitarian access to allow much needed aid to be delivered and the wounded to be evacuated. ""Wounded victims are dying only because they cannot be treated in time. In some areas of Ghouta, entire families have no safe place to go,"" the ICRC's Marianne Gasser said in a statement. Meanwhile, pro-government fighters have been sent to the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in northern Syria to confront an offensive by Turkish troops and Syrian rebels. Turkey fired shells near the advancing columns, which, it says, forced the pro-government fighters into retreat. Afrin lies just south of the Turkish border. Turkey is trying to oust the Kurdish YPG militia, which controls the area and which has called on the Syrian military for help. This video can not be played Pro-government forces waved Syrian flags as they entered Afrin, in footage posted by the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah Syria has denounced the Turkish offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty, while Turkey has insisted it will not back down. Syrian government forces are also carrying out offensives on the rebel-held north-western province of Idlib. The UN says more than 300,000 people have been displaced by the fighting there since December.

UK 'has no plan' for Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played UK PM 'is facilitating talks gridlock' The government ""does not have a viable plan"" to deal with the political stalemate in Northern Ireland, Sinn FÃ©in's president has said. Mary Lou McDonald said she feared ""entrenchment and drift"" in efforts to restore the executive, which collapsed 13 months ago. PM Theresa May has held talks with Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP at Westminster. It comes exactly a week after talks aimed at ending the deadlock at Stormont collapsed. What is direct rule? Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide Disputed Stormont 'deal' pages leaked In an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Ms McDonald accused Mrs May of ""facilitating the DUP blocking"" the restoration of power-sharing. ""I believe whether intentionally or not, Theresa May is actually facilitating the DUP blocking advancement and resolution on these core issues,"" she said. Mrs May has emphasised that her government remains committed to doing all it can to restore devolution. At a press conference outside Westminster earlier, the Sinn FÃ©in president said: ""We can only surmise from our meeting with the British prime minister that the government doesn't have a viable plan for carving a pathway for the restoration of the institutions. ""We're disappointed that the government seems wedded to what they are calling 'a reflection period',"" Ms McDonald added that her party called for the ""reconvening of the inter-governmental conference as per the Good Friday Agreement"" - the 1998 deal which brought an end to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. ""We tried to impress upon the prime minister and secretary of state that standing still and doing nothing is simply not an option,"" she said. ""Just because the DUP have crashed the bus, does not mean that everyone has to sit at home now and cross their fingers and hope against hope that things will improve and that these issues will be resolved."" Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster said the DUP was not contemplating introducing an Irish language act in Northern Ireland Following the DUP's meeting, Arlene Foster said she was hopeful a new budget would be in place for Northern Ireland ""within weeks"". ""The people of Northern Ireland deserve to have a budget in place as soon as possible,"" she said. Her party colleague, MP Nigel Dodds added that the party ""want to see devolved government"" reinstated. ""In the absence of the devolution that we all want, we can't continue to have Northern Ireland left in limbo as it has been in the last 13 months,"" he said. ""We simply want a commonsense interim position, whereby ministers are taking decisions, budgets are being set, whilst we continue to work through the issues."" Allow Twitter content?

In relation to the draft agreement which was leaked on Tuesday, Arlene Foster said it contained ""only one of a number of documents that were circulated and put out and about"". She added that her party was not contemplating introducing an Irish language act in Northern Ireland. During the meetings with Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP, the prime minister said it was important for everyone ""to reflect on the circumstances which have led to this"". In a statement, a spokesperson for Downing Street said the prime minister will be ""working closely with Northern Ireland Secretary and will continue to engage with the parties and the Irish Government."" On Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradleydeclined to immediately re-impose direct rulefrom Westminster. Theresa May hosted separate talks with Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP on Wednesday Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP - Northern Ireland's two main parties - had been in negotiations to end a 13-month stalemate at Stormont. The devolved government collapsed in a row over abotched green energy scheme. Talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed last week, and the two sides blamed each other for an impasse over a proposed Irish language act. The parties still disagree on whether or not a draft agreement was on the table before the talks broke down. There has been a 13-month political stalemate in Northern Ireland On Tuesday, parts of the draft agreement being worked onwere leaked and published. These confirmed what had already been reported about a three-stranded approach to the language question -  which would have resulted in an Irish language act, an Ulster Scots act, and a so-called respecting language and diversity act. But there was a degree of ambiguity as to whether this had been fully signed off by all the parties. Meanwhile, on Wednesday morning, MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs committee took evidence on the issue of devolution. They heard from witnesses including SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Eastwood told the committee that the power-sharing institutions could be out of action for five years ""if we keep doing what we're doing"".

How ruling helps serious crime victims,"Campaigners for justice for Worboys' victims at the Metropolitan Police HQ The Supreme Court's ruling that the Metropolitan Police botched the investigation into the black cab rapist John Worboys - and in doing so breached victims' human rights - will have a profound effect on crime fighting. It is not about the compensation, but the duty that the police are now under to carry out an effective investigation - and prove that they have done so. The case was so important to the landscape of British policing that Theresa May, when she was home secretary, intervened in the case to make her own arguments. Her lawyers argued - you may be surprised by this - that our top judges should leave the decision to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. So why is this case so important? Put most simply, the law has repeatedly made clear that police can not in general terms be sued for negligence. That position was underlined by the Supreme Court just three years ago in the case of Joanna Michael, murdered by her boyfriend. She dialled 999, but police downgraded her call and officers turned up too late to save her. The court ruled thatthe bar on negligence claims against the police stood. At the other end of the crime spectrum, they also can't be sued if they do not catch the thief who stole your lawnmower - nor can your neighbour sue them if a slow-moving investigation fails to catch the miscreant before he nicks their lawnmower. That's because the police can't be held responsible for a crime committed by someone else. But two of Worboys' victims, ""DSD"" and ""NBV"", have now altered the legal landscape. John Worboys case: Met Police loses 'landmark' appeal The cabbie who preyed on 100 women Why can't we sue the police for negligence? The women's case was that had there been an effective proper investigation from the start, they would not have been subjected to the attacks. Therefore they had been victims of inhuman or degrading treatment, which the state has a duty to prevent, under Article 3 of theEuropean Convention of Human Rights,external. The Metropolitan Police long ago conceded officers had failed over Worboys. But it fought this Article 3 challenge to the top because of the legal implications were it to lose all police forces would be under a clear obligation to prove they had effectively and exhaustively investigated a serious violent crime, or face damages claims. And that, to all intents and purposes is what has now happened. The Supreme Court justices could have limited their ruling to saying there was only a breach if a force was guilty of systemic failings such as back-office bungling because detectives were poorly managed. But they went far further - and by a majority ruled that a force had to show that its actual investigation - the specific operational steps taken to hunt down the attacker - were effective. This video can not be played Women need to be confident police will investigate - John Worboys' victim In the case of DSD, Worboys dropped her off at a police station after he had drugged her. But no officer took his name. Nobody later checked the CCTV to get his black cab registration. He could have been interviewed but wasn't. That is exactly the kind of basic failing that meant the police today lost. So will this open the floodgates to compensation claims from lawnmower theft victims? Not at all, says Lord Kerr, the lead justice. ""I do not believe that this is a serious possibility,""he said in the judgement,,external ""The recognition that really serious operational failures by police in the investigation of offences can give rise to a breach of Article 3 cannot realistically be said to herald an avalanche of claims for every retrospectively detected error in police investigations of minor crime."" But there's no doubt there will be more legal action. The first successful case could come from the families of serial killer Stephen Port's four victims. Stephen Port: Significant failings in the investigation During his trial in 2016, it emerged that the police missed obvious opportunities to link the deaths and apprehend him. Stephen Port: The killer the police missed ""This [the Worboys judgement] is a significant decision for the families of Anthony, Gabriel, Daniel and Jack,"" says Andy Petherbridge, the lawyer representing the relatives. ""We have begun civil claims against the Metropolitan Police Service - these include a claim under Article 3. I would expect today's judgment to have a positive bearing on our case. This could also strengthen any claims by survivors assaulted by Port."" Whatever the outcome of that claim, the impact on policing itself will be massive. Every single serious violent crime investigation will now have to be rock solid. Nothing can be left to chance. Everything will have to be documented - everything might be reviewed - even more so than the kind of processes seen in many successful investigations that daily protect the public. Some officers are still clearly fearful - and the Met itself has predicted it will mean shifting resources away from less serious crimes, such as fraud. But in all likelihood the long-term effect could be exactly what the victims want to see in the first place: Better training, better decision-making, better service - and more criminals caught. Just think about the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. It was just such amajor and professional reviewof the available evidence by a focused and dedicated team of detectives and forensic experts that ultimately led to two of his killers being jailed. Or as DSD put it herself at the Supreme Court: ""Had you [the police] done your job properly, there wouldn't be 105 victims, there would be one.""

UK's Brexit transition plans released,"The UK has published proposals for how it wants the transition period immediately after Brexit to work. It says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"". Number 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years. The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission. There are ""only a small number of areas"" where the two sides disagree, it says. These include the status of EU nationals arriving during transition. EU sets out Brexit transition demands Pro-Brexit Tories set out demands The transition period is due to kick in as the UK leaves in March 2019, and is intended to give time to prepare for the long-term post-Brexit arrangements between the UK and the EU, which have yet to be agreed, and to give businesses time to adapt. The BBC's Norman Smith said some of thedocument,externalpublished by David Davis's Brexit department would make ""uncomfortable reading"" for Tory Brexiteers. It contains no ""pushback"" on EU demands for free movement of people to continue in the same form during the transition phase, no suggestion of a veto to block new EU laws and no power to implement new international trade deals without the EU's permission, he said. The document's publication comes after more than 60 Eurosceptic Tory MPs set out a list of Brexit demands for the prime minister - and a day before ministers meet at Chequers to try to thrash out a way forward. The EU has said the transition phase should end on 31 December, 2020, the end of its budget period. But in the UK's ""draft text for discussion"", it says the length ""should be determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin the future partnership"". It adds: ""The UK agrees this points to a period of around two years, but wishes to discuss with the EU the assessment that supports its proposed end date."" Labour MP Chuka Umunna, of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign, said: ""It appears the government wants transition to last indefinitely - a never-ending road to nowhere because the cabinet can't agree on our future trading relationship with the EU"". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Brexit Minister Steve Baker said: ""I'd be quite happy for us to have the minimum period necessary to get out successfully into the new arrangements but that is a matter to negotiate with the European Commission. ""You can see that they want us to exit at the end of the budget period (31 December, 2020) the prime minister is suggesting two years. But what will be the case is, when we've agreed, there will be a fixed date."" One area where the two sides have been expected to clash is citizens' rights, and whether people from the EU arriving in the UK during transition will have an unrestricted right to stay. The UK government has said such people should be treated differently to those who are already here before Brexit day - something the EU says it cannot accept. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the leak suggested the UK ""has softened its position"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Giving evidence to a committee of MPs, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes stuck to the government's line, saying EU citizens would ""not be subject to the same rights"" once Brexit takes place in March 2019. ""I think there's an important point that EU citizens who come here after we've left the EU will have done so knowing that we're leaving the European Union and will have different expectations to those who have been here for some time and are entitled to settled status,"" she said. The letter to Theresa May from 62 Tory MPs says the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"". Earlier Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was time for Mrs May to spell out clearly what kind of relationship she wanted with the EU, accusing her of ""waffle and empty rhetoric"" on Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions. ""Businesses need to know. People want to know. Even Tory backbenchers are demanding to know."" He suggested the PM had downgraded her negotiation goals from a tariff-free trade agreement to ""as much tariff-free trade as possible"". Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May said this was not the case and her desired outcome remained a ""bespoke economic partnership"" with the EU which also enabled the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws, money and borders. ""We want to have a good trade agreement with the EU...but we also want to ensure this country takes the opportunities that will be open to us outside the EU to boost our economy."" She rejected Mr Corbyn's claims that Brexit would result in a ""bonfire of regulations"", insisting the Conservatives record in government showed it was committed to protecting and extending workers' rights.

'Stop using knives' begs grieving mother,"This video can not be played Camden stabbings: 'Stop using knives' begs grieving mother A mother whose two sons were stabbed to death in north London within five months of each other has called for young people to stop using knives. Sadiq Adan Mohamed, 20, died after being stabbed in Malden Road, Camden, at about 22:10 GMT on Tuesday. He was one of two men stabbed to death in Camden that night. Abdikarim Hassan, 17, died in Bartholomew Road at 21:08. Mr Mohamed's mother, Fowsiya Abdi, said: ""Please I beg you, people who got a knife, children - stop please."" Abdikarim Hassan (l) and Sadiq Adan Mohamed (r) were both killed in Camden on Tuesday Another of her sons was stabbed to death - also aged 20 - in September 2017. Her sister's brother has also been killed. She said for both her sons, it was a case of ""wrong place, wrong time"", and she fears for her other children. Mr Mohamed was given first aid but died at the scene near the junction with Marsden Street. Ms Abdi had heard rumours her son had been attacked before the police confirmed it for her. The Met Police is trying to determine if the killings of both young men on Tuesday night are linked. This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Ms Abdi said: ""I'm feeling pain. I can't sleep even, I can't sleep tonight."" Earlier Mr Mohamed's family released a statement saying: ""This is now the constant theme in our community. ""We are made to believe that the police are here to protect us, but how does a mother feel her kids are protected when she has lost two in the same vicinity within months? ""We have lots of questions and need answers. Somebody has to listen to us."" The Met Police is trying to establish whether the two deaths are linked Neighbour Layla Awod said Abdikarim Hassan was on his way back home from college when he was stabbed. She said his mother saw him lying on the floor dying after being refused to pass through the police security cordon. She knew it was her son when she called his mobile phone and heard it ringing the other side of the cordon, she said. Mr Hassan's uncle, Yusuf Ahmed, said the teenager came to the UK from Somalia when he was two years old and was the eldest of six children. He was a student at Westminster College, liked playing football, and was a ""good guy"" who was ""always smiling"". Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales On a knife edge: Rising violence in London Following the deaths, additional police patrols were sent to Camden overnight and a Section 60 order - giving them powers to stop and search people - was authorised across the borough until 07:00. A police spokesperson said murder investigations had been launched but no arrests had been made and ""urgent inquiries are under way to establish the full circumstances"". Sixteen people have been stabbed to death in London since the start of 2018. Five of those were teenagers. Less than two miles away from Tuesday night's first stabbing - and only minutes earlier - a 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Aldenham Street, Camden. Paramedics took the boy to a central London hospital with non life-threatening injuries. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of GBH with intent, but has since been released. No further action will be taken against him. Camden Police were called to another stabbing on Tuesday afternoon where a man, thought to be in his 40s, was attacked in Kilburn High Road shortly before 15:30. He was taken to hospital by London Air Ambulance and is in a stable condition. The force has not said if either attack was linked to the two fatal stabbings. A large police cordon was set up around the road where Mr Mohamed was killed A 19-year-old man who lives near Bartholomew Road told BBC Radio London stabbings were now ""everyday behaviour for these youngsters"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""desperately saddened"" by the deaths. ""I am asking the prime minister and the home secretary to urgently meet with me to discuss how we can work together to tackle the evil of knife attacks."" Meanwhile Cressida Dick, the commissioner for the Met Police, asked all Londoners to ""think about what you can do to help us tackle this blight on our city"". She urged young Londoners to ""stop and think"" before carrying a knife. The government's Serious Violence Strategy will be published in the next few months, a Home Office spokesperson said. ""Tackling this crime requires a new way of thinking,"" the spokesperson added.

Ancient Britons 'replaced' by newcomers,"Beaker pottery starts to appear in Britain around 4,500 years ago The ancient population of Britain was almost completely replaced by newcomers about 4,500 years ago, a study shows. The findings mean modern Britons trace just a small fraction of their ancestry to the people who built Stonehenge. The astonishing result comes from analysis of DNA extracted from 400 ancient remains across Europe. The mammoth study, published in Nature,,externalsuggests the newcomers, known as Beaker people, replaced 90% of the British gene pool in a few hundred years. Lead author Prof David Reich, from Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, US, said: ""The magnitude and suddenness of the population replacement is highly unexpected."" The reasons remain unclear, but climate change, disease and ecological disaster could all have played a role. People in Britain lived by hunting and gathering until agriculture was introduced from continental Europe about 6,000 years ago. These Neolithic farmers, who traced their origins to Anatolia (modern Turkey) built giant stone (or ""megalithic"") structures such as Stonehenge in Wiltshire, huge Earth mounds and sophisticated settlements such as Skara Brae in the Orkneys. But towards the end of the Neolithic, about 4,450 years ago, a new way of life spread to Britain from Europe. People began burying their dead with stylised bell-shaped pots, copper daggers, arrowheads, stone wrist guards and distinctive perforated buttons. Co-author Dr Carles Lalueza-Fox, from the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE) in Barcelona, Spain, said the Beaker traditions probably started ""as a kind of fashion"" in Iberia after 5,000 years ago. From here, the culture spread very fast by word of mouth to Central Europe. After it was adopted by people in Central Europe, it exploded in every direction - but through the movement of people. Prof Reich told BBC News: ""Archaeologists ever since the Second World War have been very sceptical about proposals of large-scale movements of people in prehistory. But what the genetics are showing - with the clearest example now in Britain at Beaker times - is that these large-scale migrations occurred, even after the spread of agriculture."" The genetic data, from more than 150 ancient British genomes, reveals that the Beakers were a distinct population from the Neolithic British. After their arrival on the island, Beaker genes appear to swamp those of the native farmers. Prof Reich added: ""The previous inhabitants had just put up the big stones at Stonehenge, which became a national place of pilgrimage as reflected by goods brought from the far corners of Britain."" He added: ""The sophisticated ancient peoples who built that monument and ones like it could not have known that within a short period of time their descendants would be gone and their lands overrun."" The newcomers brought ancestry from nomadic groups originating on the Pontic Steppe, a grassland region extending from Ukraine to Kazakhstan. These nomads moved west during the Neolithic, mixing heavily with established populations in Europe. The Beaker migration marks the first time this eastern genetic signature appears in Britain. Archaeologist and study co-author Mike Parker Pearson, from University College London (UCL), said Neolithic Britons and Beaker groups organised their societies in very different ways. The construction of massive stone monuments, co-opting hundreds of people, was an alien concept to Beakers, but the Neolithic British community ""has that absolutely as its core rationale"". ""[The Beaker people] are not prepared to collaborate on enormous labour-mobilising projects; their society is more de-centralised,"" said Prof Parker Pearson. ""We don't have a good expression for it, but the Americans do, and that is: nobody is willing to work for 'The Man'."" The Beaker folk seemed to favour more modest round ""barrows"", or earth burial mounds, to cover the distinguished dead. The group is also intimately associated with the arrival of metalworking to Britain. Prof Parker Pearson commented: ""They're the people who bring Britain out of the Stone Age. Up until then, the people of Britain had cut themselves off from the continent - 'Neolithic Brexit'. This is the moment when Britain re-joins the continent after 1,000 years of isolation - most of the rest of Europe was well out of the Stone Age by this point."" What triggered the massive genetic shift remains unclear. Buta paper published in PNAS journal last year,externalsuggested a downturn in the climate around 5,500 years ago (3,500 BC) pushed Neolithic populations into a thousand-year-long decline. Neolithic people built sophisticated settlements at Skara Brae in Scotland Dr Steven Shennan, from UCL, who co-authored that study, told BBC News: ""In Britain, after a population peak at around 3,500 or 3,600 BC, the population goes down steadily and it stays at a pretty low level until about 2,500 BC and then starts going up again. Around 2,500 BC the population is very low and that's precisely when the Beaker population seems to come in."" The reasons behind this slow population decline were probably complex, but the temporary downturn in the climate caused a permanent change in the way people farmed. One possibility is that the over-exploitation of land by Neolithic farmers applied pressure to food production. But disease may also have played a role in the population shift: ""We have some intriguing evidence that some of the Steppe nomads carried plague with them,"" said Lalueza-Fox. ""It could just be that the plague went with these migrants into Britain and the Neolithic population had not been in contact with this pathogen before."" Whatever did happen, Prof Parker Pearson is doubtful about the possibility of a violent invasion. The Beakers, he said, were ""moving in very small groups or individually"". He explained: ""This is no great horde, jumping in boats en masse... it's a very long, slow process of migration."" Furthermore, the incidence of interpersonal violence appears to be higher in Neolithic Britain (7%) than it was in the Beaker period (1%) The Nature study examines the Beaker phenomenon across Europe using DNA from hundreds more samples, including remains from Holland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Italy and France. Another intriguing possibility links the Beaker people with the spread of Celtic languages. Prof Reich commented: ""It's very exciting to think that maybe Celtic languages could have been spread by the Beaker phenomenon through Central Europe and into Britain, but that's not the only scenario."" Indeed, many archaeologists and linguists believe Celtic spread thousands of years later. But Dr Lalueza-Fox said: ""In my view, the massive population turnover must be accompanied by a language replacement.""

MP attacked by hooded gang on way home,"Adrian Bailey said he was near to his home in Southwark when he was approached by several people wearing hoodies An MP was set upon by a gang of robbers who jumped on him and attacked him before stealing his wallet and phone. Adrian Bailey, Labour MP for West Bromwich West, was on his way home from Parliament on Tuesday night when as many as six people targeted him. He was left bruised after he fought off one person who jumped on his back and when he was hit over the head with a large milk container. The Metropolitan Police said no arrests have been made. Midlands Live: Teen's nightclub death caused by drugs; Police reinforcements join Wolverhampton murder probe After the attack Mr Bailey went to his Southwark home and called police. The 72-year-old said after the first person jumped on him from behind, another then attacked him and a third person went past him on a bike and blocked his exit. After calling for help, he thought someone nearby was coming to help, but instead they turned out to be another attacker. During the robbery he received a number of blows and was hit over the head with a large milk container, leaving him ""badly shaken up"", he said. ""I appreciate that many other people have gone through what I went through last night and it really brought home to me the value of having bobbies on the beat to deter such attacks,"" he said. ""Every member of the public deserves the right to walk about in a safe and non-threatening environment. ""The Metropolitan Police response has been excellent and they are working hard with me to identify the perpetrators of this attack."" The force said officers were called to Crampton Street, in Southwark, at 22:26 GMT to reports of a robbery earlier in the evening resulting in a man being assaulted. ""The suspects made off with several items of property belonging to the victim who sustained minor injuries."" a spokesman said.

Labour denies ex-Czech agent's claimsJeremy Corbyn's spokesman denies he was an agent of the Czech regime in the 1980s after claims by former spy.25m26 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Jan Sarkocy described Mr Corbyn as a ""very, very good source"" Labour has again denied allegations Jeremy Corbyn had been either a collaborator or agent of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia in the 1980s. The Labour leader's spokesman said the claims had come from a single source and were ""absurd and hallucinogenic"". It comes as the German authorities said it had found no records of a Stasi file on Mr Corbyn in ""recent searches,"" following press speculation. Ex-Czech agent Jan Sarkocy claims he met Mr Corbyn several times in London. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Corbyn attacks press over spy 'smears' Asked to describe the then backbench MP's relationship with the Czech secret police, the StB, Mr Sarkocy told BBC News: ""It's very hard to say, but he was open."" Pressed on whether Mr Corbyn knew Mr Sarkocy was a member of the secret police, he said: ""Yeah, absolutely, because at the time, you know, everyone knew who is who at the Embassy."" Mr Sarkocy, who was interviewed by the BBC in Bratislava, Slovakia, described Mr Corbyn as a ""very, very good source"". Mr Corbyn's spokesman said the Labour leader recalled one meeting with an unnamed Czech diplomat to discuss disarmament in the 1980s but disputed other reported encounters, accusing Mr Sarkocy of making a series of outlandish claims. He said claims he was ""sympathetic"" to the Soviet-backed Czechoslovak regime were false. This video can not be played Andrew Neil asks Steve Baker: ""In what sense has Mr Corbyn betrayed this country?"" Mr Corbyn has suggested a series of front page headlines over the past week about his contacts with Mr Sarkocy, who worked in the Czechoslovak embassy in London in the 1980s, were politically motivated. In a Facebook message on Tuesday, he suggested that the coverage, based on a file which the Communist-era Czech intelligence agency compiled on Mr Corbyn, was driven by right-wing newspaper owners who were ""worried"" about the prospect of a Labour government. The director of the Czech Security Service Archive has said the files suggest Mr Corbyn was seen as a possible ""contact"" for the authorities but there was no evidence to suggest he was an informant or collaborator. This was Jeremy Corbyn's reaction when Theresa May raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions The body which runs the archives of the former East Germany's secret police, the Stasi, said it had not found ""any records"" on the Labour leader in ""recent searches"". The Federal Commissioner for the Stasi records has now scotched press speculation that the much-feared secret police compiled a dossier on Mr Corbyn after he toured the country with his then girlfriend - Labour MP and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott - in the 1970s. In a statement, the Federal Commissioner said: ""The most recent researches in the written records of the Ministry for State Security of East Germany have not produced any records or any other information on Jeremy Corbyn or Diane Abbott."" It has been reported that East German agents targeted left-wing politicians and groups, infiltrating Labour Action for Peace, a group in which Mr Corbyn was active in during the 1980s. Speaking after Prime Minister's Questions, a Labour spokesman said there was nothing to indicate that Mr Corbyn had been aware of this. More broadly, he said the press had had ""creative fun"" with the spy stories but the claims were based on a single source and had been denied by the Czech intelligence archives. Mr Corbyn, who is said to have ""good records"" of his contacts from the period, remembered meeting one Czechoslovak official to discuss the prospect for peace and disarmament, a discussion that took place at a time when there were growing hopes of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Labour leader was ""not embarrassed"" to have met a wide range of people from both Warsaw Pact and Nato countries during the Cold War, his spokesman said, but some of the alleged meetings were ""demonstrably false"". The MP, he said, had been at a socialist conference in Chesterfield on 24 October 1987, one of the dates in which he was reported to have met Mr Sarkocy. The Labour leader, meanwhile, has called on Tory MP Ben Bradley to apologise or face legal action for a post on Twitter in which he claimed Mr Corbyn had ""sold British secrets to Communist spies"". Mr Corbyn's lawyers have sent a letter to the Mansfield MP urging him to confirm in writing that the ""defamatory statement"" - which they say is damaging and potentially harmful to the Labour leader's reputation - will not be repeated in any form. Mr Bradley, who had already deleted the tweet following criticism on social media, is also being urged to make a donation to a charity of Jeremy Corbyn's choice ""in lieu of damages"".

NFU elects first female president,"This video can not be played Minette Batters says the UK must not 'open the flood gates' to cheap food from other parts of the world The first female president of the National Farmers Union has warned against ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal. Minette Batters, a beef farmer from Wiltshire, is the first woman to lead the NFU in its 110-year history. She told the BBC that she saw ""potential"" after Brexit, but World Trade Organisation rules would be bad for farmers and consumers. Ms Batters takes over from Meurig Raymond, who held the post since 2014. She had just one opponent, Essex farmer Guy Smith, who will become her deputy. The NFU, which represents more than 50,000 farmers and growers in England and Wales, announced the result at its annual meeting in Birmingham. The union backed Remain in the 2016 referendum, but Ms Batters said she was keen to look to the future. ""We feel very strongly now, after doing our research into what World Trade Organisation rules [or a 'no deal'] would mean, that we need to look forward and find solutions,"" she said. ""Crashing out would not be good for farming so it is vital we agree our relationship with the EU."" And she believes it is not just the farming industry that needs that certainty. ""It is important for consumers too,"" she said. ""When buying anything, we don't want to see those taxes go up. It would have a negative impact for consumers."" She also emphasised the importance of not ""opening the flood gates"" to cheap food with lower standards, as she said the NFU had the ambition to maintain or potentially raise them. Minette Batters says she never planned to be NFU president Ms Batters also said it was up to the farming community to prove its worth - especially if it wants the UK taxpayer to continue subsidies given to them by the EU when they come to an end. ""We have talked about getting the public out to the farm, but I think we need to take the countryside to the town,"" she said. ""In the next few years we must make the case of why British farms and foods deliver. ""We can't expect to be given handouts as they are or, as Theresa May would say, given to the privileged few. We must make our case."" Ms Batters was pleased to see theEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove address the NFU's conferenceearlier in the week and seemed hopeful about what the minister could do to support the industry. Michael Gove spoke to the NFU conference on Tuesday ""He is a big hitting politician and is very capable,"" she said. ""We have much hope for the plans he offered around the environment and hope he does the same for farming."" She said most politicians from all sides of the political spectrum would acknowledge they have not been as involved with farming since joining the EU, but she hopes they will now take a strong interest in the future of the industry. Ms Batters was brought up on a farm, but did not stand to inherit the tenancy for the land from her father. However, in 1998 she managed to convince the landlords that, in exchange for renovating two derelict cottages in the farmyard, she could take on the farm buildings and 300 acres. Starting with just 20 Simmental cross suckler cows, the business has grown to a herd of over 300 pedigree Hereford cattle, a small flock of pedigree sheep, fields and a converted Tythe barn wedding venue. She also runs a catering business specialising in home grown produce, and employs two full-time and up to 20 part-time staff Ms Batters also followed in her father's footsteps by being a lifetime member of the NFU, but got involved locally after a colleague convinced her to run for the position as county chairwoman for Wiltshire. She then served as Wiltshire's council delegate and also as regional board chairwoman for the South West, as well as being a member of NFU Governance Board and the agricultural representative on the SW Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Committee. She is now determined to get rid of the NFU's reputation as a male-dominated organisation. ""That really is a very out of date opinion,"" she said. ""We have very mixed and diverse staff and colleagues. ""There are a lot of women working in the organisation, from plant and animal health through to planning and broadband, and we cover every aspect."" Along with her NFU work, she has co-founded campaigns such as Ladies in Beef and the Great British Beef Week, and supported others, like Love British Food.

"Ancient Britons 'replaced' by newcomersBritain's Stone Age population was almost completely replaced some 4,500 years ago, a study shows.","Beaker pottery starts to appear in Britain around 4,500 years ago The ancient population of Britain was almost completely replaced by newcomers about 4,500 years ago, a study shows. The findings mean modern Britons trace just a small fraction of their ancestry to the people who built Stonehenge. The astonishing result comes from analysis of DNA extracted from 400 ancient remains across Europe. The mammoth study, published in Nature,,externalsuggests the newcomers, known as Beaker people, replaced 90% of the British gene pool in a few hundred years. Lead author Prof David Reich, from Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, US, said: ""The magnitude and suddenness of the population replacement is highly unexpected."" The reasons remain unclear, but climate change, disease and ecological disaster could all have played a role. People in Britain lived by hunting and gathering until agriculture was introduced from continental Europe about 6,000 years ago. These Neolithic farmers, who traced their origins to Anatolia (modern Turkey) built giant stone (or ""megalithic"") structures such as Stonehenge in Wiltshire, huge Earth mounds and sophisticated settlements such as Skara Brae in the Orkneys. But towards the end of the Neolithic, about 4,450 years ago, a new way of life spread to Britain from Europe. People began burying their dead with stylised bell-shaped pots, copper daggers, arrowheads, stone wrist guards and distinctive perforated buttons. Co-author Dr Carles Lalueza-Fox, from the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE) in Barcelona, Spain, said the Beaker traditions probably started ""as a kind of fashion"" in Iberia after 5,000 years ago. From here, the culture spread very fast by word of mouth to Central Europe. After it was adopted by people in Central Europe, it exploded in every direction - but through the movement of people. Prof Reich told BBC News: ""Archaeologists ever since the Second World War have been very sceptical about proposals of large-scale movements of people in prehistory. But what the genetics are showing - with the clearest example now in Britain at Beaker times - is that these large-scale migrations occurred, even after the spread of agriculture."" The genetic data, from more than 150 ancient British genomes, reveals that the Beakers were a distinct population from the Neolithic British. After their arrival on the island, Beaker genes appear to swamp those of the native farmers. Prof Reich added: ""The previous inhabitants had just put up the big stones at Stonehenge, which became a national place of pilgrimage as reflected by goods brought from the far corners of Britain."" He added: ""The sophisticated ancient peoples who built that monument and ones like it could not have known that within a short period of time their descendants would be gone and their lands overrun."" The newcomers brought ancestry from nomadic groups originating on the Pontic Steppe, a grassland region extending from Ukraine to Kazakhstan. These nomads moved west during the Neolithic, mixing heavily with established populations in Europe. The Beaker migration marks the first time this eastern genetic signature appears in Britain. Archaeologist and study co-author Mike Parker Pearson, from University College London (UCL), said Neolithic Britons and Beaker groups organised their societies in very different ways. The construction of massive stone monuments, co-opting hundreds of people, was an alien concept to Beakers, but the Neolithic British community ""has that absolutely as its core rationale"". ""[The Beaker people] are not prepared to collaborate on enormous labour-mobilising projects; their society is more de-centralised,"" said Prof Parker Pearson. ""We don't have a good expression for it, but the Americans do, and that is: nobody is willing to work for 'The Man'."" The Beaker folk seemed to favour more modest round ""barrows"", or earth burial mounds, to cover the distinguished dead. The group is also intimately associated with the arrival of metalworking to Britain. Prof Parker Pearson commented: ""They're the people who bring Britain out of the Stone Age. Up until then, the people of Britain had cut themselves off from the continent - 'Neolithic Brexit'. This is the moment when Britain re-joins the continent after 1,000 years of isolation - most of the rest of Europe was well out of the Stone Age by this point."" What triggered the massive genetic shift remains unclear. Buta paper published in PNAS journal last year,externalsuggested a downturn in the climate around 5,500 years ago (3,500 BC) pushed Neolithic populations into a thousand-year-long decline. Neolithic people built sophisticated settlements at Skara Brae in Scotland Dr Steven Shennan, from UCL, who co-authored that study, told BBC News: ""In Britain, after a population peak at around 3,500 or 3,600 BC, the population goes down steadily and it stays at a pretty low level until about 2,500 BC and then starts going up again. Around 2,500 BC the population is very low and that's precisely when the Beaker population seems to come in."" The reasons behind this slow population decline were probably complex, but the temporary downturn in the climate caused a permanent change in the way people farmed. One possibility is that the over-exploitation of land by Neolithic farmers applied pressure to food production. But disease may also have played a role in the population shift: ""We have some intriguing evidence that some of the Steppe nomads carried plague with them,"" said Lalueza-Fox. ""It could just be that the plague went with these migrants into Britain and the Neolithic population had not been in contact with this pathogen before."" Whatever did happen, Prof Parker Pearson is doubtful about the possibility of a violent invasion. The Beakers, he said, were ""moving in very small groups or individually"". He explained: ""This is no great horde, jumping in boats en masse... it's a very long, slow process of migration."" Furthermore, the incidence of interpersonal violence appears to be higher in Neolithic Britain (7%) than it was in the Beaker period (1%) The Nature study examines the Beaker phenomenon across Europe using DNA from hundreds more samples, including remains from Holland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Italy and France. Another intriguing possibility links the Beaker people with the spread of Celtic languages. Prof Reich commented: ""It's very exciting to think that maybe Celtic languages could have been spread by the Beaker phenomenon through Central Europe and into Britain, but that's not the only scenario."" Indeed, many archaeologists and linguists believe Celtic spread thousands of years later. But Dr Lalueza-Fox said: ""In my view, the massive population turnover must be accompanied by a language replacement.""

Twitter bot purge prompts backlash,"Twitter has been under pressure to block bot accounts used to spread disinformation The hashtag #TwitterLockout has trended after an apparent purge of suspected malicious bots on the social network. Dozens of users report having had their accounts suspended until they provided a telephone number which they then had to verify, to prove they were real. Some members have raised concerns about their amount of lost followers, and claimed discrimination against right-wing political beliefs. Others have in turn mocked allegations of bias. ""Twitter's tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias,"" the social network has said in response. ""Every day we proactively look for suspicious account behaviours that indicate inorganic or automated activity, violations of our policies around having multiple accounts, or abuse. ""And every day we take action on any accounts we find that violate our terms of service, including by asking account owners to confirm a phone number so we can confirm a human is behind it. ""This is part of our ongoing, comprehensive efforts to make Twitter safer and healthier for everyone."" The firm allowsautomated software to be used to send tweets,externalunder some circumstances, but forbids the posted content from being misleading. It has alsoissued new guidance,externalabout the use of automation and having multiple accounts. The action follows an indictment announced last week by special counsel Robert Mueller against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian firms. They are alleged to have used fake accounts on Twitterand other social media platformsto conduct ""information warfare against the United States"". Twitter and Facebook had faced criticism from US lawmakers earlier in the year for not having taken the problem seriously enough. One researcher who has studied digital disinformation campaigns said a Twitter crackdown should come as no surprise. ""This is a company that's under a lot of heat to clean up its act in terms of how its platform has been exploited to spread misinformation and junk news,"" said Samantha Bradshaw from the University of Oxford's Computational Propaganda Project. ""It now needs to rebuild trust with users and legislators to show it is trying to take action against these threats against democracy."" Facebook ads boss in fake news Twitter storm Facebook to seek verification by post for election ads Russian Tumblr trolls pose as black activists Social media images shown as evidence of 'Russian trolls' The effort has nonetheless infuriated some Twitter members, including several conservative radio show hosts.

"NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staffFigures show one in 12 posts in England is unfilled - enough to staff 10 large hospitals.","The NHS in England has nearly 100,000 jobs unfilled, a situation described as ""dangerously"" understaffed. The total represents one in 12 of all the posts in the health service and would be enough to staff 10 large hospitals. It includes 35,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies. The figures have been revealed in a finance report, showing NHS services are heading for a Â£931m deficit this year, twice what was planned. Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes The overspend by hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services has been partly blamed on the need to cover the vacancies with overtime and temporary staff. The accounts to the end of December also show higher than expected spending on paying the private sector to see NHS patients in an attempt to relieve the pressure on hard-pressed A&E units. Despite the overspend, the forecast is still some way short of the record Â£2.45bn deficit accrued in 2015-16.

Nigel Edwards of the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS was ""dangerously"" short of staff. ""In some ways, the lack of crucial workers in the NHS is an even bigger problem than the lack of funding. ""We can sign a cheque and bring back more money on-stream if the will is there, but there is no button to push which will suddenly bring us tens of thousands of qualified extra staff."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies added: ""All the evidence shows that standards of patient care rise and fall as nurse numbers do. ""That was the lesson from Mid Staffordshire and we cannot afford to forget it."" Ian Dalton, head of NHS Improvement, the regulator that released the accounts, said the health service was working hard to tackle the problems. He said staff deserved ""heartfelt thanks"" for their hard work.

"Ancient Britons 'replaced' by newcomersBritain's Stone Age population was almost completely replaced some 4,500 years ago, a study shows.1han hour agoScience & Environment","Beaker pottery starts to appear in Britain around 4,500 years ago The ancient population of Britain was almost completely replaced by newcomers about 4,500 years ago, a study shows. The findings mean modern Britons trace just a small fraction of their ancestry to the people who built Stonehenge. The astonishing result comes from analysis of DNA extracted from 400 ancient remains across Europe. The mammoth study, published in Nature,,externalsuggests the newcomers, known as Beaker people, replaced 90% of the British gene pool in a few hundred years. Lead author Prof David Reich, from Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, US, said: ""The magnitude and suddenness of the population replacement is highly unexpected."" The reasons remain unclear, but climate change, disease and ecological disaster could all have played a role. People in Britain lived by hunting and gathering until agriculture was introduced from continental Europe about 6,000 years ago. These Neolithic farmers, who traced their origins to Anatolia (modern Turkey) built giant stone (or ""megalithic"") structures such as Stonehenge in Wiltshire, huge Earth mounds and sophisticated settlements such as Skara Brae in the Orkneys. But towards the end of the Neolithic, about 4,450 years ago, a new way of life spread to Britain from Europe. People began burying their dead with stylised bell-shaped pots, copper daggers, arrowheads, stone wrist guards and distinctive perforated buttons. Co-author Dr Carles Lalueza-Fox, from the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE) in Barcelona, Spain, said the Beaker traditions probably started ""as a kind of fashion"" in Iberia after 5,000 years ago. From here, the culture spread very fast by word of mouth to Central Europe. After it was adopted by people in Central Europe, it exploded in every direction - but through the movement of people. Prof Reich told BBC News: ""Archaeologists ever since the Second World War have been very sceptical about proposals of large-scale movements of people in prehistory. But what the genetics are showing - with the clearest example now in Britain at Beaker times - is that these large-scale migrations occurred, even after the spread of agriculture."" The genetic data, from more than 150 ancient British genomes, reveals that the Beakers were a distinct population from the Neolithic British. After their arrival on the island, Beaker genes appear to swamp those of the native farmers. Prof Reich added: ""The previous inhabitants had just put up the big stones at Stonehenge, which became a national place of pilgrimage as reflected by goods brought from the far corners of Britain."" He added: ""The sophisticated ancient peoples who built that monument and ones like it could not have known that within a short period of time their descendants would be gone and their lands overrun."" The newcomers brought ancestry from nomadic groups originating on the Pontic Steppe, a grassland region extending from Ukraine to Kazakhstan. These nomads moved west during the Neolithic, mixing heavily with established populations in Europe. The Beaker migration marks the first time this eastern genetic signature appears in Britain. Archaeologist and study co-author Mike Parker Pearson, from University College London (UCL), said Neolithic Britons and Beaker groups organised their societies in very different ways. The construction of massive stone monuments, co-opting hundreds of people, was an alien concept to Beakers, but the Neolithic British community ""has that absolutely as its core rationale"". ""[The Beaker people] are not prepared to collaborate on enormous labour-mobilising projects; their society is more de-centralised,"" said Prof Parker Pearson. ""We don't have a good expression for it, but the Americans do, and that is: nobody is willing to work for 'The Man'."" The Beaker folk seemed to favour more modest round ""barrows"", or earth burial mounds, to cover the distinguished dead. The group is also intimately associated with the arrival of metalworking to Britain. Prof Parker Pearson commented: ""They're the people who bring Britain out of the Stone Age. Up until then, the people of Britain had cut themselves off from the continent - 'Neolithic Brexit'. This is the moment when Britain re-joins the continent after 1,000 years of isolation - most of the rest of Europe was well out of the Stone Age by this point."" What triggered the massive genetic shift remains unclear. Buta paper published in PNAS journal last year,externalsuggested a downturn in the climate around 5,500 years ago (3,500 BC) pushed Neolithic populations into a thousand-year-long decline. Neolithic people built sophisticated settlements at Skara Brae in Scotland Dr Steven Shennan, from UCL, who co-authored that study, told BBC News: ""In Britain, after a population peak at around 3,500 or 3,600 BC, the population goes down steadily and it stays at a pretty low level until about 2,500 BC and then starts going up again. Around 2,500 BC the population is very low and that's precisely when the Beaker population seems to come in."" The reasons behind this slow population decline were probably complex, but the temporary downturn in the climate caused a permanent change in the way people farmed. One possibility is that the over-exploitation of land by Neolithic farmers applied pressure to food production. But disease may also have played a role in the population shift: ""We have some intriguing evidence that some of the Steppe nomads carried plague with them,"" said Lalueza-Fox. ""It could just be that the plague went with these migrants into Britain and the Neolithic population had not been in contact with this pathogen before."" Whatever did happen, Prof Parker Pearson is doubtful about the possibility of a violent invasion. The Beakers, he said, were ""moving in very small groups or individually"". He explained: ""This is no great horde, jumping in boats en masse... it's a very long, slow process of migration."" Furthermore, the incidence of interpersonal violence appears to be higher in Neolithic Britain (7%) than it was in the Beaker period (1%) The Nature study examines the Beaker phenomenon across Europe using DNA from hundreds more samples, including remains from Holland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Italy and France. Another intriguing possibility links the Beaker people with the spread of Celtic languages. Prof Reich commented: ""It's very exciting to think that maybe Celtic languages could have been spread by the Beaker phenomenon through Central Europe and into Britain, but that's not the only scenario."" Indeed, many archaeologists and linguists believe Celtic spread thousands of years later. But Dr Lalueza-Fox said: ""In my view, the massive population turnover must be accompanied by a language replacement.""

Young survivors push for US gun reform,"This video can not be played Florida students have lobbied for tighter gun control measures Survivors of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead have marched to the state capitol to press lawmakers to take more action on gun control. One student said she was disappointed in meetings with lawmakers, who ""danced around"" their questions on gun control. It is the first organised protest of the youth-led anti-gun movement that has swept the US since the attack. Thousands of Florida students walked out of their classrooms in solidarity with survivors on Wednesday morning. Six radical ways to stop US school shootings Florida survivor: 'I'm not an actor' After Florida, some owners give up guns ""We came here prepared, and we are going to come to every single meeting with every single legislator prepared,"" Delaney Tarr said in Florida's capital city of Tallahassee. This video can not be played US students walk out to demand firearms control ""We know what we want. We want gun reform. We want common sense gun laws."" Students chanted ""protect our kids"" and carried banners with the words ""never again"" emblazoned across them as they protested outside the capitol. They were joined by students from two universities in Florida. ""Today instead of returning to our studies, instead of preparing for exams and instead of grieving for dead classmates and teachers, we are out here advocating for a change,"" said Florence Yared, a 17-year-old survivor of last week's shooting. This video can not be played Florida shooting survivor Lorenzo Prado mistaken for the gunman The students arrived on Tuesday as the state legislature rejected a ban on assault rifles like the one used in the attack. They split into several groups to discuss how to prevent gun violence and mental health issues with lawmakers. When pressed on gun control, state Senate President Joe Negron said ""that's an issue that we're reviewing"". President Donald Trump hosted students and teachers at the White House on Wednesday for a ""listening session"" on gun control. He pledged action on mental health and background checks following Florida's school shooting. ""It's not going to be talk like it's been in the past,"" he said. ""It's been going on too long, too many instances, we're going to get it done."" The National Rifle Association, a powerful gun rights lobby group, announced it would participate in a town hall that will be broadcast on CNN on Wednesday evening, according to the network. The danger of desensitising school shootings West Point admits murdered Florida hero Russian bots debate US gun control laws Student Tyra Hemans met Florida representative Wengay Newton after arriving in Tallahassee It was born out of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland one week ago, the second-deadliest school shooting in US history. For the first time, articulate student survivors of the attack have broken into the much-debated topic of gun control, says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Tallahassee. This video can not be played British student at Florida school Lewis Mizen: ""Something like this isn't going to stop us marching towards our future"" Wednesday's demonstration is their first organised protest aimed at putting pressure on legislators to ban assault-style rifles, similar to the semi-automatic AR-15 model police say was used by the alleged gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz. Several students took centre stage at an emotionally charged rally in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday, with high school student Emma Gonzalez attacking President Trump and other politicians for accepting political donations from the NRA. The movement has drawn support from celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey, who have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to help fund a planned march on gun control in Washington on 24 March. This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. Florida's Republican-controlled legislature on Tuesday rejected a Democratic motion to debate banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. During the current legislative session, lawmakers have heard proposals to liberalise gun laws, including to allow firearms in courts and airports. Since last week's shooting, one Republican legislator put forward a plan to permit certain adults in schools to carry guns. However, some Republicans have also voiced support in recent days for the idea of raising the legal age for buying a rifle or shotgun from 18. Gun ownership is protected by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? The US president on Tuesday instructed the justice department to propose a law to make bump-stock accessories, which allow semi-automatic rifles to fire as rapidly as machine guns, illegal. The device was not seen in the Florida shooting, but it was used by Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old gambler, who rained bullets on the crowd, killing 58, at an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in October. The White House also signalled on Tuesday it was considering raising the minimum age for people buying AR-15-type assault rifles - the current age limit in most states is 18. Mr Trump said over the weekend he was supportive of a bipartisan bill that seeks to improve the checks in place before someone can buy a gun. Previous efforts to introduce gun control measures in the wake of mass shootings in recent years have gone nowhere in the US Congress. Should US gun raffles be cancelled?

SA policemen shot dead 'execution-style',"The attackers took 10 firearms and a police van from the station Five police officers and a soldier have been shot dead during a raid on their station in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. In a statement, the South African Government News Agency said three officers were killed instantly. The off-duty soldier was shot as the assailants fled, taking two other officers hostage. Their bodies were found 6km (4 miles) down the road. A government statement said both men had been shot ""execution style"". Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories The unknown group of armed robbers burst into the police station near Mthatha, and opened fire early on Wednesday morning. Police do not yet know the motive for the attack. The suspects are believed to have robbed a cash machine shortly before. They took 10 firearms and a police van from the station. Gen Khehla John Sitole, National Commissioner of the South African Police Service, has vowed to find the killers,saying he was ""appalled and deeply saddened,externalby the cold and callous attack"". People on social media have been sharing their dismay at the attack. One Facebook user, who was a family friend of the soldier killed, said: ""An attack to the law enforcement institutions is an attack to the safety and security of our communities. ""This is a shock for the community. We now live in fear. If they can attack the people meant to protect the communityâ who are we? Who will we turn to?"" The BBC's South Africa correspondent Milton Nkosi says that before this attack, research found the killings of police officers had dropped by 52% since the end of apartheid in 1994.

"Cannabis licence considered for boy, 6Baroness Williams tells the Lords ""every option is being considered"" for Alfie Dingley who has epilepsy.28m29 minutes agoCoventry & Warwickshire","At one point, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year A licence to allow a boy to legally take cannabis to treat his epilepsy is being considered by the government. Six-year-old Alfie Dingley, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, suffers up to 30 violent seizures a day. The Home Office had denied the family's request for a licence as the drug is illegal in the UK. But speaking in the House of Lords earlier, Health minister Baroness Williams said ""every option is being considered"" by ministers. She said she had a ""huge amount of sympathy"" for Alfie and his family and that the policing minister and the home secretary ""want to explore every option within the current regulatory framework including issuing a licence"", under section 30 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Midlands Live: Teen's nightclub death caused by drugs; Labour MP bruised and shaken after mugging near Parliament Alfie's mother, Hannah Deacon, took her son to the Netherlands to take a cannabis-based medication in September. She said that while there, the medication, prescribed by a paediatric neurologist, saw his seizures reduce in number, duration and severity and he went 24 days without an attack. Ms Deacon said Alfie's cannabis dose was ""very small"", just three drops of the oil His condition is very rare with only nine boys in the world with the condition, she said. The case had been raised in the Lords a day after an urgent Commons debatewas tabled by Conservative MP for Reigate, Crispin Blunt. Lord Dear, independent crossbencher and former chief constable of the West Midlands, told the debate on Tuesday the current legal classification of the drug as having no therapeutic value had been ""roundly rebuffed"" by other countries. Calling on the government to look urgently at the licensing of the drug for medicinal use, he said 12 EU countries, numerous US states, Canada and Israel all allow ""under medical supervision licensed use of cannabis"". Baroness Williams added: ""We must keep laws like this under review and certainly the World Health Organisation are reviewing cannabis as a whole and the constituent parts of cannabis. ""We are keeping a very close eye on the outcome of that review and we will be taking a view on it in due course."" Home Office denies cannabis plea for boy Boy, 5, leaves UK for cannabis treatment.

Young survivors push for US gun reformA youth-led anti-gun movement born out of Florida's deadly school shooting stages its first protest.16m16 minutes agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Florida students have lobbied for tighter gun control measures Survivors of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead have marched to the state capitol to press lawmakers to take more action on gun control. One student said she was disappointed in meetings with lawmakers, who ""danced around"" their questions on gun control. It is the first organised protest of the youth-led anti-gun movement that has swept the US since the attack. Thousands of Florida students walked out of their classrooms in solidarity with survivors on Wednesday morning. Six radical ways to stop US school shootings Florida survivor: 'I'm not an actor' After Florida, some owners give up guns ""We came here prepared, and we are going to come to every single meeting with every single legislator prepared,"" Delaney Tarr said in Florida's capital city of Tallahassee. This video can not be played US students walk out to demand firearms control ""We know what we want. We want gun reform. We want common sense gun laws."" Students chanted ""protect our kids"" and carried banners with the words ""never again"" emblazoned across them as they protested outside the capitol. They were joined by students from two universities in Florida. ""Today instead of returning to our studies, instead of preparing for exams and instead of grieving for dead classmates and teachers, we are out here advocating for a change,"" said Florence Yared, a 17-year-old survivor of last week's shooting. This video can not be played Florida shooting survivor Lorenzo Prado mistaken for the gunman The students arrived on Tuesday as the state legislature rejected a ban on assault rifles like the one used in the attack. They split into several groups to discuss how to prevent gun violence and mental health issues with lawmakers. When pressed on gun control, state Senate President Joe Negron said ""that's an issue that we're reviewing"". President Donald Trump hosted students and teachers at the White House on Wednesday for a ""listening session"" on gun control. He pledged action on mental health and background checks following Florida's school shooting. ""It's not going to be talk like it's been in the past,"" he said. ""It's been going on too long, too many instances, we're going to get it done."" The National Rifle Association, a powerful gun rights lobby group, announced it would participate in a town hall that will be broadcast on CNN on Wednesday evening, according to the network.

For the first time, articulate student survivors of the attack have broken into the much-debated topic of gun control, says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Tallahassee. This video can not be played British student at Florida school Lewis Mizen: ""Something like this isn't going to stop us marching towards our future"" Wednesday's demonstration is their first organised protest aimed at putting pressure on legislators to ban assault-style rifles, similar to the semi-automatic AR-15 model police say was used by the alleged gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz. Several students took centre stage at an emotionally charged rally in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday, with high school student Emma Gonzalez attacking President Trump and other politicians for accepting political donations from the NRA. The movement has drawn support from celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey, who have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to help fund a planned march on gun control in Washington on 24 March. This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. Florida's Republican-controlled legislature on Tuesday rejected a Democratic motion to debate banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. During the current legislative session, lawmakers have heard proposals to liberalise gun laws, including to allow firearms in courts and airports. Since last week's shooting, one Republican legislator put forward a plan to permit certain adults in schools to carry guns. However, some Republicans have also voiced support in recent days for the idea of raising the legal age for buying a rifle or shotgun from 18. Gun ownership is protected by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? The US president on Tuesday instructed the justice department to propose a law to make bump-stock accessories, which allow semi-automatic rifles to fire as rapidly as machine guns, illegal. The device was not seen in the Florida shooting, but it was used by Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old gambler, who rained bullets on the crowd, killing 58, at an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in October. The White House also signalled on Tuesday it was considering raising the minimum age for people buying AR-15-type assault rifles - the current age limit in most states is 18. Mr Trump said over the weekend he was supportive of a bipartisan bill that seeks to improve the checks in place before someone can buy a gun. Previous efforts to introduce gun control measures in the wake of mass shootings in recent years have gone nowhere in the US Congress. Should US gun raffles be cancelled?

"KFC crisis 'caused by depot chaos'Chicken is going to waste as lorry delivery drivers queue for hours at the site, it is claimed.3h3 hours agoCoventry & Warwickshire","Lorries have been seen queuing outside the new DHL KFC distribution site in Rugby The KFC crisis is being caused by chaos at a delivery depot where chicken is going to waste, it is claimed. Drivers have been left waiting for hours because of problems getting into the firm's new delivery site in Rugby. The council said the site was used to store chicken before being registered to do so, but KFC's delivery contractor DHL had since registered. KFC said it is doing all it can to ""avoid"" food wastage and DHL said it was working to tackle the problem. More than 250 outlets are still shut because of supply problems, which started when it switched its delivery contract to DHL. One lorry driver said he lost a full load of chicken because of the depot issues. Midlands Live: Teen's nightclub death caused by drugs; Police reinforcements join Wolverhampton murder probe Tony, who did not want to give his full name, had a delivery of chicken scrapped, because his lorry's temperature was set wrongly at the depot in Rugby Gateway Industrial Park, which only handles distribution for KFC. On another occasion this week, he said he was left waiting at the depot for seven hours for his load and blames a lack of training. Disruption continues at KFC amid delivery problems 'Don't call police over KFC crisis' He said: ""Can you imagine how much food was on that trailer? Other businesses say they have health and safety concerns over the queuing lorries A former DHL worker, who did not wish to be named, said friends still working for the firm claim the depot is understaffed. He said lorry-loads of chicken were left to go off earlier this week, because there were not enough people to put it away. He added: ""Everybody knew it wasn't ready. It is going to take at least a week before it is all sorted out."" The site is still recruiting drivers and managers and earlier, people were also arriving for interviews. Hundreds of restaurants are closed across the UK because of the supply problems Richard Sweetman, who works nearby, said: ""For two weeks it's been absolute chaos. ""I wonder about the level of organisation and planning that went into the project."" Rugby Borough Council confirmed the depot had been used to store chicken before it had been registered to do so and that environmental officers visited the centre on Tuesday. A spokesman said what DHL was doing from a food hygiene point of view was ""absolutely fine"" and added that after the visit, the company submitted the registration documents and the depot is now registered. John Boulter, managing director for retail DHL supply chain, apologised and said it is still working on the cause of the problem.

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdictTheresa May clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit - here are the key bits of their exchanges.,"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. It was a noisy, boisterous session, which had the Speaker in full headmaster mode even before Mr Corbyn had got to his feet - it was the first of several interventions from John Bercow.

Mr Corbyn decided to focus on Brexit - and managed to raise a smile from the PM with his first question on David Davis's ""Mad Max"" speech, in which the Brexit secretary reassured the country life outside the EU would not be like a scene from a lawless Aussie dystopia. ""Doesn't the PM feel he (Mr Davis) could set the bar just a little bit higher?,"" asked Mr Corbyn. The PM was clearly amused by the Labour leader's joke - a rare thing indeed - but her reply was pure government boilerplate, complete with a swipe at Labour's shifting position on Brexit.

He told Mrs May the government was all ""waffle and empty rhetoric"" on Brexit, adding - in a scripted quip - ""this government isn't on the road to Brexit, Mr Speaker, it's on the road to nowhere"". Mrs May hit back with her own gag - the joke writers have been working over time this week - about the allegations over Mr Corbyn's contacts with a Czech spy in the 1980s. ""Normally he stands up and asks me to sign a blank cheque, I know he likes Czechs but really that is terribly depressing,"" said the PM, to a few groans and some laughter from MPs.

Here is BBC's Parliamentary Correspondent Mark's D'Arcy's take: Well, wellâ¦ a big, if not very informative Brexit exchange between the two main protagonists at PMQs. Jeremy Corbyn mined a rich seam of quotes from ministers, producing laughs from his backbenchers, but nothing new from the prime minister. The interest in all this is less what was said and more whether it signals an evolution in Labour's Brexit strategy. The questions reflected Labour's long-standing rhetoric about a ""jobs-first Brexit."" But the time is coming when they will have to take a position on, for example, UK membership of ""a customs union,"" after Brexit. So were these questions an attempt to start reaching out to Europhile Tory backbenchers who might rebel on forthcoming amendments to the Trade Bill? Perhaps the divisions among Tory MPs have finally proved an irresistible target. Elsewhere the PM has being trying to find positive notes to strike - and she was prepared to engage in a positive way with questions from Labour's Chris Bryant on rehabilitation for spinal injuries and the Conservative Sir Mike Penning on the safety of medical treatments. The session also saw a series of long and vehement rebukes to noisy MPs from Mr Speaker - and a couple of direct slap-downs to SNP MPs. This is one of the most Speaker-intensive PMQs for quite a while, and it looks as if, in the wake of the various concerns about bullying in Westminster, John Bercow has decided to launch a bit of a clampdown, Allow Twitter content?

KFC crisis 'caused by depot chaos',"Lorries have been seen queuing outside the new DHL KFC distribution site in Rugby The KFC crisis is being caused by chaos at a delivery depot where chicken is going to waste, it is claimed. Drivers have been left waiting for hours because of problems getting into the firm's new delivery site in Rugby. The council said the site was used to store chicken before being registered to do so, but KFC's delivery contractor DHL had since registered. KFC said it is doing all it can to ""avoid"" food wastage and DHL said it was working to tackle the problem. More than 250 outlets are still shut because of supply problems, which started when it switched its delivery contract to DHL. One lorry driver said he lost a full load of chicken because of the depot issues. Midlands Live: Teen's nightclub death caused by drugs; Police reinforcements join Wolverhampton murder probe Tony, who did not want to give his full name, had a delivery of chicken scrapped, because his lorry's temperature was set wrongly at the depot in Rugby Gateway Industrial Park, which only handles distribution for KFC. On another occasion this week, he said he was left waiting at the depot for seven hours for his load and blames a lack of training. Disruption continues at KFC amid delivery problems 'Don't call police over KFC crisis' He said: ""Can you imagine how much food was on that trailer? Other businesses say they have health and safety concerns over the queuing lorries A former DHL worker, who did not wish to be named, said friends still working for the firm claim the depot is understaffed. He said lorry-loads of chicken were left to go off earlier this week, because there were not enough people to put it away. He added: ""Everybody knew it wasn't ready. It is going to take at least a week before it is all sorted out."" The site is still recruiting drivers and managers and earlier, people were also arriving for interviews. Hundreds of restaurants are closed across the UK because of the supply problems Richard Sweetman, who works nearby, said: ""For two weeks it's been absolute chaos. ""I wonder about the level of organisation and planning that went into the project."" Rugby Borough Council confirmed the depot had been used to store chicken before it had been registered to do so and that environmental officers visited the centre on Tuesday. A spokesman said what DHL was doing from a food hygiene point of view was ""absolutely fine"" and added that after the visit, the company submitted the registration documents and the depot is now registered. John Boulter, managing director for retail DHL supply chain, apologised and said it is still working on the cause of the problem.

Tesla probes 'crypto-currency hack',"Tesla has confirmed that its cloud computing platform has been compromised by hackers. RedLock, the company that alerted it to the breach, believes the attackers may have done this to mine crypto-currency - an attack known as crypto-jacking. Tesla said it had addressed the vulnerability ""within hours"" and that no customer data had been stolen. A spokeswoman added that the effects of the hack seemed to be limited to internally used engineering test cars. ""Our initial investigation found no indication that customer privacy or vehicle safety or security was compromised in any way,"" she said. RedLock said that Tesla's log-in credentials were stored on a system that was not password-protected. Crypto-currency mining is the process for creating new digital coins by solving complex mathematical problems. It uses large amounts of computer processing power and therefore racks up large electricity bills. Hackers can save money by installing software on other people's computers to mine coins without their knowledge or consent. This is known as crypto-jacking. Crypto-jacking is becoming more widespread, especially as the value of digital currencies such as Bitcoin continues to rise. Hackers have compromised services offered by Starbucks, YouTube and the UK's Information Commissioner's Office. According to RedLock, the hackers discovered log-in details to Tesla's Amazon Web Services environment on a Kubernetes console - a system originally designed by Google to manage applications. The console was reportedly not password-protected. Exposed Amazon cloud storage clients get tip-offs Hackers hijack government websites to mine crypto-cash The value of the crypto-currency that the hackers mined using stolen power is unknown. According toa report in Fortune,external, Tesla paid RedLock $3,133.70 (Â£2,243.73) for uncovering the security flaw. The researchers said that the hackers used ""sophisticated evasion measures"" to avoid detection, such as keeping their use of computing power low and masking their Internet Protocol (IP) address with CloudFlare's content delivery network service. In a report published last year,RedLock said,externalthat 53% of organisations using cloud storage services such as Amazon had accidentally exposed these to the public, with ""hundreds"" leaking credentials through services such as Kubernetes.

Young survivors push for US gun reformA youth-led anti-gun movement born out of Florida's deadly school shooting stages its first protest.1h41 minutes agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Florida students have lobbied for tighter gun control measures Survivors of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead have marched to the state capitol to press lawmakers to take more action on gun control. One student said she was disappointed in meetings with lawmakers, who ""danced around"" their questions on gun control. It is the first organised protest of the youth-led anti-gun movement that has swept the US since the attack. Thousands of Florida students walked out of their classrooms in solidarity with survivors on Wednesday morning. Six radical ways to stop US school shootings Florida survivor: 'I'm not an actor' After Florida, some owners give up guns ""We came here prepared, and we are going to come to every single meeting with every single legislator prepared,"" Delaney Tarr said in Florida's capital city of Tallahassee.

""Today instead of returning to our studies, instead of preparing for exams and instead of grieving for dead classmates and teachers, we are out here advocating for a change,"" said Florence Yared, a 17-year-old survivor of last week's shooting. This video can not be played Florida shooting survivor Lorenzo Prado mistaken for the gunman The students arrived on Tuesday as the state legislature rejected a ban on assault rifles like the one used in the attack. They split into several groups to discuss how to prevent gun violence and mental health issues with lawmakers. When pressed on gun control, state Senate President Joe Negron said ""that's an issue that we're reviewing"". President Donald Trump hosted students and teachers at the White House on Wednesday for a ""listening session"" on gun control. He pledged action on mental health and background checks following Florida's school shooting. ""It's not going to be talk like it's been in the past,"" he said. ""It's been going on too long, too many instances, we're going to get it done.""

This video can not be played British student at Florida school Lewis Mizen: ""Something like this isn't going to stop us marching towards our future"" Wednesday's demonstration is their first organised protest aimed at putting pressure on legislators to ban assault-style rifles, similar to the semi-automatic AR-15 model police say was used by the alleged gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz. Several students took centre stage at an emotionally charged rally in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday, with high school student Emma Gonzalez attacking President Trump and other politicians for accepting political donations from the NRA. The movement has drawn support from celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey, who have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to help fund a planned march on gun control in Washington on 24 March.

Florida's Republican-controlled legislature on Tuesday rejected a Democratic motion to debate banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. During the current legislative session, lawmakers have heard proposals to liberalise gun laws, including to allow firearms in courts and airports. Since last week's shooting, one Republican legislator put forward a plan to permit certain adults in schools to carry guns. However, some Republicans have also voiced support in recent days for the idea of raising the legal age for buying a rifle or shotgun from 18.

The US president on Tuesday instructed the justice department to propose a law to make bump-stock accessories, which allow semi-automatic rifles to fire as rapidly as machine guns, illegal. The device was not seen in the Florida shooting, but it was used by Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old gambler, who rained bullets on the crowd, killing 58, at an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in October. The White House also signalled on Tuesday it was considering raising the minimum age for people buying AR-15-type assault rifles - the current age limit in most states is 18. Mr Trump said over the weekend he was supportive of a bipartisan bill that seeks to improve the checks in place before someone can buy a gun.

Productivity growth strongest since 2008,"The UK has seen the strongest two quarters of productivity growth since the recession of 2008, according to the latest data. Output per hour rose 0.8% in the three months to December,the Office for National Statistics said,external. It follows growth of 0.9% in the previous period. There was also a better than expected rise in wages. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.5% year-on-year. However, unemployment edged higher, but still remains low at 4.4%. The growth in productivity - as measured by the amount of work produced per working hour - will provide encouragement to policy makers who have wrestled with the challenge of low productivity growth since the financial crisis. The economy: Three better things, one worry UK economic growth exceeds forecasts The ONS said the surprise rise in the unemployment rate raised the question of whether the UK's long run of falling unemployment might be over. The rise in wages still lags behind inflation which stood at 3% at the end of last year. So average pay has not increased in real terms. But a pick up in wage growth is another sign that the UK economy could be shifting tack. Economists suggest that the rise in wages is significant. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG in the UK, said: ""There are signs that average weekly earnings, which rose by 2.5% in the fourth quarter, are beginning to respond to the tightness of the labour market, although households are still feeling the squeeze when accounting for inflation, with real earnings falling by 0.3%."" She also described the productivity figures as ""very encouraging"". ""If stronger productivity continues into 2018, the Bank of England may decide to hold at least once on raising rates this year,"" she added. Earlier this month the Bank of Englandindicated that interest rates were likely to go up more quickly than previously expected if the economy remained on its current track. Economist predicted there might be a rate rise as early as May. The increase in unemployment for the three months to the end of December was the first rise in the jobless rate for two years. However, the total number of people in work also continued to rise, jumping by 88,000 in the same period. Some of that increase was due to people previously classed as inactive and not looking for work moving into the workforce or registering as unemployed. ""There are mixed messages in the data we've had out this morning,"" says Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC. ""You've got a big rise in unemployment, a big rise in employment and a big rise in the workforce. It's not clear any one of those in isolation is a start of a trend. Ms Martins said she expected the unemployment rate to continue to rise but that rising numbers out of work could be part of the explanation for increased productivity growth. ""If GDP is growing more than the number of people working in it, then productivity will grow as there is more growth per head. ""It's not the nicest way to get productivity but it is effective as long as GDP growth doesn't slow too,"" she said. We used to take it for granted that we would each get better off as the economy grew. As companies and the government invested in better technology and skills, each worker could produce more goods or services per hour, bringing in more revenue to their employers - and as a result, each worker could be paid more per hour. Those improvements in productivity were for most of the last 200 years the motor of economic growth, so regular they could be taken for granted. In the past decade, that engine of improved prosperity broke down. By June 2017, the amount produced per hour was only 0.4 per cent larger than it had been nine years before. While we had had economic growth, most of it wasn't growth in the amount each worker produced or earned, but simply growth in the number of people working. Because an economy is simply people and their economic activity, when the number of people grows, so does the economy. But it may not be the sort of growth where individuals are getting better off. So used to the ""productivity puzzle"" have economists become that when the ONS estimated productivity growth of 0.9% in the third quarter of last year, many dismissed it as a blip. But now, with another estimate of 0.8 per cent in the final quarter, fewer are scoffing. Maybe that old motor has some life in it yet.

SA policemen âlined up and shotâ,"The attackers took 10 firearms and a police van from the station Five police officers and a soldier have been shot dead during a raid on their station in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. In a statement, the South African Government News Agency said three officers were killed instantly. The off-duty soldier was shot as the assailants fled, taking two other officers hostage. Their bodies were found 6km (4 miles) down the road. A government statement said both men had been shot ""execution style"". Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories The unknown group of armed robbers burst into the police station near Mthatha, and opened fire early on Wednesday morning. Police do not yet know the motive for the attack. The suspects are believed to have robbed a cash machine shortly before. They took 10 firearms and a police van from the station. Gen Khehla John Sitole, National Commissioner of the South African Police Service, has vowed to find the killers,saying he was ""appalled and deeply saddened,externalby the cold and callous attack"". People on social media have been sharing their dismay at the attack. One Facebook user, who was a family friend of the soldier killed, said: ""An attack to the law enforcement institutions is an attack to the safety and security of our communities. ""This is a shock for the community. We now live in fear. If they can attack the people meant to protect the communityâ who are we? Who will we turn to?"" The BBC's South Africa correspondent Milton Nkosi says that before this attack, research found the killings of police officers had dropped by 52% since the end of apartheid in 1994.

UK setting out Brexit transition position,"The UK has published proposals for how it wants the transition period immediately after Brexit to work. It says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"". Number 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years. The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission. There are ""only a small number of areas"" where the two sides disagree, it says. These include the status of EU nationals arriving during transition. EU sets out Brexit transition demands Pro-Brexit Tories set out demands The transition period is due to kick in as the UK leaves in March 2019, and is intended to give time to prepare for the long-term post-Brexit arrangements between the UK and the EU, which have yet to be agreed, and to give businesses time to adapt. The BBC's Norman Smith said some of thedocument,externalpublished by David Davis's Brexit department would make ""uncomfortable reading"" for Tory Brexiteers. It contains no ""pushback"" on EU demands for free movement of people to continue in the same form during the transition phase, no suggestion of a veto to block new EU laws and no power to implement new international trade deals without the EU's permission, he said. The document's publication comes after more than 60 Eurosceptic Tory MPs set out a list of Brexit demands for the prime minister - and a day before ministers meet at Chequers to try to thrash out a way forward. The EU has said the transition phase should end on 31 December, 2020, the end of its budget period. But in the UK's ""draft text for discussion"", it says the length ""should be determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin the future partnership"". It adds: ""The UK agrees this points to a period of around two years, but wishes to discuss with the EU the assessment that supports its proposed end date."" Labour MP Chuka Umunna, of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign, said: ""It appears the government wants transition to last indefinitely - a never-ending road to nowhere because the cabinet can't agree on our future trading relationship with the EU"". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Brexit Minister Steve Baker said: ""I'd be quite happy for us to have the minimum period necessary to get out successfully into the new arrangements but that is a matter to negotiate with the European Commission. ""You can see that they want us to exit at the end of the budget period (31 December, 2020) the prime minister is suggesting two years. But what will be the case is, when we've agreed, there will be a fixed date."" One area where the two sides have been expected to clash is citizens' rights, and whether people from the EU arriving in the UK during transition will have an unrestricted right to stay. The UK government has said such people should be treated differently to those who are already here before Brexit day - something the EU says it cannot accept. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the leak suggested the UK ""has softened its position"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Giving evidence to a committee of MPs, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes stuck to the government's line, saying EU citizens would ""not be subject to the same rights"" once Brexit takes place in March 2019. ""I think there's an important point that EU citizens who come here after we've left the EU will have done so knowing that we're leaving the European Union and will have different expectations to those who have been here for some time and are entitled to settled status,"" she said. The letter to Theresa May from 62 Tory MPs says the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"". Earlier Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was time for Mrs May to spell out clearly what kind of relationship she wanted with the EU, accusing her of ""waffle and empty rhetoric"" on Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions. ""Businesses need to know. People want to know. Even Tory backbenchers are demanding to know."" He suggested the PM had downgraded her negotiation goals from a tariff-free trade agreement to ""as much tariff-free trade as possible"". Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May said this was not the case and her desired outcome remained a ""bespoke economic partnership"" with the EU which also enabled the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws, money and borders. ""We want to have a good trade agreement with the EU...but we also want to ensure this country takes the opportunities that will be open to us outside the EU to boost our economy."" She rejected Mr Corbyn's claims that Brexit would result in a ""bonfire of regulations"", insisting the Conservatives record in government showed it was committed to protecting and extending workers' rights.

Review ordered into medical problem cases,"The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs The government has ordered a review into how UK authorities responded to concerns over three major medical problems. Baroness Julia Cumberlege has been asked to look at the pregnancy test Primodos, vaginal mesh implants and epilepsy drug sodium valproate cases. All three have been in the news in recent months with campaigners unhappy at the official response to each. There could even be public inquiries if they are felt necessary. The move was announced by Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions. Afterwards, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""We must acknowledge that the response to these issues from those in position of authority has not always been good enough. ""Sometimes the reaction has felt overly focused on defending the status quo rather than addressing the needs of patients."" Epilepsy drug in fresh safety review Hormone pregnancy test 'no link to harm' Case studies: Mesh led to 'excruciating pain' Hundreds suing NHS over vaginal implants What's the issue with mesh implants? The government has already agreed to carry out a full audit of how many women in England have suffered complications as a result of vaginal mesh implants, while a European review is examining whether warnings about risks to unborn babies from the mother's use of sodium valproate are strong enough. And last year, after carrying out an inquiry, the Commission on Human Medicines said the evidence did not support a ""causal link"" between use of Primodos and birth defects and miscarriages. This new review will not repeat the work done previously. Instead, it will look at: The robustness and speed of the authorities' responses Whether regulators did enough to engage those affected to ensure their concerns were escalated and acted upon Whether there needs to be an independent system - even a public inquiry - into any of the cases Primodos:The hormonal pregnancy test was used in Britain between 1953 and 1975. It worked by triggering a period if a woman was not pregnant. Before that, pregnancy tests required complicated blood tests. It is estimated that more than one million women used the drug to test for pregnancies. Campaigners claim it caused birth defects in their children, such as blindness, deafness, spina bifida and heart and limb defects, as well as cleft palates. Valproate:It is considered an effective treatment for epilepsy, bipolar disorders and migraine and has been used in the UK since the 1970s. Instructions for doctors - and, more recently, patient leaflets - say it should not be used during pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative and only after a careful discussion of the risks. Babies exposed to valproate medicines in the womb have a 10% chance of developing physical abnormalities and a 40% chance of developing cognitive problems, such as learning disabilities and autism. Parents who have had babies born with disabilities say they were not sufficiently warned about the risks. Vaginal mesh implants:These are used to hold up pelvic organs to treat incontinence and prolapse. It is estimated more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. But there have been reports of the implants cutting into the vagina and women being left in permanent pain, unable to walk, work or have sex. More than 800 women are taking legal action against the NHS and mesh manufacturers.

Stand-up comedian sued by ex-husband,"Louise Reay said the comments reflected how sad she was about the breakdown of her marriage An award-winning comedian is being sued for Â£30,000 by her ex-husband after using material about their marriage in a show at the Edinburgh Fringe. Louise Beamont, whose stage name is Reay, has been accused by Thomas Reay of defamation and breach of privacy. It follows her 2017 show called Hard Mode about freedom of speech, which was later performed in London. Mr Reay is also understood to be seeking legal costs and an injunction against Ms Beamont. The pair married in 2013, but separated before she wrote the script for the performance, which mentioned her previous relationship and focuses on what would happen if the BBC came under the control of the Chinese government. Ms Beamont has now set up a fundraising page to pay for her defence of the legal action, which she says could bankrupt her. On the Gofundme page, the comedian wrote: ""During that show, I referred to my husband a couple of times - perhaps two minutes' worth of reference in a 50-minute show. ""The main gist of those references was to tell the audience how sad I was that my marriage had broken down recently. ""He is seeking Â£30,000 damages, his legal costs (which I can only assume will be massive) and an injunction stopping me from publishing statements about him."" Louise Reay performed her show at the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2017 Ms Beamont, who stays in London, said she would not comment on the case beyond her statement on the fundraising page because of legal reasons. She added: ""As stand-up comedians, I believe it's the very definition of our job to talk about our lives and social issues. ""So this has become a free speech issue."" However, Mr Reay's solicitors denied the action was about preventing free speech and said that her material had suggested the couple's relationship was abusive. In a statement, Taylor Hampton Solicitors Limited said: ""We have from the outset made clear to Ms Beamont that our client is not in any way seeking to restrict or 'silence' her comedy or its content, except to the very limited extent that it involves the publication of unjustified false allegations and private information relating to him. Louise Reay's show was about freedom of speech ""For an extended period last summer, following their separation, Ms Beamont repeatedly performed a comedy show which identified our client verbally and in still and moving images, contained private information about him and his relationship with Ms Beamont, and made very serious and inflammatory allegations of wrongdoing against him. ""These allegations included the entirely false suggestion that our client's relationship with Ms Beamont was an abusive one."" The solicitor said their client was ""harassed"" by the performances and that the material had caused him ""enormous distress"". Their statement added: ""No right to freedom of expression or artistic licence can extend to the publication of such seriously defamatory and false allegations, or the unjustified misuse of our client's private information.""

Two stab deaths within two hours,"This video can not be played Camden stabbings: 'Stop using knives' begs grieving mother A mother whose two sons were stabbed to death in north London within five months of each other has called for young people to stop using knives. Sadiq Adan Mohamed, 20, died after being stabbed in Malden Road, Camden, at about 22:10 GMT on Tuesday. He was one of two men stabbed to death in Camden that night. Abdikarim Hassan, 17, died in Bartholomew Road at 21:08. Mr Mohamed's mother, Fowsiya Abdi, said: ""Please I beg you, people who got a knife, children - stop please."" Abdikarim Hassan (l) and Sadiq Adan Mohamed (r) were both killed in Camden on Tuesday Another of her sons was stabbed to death - also aged 20 - in September 2017. Her sister's brother has also been killed. She said for both her sons, it was a case of ""wrong place, wrong time"", and she fears for her other children. Mr Mohamed was given first aid but died at the scene near the junction with Marsden Street. Ms Abdi had heard rumours her son had been attacked before the police confirmed it for her. The Met Police is trying to determine if the killings of both young men on Tuesday night are linked. This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Ms Abdi said: ""I'm feeling pain. I can't sleep even, I can't sleep tonight."" Earlier Mr Mohamed's family released a statement saying: ""This is now the constant theme in our community. ""We are made to believe that the police are here to protect us, but how does a mother feel her kids are protected when she has lost two in the same vicinity within months? ""We have lots of questions and need answers. Somebody has to listen to us."" The Met Police is trying to establish whether the two deaths are linked Neighbour Layla Awod said Abdikarim Hassan was on his way back home from college when he was stabbed. She said his mother saw him lying on the floor dying after being refused to pass through the police security cordon. She knew it was her son when she called his mobile phone and heard it ringing the other side of the cordon, she said. Mr Hassan's uncle, Yusuf Ahmed, said the teenager came to the UK from Somalia when he was two years old and was the eldest of six children. He was a student at Westminster College, liked playing football, and was a ""good guy"" who was ""always smiling"". Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales On a knife edge: Rising violence in London Following the deaths, additional police patrols were sent to Camden overnight and a Section 60 order - giving them powers to stop and search people - was authorised across the borough until 07:00. A police spokesperson said murder investigations had been launched but no arrests had been made and ""urgent inquiries are under way to establish the full circumstances"". Sixteen people have been stabbed to death in London since the start of 2018. Five of those were teenagers. Less than two miles away from Tuesday night's first stabbing - and only minutes earlier - a 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Aldenham Street, Camden. Paramedics took the boy to a central London hospital with non life-threatening injuries. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of GBH with intent, but has since been released. No further action will be taken against him. Camden Police were called to another stabbing on Tuesday afternoon where a man, thought to be in his 40s, was attacked in Kilburn High Road shortly before 15:30. He was taken to hospital by London Air Ambulance and is in a stable condition. The force has not said if either attack was linked to the two fatal stabbings. A large police cordon was set up around the road where Mr Mohamed was killed A 19-year-old man who lives near Bartholomew Road told BBC Radio London stabbings were now ""everyday behaviour for these youngsters"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""desperately saddened"" by the deaths. ""I am asking the prime minister and the home secretary to urgently meet with me to discuss how we can work together to tackle the evil of knife attacks."" Meanwhile Cressida Dick, the commissioner for the Met Police, asked all Londoners to ""think about what you can do to help us tackle this blight on our city"". She urged young Londoners to ""stop and think"" before carrying a knife. The government's Serious Violence Strategy will be published in the next few months, a Home Office spokesperson said.

Breaking|Breaking newsUS preacher Billy Graham diesUS evangelist Billy Graham - one of the most influential preachers of the 20th Century - has died aged 99.2m3 minutes agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Billy Graham preached to more than 200 million people worldwide US evangelist Billy Graham - one of the most influential preachers of the 20th Century - has died aged 99. He died at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, a spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said. In a 60-year career, he is estimated to have preached to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Former presidents are among the many who have been paying tribute. President Trump called him ""great"" and a ""very special man"". After becoming one of the best-known promoters of Christianity in the US, Graham embarked on his global mission with an event in London in 1954. Graham reached millions of worshippers through TV - the first to use the medium to convey the Christian message on such a scale. Billy Graham: The man dubbed God's Ambassador Born in 1918 and raised on his family's dairy farm in Charlotte, North Carolina, Billy Graham became a committed Christian at the age of 16 after hearing a travelling evangelist. He was ordained a minister in 1939, aged 21. Graham's public profile was raised in the United States when he held a two-month ministry in a giant tent in Los Angeles in 1949. Preaching in Paris in 1986 His global mission took him to all corners of the world including Nigeria and communist North Korea. An early sermon outside the US took place before 12,000 worshippers in 1954 in Harringay Arena, London. At first ambivalent about the civil rights movement in the US, he became more sympathetic in the 1950s, preaching to racially integrated congregations. Six things Billy Graham believed His fiery delivery became more measured with advancing years and controversy surrounding the techniques of mass evangelism. Graham avoided the scandals - sexual and financial -  which dogged some contemporary televangelists through the decades. A social conservative, he opposed same-sex marriage and abortion. Graham preached his final revival meeting in New York in 2005 at the age of 86. As the end of his life approached, he said: ""I know that soon my life will be over.

UK singer Sir Cliff Richard, who announced he had become Christian at a Billy Graham event in London in 1966, said the world had lost someone special. ""Dr Billy Graham was the most honourable and honest of men.  His faith was obvious and I found him inspiring to be with,"" the pop singer said. ""His rallies were always moving and enlightening and he presented a 'hope' to many who didn't know that one existed."" Billy Graham was close to US presidents from Harry Truman, through Richard Nixon to Barack Obama. He played golf with Gerald Ford and went on holiday with George H W Bush.

Syria enclave crisis 'catastrophic',"This video can not be played Young children have been found buried in the rubble A doctor working in the Syrian rebel enclave of the Eastern Ghouta says the situation is ""catastrophic"" - and he believes the international community has abandoned the people living there. ""We don't have anything - no food, no medicine, no shelter,"" Dr Bassam said. Activists say 45 people were killed in fresh government air strikes on Wednesday, bringing the total death toll there since Sunday to nearly 300. The Red Cross is demanding urgent humanitarian access to the region. The Syrian military says it is trying to liberate the area from terrorists - but it has also been accused of targeting civilians. The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also has a presence there. Pro-government forces, backed by Russia, intensified their efforts to retake the last major rebel stronghold on Sunday night. ""They targeted everything: shops, markets, hospitals, schools, mosques, everything,"" Dr Bassam told the BBC on Wednesday. A makeshift hospital was set up in Douma - one of the several towns under bombardment ""Maybe every minute we have 10 or 20 air strikes...I will treat someone - and after a day or two they come again, injured again."" ""Where is the international community, where is (the UN) Security Council... they abandoned us. They leave us to be killed,"" he said. The head of safety and security for the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which operates medical facilities in the Eastern Ghouta, told the BBC that 45 people had been killed and another 250 injured on Wednesday alone. Dr Ahmad Dbis said that since Sunday, ten members of medical staff and volunteers had been killed and 14 medical facilities were taken out of service, with five totally destroyed. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the total death toll since Sunday at 296. It said that barrel bombs - containers filled with explosives and shrapnel - were used in government strikes on the towns of Jisreen and Kfar Batna on Wednesday. It follows the bombardment on Tuesday of at least 10 towns and villages across the Eastern Ghouta. Syrian state television reported that at least six people living in government-controlled areas of eastern Damascus were killed earlier this week - and 28 others wounded - by shells fired from the Eastern Ghouta. The Syrian military said it carried out ""precision strikes"" on areas from which the shells were launched. Syria country profile Since Sunday, activists say nearly 300 people have died, more than 60 of which were children. At least 1,400 people have been injured, they say. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent The catastrophe in eastern Ghouta is unfolding as the war in Syria enters a new and even more dangerous phase. The international community is impotent to act, not least because key members of that community are deeply implicated in what is going on, not least Russia. Other regional players like Turkey and Iran are acting to secure their own long-term strategic interests. So too is Washington though its goals seem uncertain now that IS is defeated and the Assad regime remains in power. There is no consensus in the international community, no great leadership in evidence, and no shared sense of what Syria's future should be. Just as the international community has failed to halt the use of chemical weapons, so too it has been unable to secure humanitarian access to those at greatest risk. No. The government has allowed one humanitarian convoy into the Eastern Ghouta since late November, and there are severe shortages of food. A bundle of bread now costs close to 22 times the national average and 12% of children under five years old are said to be acutely malnourished. The Eastern Ghouta town of Hamouria has been heavily bombarded On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) joined the UN in calling for emergency humanitarian access to allow much needed aid to be delivered and the wounded to be evacuated. ""Wounded victims are dying only because they cannot be treated in time. In some areas of Ghouta, entire families have no safe place to go,"" the ICRC's Marianne Gasser said in a statement. ""On the other side of the frontline, people in Damascus are in constant fear that their children will be hit by falling mortars. This is madness and it has to stop. Civilians must not be targeted,"" she added. The UN has already called for a ceasefire. The violence in the region - designated as a ""de-escalation zone"" by Syria's main allies, Russia and Iran, as well as Turkey - is the worst since 2013, when a chemical attack killed hundreds of people, activists say. This video can not be played Father describes a 'miserable day for Eastern Ghouta' Meanwhile, pro-government fighters have been sent to the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in northern Syria to confront an offensive by Turkish troops and Syrian rebels. Turkey fired shells near the advancing columns, which, it says, forced the pro-government fighters into retreat. Afrin lies just south of the Turkish border. Turkey is trying to oust the Kurdish YPG militia, which controls the area and which has called on the Syrian military for help. Syria has denounced the Turkish offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty, while Turkey has insisted it will not back down. This video can not be played Pro-government forces waved Syrian flags as they entered Afrin, in footage posted by the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah Syrian government forces are also carrying out offensives on the rebel-held north-western province of Idlib. The UN says more than 300,000 people have been displaced by the fighting there since December.

FaceTime chat 'saves woman's life'Woman notices her sister is suffering from a stroke while they spoke on a FaceTime call.,"Opokua Kwapong says FaceTime saved her life A woman who had a stroke while on a FaceTime video call with her sister, says the technology saved her life. Opokua Kwapong, who lives alone in New York, was on a call with her sister, Adumea Sapong, in Manchester, when Mrs Sapong noticed that her elder sibling ""didn't look right"". She raised the alarm after she also noticed her sister's voice was slurred. Ms Kwapong said she had not realised how serious the situation was. The 58-year-old had woken from an afternoon nap when Mrs Sapong had called her on FaceTime, a video calling feature on iPhones. Ms Kwapong said: ""My sister looked at me and said she could see that my face didn't look right. ""She also said that I was slurring my words, but I thought she was just fussing and I didn't believe her."" Mrs Sapong said: ""When I called Opokua she said that she'd not been feeling well and had been feeling tired and was also having some difficulty walking. ""I said, 'Perhaps you need to take some aspirin.' She tried to pick up a glass of water and wasn't able to. Then I noticed on the FaceTime video call that her face was drooping. I told her she needed to hang up and immediately see a doctor. ""She thought I was making a fuss so I then conferenced in one of my other sisters, who is a doctor, and she could hear her speaking and could also tell that her speech was slurred. We both told her to call for help straightaway."" Ms Kwapong hung up the call and then dialled the emergency services. Following hospital scans, Ms Kwapong was diagnosed as having had a clot on the brain. The stroke has left her paralysed on her left side. Ms Kwapong, who works as a food scientist, said: ""There is no doubt that FaceTime saved my life. ""If my sister had not noticed that something was not right, then things could have been so different. ""Not only did technology save my life, it now also allows me to live my life. ""I rely a lot on video conferencing as I'm not able to travel as much as I did previously for my work."" Mrs Sapong said: ""You hear a lot of negative stories about the internet and technology, but I think this is an example of how technology can be a force for good. ""If it had not been for FaceTime, then we would be having a very different conversation right now."" Esmee Russell, head of prevention and campaigns at the Stroke Association, said: ""A stroke can happen to anyone, at any age, at any time - that's why it's so important that people know to act fast: it could save a life."" Strokes happen when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off by a clot (known as an ischaemic stroke), or damaged by a bleed that causes brain cells in the affected area to die (known as a haemorrhagic stroke). Facial weakness - Can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped? Arm weakness - Can the person raise both arms? Speech problems - Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say? Time to call 999 (911 in the US, 112 in Europe) - If you see any one of these signs, seek immediate medical attention.

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdictTheresa May clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit - here are the key bits of their exchanges.9m9 minutes agoUK Politics,"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. It was a noisy, boisterous session, which had the Speaker in full headmaster mode even before Mr Corbyn had got to his feet - it was the first of several interventions from John Bercow.

Mr Corbyn decided to focus on Brexit - and managed to raise a smile from the PM with his first question on David Davis's ""Mad Max"" speech, in which the Brexit secretary reassured the country life outside the EU would not be like a scene from a lawless Aussie dystopia. ""Doesn't the PM feel he (Mr Davis) could set the bar just a little bit higher?,"" asked Mr Corbyn. The PM was clearly amused by the Labour leader's joke - a rare thing indeed - but her reply was pure government boilerplate, complete with a swipe at Labour's shifting position on Brexit.

He claimed that the 62 Brexiteer Tories who sent her a letter setting what they wanted from Brexit were in favour of weakening protections.

Mr Corbyn had a go at Boris Johnson, for neglecting to mention Northern Ireland in his ""road to Brexit"" speech. He told Mrs May the government was all ""waffle and empty rhetoric"" on Brexit, adding - in a scripted quip - ""this government isn't on the road to Brexit, Mr Speaker, it's on the road to nowhere"". Mrs May hit back with her own gag - the joke writers have been working over time this week - about the allegations over Mr Corbyn's contacts with a Czech spy in the 1980s. ""Normally he stands up and asks me to sign a blank cheque, I know he likes Czechs but really that is terribly depressing,"" said the PM, to a few groans and some laughter from MPs. The Labour leader - who has dismissed the claims as ""smears"" and James Bond fantasies - feigned a yawn. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here is BBC's Parliamentary Correspondent Mark's D'Arcy's take: Well, wellâ¦ a big, if not very informative Brexit exchange between the two main protagonists at PMQs. Jeremy Corbyn mined a rich seam of quotes from ministers, producing laughs from his backbenchers, but nothing new from the prime minister. The interest in all this is less what was said and more whether it signals an evolution in Labour's Brexit strategy. The questions reflected Labour's long-standing rhetoric about a ""jobs-first Brexit."" But the time is coming when they will have to take a position on, for example, UK membership of ""a customs union,"" after Brexit. So were these questions an attempt to start reaching out to Europhile Tory backbenchers who might rebel on forthcoming amendments to the Trade Bill? Perhaps the divisions among Tory MPs have finally proved an irresistible target. Elsewhere the PM has being trying to find positive notes to strike - and she was prepared to engage in a positive way with questions from Labour's Chris Bryant on rehabilitation for spinal injuries and the Conservative Sir Mike Penning on the safety of medical treatments. The session also saw a series of long and vehement rebukes to noisy MPs from Mr Speaker - and a couple of direct slap-downs to SNP MPs. This is one of the most Speaker-intensive PMQs for quite a while, and it looks as if, in the wake of the various concerns about bullying in Westminster, John Bercow has decided to launch a bit of a clampdown, Allow Twitter content?

Government loses clean air court caseCampaigners win a third High Court victory over the UK government's plans to tackle air pollution.,"Campaigners have won a third High Court victory over the UK government's plans to tackle air pollution. The judge in the case said the government plan was ""unlawful"" and that more action was needed in 45 English local authority areas. He said ministers had to ensure that in each of the areas, steps were taken to comply with the law as soon as possible. The case was brought by ClientEarth, a group of activist lawyers. Mr Justice Garnham said: ""Because the obligation is zone-specific, the fact that each of the 45 local authority areas will achieve compliance in any event by 2021 is of no immediate significance. ""The Environment Secretary must ensure that, in each of the 45 areas, steps are taken to achieve compliance as soon as possible, by the quickest route possible and by a means that makes that outcome likely."" He added: ""In effect, these local authorities are being urged and encouraged to come up with proposals to improve air quality over the next three years, but are not being required to do so. In my judgment, that sort of exhortation is not sufficient."" Consumer products 'affecting air quality' London hits annual air quality limit Pollution hotspots: Check your area As a result of previous rulings, the government drew up new plans for reducing nitrogen dioxide pollution, much of which comes from vehicles, to within legal limits. Keep away from the busiest roads - pollution concentrates around the heaviest traffic Use side roads - these are cleaner because there is so much less traffic Watch out for hotspots of dirty air - engines are often left running in stationary traffic. This can create ""urban canyons"" of pollution, particularly around traffic lights, so stand back after pushing the button before crossing the road When walking up a hill always stick to the side where traffic is flowing down the hill, away from the brunt of the fumes. This will always be the cleaner alternative Basic face-masks are not worth the hassle - these trap dust but little else, while heavy-duty versions are cumbersome. Scientists recommend avoiding busy roads instead ClientEarth's latest case was brought against the Environment Secretary and the Transport Secretary, while a claim against the Welsh Government was discontinued afterit agreed to work with the campaigning group on new proposals. A government spokesperson said: ""We are pleased that the judge dismissed two of the three complaints. The judge found that our modelling is compliant and that our approach to areas with major air quality problems is 'sensible, rational and lawful'. ""The court has also asked us to go further in areas with less severe air quality problems. We had previously considered that it was sufficient to take a pragmatic, less formal approach to such areas. However, in view of the court's judgment, we are happy to take a more formal line with them. ""We have already delivered significant improvements in air quality since 2010 and we will continue to implement our Â£3.5bn air quality plan."" A raft of recent studies and reports have linked air pollution to heart disease and lung problems, including asthma. The Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Paediatrics and Child Health say that outdoor air pollution is contributing to some 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK.

The Commons gave the Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill a second reading, without a vote. It will now move on to detailed scrutiny at 'committee stage'. The Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said the government would refer to the legislation as ""Max's law"" after Max Johnson, a 10-year-old boy needing a heart transplant who's been campaigning for a change in the law. As the bill went through, Geoffrey Robinson, who initiated the legislation, called it a ""great moment"". MPs also approved another bill at 'second reading' stage, which would remove the time limit on British citizens abroad voting in general elections, currently set at 15 years.

Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament Shadow minister Cat Smith says the issue ""must be considered properly"". She says it's ""deeply concerning"" that this measure, a Conservative Party manifesto commitment, has been brought forward as a private member's bill. She adds that it shows ""disrespect"" to the political process to bring forward the change this way. She goes on to list a series of other problems with the electoral system and the number of unregistered voters in the UK. She also asks whether more overseas voters would be a burden on ""overstretched"" election staff. She manages to speak for almost 20 minutes before Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a supporter of the bill, calls for a closure motion to end debate, which is put to a division. In confusing scenes, the division is then cancelled due to a lack of tellers for the ""no"" side. The bill then passes to committee stage unopposed. Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith says the government is ""interested in making it easier for people to vote"" and that ""participation in our democracy is a fundamental part of being British"". She says it's now ""easier to stay in touch"" with what's going on in Britain due to changes in technology, which is why the issue of the 15-year limit on expat voting needs to be looked at again. Extending votes to all expats with no time limit is a Conservative Party manifesto promise from the 2017 election. Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament Conservative backbencher Sir Roger Gale delivers something of a dressing down to Sandy Martin. He raisesHarry Shindler, a 97 year old veteran of World War 2who lives in Italy and has campaigned for the right of UK citizens abroad to vote, eschewing the chance to take Italian citizenship in order to do so. He asks Sandy Martin to meet Mr Shindler to explain to him why he, as a proud Briton, shouldn't be allowed to vote. ""I want Harry Shindler and those millions of expats like him, who are proudly British, who take a keen interest, who regard it as their mother country...I want them to have that right"", he says. Lib Dem Layla Moran also speaks in support. She says British people abroad are ""every bit as British as the people in this room"" and they have ""lost their voice"" because of ""outdated"" notions of what it is to be British.

Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour's Sandy Martin has spoken in the debate for over 45 minutes to oppose it. He says the Conservative Party supported extending votes for citizens abroad in the 2017 manifesto but suggests it has been downgraded to a private member's bill because they find it ""embarrassing"" to extend the vote to people who have ""chosen not to pay their taxes in this country"". He says ""15 years is actually a very reasonable amount of time"" for people to be able to vote once they've left the UK. He ends admitting that he would ""love to go on [speaking] for 15 years, but I have pretty much run out of things to say"" before suggesting there are ""powerful and wealthy people...desperate"" for the ""right to vote forever more"" which is why it should be opposed. Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament The bill is being introduced by a Conservative Glyn Davies, who says there are benefits to ensuring that British people living overseas retain a ""close involvement"" in what happens in the UK. ""The last thing we need to do is make their involvement in this country less relevant,"" he says. He says British citizens living overseas have an ""ongoing legitimate interest"" in the public affairs of the UK. Many are working abroad and will eventually return home when they retire. He says the rationale for stopping British people overseas from voting is that after  a certain period of time they ""lose connection"" with their country. Glyn Davies says that has changed because Facebook and Skype, for example, have made it easy to ""connect across the world"". Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament MPs are now debating the second bill of the day, the Overseas Electors Bill. It is a private memberâs bill
introduced by the Conservative MP Glyn Davies. The bill would end the 15 year time limit on voters
continuing to participate in UK elections after they leave the UK. If the bill
passes British citizens can continue to vote in the constituency in which they last
resided for as long as they live outside the United Kingdom. Until 1985 citizens living outside the UK couldnât vote at
all, and since legislation to allow votes was brought in the limit has gone
from five years after leaving, up to 20 years and down to 15 years in 2002. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Geoffrey Robinson, who introduced the bill, winds up the debate, saying it's been ""the House at it's best"". He calls it a ""great moment"" as the bill is passed without a division. The Organ Donation (Deemed Consent Bill) will now move on to committee stage. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Bringing the debate to a close, the Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price says the government is supporting the bill and she wants to emphasise the personal support of the Prime Minister Theresa May for the measure. She says the government will refer to the bill as ""Max's law"" after Max Johnson, a 10-year-old boy in need of a heart transplant who has been campaigning for the change. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill Luke Pollard tells MPs that the debate has inspired him to sign up as a full organ donor. The Labour MP admits that he was previously ""squeamish"" about giving his eyes. ""However i was convinced by the arguments,"" he says, adding that it only took two minutes to sign up. ""It was really simple to do,"" he says. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson says it's been an ""excellent debate"" and thanks a number of MPs who have taken part. She also pays tribute to the Daily Mirror newspaper, for raising awareness with a campaign on organ donation, as well as the ITV soap Coronation Street, which has had a high profile storyline about an organ transplant. The Labour Party is supporting today's bill. She says one donor ""can save nine people"". Addressing concerns about the opt-out policy's lack of impact in Wales, she says it ""took ten years"" from implementation in Spain to any significant rise in organ donation, and says Spain is now a ""world leader"" in the field.

Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour's Virendra Sharma is raising the difficulty black and minority ethnic patients have getting donated organs. He says that while non-white people make up a quarter of those on transplant waiting lists, only 6% of people signed up on the donors register are from BME backgrounds. Although BME patients can receive organs from white donors, they are far more likely to find a suitable match among non-white donors. BME families are also less likely to consent to their loved ones donating their organs after death. Mr Sharma says moving to an ""opt in"" system could ""save thousands of lives each year"".

Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour's Julie Elliott says she has always been a supporter of organ donation, but wants to tell the story of her 36-year-old daughter Rebecca, who suddenly developed chronic kidney disease. After a period of serious illness she has returned to work but undergoes dialysis for eight hours every night, until she can get a transplant. She says parents have a ""natural instinct to make things better for your children"" and talks about the frustration of not being able to fix something for your child. ""What I can do from my privileged position"", she says, is raise awareness of organ donation and support the bill. She says she has a message for donors' families ""as hopefully one day the family member of a recipient"" that their ""selfless actions"" amid a time of great pain ""to save the lives of people you don't know, is such a wonderful thing that everyone should be grateful for"". Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament A Conservative, Nigel Huddleston calls it a ""tragedy"" that 456 adults and 14 children lost their lives last year while on the organ donation list. Backing the bill, he says it's about removing obstructions to donating while allowing anyone who does not want to donate to opt out. He says it's important, though, not to attach stigma to people who want to opt out. The Conservative Philip Davies, known for objecting to private members' bill, intervenes with a declaration: ""I have no intention of blocking the bill today."" But he wonders if his Conservative colleague ""shares his misgivings about the state presuming that people have consented to something when actually they haven't."" In reply, Nigel Huddleton says: ""This is a matter of life and death we are talking about here."" Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Conservative backbencher Dame Cheryl Gillan says she supports the bill and is experiencing ""deja vu"". ""I went through all these arguments back in 2010"" she says, when she was Welsh Secretary and the Welsh Government was preparing to introduce the opt-out system there, which it eventually did in 2013 She says that she has changed her mind on the issue, due to a family friend who has the condition primary sclerosing cholangitis, a liver disease. She says the shortage of available organs is such that you need to be experiencing cirrhosis to get a transplant but, by that time, you might be too ill to receive one. She says the the legislation ""will not be enough in itself but it will do absolutely no harm"" to people like her family friend. She says it must be accompanied by campaigns to encourage people to register and donate. Â© 2025 BBC.

Government loses clean air court case,"Campaigners have won a third High Court victory over the UK government's plans to tackle air pollution. The judge in the case said the government plan was ""unlawful"" and that more action was needed in 45 English local authority areas. He said ministers had to ensure that in each of the areas, steps were taken to comply with the law as soon as possible. The case was brought by ClientEarth, a group of activist lawyers. Mr Justice Garnham said: ""Because the obligation is zone-specific, the fact that each of the 45 local authority areas will achieve compliance in any event by 2021 is of no immediate significance. ""The Environment Secretary must ensure that, in each of the 45 areas, steps are taken to achieve compliance as soon as possible, by the quickest route possible and by a means that makes that outcome likely."" He added: ""In effect, these local authorities are being urged and encouraged to come up with proposals to improve air quality over the next three years, but are not being required to do so. In my judgment, that sort of exhortation is not sufficient."" Consumer products 'affecting air quality' London hits annual air quality limit Pollution hotspots: Check your area As a result of previous rulings, the government drew up new plans for reducing nitrogen dioxide pollution, much of which comes from vehicles, to within legal limits. Keep away from the busiest roads - pollution concentrates around the heaviest traffic Use side roads - these are cleaner because there is so much less traffic Watch out for hotspots of dirty air - engines are often left running in stationary traffic. This can create ""urban canyons"" of pollution, particularly around traffic lights, so stand back after pushing the button before crossing the road When walking up a hill always stick to the side where traffic is flowing down the hill, away from the brunt of the fumes. This will always be the cleaner alternative Basic face-masks are not worth the hassle - these trap dust but little else, while heavy-duty versions are cumbersome. Scientists recommend avoiding busy roads instead ClientEarth's latest case was brought against the Environment Secretary and the Transport Secretary, while a claim against the Welsh Government was discontinued afterit agreed to work with the campaigning group on new proposals. A government spokesperson said: ""We are pleased that the judge dismissed two of the three complaints. The judge found that our modelling is compliant and that our approach to areas with major air quality problems is 'sensible, rational and lawful'. ""The court has also asked us to go further in areas with less severe air quality problems. We had previously considered that it was sufficient to take a pragmatic, less formal approach to such areas. However, in view of the court's judgment, we are happy to take a more formal line with them. ""We have already delivered significant improvements in air quality since 2010 and we will continue to implement our Â£3.5bn air quality plan."" A raft of recent studies and reports have linked air pollution to heart disease and lung problems, including asthma. The Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Paediatrics and Child Health say that outdoor air pollution is contributing to some 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK.

FaceTime chat 'saves woman's life',"Opokua Kwapong says FaceTime saved her life A woman who had a stroke while on a FaceTime video call with her sister, says the technology saved her life. Opokua Kwapong, who lives alone in New York, was on a call with her sister, Adumea Sapong, in Manchester, when Mrs Sapong noticed that her elder sibling ""didn't look right"". She raised the alarm after she also noticed her sister's voice was slurred. Ms Kwapong said she had not realised how serious the situation was. The 58-year-old had woken from an afternoon nap when Mrs Sapong had called her on FaceTime, a video calling feature on iPhones. Ms Kwapong said: ""My sister looked at me and said she could see that my face didn't look right. ""She also said that I was slurring my words, but I thought she was just fussing and I didn't believe her."" Mrs Sapong said: ""When I called Opokua she said that she'd not been feeling well and had been feeling tired and was also having some difficulty walking. ""I said, 'Perhaps you need to take some aspirin.' She tried to pick up a glass of water and wasn't able to. Then I noticed on the FaceTime video call that her face was drooping. I told her she needed to hang up and immediately see a doctor. ""She thought I was making a fuss so I then conferenced in one of my other sisters, who is a doctor, and she could hear her speaking and could also tell that her speech was slurred. We both told her to call for help straightaway."" Ms Kwapong hung up the call and then dialled the emergency services. Following hospital scans, Ms Kwapong was diagnosed as having had a clot on the brain. The stroke has left her paralysed on her left side. Ms Kwapong, who works as a food scientist, said: ""There is no doubt that FaceTime saved my life. ""If my sister had not noticed that something was not right, then things could have been so different. ""Not only did technology save my life, it now also allows me to live my life. ""I rely a lot on video conferencing as I'm not able to travel as much as I did previously for my work."" Mrs Sapong said: ""You hear a lot of negative stories about the internet and technology, but I think this is an example of how technology can be a force for good. ""If it had not been for FaceTime, then we would be having a very different conversation right now."" Esmee Russell, head of prevention and campaigns at the Stroke Association, said: ""A stroke can happen to anyone, at any age, at any time - that's why it's so important that people know to act fast: it could save a life."" Strokes happen when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off by a clot (known as an ischaemic stroke), or damaged by a bleed that causes brain cells in the affected area to die (known as a haemorrhagic stroke). Facial weakness - Can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped? Arm weakness - Can the person raise both arms? Speech problems - Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say? Time to call 999 (911 in the US, 112 in Europe) - If you see any one of these signs, seek immediate medical attention.

Ex-charity boss sent inappropriate texts,"A former chief executive of Save the Children faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff before leaving the charity, the BBC has learned. Justin Forsyth was accused of sending inappropriate texts and commenting on what young female staff were wearing. Mr Forsyth said he had ""apologised unreservedly"" to the three workers. It comes as Oxfam and Save the Children haveseparately been quizzed by MPs about sexual misconduct by workers. Although not accused of sexual misconduct, Mr Forsyth, who is now deputy executive director at Unicef., said he had had ""unsuitable and thoughtless conversations"" with staff. He said the concerns were handled through a process of mediation and no formal complaints were made. He added he thought the issue had been closed ""many years ago"". Save the Children said it had commissioned ""a root and branch review of the organisational culture"" at the charity ""addressing any behavioural challenges among senior leadership"". The charity said concerns were raised about ""inappropriate behaviour and comments"" by Mr Forsyth in 2015. It said two trustees carried out separate investigations into a total of three complaints made by female employees. ""Both reviews resulted in unreserved apologies from the CEO. All the parties agreed to this and the former CEO apologised to the women in question. At that time the matters were closed."" A Unicef spokesman said: ""We welcome Mr Forsyth's decision to come forward and acknowledge past mistakes. ""We are discussing this matter with Mr Forsyth and his former employer so we can take appropriate action."" An investigation by BBC Radio 4's PM programme, found the complaints against Mr Forsyth included women receiving a series of inappropriate texts, and comments on how they looked, what they were wearing and how he felt about them. If they did not respond, Mr Forsyth would follow up his messages with an email, asking if they had seen the text. If they still did not respond, he would ask someone to send them to him for a ""quick word"". A woman who complained at the time said the longer she was at the charity the more she was exposed to ""some of the bravado"". ""That is both at head office and in the field,"" she said. ""Other women tell you to watch out for certain senior people. You start to hear rumours about some of the directors but of course until it happens to you - which it did - you don't really appreciate how hard it is to deal with."" She said it did not seem the complaints were being treated with the ""appropriate degree of seriousness"" and it was ""troubling"" that the then chairman of the charity's board of trustees, Sir Alan Parker, became involved. Sir Alan is the founder of the PR firm Brunswick. Justin Forsyth with Samantha Cameron in Lebanon Another former employee of Save the Children told the BBC: ""The centre of this crisis was not in Haiti or Chad. It was in London. ""Young professional women at Save the Children felt unsafe. They felt that their careers could depend on ensuring they responded to unwanted attention and to bullying."" In his statement, Mr Forsyth said he had made ""some personal mistakes during my time at Save the Children"". ""I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I now know caused offence and hurt. ""When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved. ""My apologies were accepted and I had thought the issue closed many years ago."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The allegations come after Brendan Cox - the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox - quit two charities he set up in memory of his wifeamid allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The Charity Commission said it had ""extensive regulatory engagement"" with Save the Children after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour were made against Mr Cox and Mr Forsyth between 2015-16. A spokeswoman added that the body received an independent review ""commissioned by trustees"", and ""received direct confirmation and assurance from trustees"" that recommendations made to the charity ""were being urgently acted upon"".

"AI ripe for exploitation, experts warn","The threat of AI is real and many of the technologies are already developed, warn 26 leading experts Drones turned into missiles, fake videos manipulating public opinion and automated hacking are just three of the threats from artificial intelligence in the wrong hands, experts have said. The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence report,externalwarns that AI is ripe for exploitation by rogue states, criminals and terrorists. Those designing AI systems need to do more to mitigate possible misuses of their technology, the authors said. And governments must consider new laws. The report calls for: Policy-makers and technical researchers to work together to understand and prepare for the malicious use of AI A realisation that, while AI has many positive applications, it is a dual-use technology and AI researchers and engineers should be mindful of and proactive about the potential for its misuse Best practices that can and should be learned from disciplines with a longer history of handling dual use risks, such as computer security An active expansion of the range of stakeholders engaging with, preventing and mitigating the risks of malicious use of AI Speaking to the BBC, Shahar Avin, from Cambridge University's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, explained that the report concentrated on areas of AI that were available now or likely to be available within five years, rather than looking to the distant future. Particularly worrying is the new area of reinforcement learning where AIs are trained to superhuman levels of intelligence without human examples or guidance. He outlined some of the scenarios where AI could turn ""rogue"" in the near future: Technologies such as AlphaGo - an AI developed by Google's DeepMind and able to outwit human Go players - could be used by hackers to find patterns in data and new exploits in code A malicious individual could buy a drone and train it with facial recognition software to target a certain individual Bots could be automated or ""fake"" lifelike videos for political manipulation Hackers could use speech synthesis to impersonate targets Miles Brundage, research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute, said: ""AI will alter the landscape of risk for citizens, organisations and states - whether it's criminals training machines to hack or 'phish' at human levels of performance or privacy-eliminating surveillance, profiling and repression - the full range of impacts on security is vast. ""It is often the case that AI systems don't merely reach human levels of performance but significantly surpass it. ""It is troubling, but necessary, to consider the implications of superhuman hacking, surveillance, persuasion, and physical target identification, as well as AI capabilities that are subhuman but nevertheless much more scalable than human labour."" Dr SeÃ¡n Ã hÃigeartaigh, executive director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and one of the co-authors, added: ""Artificial intelligence is a game changer and this report has imagined what the world could look like in the next five to 10 years. ""We live in a world that could become fraught with day-to-day hazards from the misuse of AI and we need to take ownership of the problems - because the risks are real. ""There are choices that we need to make now, and our report is a call to action for governments, institutions and individuals across the globe. ""For many decades hype outstripped fact in terms of AI and machine learning. No longer. This report looks at the practices that just don't work anymore - and suggests broad approaches that might help: for example, how to design software and hardware to make it less hackable - and what type of laws and international regulations might work in tandem with this."" The 100-page report identified three areas - digital, physical and political - in which the malicious use of AI is most likely to be exploited. Contributors included OpenAI, a non-profit research firm, digital rights group The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for a New American Security, a national security think-tank.

The Commons gave the Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill a second reading, without a vote. It will now move on to detailed scrutiny at 'committee stage'. The Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said the government would refer to the legislation as ""Max's law"" after Max Johnson, a 10-year-old boy needing a heart transplant who's been campaigning for a change in the law. As the bill went through, Geoffrey Robinson, who initiated the legislation, called it a ""great moment"". MPs also approved another bill at 'second reading' stage, which would remove the time limit on British citizens abroad voting in general elections, currently set at 15 years. That bill too will now pass on to committee stage. BBC parliamentary correspondent tweets:  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament Shadow minister Cat Smith says the issue ""must be considered properly"". She says it's ""deeply concerning"" that this measure, a Conservative Party manifesto commitment, has been brought forward as a private member's bill. She adds that it shows ""disrespect"" to the political process to bring forward the change this way. She goes on to list a series of other problems with the electoral system and the number of unregistered voters in the UK. She also asks whether more overseas voters would be a burden on ""overstretched"" election staff. She manages to speak for almost 20 minutes before Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a supporter of the bill, calls for a closure motion to end debate, which is put to a division. In confusing scenes, the division is then cancelled due to a lack of tellers for the ""no"" side. The bill then passes to committee stage unopposed. Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith says the government is ""interested in making it easier for people to vote"" and that ""participation in our democracy is a fundamental part of being British"". She says it's now ""easier to stay in touch"" with what's going on in Britain due to changes in technology, which is why the issue of the 15-year limit on expat voting needs to be looked at again. Extending votes to all expats with no time limit is a Conservative Party manifesto promise from the 2017 election. Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament Conservative backbencher Sir Roger Gale delivers something of a dressing down to Sandy Martin. He raisesHarry Shindler, a 97 year old veteran of World War 2who lives in Italy and has campaigned for the right of UK citizens abroad to vote, eschewing the chance to take Italian citizenship in order to do so. He asks Sandy Martin to meet Mr Shindler to explain to him why he, as a proud Briton, shouldn't be allowed to vote. ""I want Harry Shindler and those millions of expats like him, who are proudly British, who take a keen interest, who regard it as their mother country...I want them to have that right"", he says. Lib Dem Layla Moran also speaks in support. She says British people abroad are ""every bit as British as the people in this room"" and they have ""lost their voice"" because of ""outdated"" notions of what it is to be British.

Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour's Sandy Martin has spoken in the debate for over 45 minutes to oppose it. He says the Conservative Party supported extending votes for citizens abroad in the 2017 manifesto but suggests it has been downgraded to a private member's bill because they find it ""embarrassing"" to extend the vote to people who have ""chosen not to pay their taxes in this country"". He says ""15 years is actually a very reasonable amount of time"" for people to be able to vote once they've left the UK. He ends admitting that he would ""love to go on [speaking] for 15 years, but I have pretty much run out of things to say"" before suggesting there are ""powerful and wealthy people...desperate"" for the ""right to vote forever more"" which is why it should be opposed. Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament The bill is being introduced by a Conservative Glyn Davies, who says there are benefits to ensuring that British people living overseas retain a ""close involvement"" in what happens in the UK. ""The last thing we need to do is make their involvement in this country less relevant,"" he says. He says British citizens living overseas have an ""ongoing legitimate interest"" in the public affairs of the UK. Many are working abroad and will eventually return home when they retire. He says the rationale for stopping British people overseas from voting is that after  a certain period of time they ""lose connection"" with their country. Glyn Davies says that has changed because Facebook and Skype, for example, have made it easy to ""connect across the world"". Overseas Electors Bill House of CommonsParliament MPs are now debating the second bill of the day, the Overseas Electors Bill. It is a private memberâs bill
introduced by the Conservative MP Glyn Davies. The bill would end the 15 year time limit on voters
continuing to participate in UK elections after they leave the UK. If the bill
passes British citizens can continue to vote in the constituency in which they last
resided for as long as they live outside the United Kingdom. Until 1985 citizens living outside the UK couldnât vote at
all, and since legislation to allow votes was brought in the limit has gone
from five years after leaving, up to 20 years and down to 15 years in 2002. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Geoffrey Robinson, who introduced the bill, winds up the debate, saying it's been ""the House at it's best"". He calls it a ""great moment"" as the bill is passed without a division. The Organ Donation (Deemed Consent Bill) will now move on to committee stage. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Bringing the debate to a close, the Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price says the government is supporting the bill and she wants to emphasise the personal support of the Prime Minister Theresa May for the measure. She says the government will refer to the bill as ""Max's law"" after Max Johnson, a 10-year-old boy in need of a heart transplant who has been campaigning for the change. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill Luke Pollard tells MPs that the debate has inspired him to sign up as a full organ donor. The Labour MP admits that he was previously ""squeamish"" about giving his eyes. ""However i was convinced by the arguments,"" he says, adding that it only took two minutes to sign up. ""It was really simple to do,"" he says. Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson says it's been an ""excellent debate"" and thanks a number of MPs who have taken part. She also pays tribute to the Daily Mirror newspaper, for raising awareness with a campaign on organ donation, as well as the ITV soap Coronation Street, which has had a high profile storyline about an organ transplant. The Labour Party is supporting today's bill. She says one donor ""can save nine people"". Addressing concerns about the opt-out policy's lack of impact in Wales, she says it ""took ten years"" from implementation in Spain to any significant rise in organ donation, and says Spain is now a ""world leader"" in the field.

Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour's Virendra Sharma is raising the difficulty black and minority ethnic patients have getting donated organs. He says that while non-white people make up a quarter of those on transplant waiting lists, only 6% of people signed up on the donors register are from BME backgrounds. Although BME patients can receive organs from white donors, they are far more likely to find a suitable match among non-white donors. BME families are also less likely to consent to their loved ones donating their organs after death. Mr Sharma says moving to an ""opt in"" system could ""save thousands of lives each year"".

Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour's Julie Elliott says she has always been a supporter of organ donation, but wants to tell the story of her 36-year-old daughter Rebecca, who suddenly developed chronic kidney disease. After a period of serious illness she has returned to work but undergoes dialysis for eight hours every night, until she can get a transplant. She says parents have a ""natural instinct to make things better for your children"" and talks about the frustration of not being able to fix something for your child. ""What I can do from my privileged position"", she says, is raise awareness of organ donation and support the bill. She says she has a message for donors' families ""as hopefully one day the family member of a recipient"" that their ""selfless actions"" amid a time of great pain ""to save the lives of people you don't know, is such a wonderful thing that everyone should be grateful for"". Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament A Conservative, Nigel Huddleston calls it a ""tragedy"" that 456 adults and 14 children lost their lives last year while on the organ donation list. Backing the bill, he says it's about removing obstructions to donating while allowing anyone who does not want to donate to opt out. He says it's important, though, not to attach stigma to people who want to opt out. The Conservative Philip Davies, known for objecting to private members' bill, intervenes with a declaration: ""I have no intention of blocking the bill today."" But he wonders if his Conservative colleague ""shares his misgivings about the state presuming that people have consented to something when actually they haven't."" In reply, Nigel Huddleton says: ""This is a matter of life and death we are talking about here."" Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill House of CommonsParliament Conservative backbencher Dame Cheryl Gillan says she supports the bill and is experiencing ""deja vu"". ""I went through all these arguments back in 2010"" she says, when she was Welsh Secretary and the Welsh Government was preparing to introduce the opt-out system there, which it eventually did in 2013 She says that she has changed her mind on the issue, due to a family friend who has the condition primary sclerosing cholangitis, a liver disease. She says the shortage of available organs is such that you need to be experiencing cirrhosis to get a transplant but, by that time, you might be too ill to receive one. She says the the legislation ""will not be enough in itself but it will do absolutely no harm"" to people like her family friend. She says it must be accompanied by campaigns to encourage people to register and donate. Â© 2025 BBC.

Lloyds hails 'landmark' year,"Lloyds Banking Group has reported strong full year profits in its first year as a fully private enterprise. Pre-tax profit for 2017 was Â£5.3bn, 24% higher than a year earlier, and the bank's highest profit since 2006. Chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio said it had been ""a landmark year"", and announced that the bank  planned to spend up to Â£1bn buying back shares. The government sold its last shares in Lloyds in May, eight years after pumping in Â£20bn to save it. Lloyds, Britain's biggest mortgage provider, also said it would invest Â£3bn in new technology and staff as part of a three-year plan focused on expanding its digital services. HSBC profits jump to $17.2bn on Asia growth Lloyds to cut more than 900 jobs ""Our customers want better products they want more convenience. They want safer products,"" Mr Horta Osorio told BBC Radio 4. He said the bank planned to lend an additional Â£6bn to small businesses in the UK over the next three years and provide Â£10bn more to first time buyers. The increased investment is part of Lloyd's efforts to adapt to changing consumer banking habits. The bank also said it had put aside an extra Â£600m in the fourth quarter of last year to pay compensation over mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) claims. This takes the bank's total PPI costs for the year to Â£1.6bn. Mr Horta Osorio has overseen a programme of bank branch closures, including job losses, since he took over in 2011. At that time the government still held a 43% stake in the bank. Mr Horta Osorio said last year had marked a step-change for the group after the government sold its last remaining shareholding. ""We were, last year, able to give all of tax-payers' money back and some more, which was a big moment of pride for all at Lloyds Banking Group."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the results were ""slightly below expectations"", but said most measures showed ""strong improvement"". ""With the shackles of the government share stake now removed, Lloyds has been able to concentrate fully on financial growth and repair,"" he added. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said: ""Lloyds is increasingly looking like a bank firing on nearly all its cylinders. Guidance for the year ahead and beyond looks very robust."" Lloyds has already announced there will be more than 900 job losses as the group focuses away from High Street branches and towards online services. But the bank said it would also be creating new posts. Lloyds Banking Group includes Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows. Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown said investors were likely to welcome these results. ""The combination of the dividend and the new share buyback scheme means shareholders are getting a pretty tasty 6% return on their investment,"" he said.

"Pro-Brexit Tories set out demandsTory group urges clean break with the EU - Labour says the PM is too ""weak"" to stand up to them.3h3 hours agoUK PoliticsComments","More than 60 Brexit-supporting Tory MPs have written to Theresa May to insist the UK make a clean break with the EU. The MPs say the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"". The letter was sent by the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg. Opposition critics accused the PM of being ""too weak"" to confront the ""hard Brexiteers"" in her own party. What is the European Research Group? Post-Brexit UK won't be like Mad Max, says David Davis The letter, signed by 62 MPs including several ex-ministers and former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, includes a number of ""suggestions"" for securing a successful Brexit. It backs the PM's vision for Brexit, as set out in herLancaster House speech,externalin January 2017, including leaving the customs union and single market. But it says she ""must"" ensure the UK can change its laws without authorisation from the EU from the moment it leaves in March 2019. The MPs also insist the UK must be ""free to start its own trade negotiations"" during the planned two-year transition period that would kick in after Brexit day. And it urges the UK government to resist EU efforts to set the timetable for Brexit negotiations. ""The UK should negotiate as an equal partner. Ministers may not want or be able to accept the EU's timing and mandates as fixed, and should be able to set out alternative terms including, for example, building an agreement based on our World Trade Organisation membership instead,"" says the letter. It comes ahead of a crunch cabinet meeting on Thursday to thrash out an agreement on how to proceed in negotiations with the EU. The government is also set to publish its its response to the EU's proposals for how the two-year transition period after Brexit should work later on Wednesday. The UK wants a mechanism to object to new European legislation introduced during the implementation phase. The prime minister had suggested that EU nationals who arrive during the transition period should not have the right to settle permanently in the UK. Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg With no majority, she knows that she needs to keep the dozens and dozens of Brexit-backing Tory MPs broadly with her for her own government's survival. They have accepted some shifts from the government that they used to find intolerable - a Brexit departure lounge of a couple of years rather than a sharp exit, and a bill of tens of billions. But they are not, as this letter makes clear, up for swallowing many more compromises when it comes to getting trade deals done immediately after Brexit. Read Laura's full blog Labour claimed the MPs' letter ""exposes the deep divisions that run through the heart of this Tory government"". Shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield  said: ""It is clearer than ever that Theresa May cannot deliver the Brexit deal Britain needs. ""She is too weak to face down the fanatics in her own party and to deliver a final deal that protects jobs and the economy."" The SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""It is clear from this list of demands that the Tories don't want either a transition deal or a âfuture relationship with the EU."" Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said it appeared the prime minister had ""one arm tied behind her back by the Tory militants who are now nakedly acting like a party within a party"". In other Brexit news, a group of pro-Leave economists claim to have ""comprehensively debunked"" leaked government forecasts predicting a hit to the UK economy outside the EU. The Whitehall forecasts - which predicted lower growth across the UK as a result of Brexit - sparked a row when they emerged last month. Now Economists for Free Trade have published their ""alternative"" calculations, saying the civil servants' version ignored what they said were the ""clear objectives"" set out by Mrs May of free trade with Europe and the rest of the world. Using government models, this would suggest a 2% rise in GDP over 15 years, the group claimed. Mr Duncan Smith said the report ""deserves to be taken very seriously"". Mrs May is meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for talks in Downing Street and is expected to update him on Brexit progress.

Stand-up comedian sued by ex-husbandLouise Reay is being sued for comments made about her marriage during her Edinburgh Fringe show.,"Louise Reay said the comments reflected how sad she was about the breakdown of her marriage An award-winning comedian is being sued for Â£30,000 by her ex-husband after using material about their marriage in a show at the Edinburgh Fringe. Louise Beamont, whose stage name is Reay, has been accused by Thomas Reay of defamation and breach of privacy. It follows her 2017 show called Hard Mode about freedom of speech, which was later performed in London. Mr Reay is also understood to be seeking legal costs and an injunction against Ms Beamont. The pair married in 2013, but separated before she wrote the script for the performance, which mentioned her previous relationship and focuses on what would happen if the BBC came under the control of the Chinese government. Ms Beamont has now set up a fundraising page to pay for her defence of the legal action, which she says could bankrupt her. On the Gofundme page, the comedian wrote: ""During that show, I referred to my husband a couple of times - perhaps two minutes' worth of reference in a 50-minute show. ""The main gist of those references was to tell the audience how sad I was that my marriage had broken down recently. ""He is seeking Â£30,000 damages, his legal costs (which I can only assume will be massive) and an injunction stopping me from publishing statements about him."" Louise Reay performed her show at the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2017 Ms Beamont, who stays in London, said she would not comment on the case beyond her statement on the fundraising page because of legal reasons. She added: ""As stand-up comedians, I believe it's the very definition of our job to talk about our lives and social issues. ""So this has become a free speech issue."" However, Mr Reay's solicitors denied the action was about preventing free speech and said that her material had suggested the couple's relationship was abusive. In a statement, Taylor Hampton Solicitors Limited said: ""We have from the outset made clear to Ms Beamont that our client is not in any way seeking to restrict or 'silence' her comedy or its content, except to the very limited extent that it involves the publication of unjustified false allegations and private information relating to him. Louise Reay's show was about freedom of speech ""For an extended period last summer, following their separation, Ms Beamont repeatedly performed a comedy show which identified our client verbally and in still and moving images, contained private information about him and his relationship with Ms Beamont, and made very serious and inflammatory allegations of wrongdoing against him. ""These allegations included the entirely false suggestion that our client's relationship with Ms Beamont was an abusive one."" The solicitor said their client was ""harassed"" by the performances and that the material had caused him ""enormous distress"". Their statement added: ""No right to freedom of expression or artistic licence can extend to the publication of such seriously defamatory and false allegations, or the unjustified misuse of our client's private information.""

Pence and N Korea planned Olympic meeting,"Mike Pence was seated directly in front of the North Korean delegation at the opening ceremony US Vice-President Mike Pence was due to meet North Korean officials at the Winter Olympics last week, US officials have said, but the North Koreans pulled out at the last moment. Mr Pence was in South Korea for the opening of the Winter Olympics. A spokesman said he was scheduled to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-jong, among others. It would have been the first official interaction between North Korea and the Trump administration. North Korea has made no comment on the US reports. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said when the ""possibility arose"" of a brief meeting with the North Korean delegation, Mr Pence ""was ready to take this opportunity to drive home the necessity of North Korea abandoning its illicit ballistic missile and nuclear programs"". ""At the last minute, DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] officials decided not to go forward with the meeting. We regret their failure to seize this opportunity,"" she said in a statement. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon What this 'casual' photo tells us about N Korea N Korea leader's sister takes 'real power' south North Korea's attendance at the Winter Olympics was seen as a major thaw in consistently tense relations on the Korean peninsula. But there were also concerns that Pyongyang, which has been widely condemned for its repeated testing of nuclear weapons and conventional missiles, was using the event simply to improve its international image. Are North and South Korea friends again? North Korea got what it wanted from the Winter Olympics North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know The US - among others - has warned against easing pressure on the North Koreans to abandon their nuclear programme and improve their human rights situation. Mr Pence was criticised by some for not engaging diplomatically with the North Koreans while in South Korea. He sat feet away from Kim Yo-jong - who is accused of human rights violations - at the Games but did not interact with her, saying: ""I didn't believe it was proper for the United States of America to give her any attention in that forum."" Mr Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, said North Korea had ""dangled a meeting in hopes of the vice president softening his message, which would have ceded the world stage for their propaganda during the Olympics"". ""This administration will stand in the way of Kim's desire to whitewash their murderous regime with nice photo ops at the Olympics. Perhaps that's why they walked away from a meeting or perhaps they were never sincere about sitting down,"" he said. On leaving the Games, Mr Pence said the US and its allies remained firmly aligned on North Korea ""There is no daylight between the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan on the need to continue to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile programme."" However, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has said he is considering accepting an invitation to visit Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. It would be the first summit in more than a decade between Korean leaders. Are North and South Korea friends again?

Two stab murders within two hours,"This video can not be played Camden stabbings: 'Stop using knives' begs grieving mother A mother whose two sons were stabbed to death in north London within five months of each other has called for young people to stop using knives. Sadiq Adan Mohamed, 20, died after being stabbed in Malden Road, Camden, at about 22:10 GMT on Tuesday. He was one of two men stabbed to death in Camden that night. Abdikarim Hassan, 17, died in Bartholomew Road at 21:08. Mr Mohamed's mother, Fowsiya Abdi, said: ""Please I beg you, people who got a knife, children - stop please."" Abdikarim Hassan (l) and Sadiq Adan Mohamed (r) were both killed in Camden on Tuesday Another of her sons was stabbed to death - also aged 20 - in September 2017. Her sister's brother has also been killed. She said for both her sons, it was a case of ""wrong place, wrong time"", and she fears for her other children. Mr Mohamed was given first aid but died at the scene near the junction with Marsden Street. Ms Abdi had heard rumours her son had been attacked before the police confirmed it for her. The Met Police is trying to determine if the killings of both young men on Tuesday night are linked. This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Ms Abdi said: ""I'm feeling pain. I can't sleep even, I can't sleep tonight."" Earlier Mr Mohamed's family released a statement saying: ""This is now the constant theme in our community. ""We are made to believe that the police are here to protect us, but how does a mother feel her kids are protected when she has lost two in the same vicinity within months? ""We have lots of questions and need answers. Somebody has to listen to us."" The Met Police is trying to establish whether the two deaths are linked Neighbour Layla Awod said Abdikarim Hassan was on his way back home from college when he was stabbed. She said his mother saw him lying on the floor dying after being refused to pass through the police security cordon. She knew it was her son when she called his mobile phone and heard it ringing the other side of the cordon, she said. Mr Hassan's uncle, Yusuf Ahmed, said the teenager came to the UK from Somalia when he was two years old and was the eldest of six children. He was a student at Westminster College, liked playing football, and was a ""good guy"" who was ""always smiling"". Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales On a knife edge: Rising violence in London Following the deaths, additional police patrols were sent to Camden overnight and a Section 60 order - giving them powers to stop and search people - was authorised across the borough until 07:00. A police spokesperson said murder investigations had been launched but no arrests had been made and ""urgent inquiries are under way to establish the full circumstances"". Sixteen people have been stabbed to death in London since the start of 2018. Five of those were teenagers. Less than two miles away from Tuesday night's first stabbing - and only minutes earlier - a 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Aldenham Street, Camden. Paramedics took the boy to a central London hospital with non life-threatening injuries. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of GBH with intent, but has since been released. No further action will be taken against him. Camden Police were called to another stabbing on Tuesday afternoon where a man, thought to be in his 40s, was attacked in Kilburn High Road shortly before 15:30. He was taken to hospital by London Air Ambulance and is in a stable condition. The force has not said if either attack was linked to the two fatal stabbings. A large police cordon was set up around the road where Mr Mohamed was killed A 19-year-old man who lives near Bartholomew Road told BBC Radio London stabbings were now ""everyday behaviour for these youngsters"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""desperately saddened"" by the deaths. ""I am asking the prime minister and the home secretary to urgently meet with me to discuss how we can work together to tackle the evil of knife attacks."" Meanwhile Cressida Dick, the commissioner for the Met Police, asked all Londoners to ""think about what you can do to help us tackle this blight on our city"". She urged young Londoners to ""stop and think"" before carrying a knife. The government's Serious Violence Strategy will be published in the next few months, a Home Office spokesperson said. ""Tackling this crime requires a new way of thinking,"" the spokesperson added.

Pro-government forces enter Afrin,"This video can not be played Pro-government forces waved Syrian flags as they entered Afrin, in footage posted by the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah Syrian pro-government forces have entered the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, provoking an immediate response from Turkish forces besieging the area. The government was asked for military help by a Kurdish militia that has been trying to repel an offensive by Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels. Fighters were seen passing through a checkpoint in armoured vehicles. Turkish troops then shelled the area and Turkey said it had forced the pro-government fighters to retreat. Turkey had threatened to confront government forces if they intervened, raising the prospect of direct conflict between two of the main players in Syria's civil war. The development comes as: Syrian government warplanes continued to bombard the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghoutaregion outside Damascus, reportedly killing dozens of civilians a day after strikes left more than 120 dead The government's allyRussia acknowledged that dozens of its citizens were killed or wounded in a recent armed clash in Syria- an apparent reference to a confrontation this month with US-backed forces in Deir al-Zour Turkish leaders say they want to clear the Kurdish enclave of members of the People's Protection Units (YPG) militia, which they consider a terrorist group. They say it is an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades. The Syrian Kurds deny any direct organisational links to the PKK - an assertion backed by the US, which has provided the militia and allied Arab fighters with weapons and air support to help them battle the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). The Turkish air and ground assault on Afrin, dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch"", began on 20 January. Since then, Turkish troops and Syrian rebels have taken about 45 villages, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The UK-based monitoring group says the fighting has left at least 205 Syrian rebels and 219 Kurdish militiamen dead, along with 112 civilians. Turkey says 32 of its soldiers have been killed and denied reports of any civilian casualties in Afrin. The abridged back story How historical Afrin became a prize worth a war The government has denounced the Turkish offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty. Soon after it began, the Kurdish authorities in Afrin called on the government to ""carry out its sovereign obligations"" and send troops to help defend the border from Turkish attacks. The government, which has so far avoided conflict with Kurdish forces since the start of the civil war in 2011, did not immediately respond to the appeal for help. Turkey launched a cross-border operation against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria last month But on Tuesday state media reported that members of the ""Popular Forces"" had arrived in Afrin to ""support the locals against the aggression waged by the Turkish regime"" and to confront IS, which has no known presence in the area. A military media unit run by Lebanon's Hezbollah movement - an ally of the Syrian government - posted photos and video of men brandishing Syrian flags passing through a checkpoint on a number of pick-up trucks and lorries mounted with heavy weapons. A reporter for the official Sana news agency said Turkish artillery had targeted the convoy after it crossed into the Kurdish enclave, as well as media personnel accompanying it. Turkey and its allies wants to drive Kurdish YPG militia fighters from Afrin Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency later reported that Turkish troops had fired ""warning shots"" at ""pro-regime terrorist groups trying to advance"" towards Afrin, forcing them to retreat about 10km (6 miles). Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the convoy was made up of Shia militiamen acting independently, adding that he had earlier persuaded the Syrian government's main allies, Russia and Iran, to stop any troops being deployed. ""Unfortunately, these kinds of terror organisations take wrong steps with the decisions they take. It is not possible for us to allow this. They will pay a heavy price,"" the Reuters news agency quoted him as telling an news conference. By Selin Girit, BBC News, Istanbul For Turks this was not surprising, but it is alarming. Turkey had said that if Syrian forces came in to Afrin to support the Kurdish YPG forces, there would be serious consequences. The confrontation risks an escalation in Turkey's one-month old offensive that is aimed at driving the YPG out of Afrin. This video can not be played Why do the two biggest military powers in Nato risk fighting each other in Syria? There has not yet been an official statement regarding the latest events. But presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin had tweeted to say that reports suggesting that Syrian government had struck a deal with the YPG were not based on facts, adding that ""dirty and secret negotiations were being held"". Ankara says it is determined to carry on its operation whatever happens. But many argue Turkey would need Russia's backing in order to avoid confronting Syrian troops along with the YPG. Afrin is just one of many active fronts in the country's civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Government forces, supported by Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militias, are also carrying out offensives on two major rebel strongholds - the north-western province of Idlib and the besieged Eastern Ghouta region. The UN says more than 300,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in Idlib since December, while almost 200 civilians are reported to have been killed in government air and artillery strikes on the Eastern Ghouta since Monday. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry acknowledged that dozens of its citizens and people from other former Soviet states were killed or wounded in a recent battle. It gave no details, butit is believed to be a reference to an incident in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour on 7 February, when the US military said it had killed an estimated 100 pro-Syrian government fighters in response to an attack on an allied, Kurdish-led militia force battling Islamic State militants in the area.

Russia admits heavy casualties,"Russia gave no details about Russian volunteers fighting in Syria Russia's foreign ministry has confirmed that ""several dozen"" Russian citizens - not regular soldiers - were killed or wounded in a recent battle in Syria. The statement did not give a date. Previously the Russian government said ""probably five"" Russians had died in a clash in Deir al-Zour province. Some reports have said more than 100 Russian mercenaries were killed in US air strikes on 7 February. Russia does not divulge firm details of ""volunteer"" fighters in the conflict. The latest Russian statement said no Russian regular forces had been involved in a ""recent armed clash"". The foreign ministry spoke of ""several dozen"" citizens from Russia and other ex-Soviet republics, who have been killed or wounded. It said the injured are undergoing medical treatment at a number of hospitals. ""It has been pointed out that certain Russian citizens in Syria have arrived there of their own free will and for different reasons. The foreign ministry does not have the authority to assess the validity and legality of their decisions,"" it added. Officially, Russia's military role mainly takes the form of air strikes, helping President Bashar al-Assad's forces. However, independent media have found evidence of other Russian citizens fighting for the Syrian government side. Relatives of the hired fighters saythey have been paid insurance money by unknown representativesof so-called private military companies, which bring their bodies back. Yevgeny Alikov's mother, Nina Atyusheva, with her dead son's identification tag A pensioner from the north-west Arkhangelsk Oblast region, Nina Atyusheva, told the BBC she has been fighting to get the state to formally record her son's death: ""I want to ask this question: in what way are the children sent by the armed forces different from those like mine, who went as a volunteer?"" Read more:The Russian guns for hire in Syria The US launched air and artillery strikes in Deir al-Zour province, which, it says, killed 100 militia. It says it had to defend the headquarters of its allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which was under attack by fighters aligned with the Syrian government. The US says these forces crossed an informal demarcation line along the Euphrates River; the government controls the western side and the SDF the east. The two sides have clashed over the past year while trying to drive Islamic State (IS) militants from their last major stronghold in the country. The Pentagon said it had been in constant contact with Russia in the run up to the February operation. The Syrian government called the attacks a ""massacre""and said it would complain to the United Nations. Russia and the US have accused each other of operating in the area and planning to control nearby oil fields. According to the Russian defence ministry, 44 official military personnel have died in Syria. The number of dead private military contractors remains unknown. A Reuters investigation showed that at least 131 Russians died,externalin Syria in the first nine months of 2017 - a number thought to include private military contractors.

Syria country profile,"Syria covers an area that has seen invasions and occupations over the ages, from Romans and Mongols to Crusaders and Turks. It is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, Christians, Druze, Alawites, and Shia and Sunni Arabs, the last of whom make up a majority of the Muslim population. Modern Syria gained its independence from France in 1946, after which it saw considerable political instability with multiple military coups and coup attempts  between 1949 and 1971. Between 1958 and 1961 it briefly joined with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic. Significantly, the 1963 coup saw the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party establish a one-party state. General Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1970, setting up a repressive political system. After his death in 2000, his son Bashar al-Assad inherited the presidency. Following the 2011 Arab Spring, Syria saw a multi-sided civil war, with involvement of different countries. More than six million Syrians fled the country. After the defeat of Islamic State, the frontlines stabilised with the country effectively divided into cantons. In late 2024, a coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swiftly captured several major cities, including Damascus, and toppled Assad's regime. Seemore country profiles,external- Profiles compiled byBBC Monitoring,external Capital:Damascus Area:185,180 sq km Population:22.1 million Language:Arabic Life expectancy:68 years (men) 75 years (women) Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader: Ahmed al-Sharaa (nom de guerre: Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) Shortly before his forces captured Damascus, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani dropped that nom de guerre associated with his jihadist past, and started using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in official communiques. The move is part of Jolani's effort to bolster his legitimacy in a new context, now that his Islamist militant group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, leading other factions, has captured the Syrian capital, Damascus, solidifying its control over much of the country. Jolani's transformation is not recent, but has been carefully cultivated over the years, evident not only in his public statements and interviews with international outlets but also in his evolving appearance. Once clad in traditional jihadist militant attire, he has adopted a more Western-style wardrobe in recent. During the rebel offensive, he donned military fatigues, symbolising his role as military commander. SyriaÂ has three distinct media environments - pro-government, opposition and Kurdish - reflecting its territorial divisions after more than a decade of war. It as yet unclear how the media landscape will change with the fall of the Assad regime. Journalists have faced clear red lines onÂ reporting, and media workers have been targeted by all parties to the conflict.

Pro-Brexit Tories set out demands,"More than 60 Brexit-supporting Tory MPs have written to Theresa May to insist the UK make a clean break with the EU. The MPs say the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"". The letter was sent by the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg. Opposition critics accused the PM of being ""too weak"" to confront the ""hard Brexiteers"" in her own party. What is the European Research Group? Post-Brexit UK won't be like Mad Max, says David Davis The letter, signed by 62 MPs including several ex-ministers and former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, includes a number of ""suggestions"" for securing a successful Brexit. It backs the PM's vision for Brexit, as set out in herLancaster House speech,externalin January 2017, including leaving the customs union and single market. But it says she ""must"" ensure the UK can change its laws without authorisation from the EU from the moment it leaves in March 2019. The MPs also insist the UK must be ""free to start its own trade negotiations"" during the planned two-year transition period that would kick in after Brexit day. And it urges the UK government to resist EU efforts to set the timetable for Brexit negotiations. ""The UK should negotiate as an equal partner. Ministers may not want or be able to accept the EU's timing and mandates as fixed, and should be able to set out alternative terms including, for example, building an agreement based on our World Trade Organisation membership instead,"" says the letter. It comes ahead of a crunch cabinet meeting on Thursday to thrash out an agreement on how to proceed in negotiations with the EU. The government is also set to publish its its response to the EU's proposals for how the two-year transition period after Brexit should work later on Wednesday. The UK wants a mechanism to object to new European legislation introduced during the implementation phase. The prime minister had suggested that EU nationals who arrive during the transition period should not have the right to settle permanently in the UK. Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg With no majority, she knows that she needs to keep the dozens and dozens of Brexit-backing Tory MPs broadly with her for her own government's survival. They have accepted some shifts from the government that they used to find intolerable - a Brexit departure lounge of a couple of years rather than a sharp exit, and a bill of tens of billions. But they are not, as this letter makes clear, up for swallowing many more compromises when it comes to getting trade deals done immediately after Brexit. Read Laura's full blog Labour claimed the MPs' letter ""exposes the deep divisions that run through the heart of this Tory government"". Shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield  said: ""It is clearer than ever that Theresa May cannot deliver the Brexit deal Britain needs. ""She is too weak to face down the fanatics in her own party and to deliver a final deal that protects jobs and the economy."" The SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""It is clear from this list of demands that the Tories don't want either a transition deal or a âfuture relationship with the EU."" Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said it appeared the prime minister had ""one arm tied behind her back by the Tory militants who are now nakedly acting like a party within a party"". In other Brexit news, a group of pro-Leave economists claim to have ""comprehensively debunked"" leaked government forecasts predicting a hit to the UK economy outside the EU. The Whitehall forecasts - which predicted lower growth across the UK as a result of Brexit - sparked a row when they emerged last month. Now Economists for Free Trade have published their ""alternative"" calculations, saying the civil servants' version ignored what they said were the ""clear objectives"" set out by Mrs May of free trade with Europe and the rest of the world. Using government models, this would suggest a 2% rise in GDP over 15 years, the group claimed. Mr Duncan Smith said the report ""deserves to be taken very seriously"". Mrs May is meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for talks in Downing Street and is expected to update him on Brexit progress.

Taxi rapist police 'failings' ruling due,"The Supreme Court is to rule on whether the Metropolitan Police failed two victims of black cab rapist John Worboys. The case rests on whether the Met's failure to properly investigate the women's allegations amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. They failed to believe the women's reports of assaults in 2003 and 2007. The women are also separately pursuing a judicial review of the Parole Board's decision to release Worboys. Worboys was able to continue to attack women until he was convicted of 19 offences in 2009, when he was ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. The Met believe he may have attacked more than 100 women. Police appeal against ruling they failed rape victims Cabbie who preyed on young women In 2014, a judge ruled that the women's human rights had been breached and ordered the force to pay them more than Â£40,000 in damages. The women brought their claims under article three of the Human Rights Act - the right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment. Until then, police could not be found to be negligent for generally failing to identify and apprehend an unknown suspect. The police appealed, arguing that its duty was fulfilled simply by having practices and procedures to investigate in place, although it was agreed that the damages awarded to the women would not be recouped if the appeal succeeded. The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said victory for the women in the case would mean police forces could face human rights actions whenever they fail to properly investigate serious violent crime and would be a ""major victory for victims"". The case comes a month afterthe government announced it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision to release Worboysafter he had served less than 10 years in prison.

Most firms pay men more than women,"The majority of medium and large companies pay higher wage rates to men than to women, according to the latest government figures. The disparity, known as the the gender pay gap, reflects the different average hourly salaries earned by men and women. The government data showed,external74% of firms pay higher rates to their male staff. Just 15% of businesses with more than 250 employees pay more to women. As many as 11% of firms said there is no difference between the rates paid to either gender. What is the gender pay gap? Unlike pay inequality - which compares the wages of men and women doing the same job - a gender pay difference at a company is not illegal, but could possibly reflect discrimination. The average gender pay gap across all medium and large-sized firms is now 8.2%, as measured by median pay. In other words men typically earn over 8% more per hour than women. Among those with the largest gender pay gap are airlines such as Tui and Easyjet, and banks including Virgin Money, the Clydesdale and TSB. Easyjet has said its pay gap of 45.5% is down to the fact that most of its pilots are male, while most of its more modestly paid cabin crew are female. Tui Airways - where men earn 47% more than women - has the same issue. Many banks also appear to have a gender bias on salaries. The Bank of England's wage rate for men is 24% higher than for its female employees. BBC's 9% pay gap revealed Gender pay gap: 500 firms reveal their figures By law, all firms with more than 250 staff must report their gender pay gap to the government by 4 April this year. So far only 1,047 firms have complied, leaving another 8,000 to go. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, denied companies were dragging their feet in reporting the data. ""I don't see a reluctance,"" she told the Today programme. ""I think this is genuinely quite difficult data to find, it is often sitting on different systems and firms are working very hard towards that deadline. ""I think we'll see the vast majority of firms reporting on time."" Personnel experts urged companies to hurry up with their returns, even if they prove to be embarrassing. ""Some businesses may be concerned about reputational issues, which may be holding them back from reporting early,"" said Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). ""They may be hoping that by waiting until the deadline and submitting at the same time as others that their results will get lost in the crowd."" But he said the main task was to change ""societal norms"" to help women progress at work. Ms Fairbairn said: ""That's the really important thing about this - what changes - because we do really need this to change. ""It is about fairness but it is also fundamentally about productivity in our economy. I think firms are embracing this."" On the other side of the coin, a minority of organisations pay their female staff more than their male colleagues. These include Three Rivers Council, where the hourly rate for women is 42% higher than for men. Europcar, drinks giant Diageo, refuse collector Biffa, and delivery firm Ocado are also among the better-known names. Diageo - which has a 9.8% pay bias in favour of women in its English operation - said most of its sales and manufacturing roles were taken by men, while more women were employed in higher-paid office positions. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the pay gap for all employees at 18%. Want to find out the gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here,external.

Lloyds hails 'landmark' yearLLoyds Banking Group has reported strong full year profits in its first year as a private enterprise.,"Lloyds Banking Group has reported strong full year profits in its first year as a fully private enterprise. Pre-tax profit for 2017 was Â£5.3bn, 24% higher than a year earlier, and the bank's highest profit since 2006. Chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio said it had been ""a landmark year"", and announced that the bank  planned to spend up to Â£1bn buying back shares. The government sold its last shares in Lloyds in May, eight years after pumping in Â£20bn to save it. Lloyds, Britain's biggest mortgage provider, also said it would invest Â£3bn in new technology and staff as part of a three-year plan focused on expanding its digital services. HSBC profits jump to $17.2bn on Asia growth Lloyds to cut more than 900 jobs ""Our customers want better products they want more convenience. They want safer products,"" Mr Horta Osorio told BBC Radio 4. He said the bank planned to lend an additional Â£6bn to small businesses in the UK over the next three years and provide Â£10bn more to first time buyers. The increased investment is part of Lloyd's efforts to adapt to changing consumer banking habits. The bank also said it had put aside an extra Â£600m in the fourth quarter of last year to pay compensation over mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) claims. This takes the bank's total PPI costs for the year to Â£1.6bn. Mr Horta Osorio has overseen a programme of bank branch closures, including job losses, since he took over in 2011. At that time the government still held a 43% stake in the bank. Mr Horta Osorio said last year had marked a step-change for the group after the government sold its last remaining shareholding. ""We were, last year, able to give all of tax-payers' money back and some more, which was a big moment of pride for all at Lloyds Banking Group."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the results were ""slightly below expectations"", but said most measures showed ""strong improvement"". ""With the shackles of the government share stake now removed, Lloyds has been able to concentrate fully on financial growth and repair,"" he added. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said: ""Lloyds is increasingly looking like a bank firing on nearly all its cylinders. Guidance for the year ahead and beyond looks very robust."" Lloyds has already announced there will be more than 900 job losses as the group focuses away from High Street branches and towards online services. But the bank said it would also be creating new posts. Lloyds Banking Group includes Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows. Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown said investors were likely to welcome these results. ""The combination of the dividend and the new share buyback scheme means shareholders are getting a pretty tasty 6% return on their investment,"" he said.

MPs send Brexit 'suggestions' to May,"More than 60 Brexit-supporting Tory MPs have written to Theresa May to insist the UK make a clean break with the EU. The MPs say the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"".

The government is also set to publish its its response to the EU's proposals for how the two-year transition period after Brexit should work later on Wednesday. The UK wants a mechanism to object to new European legislation introduced during the implementation phase. The prime minister had suggested that EU nationals who arrive during the transition period should not have the right to settle permanently in the UK. Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg With no majority, she knows that she needs to keep the dozens and dozens of Brexit-backing Tory MPs broadly with her for her own government's survival. They have accepted some shifts from the government that they used to find intolerable - a Brexit departure lounge of a couple of years rather than a sharp exit, and a bill of tens of billions. But they are not, as this letter makes clear, up for swallowing many more compromises when it comes to getting trade deals done immediately after Brexit. Read Laura's full blog Labour claimed the MPs' letter ""exposes the deep divisions that run through the heart of this Tory government"". Shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield  said: ""It is clearer than ever that Theresa May cannot deliver the Brexit deal Britain needs. ""She is too weak to face down the fanatics in her own party and to deliver a final deal that protects jobs and the economy."" The SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""It is clear from this list of demands that the Tories don't want either a transition deal or a âfuture relationship with the EU."" Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said it appeared the prime minister had ""one arm tied behind her back by the Tory militants who are now nakedly acting like a party within a party"". In other Brexit news, a group of pro-Leave economists claim to have ""comprehensively debunked"" leaked government forecasts predicting a hit to the UK economy outside the EU. The Whitehall forecasts - which predicted lower growth across the UK as a result of Brexit - sparked a row when they emerged last month. Now Economists for Free Trade have published their ""alternative"" calculations, saying the civil servants' version ignored what they said were the ""clear objectives"" set out by Mrs May of free trade with Europe and the rest of the world. Using government models, this would suggest a 2% rise in GDP over 15 years, the group claimed. Mr Duncan Smith said the report ""deserves to be taken very seriously"". Mrs May is meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for talks in Downing Street and is expected to update him on Brexit progress.

Most smaller firms pay men moreNew figures show almost three in four small UK companies pay men more than their female workers.7h7 hours agoBusiness,"The majority of medium and large companies pay higher wage rates to men than to women, according to the latest government figures. The disparity, known as the the gender pay gap, reflects the different average hourly salaries earned by men and women. The government data showed,external74% of firms pay higher rates to their male staff. Just 15% of businesses with more than 250 employees pay more to women. As many as 11% of firms said there is no difference between the rates paid to either gender. What is the gender pay gap? Unlike pay inequality - which compares the wages of men and women doing the same job - a gender pay difference at a company is not illegal, but could possibly reflect discrimination. The average gender pay gap across all medium and large-sized firms is now 8.2%, as measured by median pay. In other words men typically earn over 8% more per hour than women. Among those with the largest gender pay gap are airlines such as Tui and Easyjet, and banks including Virgin Money, the Clydesdale and TSB. Easyjet has said its pay gap of 45.5% is down to the fact that most of its pilots are male, while most of its more modestly paid cabin crew are female. Tui Airways - where men earn 47% more than women - has the same issue. Many banks also appear to have a gender bias on salaries. The Bank of England's wage rate for men is 24% higher than for its female employees. BBC's 9% pay gap revealed Gender pay gap: 500 firms reveal their figures By law, all firms with more than 250 staff must report their gender pay gap to the government by 4 April this year. So far only 1,047 firms have complied, leaving another 8,000 to go. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, denied companies were dragging their feet in reporting the data. ""I don't see a reluctance,"" she told the Today programme. ""I think this is genuinely quite difficult data to find, it is often sitting on different systems and firms are working very hard towards that deadline. ""I think we'll see the vast majority of firms reporting on time."" Personnel experts urged companies to hurry up with their returns, even if they prove to be embarrassing. ""Some businesses may be concerned about reputational issues, which may be holding them back from reporting early,"" said Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). ""They may be hoping that by waiting until the deadline and submitting at the same time as others that their results will get lost in the crowd."" But he said the main task was to change ""societal norms"" to help women progress at work. Ms Fairbairn said: ""That's the really important thing about this - what changes - because we do really need this to change. ""It is about fairness but it is also fundamentally about productivity in our economy. I think firms are embracing this."" On the other side of the coin, a minority of organisations pay their female staff more than their male colleagues. These include Three Rivers Council, where the hourly rate for women is 42% higher than for men. Europcar, drinks giant Diageo, refuse collector Biffa, and delivery firm Ocado are also among the better-known names. Diageo - which has a 9.8% pay bias in favour of women in its English operation - said most of its sales and manufacturing roles were taken by men, while more women were employed in higher-paid office positions. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the pay gap for all employees at 18%. Want to find out the gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here,external. However, these are calculated differently and are for all employees, not just those who work in firms of over 250 staff.

Ex-Save the Children boss 'faced complaints',"A former chief executive of Save the Children faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff before leaving the charity, the BBC has learned. Justin Forsyth was accused of sending inappropriate texts and commenting on what young female staff were wearing. Mr Forsyth said he had ""apologised unreservedly"" to the three workers. It comes as Oxfam and Save the Children haveseparately been quizzed by MPs about sexual misconduct by workers. Although not accused of sexual misconduct, Mr Forsyth, who is now deputy executive director at Unicef., said he had had ""unsuitable and thoughtless conversations"" with staff. He said the concerns were handled through a process of mediation and no formal complaints were made. He added he thought the issue had been closed ""many years ago"". Save the Children said it had commissioned ""a root and branch review of the organisational culture"" at the charity ""addressing any behavioural challenges among senior leadership"". The charity said concerns were raised about ""inappropriate behaviour and comments"" by Mr Forsyth in 2015. It said two trustees carried out separate investigations into a total of three complaints made by female employees. ""Both reviews resulted in unreserved apologies from the CEO. All the parties agreed to this and the former CEO apologised to the women in question. At that time the matters were closed."" A Unicef spokesman said: ""We welcome Mr Forsyth's decision to come forward and acknowledge past mistakes. ""We are discussing this matter with Mr Forsyth and his former employer so we can take appropriate action."" An investigation by BBC Radio 4's PM programme, found the complaints against Mr Forsyth included women receiving a series of inappropriate texts, and comments on how they looked, what they were wearing and how he felt about them. If they did not respond, Mr Forsyth would follow up his messages with an email, asking if they had seen the text. If they still did not respond, he would ask someone to send them to him for a ""quick word"". A woman who complained at the time said the longer she was at the charity the more she was exposed to ""some of the bravado"". ""That is both at head office and in the field,"" she said. ""Other women tell you to watch out for certain senior people. You start to hear rumours about some of the directors but of course until it happens to you - which it did - you don't really appreciate how hard it is to deal with."" She said it did not seem the complaints were being treated with the ""appropriate degree of seriousness"" and it was ""troubling"" that the then chairman of the charity's board of trustees, Sir Alan Parker, became involved. Sir Alan is the founder of the PR firm Brunswick. Justin Forsyth with Samantha Cameron in Lebanon Another former employee of Save the Children told the BBC: ""The centre of this crisis was not in Haiti or Chad. It was in London. ""Young professional women at Save the Children felt unsafe. They felt that their careers could depend on ensuring they responded to unwanted attention and to bullying."" In his statement, Mr Forsyth said he had made ""some personal mistakes during my time at Save the Children"". ""I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I now know caused offence and hurt. ""When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved. ""My apologies were accepted and I had thought the issue closed many years ago."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The allegations come after Brendan Cox - the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox - quit two charities he set up in memory of his wifeamid allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The Charity Commission said it had ""extensive regulatory engagement"" with Save the Children after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour were made against Mr Cox and Mr Forsyth between 2015-16. A spokeswoman added that the body received an independent review ""commissioned by trustees"", and ""received direct confirmation and assurance from trustees"" that recommendations made to the charity ""were being urgently acted upon"".

Syria enclave crisis 'beyond imagining',"This video can not be played Young children have been found buried in the rubble A doctor working in the Syrian rebel enclave of the Eastern Ghouta says the situation is ""catastrophic"" - and he believes the international community has abandoned the people living there. ""We don't have anything - no food, no medicine, no shelter,"" Dr Bassam said. Activists say 45 people were killed in fresh government air strikes on Wednesday, bringing the total death toll there since Sunday to nearly 300. The Red Cross is demanding urgent humanitarian access to the region. The Syrian military says it is trying to liberate the area from terrorists - but it has also been accused of targeting civilians. The Eastern Ghouta is dominated by the Islamist faction Jaysh al-Islam. But Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, also has a presence there. Pro-government forces, backed by Russia, intensified their efforts to retake the last major rebel stronghold on Sunday night. ""They targeted everything: shops, markets, hospitals, schools, mosques, everything,"" Dr Bassam told the BBC on Wednesday. A makeshift hospital was set up in Douma - one of the several towns under bombardment ""Maybe every minute we have 10 or 20 air strikes...I will treat someone - and after a day or two they come again, injured again."" ""Where is the international community, where is (the UN) Security Council... they abandoned us. They leave us to be killed,"" he said. The head of safety and security for the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which operates medical facilities in the Eastern Ghouta, told the BBC that 45 people had been killed and another 250 injured on Wednesday alone. Dr Ahmad Dbis said that since Sunday, ten members of medical staff and volunteers had been killed and 14 medical facilities were taken out of service, with five totally destroyed. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the total death toll since Sunday at 296. It said that barrel bombs - containers filled with explosives and shrapnel - were used in government strikes on the towns of Jisreen and Kfar Batna on Wednesday. It follows the bombardment on Tuesday of at least 10 towns and villages across the Eastern Ghouta. Syrian state television reported that at least six people living in government-controlled areas of eastern Damascus were killed earlier this week - and 28 others wounded - by shells fired from the Eastern Ghouta. The Syrian military said it carried out ""precision strikes"" on areas from which the shells were launched. Syria country profile Since Sunday, activists say nearly 300 people have died, more than 60 of which were children. At least 1,400 people have been injured, they say. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent The catastrophe in eastern Ghouta is unfolding as the war in Syria enters a new and even more dangerous phase. The international community is impotent to act, not least because key members of that community are deeply implicated in what is going on, not least Russia. Other regional players like Turkey and Iran are acting to secure their own long-term strategic interests. So too is Washington though its goals seem uncertain now that IS is defeated and the Assad regime remains in power. There is no consensus in the international community, no great leadership in evidence, and no shared sense of what Syria's future should be. Just as the international community has failed to halt the use of chemical weapons, so too it has been unable to secure humanitarian access to those at greatest risk. No. The government has allowed one humanitarian convoy into the Eastern Ghouta since late November, and there are severe shortages of food. A bundle of bread now costs close to 22 times the national average and 12% of children under five years old are said to be acutely malnourished. The Eastern Ghouta town of Hamouria has been heavily bombarded On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) joined the UN in calling for emergency humanitarian access to allow much needed aid to be delivered and the wounded to be evacuated. ""Wounded victims are dying only because they cannot be treated in time. In some areas of Ghouta, entire families have no safe place to go,"" the ICRC's Marianne Gasser said in a statement. ""On the other side of the frontline, people in Damascus are in constant fear that their children will be hit by falling mortars. This is madness and it has to stop. Civilians must not be targeted,"" she added. The UN has already called for a ceasefire. The violence in the region - designated as a ""de-escalation zone"" by Syria's main allies, Russia and Iran, as well as Turkey - is the worst since 2013, when a chemical attack killed hundreds of people, activists say. This video can not be played Father describes a 'miserable day for Eastern Ghouta' Meanwhile, pro-government fighters have been sent to the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in northern Syria to confront an offensive by Turkish troops and Syrian rebels. Turkey fired shells near the advancing columns, which, it says, forced the pro-government fighters into retreat. Afrin lies just south of the Turkish border. Turkey is trying to oust the Kurdish YPG militia, which controls the area and which has called on the Syrian military for help. Syria has denounced the Turkish offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty, while Turkey has insisted it will not back down.

Casualties soar in Syrian rebel enclave,"This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" The death toll from two days of bombing by Syria's government of a rebel-held area has risen to 250, reports say. It is the worst violence in the Eastern Ghouta area near Damascus since 2013, according to activists. More than 50 children are among the dead, they say. The UN has warned that the situation is ""spiralling out of control"". Meanwhilethe Damascus government has sent forces to confront Turkish troopswho have crossed the border to push back the Kurds in northern Syria. Turkey fired shells near the advancing columns, which, it claims, forced the pro-government fighters into retreat. The Syrian military has not commented on the reports from the Eastern Ghouta but says it carried out ""precision strikes"" on areas from which the shells were launched. A UN spokesperson said at least six hospitals had been hit in the area on Monday and Tuesday. Pro-government forces - backed by Russia - intensified their efforts to retake the last major rebel stronghold on Sunday night. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least 250 people had been killed in air strikes and artillery fire since then. A makeshift hospital was set up in Douma - one of the several towns under bombardment It said it was the highest 48-hour death toll sincea 2013 chemical attack on the besieged enclave. About 1,200 people were injured. Activists say at least 10 towns and villages across the Eastern Ghouta came under renewed bombardment on Tuesday. The UN called for a ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and the wounded to be evacuated. Syria country profile By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor After seven years, Syria's war is not ending but it is changing. President Assad now looks like he is trying to roll up this final major enclave around Damascus - the Eastern Ghouta. This would secure his victory around the capital, and would be a very big moment. But Syria remains linked into a web of war and power politics, which guarantees more conflict. Up in the north, there are a whole host of big powers completing for influence: Russia, Iran, Turkey and the United States. British Special Forces are there, too. Iran is seen as a particularly big threat by the Americans, the Israelis, who are also getting involved increasingly, and the Saudis, who have been big players in the war as well. While the cast of characters is changing, the bloodshed continues and it is certainly not over. A local doctor told the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, which supports medical facilities in the Eastern Ghouta, that it was ""catastrophic"". ""People have nowhere to turn,"" he said. ""They are trying to survive but their hunger from the siege has weakened them significantly."" The UN's co-ordinator in Syria, Panos Moumtzis, said he was ""appalled"" by reports that hospitals had been deliberately targeted,warning that such attacks might amount to war crimes,external. Five hospitals in Marj, Saqba and Douma were left inoperable or partially functioning after reported government strikes on Monday, while on Tuesday a hospital in Zamalka was hit, according to Mr Moumtzis. The Syrian American Medical Society said a hospital in Arbin was also put out of service on Tuesday. The Syrian Observatory said the facility had been targeted by Russian warplanes. The government has allowed one humanitarian convoy into the Eastern Ghouta since late November, and there are severe shortages of food. A bundle of bread now costs close to 22 times the national average and 12% of children under five years old are said to be acutely malnourished.

Top City regulator used tax break scheme,"The incoming head of the financial industry regulator had to repay tax after using an unapproved tax break scheme. Charles Randell, who becomes chair of the Financial Conduct Authority in April, told MPs he had made an ""error of judgement"" by putting money into Ingenious Film Partners 2. The scheme makes use of tax breaks available to promote film productions. Mr Randell paid into the scheme between 2006 and 2011. He told MPs on the Treasury Committee that the scheme had been recommended to him by a financial advisor and he had been assured it was approved by HMRC. But Mr Randell said that it had been ""an error of judgement"" that he had failed to further investigate those assurances. ""I was reassured that this partnership had been discussed with senior officials at HMRC, who had indicated that they approved of it,"" he told MPs. ""It's clear to me now that, far from taking any comfort from that, I should have seen it as a warning signal."" When HMRC ruled that the tax scheme was not valid, Mr Randell had to pay back Â£114,000 plus interest. The Ingenious tax schemes attracted investment from many high-profile figures. The cash raised has been used to help produce films including, Avatar, Life of Pi and Die Hard 4. But Ingenious has lost several legal battles with HMRC, resulting in its clients having to pay unpaid tax. It was estimated that the most recent ruling, in June of last year, could cost clients close to Â£700m. Mr Randell was appearing at a parliamentary hearing into his appointment to chair the FCA, which is accountable to Treasury and parliament. At the time of his investments in the Ingenious scheme he was a partner at the city law firm Slaughter and May and an advisor to the government. He agreed with Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, when she asked Mr Randell whether the scheme would, to a member of the public, look like ""some rather clever tax wheeze ... the sort of scheme that is not open to many of the consumers who invest in businesses regulated by the FCA"".

Council sorry for 'Monroe Â£10 food' tweet,"A council leader has distanced himself from a tweet made by his party suggesting a family can be fed on Â£10 a week. The tweet, which has now been deleted, said parents who could not meet this budget were ""indolent or dysfunctional or more likely parents who simply don't know how to feed their children well"". It has enraged food writer Jack Monroe who was tagged in the original post. Tim Warren said Bath's Conservatives had now tweeted an apology. The original tweet, which appeared on Saturday, on the Bath Conservatives Association feed, said: ""The reality may be indolent or disfunctional (sic) parents or more likely parents who simply don't know how to feed their children well. ""If absolutely-not-a-Tory Jack Monroe @BootstrapCook could feed herself & her child for Â£10 a week - not easily, but adequately - most people can."" The campaigner and cookbook author is renowned for a blog about cooking for a family on a shoestring. Reacting on the blog, Monroe said: ""I took exception to the Conservatives holding me up as some kind of role model because, it was their policies that left me hungry, cold, almost homeless, moving house seventeen times with a child under my arm."" Monroe challenged the original tweeter to live on just Â£10 a week for three weeks running, but added: ""You won't even start to experience the daily grind of living in poverty. ""Poverty isn't just having no heating, or not quite enough food, or unplugging your fridge and turning your hot water off. ""Poverty is the sinking feeling when your small boy finishes his one weetabix and says 'more mummy, bread and jam please mummy' as you're wondering whether to take the TV or the guitar to the pawn shop first, and how to tell him that there is no bread and jam.""
