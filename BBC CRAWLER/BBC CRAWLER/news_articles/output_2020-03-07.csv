Governor Andrew Cuomo has declared a state of emergency in New York state after the number of coronavirus cases almost doubled in 24 hours. Mr Cuomo said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had risen from 44 to 76 in the state, with 11 in New York City. Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, the governor said health authorities had been ""aggressively testing"" for coronavirus cases in recent days. New York authorities have placed dozens of people under mandatory quarantine as a precaution. ""There's no doubt that massive quarantine is the best way to slow the spread,"" Mr Cuomo said.

Italy says the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has risen by 36, bringing the total to 233 in the country. Italy has recorded the most deaths of any country outside China, where the virus originated in the city of Wuhan. The number of new coronavirus cases also increased markedly in Italy, from 4,636 to 5,883, authorities said. The new figures were announced by Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy's Civil
Protection Agency, at a news conference on Saturday. Of those originally infected by the virus, 589 had
fully recovered while 567 were being treated in intensive care, Mr Borrelli said. The outbreak started in Italy's northern regions a few weeks ago, but has spread to other parts of the country. Italy has the highest coronavirus death toll outside China A hotel in Beit Jala has been placed under quarantine Thirteen US citizens thought to have been exposed to coronavirus are in quarantine in a hotel  near Bethlehem. The church group, who were on a trip to the Holy Land, are working with US and Palestinian authorities to try to get home. ""It was going to be the trip of a lifetime,"" Chris Bell, lead pastor of the 3Circle Church in Fairhope, Alabama, told Reuters. He is there with his wife, Nan, while his three children are being cared for in the US by friends and family. The group is awaiting test results, he said, and no-one had left their hotel floor. Palestinian security forces wearing gloves and masks are stationed around the hotel in Beit Jala. Palestinian authorities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank declared a state of emergency after seven cases were confirmed in Bethlehem on Thursday. Hand sanitisers have been appearing at major sports events in the UK, including at Twickenham on Saturday for the Six Nations game. Next week they will be in horse racing action at Cheltenham for the jump season's most important week. Big events have not been closed to the public in the UK so far - as some have in Italy.   Hand sanitiser wall at Twickenham A US Navy sailor stationed in Italy is the first US service member in Europe to test positive for coronavirus, the US military command has said. The sailor is currently ""restricted to their residence"" and receiving medical care in the southern Italian city of Naples, a statement said. Military health professionals are carrying out a contact investigation to see whether any other staff were also carrying coronavirus, it said. Last month, US Forces Korea said a 23-year-old soldier based in South Korea had tested positive.

Cypriot authorities had closed four of the eight checkpoints on the line last Saturday but activists for the group Unite Cyprus are demanding they be reopened. Police said officers made ""limited use"" of personal tear gas spray to control the crowds gathered on either side of the Ledra Street crossing in Nicosia. Cyprus is effectively partitioned, with the northern third run by a Turkish Cypriot government and the southern two-thirds by an internationally recognised government led by Greek Cypriots. The Xinjia hotel has been reduced to a pile of rubble The Xinjia hotel in the Chinese city of Quanzhou has been reduced to rubble. The five-storey, 80-room hotel, which was being used as a quarantine facility monitoring people who had had close contact with coronavirus patients, collapsed on Saturday night, trapping at least 70 people. Combing through the debris, rescuers are still trying to recover people who were in the building when it fell. Dramatic pictures show rescuers pulling people from the remains of the hotel, carrying some on stretchers and helping others down ladders. At least 32 people have been pulled out so far, authorities say. Other images show the extent of the hotel's collapse. Its cause is not yet known.

Local reports say the pair are employees of four-star hotel, the Kuredi Island Resort. The government has been taking precautions to try to prevent the spread of the virus, including a temporary ban on all cruise ships entering and docking in the Maldives. Earlier (see our post from 14:27), we told you about the ban
on pre-match handshakes at Premier League matches. In the spirit of fair play, players resorted to fist-bumps
instead. Here are some pictures of the fist-bumps in action. Arsenal and West Ham players adhered to the ban on handshakes Watford's Troy Deeney and Crystal Palace's Patrick van Aanholt bump fists Norwich City goalkeeper Tim Krul's gloves came in handy But not everyone adhered to the handshake prohibition. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was pictured shaking hands with referee Paul Tierney after the match. The BBC Sport live blog reported that some players were shaking hands after the final whistle too. UK health authorities will not be pleased. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp shakes hands with referee Paul Tierney Here's a rare bit of good news with regard to the outbreak in Iran, one of the worst outside China. The World Health Organization's representative there, Dr
Christoph Hamelmann, says it has seen tremendous progress at hospitals across the country in recent days. He said Iran had made facilities available in every province for
the treatment of patients with Covid-19. Speaking in the capital, Tehran, he also said he expected international sanctions
affecting the health sector would not be fully implemented while the outbreak
continued. Iran has confirmed almost 6,000 coronavirus infections and 145 deaths but experts fear the official numbers may be underestimated. Several politicians and senior officials have been affected and a second member of parliament is now reported to have died. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have quarantined some 1,262 soldiers over suspicions they may have contracted the coronavirus, reports say. The IDF said on Friday that most of the soldiers currently in quarantine had recently returned from holiday abroad, the Jerusalem Post reported. Some, however, had come into contact with people confirmed to have the virus, the IDF said. The IDF said 189 soldiers had already completed a 14-day period of mandatory self-quarantine. Only one Israeli soldier has tested positive so far. That soldier is one of 21 confirmed cases of people with the virus in Israel. In a move to stem the spread of the virus, IDF troops have been forbidden from visiting countries with outbreaks. Recent Israeli military drills have been cancelled too.  More than 1,200 members of the IDF have been told to self-isolate at home If you're planning a trip to Russia - or more specifically, the country's capital - you should probably be aware of this, from our political correspondent Jonathan Blake: The UK government is warning people travelling to Moscow that they may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, due to the coronavirus outbreak. Updated travel advice,externalsays there are reports in Russia, citing official sources, that the UK will be added to a list of countries which already includes China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Germany and Spain - for which special measures apply. The advice also states that passengers may be asked to sign a document agreeing to self-isolate. It says that in ""a small number of cases"" foreign visitors have been placed in enforced quarantine if they do not comply. A British couple who caught the virus on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship are still unable to return to the UK. The Diamond Princess, you might recall, was put under quarantine in Japan for two weeks in February due to an outbreak onboard. Hundreds of people on the ship caught the virus during the quarantine period. David and Sally Abel began filming a YouTube video diary of their experiences when they were stuck on the ship and have continued since they were sent to hospital. Mr Abel said his wife's latest test had come back negative but his was positive. ""Sally is now totally all clear, good to return to the UK. But she won't because I have had a positive,"" he said inthe couple's latest vlog,external. ""I have now got to go back to square one. I have another test on Monday that is more than likely going to be negative."" He said Sally was no longer in medical care but that authorities had ""agreed to allow her to remain here so we can be company for one another"". Pictures of Lu Huejin crying as she tried to get her 26-year-old daughter out of locked-down Hubei province for leukaemia treatment in neighbouring Jiangxi went viral. ""She needs to have her treatment. But they won't let us through,"" Ms Lu told two reporters who found her on a bridge of the Yangtze river. ""All I want to do is save her life."" The BBC has tracked down the family to find out what happened next. Read the full story, by our reporter Owen Amos, in Singapore, here. The UK government says the number of cases in the country is now 206, an increase of 43. Two patients who tested positive for Covid-19 have so far died in the UK. Both were elderly and had underlying health conditions. The Department of Health said that as of 07:00 on Saturday morning, more than 21,000 people had been tested for the virus. Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer Jennie Harries told the BBC that the UK remained in the ""containment"" phase of controlling the virus. We have some breaking news from China. A hotel has collapsed in south-eastern Fujian province, trapping dozens of people under the rubble, state media has reported. The Xinjia Hotel in the city of Quanzhou collapsed at around 19:30 local time (11:30 GMT) on Saturday. According to the Global Times newspaper, the building was being used to hold people who had been in close contact with others confirmed to have the virus. They were under medical observation. About 70 people were in the building when it collapsed and 32 have been rescued so far, says the newspaper, which belongs to the Chinese Communist Party. It is not yet clear what caused the building to collapse. Expect plenty of fist-bumping on the pitch at football fixtures this weekend. The Premier League and English Football League have agreed to ditch pre-match fair-play handshakes. The teams will still line up as usual but the home team will walk past the away side without shaking hands. Earlier this week the government asked the Premier League to ""step up its contingency planning"" for coronavirus in a letter sent to club bosses. Playing fixtures behind closed doors is the main contingency plan being considered. At present, matches are going ahead as planned.

Travel and leisure are proving particularly vulnerable to the economic impact of coronavirus. Airlines are the most exposed sector. UK-based airline Flybe has collapsed, German flag-carrier Lufthansa plans to cut up to half its capacity, and Norwegian's share price drop 21%. Meanwhile, oil price has also dropped by nearly 10%. What can governments do about it? And what will emerge on the other side of all this? The terrain that emerges, perhaps in months, could look very different, in the way we work, in the technologies that emerge, and in our expectations of what government can do to make life less precarious for millions of vital workers.

Italy to 'quarantine 10 million people' in Lombardy,"This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" Italy has placed up to 16 million people under quarantine as it battles to contain the spread of coronavirus. Anyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces will need special permission to travel. Milan and Venice are both affected. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced the closure of schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the whole country. The measures, the most radical taken outside China, will last until 3 April. Italy has seen the largest number of coronavirus infections in Europe, with the number of confirmed cases jumping by more than 1,200 to 5,883 on Saturday. Among the latest people to test positive is the army's chief of staff. Salvatore Farina said he felt well and was self-isolating. The strict new quarantine measures affect a quarter of the Italian population and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers its economy. The death toll in Italy has passed 230, with officials reporting more than 36 deaths in 24 hours. Live coverage: Follow the latest updates The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people, where people are being treated in hospital corridors. ""We want to guarantee the health of our citizens. We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big,"" Prime Minister Conte said as he announced the measures in the middle of the night. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Under the new measures, people are not supposed to be able to enter or leave Lombardy, where Milan is the main city. The same restrictions apply to 14 provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. ""There will be no movement in or out of these areas, or within them, unless for proven work-related reasons, emergencies or health reasons,"" Mr Conte told reporters. ""We are facing an emergency, a national emergency. We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed."" People queued to buy food in Milan as quarantine measures were announced Some transport in and out of the regions affected continued on Sunday. Flights continued to arrive at Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, though some scheduled flights were cancelled. However, Italy's national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend all operations from Malpensa from Monday and Linate would only serve domestic routes. International flights would continue to and from Rome. Chris Wood, a 26-year-old from London said he and his girlfriend had cut their holiday in Italy short and were waiting for a flight home from Venice. ""The initial announcement that Venice was in lockdown was quite terrifying but everything at the airport is pretty calm,"" he said. ""I was in a bit of a panic as I thought we were going to be stuck in Venice for a month."" Last week was critical to seeing if Italy's coronavirus response had managed to halt the spread. If the numbers had begun to tail off, it would have suggested the containment measures had worked. They haven't. With cases still surging, the government has moved to the next stage - and it's a dramatic step up. It's not quite a complete lockdown - planes and trains are still running and access will be permitted for emergency or essential work reasons. But police will be able to stop people and ask why they're trying to enter or leave the areas covered. The question is whether this is all too late. It's believed the virus was circulating in Italy for weeks before it was detected. And there have now been cases in all 22 regions of the country. The government is now taking the most extensive containment measures outside of China. But is this a case of trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted? Weddings and funerals have been suspended, as well as religious and cultural events. Cinemas, nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, museums and ski resorts have been closed. Restaurants and cafes in the quarantined zones can open between 06:00 and 18:00 but customers must sit at least 1m (3ft) apart. People have been told to stay at home as much as possible, and those who break the quarantine could face three months in jail. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"" with the restrictions. Until now only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. Last week the government announced the closure of all schools and universities across the country for 10 days.

The number of infections worldwide is more than 105,500, the WHO says, with nearly 3,600 deaths. Most of the fatalities have been in China, where the virus originated in December. But the country on Sunday reported its lowest number of new infections in a single day since January - an indication that the virus's spread there is slowing. There were 40 new cases on Saturday, less than half the number reported on Friday. Twenty-seven new deaths were reported - the lowest figure in more than a month - and all were in Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Iran, one of the worst hotspots outside China, has now confirmed almost 6,000 infections and 145 deaths. However, the real figure is believed to be much higher. One report on Sunday, quoting a government envoy, said there had been 200 deaths in the northern Gilan province alone - but the figures were later removed.

What are the rules on refunds?,"Sir Paul McCartney was due to headline Saturday night at Glastonbury this year The government has advised against mass gatherings in the UK for the foreseeable future - effectively cancelling all large-scale events, such as concerts, sports fixtures and theatre productions. The 2020 Glastonbury Festival is the latest in a long list of eventsthat have been cancelled because of coronavirus. Professional football in England and Scotland has already been suspended and all horse racing in Great Britain will stop from Wednesday. Many events around the world, including the Euro 2020 finals, have also been postponed or cancelled. So, what are your rights if you have a ticket to something that gets called off? The Euro 2020 football finals were due to take place in 12 cities around Europe, including London and Glasgow Generally, if you bought your ticket for a cancelled event from an official seller, you should be entitled to a refund, often automatically. However, additional costs, such as postage and booking fees, are unlikely to be reimbursed. For anyone who purchased a ticket through a ticket-reselling website, refunds will depend on the site's terms and conditions. Some sites, like Viagogo, have already said customers will get a full refund in the event of a cancellation. If an event is moved and you cannot make the rearranged date, you should be entitled to your money back. For example, European football's governing body, Uefa, says it will refund all Euro 2020 ticket holders who can't make any rearranged dates in 2021. The football leagues in England and Scotland have not yet announced what will happen about tickets for cancelled matches. Season ticket holders should check their individual club's terms and conditions. Organisers of the Glastonbury Festival say that anyone that has paid a Â£50 deposit can roll it over to next year in order to buy a ticket for the 2021 event. Otherwise, people can ask for their Â£50 to be refunded. If you are taking part in something, the same refund rules may apply to entry fees if it is cancelled. But you need to check the event organiser's terms and conditions. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:What is the UK's 'delay' stage? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts If you have heard nothing about a refund after a couple of weeks, follow it up, says consumer rights journalist Helen Dewdney. She advises: ""Where possible, do everything in writing so you have a record."" If you're not getting anywhere you can approach your credit card company, says Ms Dewdney. Using a credit card to buy something costing between Â£100 and Â£30,000 means you are legally entitled to a refund if you do not get what you were promised. Even if the ticket is worth less than Â£100, or a debit card was used instead, there is still the chance of getting a refund under the chargeback scheme. This is used to reverse the transaction. Coronavirus: What are your travel rights? Timeline: Which sport events have been affected? Many events are put on to raise money for good causes. Many art, music and theatre groups are charities and rely heavily on ticket sales for income. They say there could be serious financial implications if they have to refund all tickets. Some, including the BFI (British Film Institute), have asked ticket holders to consider not asking for a refund so that the money can be used as a charitable donation instead. If you are unable to attend an event because facilities such as hotels or travel are unavailable, the situation is not so clear-cut. ""You've got to hope for a goodwill gesture,"" says Ms Dewdney. ""From the organisers' point of view, they'll say the event is still going ahead."" If you've booked a package (with hotel, flight and event entry all included), you may be able to claim under your travel insurance - depending on the small print. It depends, according to Adam French, from consumer group Which?. ""If you've bought a ticket for a Taylor Swift gig to headline, but she didn't perform, you should get your money back"", he says. ""But if it's a festival with multiple acts, that means you have a ticket for the festival and not the individual performer. In that instance, you can't expect a refund."" If you decide against going to a music event or sports match because you're worried about coronavirus, there's little chance of getting your money back. The only possible exception is if you have some form of insurance with your ticket. How can I tell if I've got Covid? Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases?

Parents stressed by Italy's virus shutdown,"A cleaner sanitises an empty classroom in Turin At the San Cosimato playground in Rome, parents have that unmistakeable look of ""how on Earth am I going to entertain them?"" The perennial problem has struck early this year: with schools and universities now closed across Italy until at least 15 March, in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, some 8.4 million children are out of class well before the Easter break. It's an unprecedented response by Europe's worst-hit country. Malvina Diletti watches her eight-year-old, Edoardo, play on the climbing frame. ""We think 10 days off is totally useless, it's not even enough to discover if you're sick,"" she says. ""So they'll probably extend it, which is bad as it's tiring to have them home all the time. They may be happy today - it's the first day - but they'll get bored eventually."" They are heading home for lunch with six other children, as parents are taking it in turn to host, sharing the babysitting load during this difficult period. ""It's so we avoid grandparents having to stay with us,"" Malvina tells me, ""because if more elderly got sick, hospitals would just crash."" On Thursday the Italian authorities reported 41 deaths from the virus in the past 24 hours, raising the total death toll to 148 in Italy. Currently 3,296 people are infected in the country. This was the first country in Europe to ban all flights to China; the first to cordon off entire towns; and now it's the first to close all schools and universities, a dramatic effort to limit a worsening outbreak. ""Maybe they've done it to protect the older teachers,"" says Malvina, ""since the children are still mixing out of school. ""It doesn't really make sense - but we accept it and will do it for the community."" Edoardo says he's enjoying being off school, ""but it's strange because it's the first time"". I ask if he understands why it's happening. ""Yes,"" he replies, ""it's to stop us getting sick."" LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 Some families and teachers are adapting to the huge disruption with the help of technology. In the northern town of Busto Arsizio, part of the region worst hit by the virus, the Tosi High School is using web-learning to stream classes. ""Our lessons continue uninterrupted,"" says Amanda Ferrario, the headteacher. ""The teacher enters a virtual classroom, does the roll call and can see students connected on their devices. They can work in groups, make presentations and show videos."" The school is part of a network, Ashoka Changemakers, whose investment in the resource is paying off. ""This could be a turning point in Italian education,"" she says, ""and a chance to create innovative methods. ""Other schools may struggle because perhaps their teachers aren't trained. We're supporting those that ask for our help, as there are very few like us."" Some schools are recording entire lessons on WhatsApp, while others are incorporating the news into their lessons, one teacher telling an Italian newspaper that she'd asked pupils to come up with stories about ""the monster of coronavirus"". She added that ""facing coronavirus helps overcome fear"". Rome in crisis: A pedestrian area near St Peter's Square is almost deserted Italians are adjusting to the crisis - but the reality is hitting hard. And while there doesn't appear to be panic about the spread of cases itself, there is deepening concern about the economic impact. At the Royal Santina Hotel beside Rome's Termini Station, just 20 of the 120 rooms are occupied, and 90% of bookings for March have been cancelled. The corridors feel eerily quiet. ""This is the worst I've seen in my 35 years here,"" says owner Giuseppe Roscioli. ""It's the first time that we've lost almost all the international market - from the US, Asia and the Middle East - as well as the domestic market from Italian tourists and group bookings."" What will happen if the situation continues? ""I have the key - I can lock the door,"" he says. Empty shelves in a Milan shop: The scare has triggered some panic-buying Italy's tourism sector is now predicted to lose â¬7.4bn (Â£6.4bn; $8.3bn) as a result of the outbreak. From the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain, Rome's must-see sights are being seen by so few. ""I thought it would be fuller than it is,"" says Jill Saunderson from the UK, while enjoying St Peter's Square. ""All the waiters we've spoken to are petrified for their livelihoods.

UK will leave EU aviation safety regulator,"The UK will leave the European aviation safety regulator after the Brexit transition period, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has confirmed. He said UK membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency - responsible for certifying the airworthiness of planes - would end on 31 December. He said the UK's Civil Aviation Authority would ""bring expertise home"". But the owner of British Airways said the CAA lacked world-class knowledge and could not be ready in time. Mr Shapps told Aviation Week,externalmuch of the Cologne-based European Aviation Safety Agency's (EASA) expertise came from the UK and that a lot of its leaders were British. He said the agency's powers would revert to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) ""and the expertise will need to come home to do that, but we'll do it in a gradual way"". The trade body ADS - which represents more than 1,100 UK businesses in the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors - told the BBC the decision could potentially mean products and designs would need to be certified more than once. For example, EASA is responsible for certifying commercial aircraft for service across the EU and some non-EU European countries. When the UK ends its membership of EASA, it may need to certify aircraft separately itself. Brexit: What happens next? Aerospace industry seeks Brexit reassurance Aviation regulator's no-deal plan 'rebuffed' ADS has estimated that it would take 10 years and cost up to Â£40m annually to create a UK safety authority with all the expertise of EASA, against a current contribution to the European agency of Â£1m to Â£4m a year. It claimed a new regulatory regime could put jobs in the sector at risk. ""We have been clear that continued participation in EASA is the best option to maintain the competitiveness of our Â£36bn aerospace industry and our access to global export markets,"" the trade body said. It added that the UK's influence within EASA ""contributes to raising standards in global aviation"" and helped make the industry ""attractive to the investment it needs"". British Airways owner IAG said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision and said the Civil Aviation Authority ""does not have the expertise required to operate as a world class safety and technical regulator"". IAG said: ""The CAA will require fundamental restructuring from top to bottom which will take time. There is no way that it can be done by 31 December."" Airlines UK, which represents carriers including EasyJet and Ryanair, said its members supported continued membership of EASA - but not at the risk of the UK becoming a ""dumb follower of EU rules"". It urged the government to begin negotiations on an air safety agreement with the EU so it could be ready by the end of the year. The Department for Transport said: ""Being a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency is not compatible with the UK having genuine economic and political independence. ""We will maintain world-leading safety standards for industry, with the Civil Aviation Authority taking over these responsibilities, and will continue to work with colleagues in the EU to establish a new regulatory relationship.""

Girl raped by serial sex attacker 'feels failed',"Joseph McCann was found guilty of 37 offences against 11 victims A teenage girl who was raped by serial sex attacker Joseph McCann has said she feels ""failed in every single way"". The 17-year-old and her younger brother were both attacked after McCann tied up their mother in their home in May. The girl told the BBC she now lives in a ""constant fear of everything"" and is ""confused"" as to why the 35-year-old was not recalled to prison. It comes after a report saidprobation staff were warned he posed a risk of sexual offending. The report disclosed that in 2011, when McCann was in prison for burglary, police shared information dating to 2003 and suggested he ""might pose a risk of sexual harm and exploitation to teenage girls"". In January 2019, he was released from prison and went on to target 11 women and children across two weeks in parts of Watford, London, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire. McCann was sentenced in December to 33 life sentences after being convicted of 37 offences. This video can not be played Footage shows dramatic Joseph McCann police chase The teenage victim said she had ""lost everything"", including her Lancashire family home which McCann tricked his way into on 5 May to carry out the sex attacks. She said: ""Before any of this happened I had a lovely home, a close family and a really good job. ""After this happened I lost everything, including my family home of 12 years and my relationship with my family. ""I struggle to sleep each night and live in fear. I can't be in places on my own and my confidence has gone down since the incident."" The girl said she had ""developed really bad anxiety and I have bad days when I do not want to do anything"". ""There's not a day goes by where I don't think of what happened and that man feels no remorse for his actions,"" she said. ""My whole life will be controlled from what happened, living in constant fear of everything. I constantly feel like my life is in danger, I question situations during the day and feel nervous around people."" This video can not be played Elderly victim of serial rapist Joseph McCann tells of her ordeal The teenager and her younger brother were both raped by McCann before the girl was able to escape by jumping out of a first-floor window and then freeing her family. During thetrial she said she feared becoming McCann's ""sex slave"". ""I was my family's hero and saved our lives - that's what gets me up each morning,"" the girl said. ""Knowing I have my whole life to live and I got away from such a dangerous man shows I have courage and the fact I was able to keep my brother and mother safe is enough for me."" Serial rapist McCann given 33 life sentences The failures that let Joseph McCann out of prison 'I watched as net closed in on serial rapist' The girl also said she felt ""angered and upset"" by failings from the probation service. ""It causes anger and so much upset for everyone that the probation service failed to keep us safe. He has previous for sexual abuse and nothing was acted on,"" she said. On Thursday, the Ministry of Justice said the chief inspector of probation, Justin Russell, would be asked to carry out an independent review of the National Probation Service's management of McCann and how the process of recalling offenders to prison was working.

A giant cockerel in Yorkshire: What's the big idea? âââââ,"Should current events leave you unexpectedly at a loose end, allow me to point you in the direction ofSol LeWitt's excellent short essay on Conceptual art, which he wrote for Art Forum magazine in 1967,external. I think it is possibly the best article ever written concerning a notoriously slippery art genre, about which LeWitt knew a great deal, as he himself was a Conceptual artist (he also wrote well, with a lively style that pulls you through the more arcane passages). As the name implies, Conceptual art is all about the idea, its physical realisation being secondary: the concept is the artwork, not the object. This can mean, for anyone in the market for piece of Conceptual art, there's a very real risk of going home with a scrap of paper on which a set of instructions have been scribbled (because the idea is the art), rather than its representation in a splendid sculpture or painting. It's like a trip to Ikea, but there's no flat-pack kit. It is said, possibly apocryphally, that a very famous contemporary artist adopted the same approach when it came to paintings produced by his assistants following his style-guide. He would sign the finished canvasses and date them with the year he came up with the idea for the composition, not the year they were painted by an assistant. The upshot of which, apparently, was that he ended up signing artworks with a date before the person who actually painted the canvas was born. And so it goes with Conceptual art, which has been on my mind this week following a trip to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park to see the newly installed monumental artworks by Portugal's Joana Vasconcelos, who describes herself as a Conceptual artist. It is fair to say her work is the polar opposite to LeWitt's in terms of aesthetic. He wanted to take art back to its bare essentials, with his cool monochromatic wall paintings and austere geometric sculptures. Vasconcelos, on the other hand, is all about vibrant colour and baroque kitsch. Three x Four x Three sculpture (1984) by Conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, who said ""The idea becomes a machine that makes the art"" I suspect her massive cockerel (Pop Galo, 2016), which you encounter as you enter the park, would have appalled the late American artist. The lively collection of ceramic tiles and LED lights covering its body would have been bad enough, but the music emanating from it would have tipped him over the edge. ""Too much!"" he'd say while making a beeline for James Turrell's beautifully minimalist Deer Shelter Skyspace, in which you sit against a concrete wall and look up at the sky through a rectangle cut in the roof. Pop Galo, 2016, a huge cockerel that makes a noise and lights up in the dark James Turrell's minimalist Deer Shelter Skyspace, 2006, contrasts with the colourful spectacle of Pop Galo LeWitt was forthright about the elephant traps awaiting Conceptual artists. Gigantic, colourful, expressionistic artworks were at the top of his list of no-nos. ""When the viewer is dwarfed by the larger size of a piece this domination emphasizes the physical and emotive power of the form at the expense of losing the idea of the piece. ""New materials are one of the great afflictions of contemporary art. Some artists confuse new materials with new ideas. There is nothing worse than seeing art that wallows in gaudy baubles."" That's not how Joana Vasconcelos sees it. She works with whatever materials are demanded by her concept, which might have gaudiness at its heart. SolitÃ¡rio (2018) is a 7m (23ft) high wedding ring made out of gold-alloy car wheel rims topped off with a stack of whisky glasses shaped like a diamond. It is tasteless in the extreme. A vulgar blot on the landscape, framing the bucolic Yorkshire countryside with a crassness that seeks to comment on our age of rabid materialism. That is the artist's intention, gaudy is her concept. Solitaire, 2018 (includes crystal whisky glasses), which the artist says is an intentionally ""bling, bling, vulgar"" reflection of our consumer society A different idea calls for different materials. I'll Be Your Mirror (2018-20) is a sculpture about identities and perception. It consists of a series of overlapping, gilded, two-side mirrors arranged into the shape of a huge Venetian mask (an artwork that has taken on added meaning with the advent of Covid-19). It's not exactly subtle, but what's wrong with being direct? Conceptual art doesn't have to be a puzzle. But it needs layers that take it beyond a static one-liner, which this work does both literally and metaphorically. Joana Vasconcelos and Will Gompertz behind the mask (I'll be Your Mirror, 2018-20) which Joana says is used in many cultures to protect yourself from evil, and also to protect yourself from yourself That cannot be said for all the works on display in this outdoor/indoor exhibition. An oversized ice cream cone called Tutti Frutti (2011) is underwhelming. Vasconcelos has made it from children's plastic sand moulds of apples, pears, croissants and strawberries. It isn't very interesting to look at, and the concept (sugary seduction, greed, and hollowness) is laboured. The same can be said for Marilyn (2011), a giant pair of stilettos created out of stainless-steel saucepans, for which no explanation is needed. Tutti Frutti, 2011, made with plastic sand moulds and stainless steel Marilyn, 2011, stilettos created with stainless steel pans, lids and concrete Her best work is the gallery-filling Valkyrie Marina Rinaldi (2014), a biomorphic goddess covered in the materials from the fashion house Max Mara, with whom the artist was collaborating. It clearly draws on Louise Bourgeois's knitted figures and Niki de Saint Phalle's extravagant, blobby women - but it has its own heart and soul: not least its joyful celebration of all those materials and associated crafts about which LeWitt was sniffy. Valkyrie Marina Rinaldi, 2014 (sculpted from handmade woollen crochet, inflatable fans, power supply unit and steel cables) You can see the influence of Niki de Saint Phalle's monumental figures in Joana Vasconcelos' art I think there is room for an expressionistic artist like Joana Vasconcelos in the Conceptual art club. Ideas can have feelings. But LeWitt is spot on with much of what he says, particularly in his pithy summation to his essay: ""Conceptual art is good only when the idea is good."" Vasconcelos's Instagram-friendly art is full of good ideas but lacks any great ones.

A giant cockerel in Yorkshire: What's the big idea? âââââVasconcelos's Instagram-friendly art is is all about vibrant colour and baroque kitsch.,"Should current events leave you unexpectedly at a loose end, allow me to point you in the direction ofSol LeWitt's excellent short essay on Conceptual art, which he wrote for Art Forum magazine in 1967,external. I think it is possibly the best article ever written concerning a notoriously slippery art genre, about which LeWitt knew a great deal, as he himself was a Conceptual artist (he also wrote well, with a lively style that pulls you through the more arcane passages). As the name implies, Conceptual art is all about the idea, its physical realisation being secondary: the concept is the artwork, not the object. This can mean, for anyone in the market for piece of Conceptual art, there's a very real risk of going home with a scrap of paper on which a set of instructions have been scribbled (because the idea is the art), rather than its representation in a splendid sculpture or painting. It's like a trip to Ikea, but there's no flat-pack kit. It is said, possibly apocryphally, that a very famous contemporary artist adopted the same approach when it came to paintings produced by his assistants following his style-guide. He would sign the finished canvasses and date them with the year he came up with the idea for the composition, not the year they were painted by an assistant. The upshot of which, apparently, was that he ended up signing artworks with a date before the person who actually painted the canvas was born. And so it goes with Conceptual art, which has been on my mind this week following a trip to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park to see the newly installed monumental artworks by Portugal's Joana Vasconcelos, who describes herself as a Conceptual artist. It is fair to say her work is the polar opposite to LeWitt's in terms of aesthetic. He wanted to take art back to its bare essentials, with his cool monochromatic wall paintings and austere geometric sculptures. Vasconcelos, on the other hand, is all about vibrant colour and baroque kitsch. Three x Four x Three sculpture (1984) by Conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, who said ""The idea becomes a machine that makes the art"" I suspect her massive cockerel (Pop Galo, 2016), which you encounter as you enter the park, would have appalled the late American artist. The lively collection of ceramic tiles and LED lights covering its body would have been bad enough, but the music emanating from it would have tipped him over the edge. ""Too much!"" he'd say while making a beeline for James Turrell's beautifully minimalist Deer Shelter Skyspace, in which you sit against a concrete wall and look up at the sky through a rectangle cut in the roof. Pop Galo, 2016, a huge cockerel that makes a noise and lights up in the dark James Turrell's minimalist Deer Shelter Skyspace, 2006, contrasts with the colourful spectacle of Pop Galo LeWitt was forthright about the elephant traps awaiting Conceptual artists. Gigantic, colourful, expressionistic artworks were at the top of his list of no-nos. ""When the viewer is dwarfed by the larger size of a piece this domination emphasizes the physical and emotive power of the form at the expense of losing the idea of the piece. ""New materials are one of the great afflictions of contemporary art. Some artists confuse new materials with new ideas. There is nothing worse than seeing art that wallows in gaudy baubles."" That's not how Joana Vasconcelos sees it. She works with whatever materials are demanded by her concept, which might have gaudiness at its heart. SolitÃ¡rio (2018) is a 7m (23ft) high wedding ring made out of gold-alloy car wheel rims topped off with a stack of whisky glasses shaped like a diamond. It is tasteless in the extreme. A vulgar blot on the landscape, framing the bucolic Yorkshire countryside with a crassness that seeks to comment on our age of rabid materialism. That is the artist's intention, gaudy is her concept. Solitaire, 2018 (includes crystal whisky glasses), which the artist says is an intentionally ""bling, bling, vulgar"" reflection of our consumer society A different idea calls for different materials. I'll Be Your Mirror (2018-20) is a sculpture about identities and perception. It consists of a series of overlapping, gilded, two-side mirrors arranged into the shape of a huge Venetian mask (an artwork that has taken on added meaning with the advent of Covid-19). It's not exactly subtle, but what's wrong with being direct? Conceptual art doesn't have to be a puzzle. But it needs layers that take it beyond a static one-liner, which this work does both literally and metaphorically. Joana Vasconcelos and Will Gompertz behind the mask (I'll be Your Mirror, 2018-20) which Joana says is used in many cultures to protect yourself from evil, and also to protect yourself from yourself That cannot be said for all the works on display in this outdoor/indoor exhibition. An oversized ice cream cone called Tutti Frutti (2011) is underwhelming. Vasconcelos has made it from children's plastic sand moulds of apples, pears, croissants and strawberries. It isn't very interesting to look at, and the concept (sugary seduction, greed, and hollowness) is laboured. The same can be said for Marilyn (2011), a giant pair of stilettos created out of stainless-steel saucepans, for which no explanation is needed. Tutti Frutti, 2011, made with plastic sand moulds and stainless steel Marilyn, 2011, stilettos created with stainless steel pans, lids and concrete Her best work is the gallery-filling Valkyrie Marina Rinaldi (2014), a biomorphic goddess covered in the materials from the fashion house Max Mara, with whom the artist was collaborating. It clearly draws on Louise Bourgeois's knitted figures and Niki de Saint Phalle's extravagant, blobby women - but it has its own heart and soul: not least its joyful celebration of all those materials and associated crafts about which LeWitt was sniffy. Valkyrie Marina Rinaldi, 2014 (sculpted from handmade woollen crochet, inflatable fans, power supply unit and steel cables) You can see the influence of Niki de Saint Phalle's monumental figures in Joana Vasconcelos' art I think there is room for an expressionistic artist like Joana Vasconcelos in the Conceptual art club. Ideas can have feelings. But LeWitt is spot on with much of what he says, particularly in his pithy summation to his essay: ""Conceptual art is good only when the idea is good."" Vasconcelos's Instagram-friendly art is full of good ideas but lacks any great ones.

UK will leave EU aviation safety regulatorTransport Secretary Grant Shapps says the UK will leave the European Aviation Safety Agency in December.Business,"The UK will leave the European aviation safety regulator after the Brexit transition period, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has confirmed. He said UK membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency - responsible for certifying the airworthiness of planes - would end on 31 December. He said the UK's Civil Aviation Authority would ""bring expertise home"". But the owner of British Airways said the CAA lacked world-class knowledge and could not be ready in time. Mr Shapps told Aviation Week,externalmuch of the Cologne-based European Aviation Safety Agency's (EASA) expertise came from the UK and that a lot of its leaders were British. He said the agency's powers would revert to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) ""and the expertise will need to come home to do that, but we'll do it in a gradual way"". The trade body ADS - which represents more than 1,100 UK businesses in the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors - told the BBC the decision could potentially mean products and designs would need to be certified more than once. For example, EASA is responsible for certifying commercial aircraft for service across the EU and some non-EU European countries. When the UK ends its membership of EASA, it may need to certify aircraft separately itself. Brexit: What happens next? Aerospace industry seeks Brexit reassurance Aviation regulator's no-deal plan 'rebuffed' ADS has estimated that it would take 10 years and cost up to Â£40m annually to create a UK safety authority with all the expertise of EASA, against a current contribution to the European agency of Â£1m to Â£4m a year. It claimed a new regulatory regime could put jobs in the sector at risk. ""We have been clear that continued participation in EASA is the best option to maintain the competitiveness of our Â£36bn aerospace industry and our access to global export markets,"" the trade body said. It added that the UK's influence within EASA ""contributes to raising standards in global aviation"" and helped make the industry ""attractive to the investment it needs"". British Airways owner IAG said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision and said the Civil Aviation Authority ""does not have the expertise required to operate as a world class safety and technical regulator"".

"Storm payouts average out at Â£32,000 per household","Taff Street in Pontypridd was left underwater after heavy rain Insurers are set to pay out an average Â£32,000 per household for flood claims after destructive UK winter storms, an industry body has said. The bill to clean up after storms Dennis and Ciara is set to total more than Â£360m, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said. About Â£214m is going on flood claims and Â£149m on wind damage. However, affected people should not expect a hike in premiums, a spokeswoman said. This is because insurers use some of their premiums to pay a levy into a scheme each year - the government's Flood Re fund - which helps them pay out for flood damage. In the immediate aftermath of the two storms, insurers paid more than Â£7.7m in emergency funds to get home owners and businesses back on track, including paying for temporary accommodation when homes were uninhabitable.

The clean-up operation is still under way in affected areas. On Thursday, Environment Agency said it was pumping nearly one billion litres of water a day out of areas of East Yorkshire which were hit by floods. Scores of homes were affected when the River Aire overflowed due to the storms. Mark Shepherd, the ABI's head of general insurance policy, said: ""With some properties still under water, making emergency payments and arranging emergency alternative temporary accommodation or trading premises is very much a live issue."" The last time several significant storms struck in quick succession was in December 2015, when storms Desmond, Eva and Frank  caused damage to the cost of Â£1.3bn, the ABI said. It also put the cost of flooding in parts of south Yorkshire and the Midlands in November last year at more than Â£110m. ABI spokesman Malcolm Tarling said: ""Insurers take these events on the chin. They expect flooding and bad weather to occur, and they plan for it. ""Insurers will look at the predictions for bad weather. They know that flooding is going to get worse and become more significant, and insurers will take that into account when they set their prices."" In 2019,researchers said that climate changewould drive a ""robust increase"" in UK flooding.

Ronaldinho arrested over fake passport claims,"Ronaldinho (C) and his brother Roberto Assis (R) arrive to face a judge at a court in Asuncion Former Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho and his brother appeared in court on Saturday over allegations the pair used fake passports to enter Paraguay. Prosecutors say the brothers were given the false documents when they landed in the capital Asuncion on Wednesday. The pair were taken into custody on Friday, just hours after a judge refused to uphold a prosecutor's proposal for an alternative punishment. The prosecutor argued the brothers had been tricked. They deny any wrongdoing. Ronaldinho 'taken by surprise', prosecutor says The pair, who were questioned by police, said they thought the passports were a courtesy gesture. Officers later searched their hotel. At the court in Asuncion on Saturday, a judge ordered that Ronaldinho and his brother, Roberto Assis, be placed in pre-trial detention. Photograph of a Paraguayan ID document shared by the Paraguayan authorities bearing Ronaldo's name In July 2019, the player reportedly had his Brazilian and Spanish passports confiscated over unpaid taxes and non-payment of fines for illegally building on a nature reserve in Brazil. Ronaldinho retires from football ""I respect his sporting popularity but the law must also be respected. No matter who you are, the law still applies"",Paraguay's Interior Minister Euclides Acevedo told local media,externalthis week. The 39-year-old had travelled to Paraguay to promote a book and a campaign for underprivileged children.

Rogue estate agent 'left me in limbo',"Su Francis says a rogue estate agent left her unable to sell her home People who have had problems with estate agents are backing calls for the government to ""get on"" with introducing reforms aimed at improving standards. Su Francis, 65, from Buckinghamshire, says she's been left ""in limbo"" after a bad experience with her estate agent. She wants ministers to introduce reformsoutlined in a report,externallast summer by Lord Best, the former leader of the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust. The government said it remained committed to raising standards. Su told BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme that she was visited by a so-called quick sale estate agent who pressured her into signing a contract. However, the full details of the contract were only revealed a couple of days later during a phone call from its office. ""They were quite hard about [me] signing up. Subsequently I found out I was signed up to them for a year,"" she says. ""They provided no service whatsoever, they provided no viewings, nobody came to see it [the house] and when I phoned them it was just recorded messages. ""It's also left me quite worried about who I should take on and whether or not I can trust people. ""It's left me in limbo because I haven't been able to sell my house. As far as the financial implications, until I can sell my house, it's impossible for me to plan for my financial future."" Julia Armstrong also contacted Money Box about her experience with a rogue estate agent, who lowered the sale price of her house without her permission. ""A year later we have put our house on the market again and every viewing has said it's overpriced now because it was listed at Â£50,000 less last year,"" she says. ""It was a shock to us and our new agents advised us to drop the price this year immediately by Â£30,000 [to try to get people to even consider it]."" She added she was very unhappy that the new valuation ""has been affected by the short period more than a year ago when it [our house] was undervalued by one of these agents"". Home sellers risk losing money over quick sales 'Freehold charges cost us our dream home' In 2018, Lord Best was asked by the government to come up with proposals to help clean up the industry, covering estate agents across the UK and lettings and management agents in England and Wales. His report made a series of recommendations. These included creating a new independent regulator, and making sure that all property agents (estate, lettings and management agents) are licensed, have  passed qualifications and are signed up to a code of practice. Lord Best says acting as a property agent without a licence should be a criminal offence. ""At the moment anybody can set up shop and the next morning be operating as an agent,"" he says. ""They can take quite a lot of money off you... and they aren't regulated. ""Lawyers or accountants have proper qualifications and are properly regulated but not property agents."" Lord Best had this message for ministers: ""We need you to get your head around these recommendations and get on with it."" Su Francis is among those backing Lord Best and his recommendations. ""[Rogue agents] leave people very vulnerable, particularly elderly people,"" she says. ""Lord Best's recommendations should be implemented, the government should be listening... and people will be harmed and will be thousands of pounds out of pocket if this is allowed to continue."" Industry voices are also keen to see the government take action on Lord Best's report. The National Association of Estate Agents, the Association of Residential Letting Agents and the Property Ombudsman are all backing his call for ministers to ""get on"" with implementing his ideas. A statement for the Ministry of Housing said: ""The government is committed to raising professionalism amongst property agents and welcomes the work of the independent Regulation of Property Agents working group, chaired by Lord Best. ""We will respond to the group's final report following careful consideration."" You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme by listening againhere.

"Italy coronavirus death toll jumps to nearly 200Officials say 49 more people have died, marking the country's largest daily increase in fatalities.Europe","Churches have been fumigated in Naples The death toll from the new coronavirus in Italy has risen to 197 after the largest daily increase in fatalities there since the outbreak began. Officials said 49 people had died in 24 hours, while more than 4,600 cases have been reported in total. The country has now reported the most deaths outside of China, where the virus emerged in December. The World Health Organization says more than 101,000 people worldwide have contracted the coronavirus. More than 3,000 people have died - the majority in China. Follow live updates from around the world WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the spread of the virus ""deeply concerning"" and urged all countries to make containment ""their highest priority"". EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Officials announced the record daily death toll in a statement on Friday. They said the number could not be officially confirmed until health officials had ""established the actual cause of death"". The national health institute said the average age of those who have died was 81, with the majority suffering from underlying health problems. An estimated 72% of all those who have died were men. According to government data, 4.25% of individuals confirmed to have the coronavirus in Italy have died, the highest rate in the world. The country has one of the world's oldest populations.

All professional sport, including Serie A football matches, will also be played behind closed doors for a month. The BBC's Rome correspondent Mark Lowen tweeted that a resident in the quarantined Italian town of Codogno told him the most upsetting thing for many people there was that funerals were not being permitted for coronavirus victims because of the need to limit gatherings. ""Priests are saying a couple of prayers - and that's it,"" he wrote. Meanwhile, the Vatican - which reported its first case of the virus on Friday - says the Pope will deliver his Angelus address on Sunday via video, rather than from a window at the Vatican, to avoid drawing a large crowd. The Pope, who has been suffering from a cold, recently tested negative for the coronavirus, Italian media reported. Only China, South Korea and Iran have reported more coronavirus cases than Italy. As of Saturday, South Korea has had 7,041 cases and 46 deaths. Iran has had about 4,740 cases and 145 deaths though these figures are believed to be underestimated. Florida reported two deaths on Friday, taking the US death toll to 16 with more than 200 confirmed cases. The other fatalities have been in the west-coast states of California and Washington State. It came as US President Donald Trumpsigned an $8.3bn (Â£6.4bn) emergency billto try to combat the outbreak.

Italy coronavirus death toll jumps to nearly 200,"Churches have been fumigated in Naples The death toll from the new coronavirus in Italy has risen to 197 after the largest daily increase in fatalities there since the outbreak began. Officials said 49 people had died in 24 hours, while more than 4,600 cases have been reported in total. The country has now reported the most deaths outside of China, where the virus emerged in December. The World Health Organization says more than 101,000 people worldwide have contracted the coronavirus. More than 3,000 people have died - the majority in China. Follow live updates from around the world WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the spread of the virus ""deeply concerning"" and urged all countries to make containment ""their highest priority"". EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Officials announced the record daily death toll in a statement on Friday. They said the number could not be officially confirmed until health officials had ""established the actual cause of death"". The national health institute said the average age of those who have died was 81, with the majority suffering from underlying health problems. An estimated 72% of all those who have died were men. According to government data, 4.25% of individuals confirmed to have the coronavirus in Italy have died, the highest rate in the world. The country has one of the world's oldest populations. The government this week ordered the closure of all schools for 10 days as it battles to contain the outbreak. Parents stressed by Italy's coronavirus shutdown A cancer patient's border plea: What happened next? Is India prepared for a coronavirus outbreak? All professional sport, including Serie A football matches, will also be played behind closed doors for a month. The BBC's Rome correspondent Mark Lowen tweeted that a resident in the quarantined Italian town of Codogno told him the most upsetting thing for many people there was that funerals were not being permitted for coronavirus victims because of the need to limit gatherings. ""Priests are saying a couple of prayers - and that's it,"" he wrote. Meanwhile, the Vatican - which reported its first case of the virus on Friday - says the Pope will deliver his Angelus address on Sunday via video, rather than from a window at the Vatican, to avoid drawing a large crowd. The Pope, who has been suffering from a cold, recently tested negative for the coronavirus, Italian media reported. Only China, South Korea and Iran have reported more coronavirus cases than Italy. As of Saturday, South Korea has had 7,041 cases and 46 deaths. Iran has had about 4,740 cases and 145 deaths though these figures are believed to be underestimated. Florida reported two deaths on Friday, taking the US death toll to 16 with more than 200 confirmed cases. The other fatalities have been in the west-coast states of California and Washington State. It came as US President Donald Trumpsigned an $8.3bn (Â£6.4bn) emergency billto try to combat the outbreak. In California, 21 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the Grand Princess cruise ship that is being held off the coast near San Francisco.

"Rogue estate agent 'left me in limbo'The government needs to ""get on"" with improving standards of estate agents, house sellers say.","Su Francis says a rogue estate agent left her unable to sell her home People who have had problems with estate agents are backing calls for the government to ""get on"" with introducing reforms aimed at improving standards. Su Francis, 65, from Buckinghamshire, says she's been left ""in limbo"" after a bad experience with her estate agent. She wants ministers to introduce reformsoutlined in a report,externallast summer by Lord Best, the former leader of the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust. The government said it remained committed to raising standards. Su told BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme that she was visited by a so-called quick sale estate agent who pressured her into signing a contract. However, the full details of the contract were only revealed a couple of days later during a phone call from its office. ""They were quite hard about [me] signing up. Subsequently I found out I was signed up to them for a year,"" she says. ""They provided no service whatsoever, they provided no viewings, nobody came to see it [the house] and when I phoned them it was just recorded messages. ""It's also left me quite worried about who I should take on and whether or not I can trust people. ""It's left me in limbo because I haven't been able to sell my house. As far as the financial implications, until I can sell my house, it's impossible for me to plan for my financial future."" Julia Armstrong also contacted Money Box about her experience with a rogue estate agent, who lowered the sale price of her house without her permission. ""A year later we have put our house on the market again and every viewing has said it's overpriced now because it was listed at Â£50,000 less last year,"" she says. ""It was a shock to us and our new agents advised us to drop the price this year immediately by Â£30,000 [to try to get people to even consider it]."" She added she was very unhappy that the new valuation ""has been affected by the short period more than a year ago when it [our house] was undervalued by one of these agents"". Home sellers risk losing money over quick sales 'Freehold charges cost us our dream home' In 2018, Lord Best was asked by the government to come up with proposals to help clean up the industry, covering estate agents across the UK and lettings and management agents in England and Wales. His report made a series of recommendations. These included creating a new independent regulator, and making sure that all property agents (estate, lettings and management agents) are licensed, have  passed qualifications and are signed up to a code of practice. Lord Best says acting as a property agent without a licence should be a criminal offence. ""At the moment anybody can set up shop and the next morning be operating as an agent,"" he says. ""They can take quite a lot of money off you... and they aren't regulated. ""Lawyers or accountants have proper qualifications and are properly regulated but not property agents."" Lord Best had this message for ministers: ""We need you to get your head around these recommendations and get on with it."" Su Francis is among those backing Lord Best and his recommendations. ""[Rogue agents] leave people very vulnerable, particularly elderly people,"" she says. ""Lord Best's recommendations should be implemented, the government should be listening... and people will be harmed and will be thousands of pounds out of pocket if this is allowed to continue."" Industry voices are also keen to see the government take action on Lord Best's report. The National Association of Estate Agents, the Association of Residential Letting Agents and the Property Ombudsman are all backing his call for ministers to ""get on"" with implementing his ideas. A statement for the Ministry of Housing said: ""The government is committed to raising professionalism amongst property agents and welcomes the work of the independent Regulation of Property Agents working group, chaired by Lord Best. ""We will respond to the group's final report following careful consideration."" You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme by listening againhere.

Mr Cuomo said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had risen from 44 to 76 in the state, with 11 in New York City. Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, the governor said health authorities had been ""aggressively testing"" for coronavirus cases in recent days.

Italy says the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has risen by 36, bringing the total to 233 in the country. Italy has recorded the most deaths of any country outside China, where the virus originated in the city of Wuhan. The number of new coronavirus cases also increased markedly in Italy, from 4,636 to 5,883, authorities said. The new figures were announced by Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy's Civil
Protection Agency, at a news conference on Saturday. Of those originally infected by the virus, 589 had
fully recovered while 567 were being treated in intensive care, Mr Borrelli said. The outbreak started in Italy's northern regions a few weeks ago, but has spread to other parts of the country. Italy has the highest coronavirus death toll outside China A hotel in Beit Jala has been placed under quarantine Thirteen US citizens thought to have been exposed to coronavirus are in quarantine in a hotel  near Bethlehem. The church group, who were on a trip to the Holy Land, are working with US and Palestinian authorities to try to get home. ""It was going to be the trip of a lifetime,"" Chris Bell, lead pastor of the 3Circle Church in Fairhope, Alabama, told Reuters. He is there with his wife, Nan, while his three children are being cared for in the US by friends and family. The group is awaiting test results, he said, and no-one had left their hotel floor. Palestinian security forces wearing gloves and masks are stationed around the hotel in Beit Jala. Palestinian authorities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank declared a state of emergency after seven cases were confirmed in Bethlehem on Thursday. Hand sanitisers have been appearing at major sports events in the UK, including at Twickenham on Saturday for the Six Nations game. Next week they will be in horse racing action at Cheltenham for the jump season's most important week. Big events have not been closed to the public in the UK so far - as some have in Italy.   Hand sanitiser wall at Twickenham A US Navy sailor stationed in Italy is the first US service member in Europe to test positive for coronavirus, the US military command has said. The sailor is currently ""restricted to their residence"" and receiving medical care in the southern Italian city of Naples, a statement said. Military health professionals are carrying out a contact investigation to see whether any other staff were also carrying coronavirus, it said. Last month, US Forces Korea said a 23-year-old soldier based in South Korea had tested positive.

Cypriot authorities had closed four of the eight checkpoints on the line last Saturday but activists for the group Unite Cyprus are demanding they be reopened. Police said officers made ""limited use"" of personal tear gas spray to control the crowds gathered on either side of the Ledra Street crossing in Nicosia. Cyprus is effectively partitioned, with the northern third run by a Turkish Cypriot government and the southern two-thirds by an internationally recognised government led by Greek Cypriots. The Xinjia hotel has been reduced to a pile of rubble The Xinjia hotel in the Chinese city of Quanzhou has been reduced to rubble. The five-storey, 80-room hotel, which was being used as a quarantine facility monitoring people who had had close contact with coronavirus patients, collapsed on Saturday night, trapping at least 70 people. Combing through the debris, rescuers are still trying to recover people who were in the building when it fell. Dramatic pictures show rescuers pulling people from the remains of the hotel, carrying some on stretchers and helping others down ladders. At least 32 people have been pulled out so far, authorities say. Other images show the extent of the hotel's collapse. Its cause is not yet known.

Local reports say the pair are employees of four-star hotel, the Kuredi Island Resort. The government has been taking precautions to try to prevent the spread of the virus, including a temporary ban on all cruise ships entering and docking in the Maldives. Earlier (see our post from 14:27), we told you about the ban
on pre-match handshakes at Premier League matches. In the spirit of fair play, players resorted to fist-bumps
instead. Here are some pictures of the fist-bumps in action. Arsenal and West Ham players adhered to the ban on handshakes Watford's Troy Deeney and Crystal Palace's Patrick van Aanholt bump fists Norwich City goalkeeper Tim Krul's gloves came in handy But not everyone adhered to the handshake prohibition. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was pictured shaking hands with referee Paul Tierney after the match. The BBC Sport live blog reported that some players were shaking hands after the final whistle too. UK health authorities will not be pleased. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp shakes hands with referee Paul Tierney Here's a rare bit of good news with regard to the outbreak in Iran, one of the worst outside China. The World Health Organization's representative there, Dr
Christoph Hamelmann, says it has seen tremendous progress at hospitals across the country in recent days. He said Iran had made facilities available in every province for
the treatment of patients with Covid-19. Speaking in the capital, Tehran, he also said he expected international sanctions
affecting the health sector would not be fully implemented while the outbreak
continued. Iran has confirmed almost 6,000 coronavirus infections and 145 deaths but experts fear the official numbers may be underestimated. Several politicians and senior officials have been affected and a second member of parliament is now reported to have died. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have quarantined some 1,262 soldiers over suspicions they may have contracted the coronavirus, reports say. The IDF said on Friday that most of the soldiers currently in quarantine had recently returned from holiday abroad, the Jerusalem Post reported. Some, however, had come into contact with people confirmed to have the virus, the IDF said. The IDF said 189 soldiers had already completed a 14-day period of mandatory self-quarantine. Only one Israeli soldier has tested positive so far. That soldier is one of 21 confirmed cases of people with the virus in Israel. In a move to stem the spread of the virus, IDF troops have been forbidden from visiting countries with outbreaks. Recent Israeli military drills have been cancelled too.  More than 1,200 members of the IDF have been told to self-isolate at home If you're planning a trip to Russia - or more specifically, the country's capital - you should probably be aware of this, from our political correspondent Jonathan Blake: The UK government is warning people travelling to Moscow that they may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, due to the coronavirus outbreak. Updated travel advice,externalsays there are reports in Russia, citing official sources, that the UK will be added to a list of countries which already includes China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Germany and Spain - for which special measures apply. The advice also states that passengers may be asked to sign a document agreeing to self-isolate. It says that in ""a small number of cases"" foreign visitors have been placed in enforced quarantine if they do not comply. A British couple who caught the virus on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship are still unable to return to the UK. The Diamond Princess, you might recall, was put under quarantine in Japan for two weeks in February due to an outbreak onboard. Hundreds of people on the ship caught the virus during the quarantine period. David and Sally Abel began filming a YouTube video diary of their experiences when they were stuck on the ship and have continued since they were sent to hospital. Mr Abel said his wife's latest test had come back negative but his was positive. ""Sally is now totally all clear, good to return to the UK. But she won't because I have had a positive,"" he said inthe couple's latest vlog,external. ""I have now got to go back to square one. I have another test on Monday that is more than likely going to be negative."" He said Sally was no longer in medical care but that authorities had ""agreed to allow her to remain here so we can be company for one another"". Pictures of Lu Huejin crying as she tried to get her 26-year-old daughter out of locked-down Hubei province for leukaemia treatment in neighbouring Jiangxi went viral. ""She needs to have her treatment. But they won't let us through,"" Ms Lu told two reporters who found her on a bridge of the Yangtze river. ""All I want to do is save her life."" The BBC has tracked down the family to find out what happened next. Read the full story, by our reporter Owen Amos, in Singapore, here. The UK government says the number of cases in the country is now 206, an increase of 43. Two patients who tested positive for Covid-19 have so far died in the UK. Both were elderly and had underlying health conditions. The Department of Health said that as of 07:00 on Saturday morning, more than 21,000 people had been tested for the virus. Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer Jennie Harries told the BBC that the UK remained in the ""containment"" phase of controlling the virus. We have some breaking news from China. A hotel has collapsed in south-eastern Fujian province, trapping dozens of people under the rubble, state media has reported. The Xinjia Hotel in the city of Quanzhou collapsed at around 19:30 local time (11:30 GMT) on Saturday. According to the Global Times newspaper, the building was being used to hold people who had been in close contact with others confirmed to have the virus. They were under medical observation. About 70 people were in the building when it collapsed and 32 have been rescued so far, says the newspaper, which belongs to the Chinese Communist Party. It is not yet clear what caused the building to collapse. Expect plenty of fist-bumping on the pitch at football fixtures this weekend. The Premier League and English Football League have agreed to ditch pre-match fair-play handshakes. The teams will still line up as usual but the home team will walk past the away side without shaking hands. Earlier this week the government asked the Premier League to ""step up its contingency planning"" for coronavirus in a letter sent to club bosses. Playing fixtures behind closed doors is the main contingency plan being considered. At present, matches are going ahead as planned. You can read more about how the virus is affecting the world of sport here.   Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor This video can not be played Coronavirus: How is it affecting economies? Travel and leisure are proving particularly vulnerable to the economic impact of coronavirus. Airlines are the most exposed sector. UK-based airline Flybe has collapsed, German flag-carrier Lufthansa plans to cut up to half its capacity, and Norwegian's share price drop 21%. Meanwhile, oil price has also dropped by nearly 10%. What can governments do about it? And what will emerge on the other side of all this? The terrain that emerges, perhaps in months, could look very different, in the way we work, in the technologies that emerge, and in our expectations of what government can do to make life less precarious for millions of vital workers.

Tory group leader 'should lead party in Wales',"Suzy Davies said it has been unclear who has had the authority to deal ""swiftly and fairly"" with controversy The way the Welsh Conservative Party has handled recent controversies shows its assembly group leader should run the party in Wales, an AM has said. Suzy Davies said it has been unclear who has had the authority to deal ""swiftly and fairly"" with controversy. The assembly member for the South West Wales region said the party in Wales has had a ""difficult year"" despite its general election performance. Paul Davies has been assembly group leader since September 2018. There has long been a feeling from some in the party that the person in that role should also lead the party in Wales. Currently leadership is shared between Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative chairman Lord Davies of Gower, and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart. But it is unclear which of the three is the party's most senior politician in Wales. In recent months the Welsh Conservatives have been dealing with a series of controversies. Boris Johnson urges Tories to 'unblock nostrils of Welsh dragon' Who is new Welsh Tory assembly leader Paul Davies? 'PM's successor will resolve status of Welsh leader' Its Vale of Glamorgan candidate for next year's Senedd election, Ross England, wasdeselected in January over his role in the collapse of a rape trial. Last month, a lawyer for Monmouth AMNick Ramsay said he is considering further legal actionagainst the party over his suspension. And Bridgend MP Jamie Wallis has been criticised over hisalleged involvement in a ""sugar daddy"" dating website. Paul Davies beat Suzy Davies to lead the party in the Welsh Assembly Speaking to BBC Wales at the Welsh Conservatives' spring conference in Llangollen, Ms Davies said it was ""obvious"" why Paul Davies,who beat her in the election for the group leadership, should lead the party in Wales. ""He's been chosen by the party to do precisely that. We had a vote less than two year ago when the party was asked who do they want to lead and it was him,"" she said. ""Obviously we had a difficult year - no point denying that. ""But it has not been clear who has had the authority to deal swiftly and fairly with everybody involved in those rather difficult stories and that does nobody any favours, not least the people involved in those situations. ""So we need some clear answers now on who can take decisions, who can make sure things happen and can reassure the party that when things go wrong, there's one person they can turn to to take responsibility."" Ross England has been dropped as a Welsh Conservative candidate for the 2021 Senedd election At the conference on Saturday, Wales Office Minister David TC Davies told Tory activists it was the party's job to remove Labour from office in Cardiff Bay. Referring to the UK's departure from the European Union in January, he said: ""We've already changed the course of history in Britain and we can do it again in Wales."" Mr Davies suggested that if the Welsh Conservatives did not win a majority at the 2021 Senedd election the party could work with Plaid Cymru to oust Labour, but he said there would be no pre-election deals.
