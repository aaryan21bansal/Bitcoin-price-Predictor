"No 'single leap to freedom', minister warns","This video can not be played ""Public transport cannot go back to where it left off"" - Transport Secretary Grant Shapps The government will proceed with ""extreme caution"" exiting lockdown, the transport secretary said as he revealed plans to ""get Britain moving again"". Grant Shapps said the move beyond Covid-19 would be a ""gradual progress"" and not a ""single leap to freedom"". He pledged Â£250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure but would not confirma 14-day quarantine for passengers arriving in the UK. Another 346 UK coronavirus deaths were recorded, taking the total to 31,587. Can cities be reshaped for the world after lockdown? What do I need to know if I fly? Mr Shapps, who was speaking a day before the prime minister is due to address the country on lockdown measures, said there had been unprecedented levels of walking and cycling during the pandemic. He said: ""Whilst it's crucial that we stay at home, when the country does get back to work we need to ask those people to carry on cycling or walking and for them to be joined by many others as well."" Even if the UK transport network was running at full capacity, social distancing rules would mean only one in 10 passengers could travel, he said. Pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle and bus-only corridors will be created in England within weeks as part of a Â£250m emergency fund. It is the first part a Â£2bn package for cycling and walking, which was part of a Â£5bn investment announced in February, the Department for Transport said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? The extra funding is for English local authorities to help alter road networks with the aim of taking pressure off roads and public transport network. Matters concerning cycling and walking are devolved. For example, Wales had legislation in place to boost both activities since 2013, while Scotland announced fundingfor ""active travel infrastructure"" in April,external. The Welsh Government has suggested new policies including road or lane closures with filters for cyclists, 20 mph limits and footway widening. In Scotland, Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, infrastructure and connectivity, told the Scottish parliament his government had put forward a package of support to help local authorities implement ""temporary active travel measures"" to allow people to walk and cycle while physically distancing and keeping safe from traffic. No specific measures have been announced yet in Northern Ireland although Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is expected to appoint a cycling and walking champion. The transport secretary announced an emergency Â£250m fund for cycling and walking improvements Asked by the BBC's Ben Wright aboutreports of 14-day quarantine measures for people entering the country, Mr Shapps said he would not announce anything ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's speech on lockdown measures on Sunday. But deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the virus had an incubation period of up to 14 days, during which symptoms develop. Mr Shapps said: ""Bearing in mind the sacrifice the British people have made over seven weeks and counting, you can't have a situation where someone is asked to stay at home but others can come into the country."" The airline industry has raised concerns about the plans with trade body Airlines UK saying the policy needed ""a credible exit plan"" and should be reviewed weekly. And a spokesman for Heathrow said any measures must be medically effective, meet public expectations and be deliverable by airports. Announcing Â£10m for electric car charging points and extended an e-scooter trial across England, Scotland and Wales, the transport secretary said better air quality had been one of the few benefits of the current crisis. Mr Shapps was also asked about the apparent rise in people going outside which came after warnings against sending out ""mixed messages"" with newspaper reports suggesting sunbathing and picnics could be permitted as early as Monday. He dismissed allegations the government's messaging strategy was confusing, and said ""I think that most people are more than capable of understanding what is meant"". Asked about social distancing in schools, particularly for younger children who may not follow the rules, Mr Shapps said: ""Extreme caution is actually the watchword on this. And we've seen in other countries where second, not quite spikes have come along, but where social distancing has been relaxed and there've been problems, so we will wait to see."" The government did not hit the 100,000 daily testing target for the seventh day running but there were 96,878 tests delivered in the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Friday. The Local Government Association welcomed the transport announcements but said local councils must have ""long-term certainty"" around funding. David Renard, LGA transport spokesman, said: ""Local control over infrastructure and public transport budgets would enable them to deliver the widespread improvements to promote more active travel."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said funding for walking and cycling schemes was important for people who have to return to work and said enabling people to walk and cycle would be ""critical to easing the pressure on our busy public transport network"". RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said the success of the new walking and cycling schemes would depend on motorists' attitudes to short car journeys, and said if e-scooters were to be used as alternative transport to get around cities, safety must be taken into account.

'Moral values should prevail on takeover',"Newcastle United sat 13th in the Premier League when the season was suspended in March Newcastle United and the Premier League must put moral values ahead of financial gains, says the fiancee of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund looks set to finance 80% of a Â£300m takeover of the club. Khashoggi was killed in 2018 with Western intelligence agencies believing that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder - which he denies. ""Moral values should prevail,"" Hatice Cengiz told BBC 5 Live. ""My message would be to the management of Newcastle United and to the decision makers. ""We should consider ethical values, not just financial or political ones. Money cannot buy everything in the world. So the message that will be given to people like Crown Prince is extremely important. ""There should be no place in English football for those credibly accused of atrocities and murder"". The Premier League declined to comment. Fans vow to raise Saudi issues despite support for deal Khashoggi - a dissident Saudi columnist living in self-exile in the United States - had gone to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018, seeking papers to marry Cengiz. Investigators believe that as she waited outside, the 59-year-old was murdered and then dismembered. His remains have never been found. UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard said there was credible evidence that Crown Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials were individually liable. A court in Saudi Arabia last year sentenced five people to death and jailed three others over his murder, while Turkey has separately charged 20 suspects over the murder. ""We don't want this deal to go ahead,"" Cengiz added. ""We are not just talking about the murder of a human being but the efforts to keep all hopes regarding the future, to keep human rights alive, to support justice and to start a transformation in the Middle East. ""This deal seems to be about buying something. But there is a wider picture. Saudi Arabia shows the world its face of reform. But it has another face where the reality is far from what is shown to the world. This is why we want this (deal) to be stopped and not be completed."" Mike Ashley has owned Newcastle since 2007 and put the club up for sale in 2017. The proposed Saudi takeover is thought to be worth some Â£300 million. But it has already caused much controversy. Who are the main people involved in the potential deal? Premier League warned over takeover The Saudi government has been accused of facilitating the theft of Premier League commercial rights, while Amnesty International has criticised the potential deal due to the country's dire human rights record. The country has also been accused of ""sportswashing"", a term used to describe countries that try to improve their international reputation by investing in major teams or hosting big sporting events. But these accusations have been rebuffed by the Saudi government, which claims it wants to get more of its people engaged in sport. Hatice Cengiz has called on the Premier League to block the takeover Cengiz has written to the Premier League to state the takeover should be blocked. In a reply to her letter from chief executive Richard Masters, seen by BBC Sport, he says the Premier League are following ""due processes required by UK law and by the Premier League's own rules"", which ""go beyond those required by UK company law"" and are ""applied with rigour"". But he says he ""appreciates the strength of feeling"" from her and reiterated his condolences. Last month, the Premier League was urged by one of its largest overseas broadcast partners to ""fully interrogate"" Newcastle United's proposed Â£300m takeover. The chief executive of the Qatar-based TV giant beIN Sport, Yousef al-Obaidly, has written to the chairs of top-flight clubs about the deal, which could see the Magpies bought by a Saudi-backed consortium. In the letter, Al-Obaidly accused the Saudi Arabian government of the ""facilitation of the nearthree-year theft of the Premier League's commercial rights- and in turn your club's commercial revenues - through its backing of the huge-scale beoutQ pirate service"". Dan Roan, BBC sports editor It should be decided soon, possibly this week, and yes it will go through. Certainly speak to those close to the consortium and they don't sound too concerned. They can point to the fact that Britain's been happy to do billions of pounds-worth of arms deals with the Saudis over recent years and I think it's significant that the British government the other day did make it clear that it wouldn't stand in the way of this deal, saying it was a matter for the Premier League. The PIF, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, has declined to comment but it's understood its position is that although the Crown Prince is chair of the organisation, he is not involved with it in the day-to-day running so the accusations against him are not directly relevant to this bid. And the owners' and directors' tests the Premier League will be looking at now doesn't appear to have much to say about character. It refers to unspent convictions, but unless there is an obvious and clear link between a person and an offence or that person has been convicted in a court of law, it's difficult to see how they could fail the test.

Global coronavirus cases rise above four million,"Experts warn the infections may actually be higher due to low testing rates in many countries More than four million confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported around the world, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. The global death toll has also risen to above 277,000. The US remains the worst-hit country, accounting for over a quarter of confirmed cases and a third of deaths. Experts warn the true number of infections is likely to be far higher, with low testing rates in many countries skewing the data. Daily death tolls are continuing to drop in some nations, including Spain, but there is concern that easing lockdown restrictions could lead to a ""second wave"" of infections. In addition, governments are bracing for economic fallout as the pandemic hits global markets and supply chains. A senior Chinese official has told local media thatthe pandemic was a ""big test"" that had exposed weaknesses in the country's public health system. The rare admission, from the director of China's National Health Commission, Li Bin, comes after sustained criticism abroad of China's early response. In other recent developments: The UK government will proceed with ""extreme caution""while exiting lockdown restrictions, according to the country's transport secretary. China's president has expressed concern about the threat of the coronavirus to North Koreaand offered help. Former US President Barack Obama hasstrongly criticised Donald Trump over his response to the coronavirus crisis, calling it ""an absolute chaotic disaster"". Billionaire Tesla boss Elon Musk has said he willmove the electric carmaker's headquarters out of Californiabecause of local coronavirus restrictions. Three senior officials in the US are self-isolating after coming into contact with White House staff who tested positive for coronavirus - Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration, and top infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticised for riding a jetski on a lake as the national Congress announced three days of official mourning for victims of the pandemic Health officials in Ghana say more than 500 workers at an industrial facility have tested positive for coronavirus, while the total number of daily cases in the country has jumped by nearly 30% - just a day after authorities said infections had reached its peak. This week, some lockdown measures have begun easing in Italy, once the global epicentre of the pandemic.  Italians have been able to exercise outdoors and visit family members in their region. France has recorded its lowest daily number of coronavirus deaths for more than a month, with 80 deaths over the past 24 hours. Authorities are preparing to ease restrictions from Monday, as is the government in neighbouring Spain. Meanwhile lockdowns are continuing in countries like South Africa, despite calls from opposition parties for it to end. In South Korea, renewed restrictions are being imposed on bars and clubs after a series of transmissions linked to Seoul's leisure district. Russia also cancelled a military parade in Moscow, planned as part of the country's Victory Day celebrations. Instead, President Vladimir Putinhosted a subdued event on Saturday, laying roses at the Eternal Flame war memorial. But despite scientific evidence, leaders of several countries have continued to express scepticism about the virus and the need for lockdowns. In Belarus, thousands of soldiers marched to celebrate Victory Day, as President Alexander Lukashenko rejected calls for tougher measures. British medical journal The Lancet has written a scathing editorial about Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, calling him the biggest threat to his country's ability to contain the spread of coronavirus. Brazil is currently reporting the highest number of cases in Latin America - over 10,000 more on Saturday, bringing the national total to nearly 156,000. But despite the outbreak, President Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the virus' severity and has clashed with governors over lockdown measures. Frustrations about the outbreak turned violent in Afghanistan, andat least six people died during clashes between protesters and security forces. The violence started after demonstrators gathered in Firozkoh, the capital of Ghor province, to complain about the government's perceived failure to help the poor during the pandemic.

"Restrictions 'an enormous ask', says first minister","Mark Drakeford: ""We should all be anxious about how long we can sustain this"" The first minister has acknowledged extending the lockdown is damaging people's sense of mental well-being. Mark Drakeford said ""we should all be anxious"" about how long it can be sustained. He said he hopeschanges to the regulationswill help people ""do the bigger things we're asking of them"". From Monday, people in Wales will be allowed to go out to exercise locally more than once a day and garden centres can reopen. Mr Drakeford said only the ""very smallest and most modest steps"" could be taken because a small increase in thereproduction rate of the viruswould lead to a significant increase in deaths. What do the new lockdown rules mean? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Coronavirus in Wales: Live updates on Saturday What Covid-19 decisions are made in Wales? Speaking on BBC Radio 4'sToday programme, Mr Drakeford said: ""The evidence that we heard from behavioural scientists in making our decisions was that if you can offer people a little bit more freedom at the margin it actually strengthens people's ability and willingness to abide with the major thrust of the restrictions that we still have to ask people in Wales to abide by. This video can not be played New lockdown measures have been announced by the Welsh Government ""So by allowing people to go out to exercise more than once a day, by reopening garden centres, by allowing local authorities to begin to prepare for the reopening of libraries, then, we think, that by doing those modest things, it actually helps people to do the bigger things we're asking of them. ""But, of course, it's an enormous ask we're making, and we should all be anxious about how long we can sustain this because by sustaining it there's other damage being done to people's sense of mental wellbeing and so on.""

Mr Drakeford said his view was the two countries will be ""very much in line with one another."" ""Our new regime won't come in until Monday so that we move in a timely way together across the United Kingdom, and I still think that that is very much the preferable route."" Asked about when schools might reopen, Mark Drakeford said he was ""not convinced"" reopening schools in ""any significant way"" would be right at this point. He added: ""we're not going to be reopening schools in Wales during the next three weeks or indeed in June."" Asked if that meant he was ruling out reopening schools for the whole of June, a spokesman for the first minister said nothing had changed since the education minister's statement on Thursday which stated schoolswould not reopen on 1st June.

Are the five tests being met?,"After Easter, when the government in England announced lockdown was to continue for another three weeks, it set out five tests that had to be met before restrictions were eased. We are now well on the way to lifting them in both England and the rest of the UK. But to what extent are the tests being met? And what is the risk of them lapsing? As soon as images began to emerge in February of hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, making sure the NHS could cope became the first priority. Routine operations were cancelled en masse and large field hospitals - known as Nightingales in England - began to be built. A deal was also struck with the independent sector to use ventilators and beds in private hospitals. Cases peaked in early April - and have been falling ever since. At the peak more than 3,000 Covid admissions were being seen every day. That is now down to under 500 and all the field hospitals are hibernating. Routine work has now been restarted, but the NHS remains on an emergency footing, ready for a second peak. If cases increase again the field hospitals will be re-opened - although with the exception of London, none of these has intensive care facilities. More than 40,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, government data shows. These figure relate to the numbers who die after testing positive for the virus. It does not necessarily mean the virus was the direct cause of their death - although work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that in the overwhelming majority of cases it is. Deaths peaked in early-to-mid-April - and have been falling ever since. The downward trend is uneven because the recording of deaths slows at weekends, so the figures tend to drop then before rising during the week. But when you look at the seven-day average, the trend is clear. The number of newly diagnosed cases in the UK is hovering around the 1,500 mark on most days at the moment. Ministers say this shows infection rates are at manageable levels. At the peak there were around 6,000 positive tests a day, but this was when testing was restricted to certain groups, so was not an accurate measure of the true level of infections. It is estimated in late March there were around 100,000 new infections a day. But even now with widespread testing available, doubts remain whether the true level of infections is being identified. A surveillance programme in England run by the ONS suggests around 4,000 new infections a day are being seen. Part of the problem is that for some the virus leads to such mild symptoms or none at all, that they do not even realise they are infected. That poses a problem keeping on top of the virus because if there are significant numbers of silent spreaders, new -  more serious  - cases could keep popping up. Currently the UK has capacity to provide more than 200,000 tests a day, if you include tests posted out to individuals and care homes. That is a significant improvement on the picture at the start of March - when only around 10,000 a day were being done. Three mega-labs have been opened to process tests, while around 50 drive-through testing centres, 100 military-run mobile units and a home-testing service have been launched to complement the testing done in hospitals. That means there is plenty of capacity - anyone who needs a test can certainly get one. Staff - in hospitals, care homes and, to a lesser extent, other public services - also need personal protective equipment (PPE), such as visors, gowns and masks, to protect them from the virus. The more cases there are, the more demand for kit there will be. In the first weeks of the pandemic, there were serious concerns about the availability of PPE. Some hospitals and care homes were reporting they were struggling to get hold of the equipment they needed. The army was brought in to distribute supplies. The stockpile the government holds for pandemics has been used up, but international and domestic supply routes have improved. Local authority and NHS bosses both say the pressure on PPE has eased. Without a vaccine, this will be a very tricky one to navigate. As well as widespread testing, England has set up a contact-tracing system, with separate services being run by the other UK nations. The idea is that this service will help contain any local flare-ups by getting the close contacts of infected people to self-isolate, to stop further spread. It is still early days for the programme - with even its bosses warning it is not yet ""gold standard"". Originally the army of contact-tracers being employed was meant to be complemented by a tracing app that would alert people when they have been in close contact with an infected individual. This could be particularly useful if people have been seated close to someone on a train, for example. The app has been piloted on the Isle of Wight, but is currently not ready for national roll-out. The UK has come a long way in the past few months. But there are concerns the infection rates are still too high and tests are not being turned around quickly enough, while doubts remain about whether the contact-tracing system will be good enough. But at the end of the day, the easing of restrictions comes down to political judgement. The lockdown itself is harmful - economically, socially and for health. Ministers are taking into account more than just these five tests in the decision-making process. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

Can UK cities be reshaped?,"A new scheme in Milan has re-allocated car parking space for pedestrians and cyclists The UK government isurging the public to walk and cycle to workinstead of using public transport or driving. It comes as people across the UK have told BBC News they are finding it impossible to stay safe outside because our cities were not built for social distancing. How we will travel while maintaining social distancing is one of the biggest challenges the government faces as it seeks to start to lift the lockdown. It has led communities, UK transport groups and public health experts to call for radical changes - some already happening globally - such as wider pavements, traffic restrictions and cycle networks. Such changes would prevent further waves of infections, improve air quality and public health, and help countries achieve their climate goals, they say. The decline in road use during the lockdown has seen dramatic falls in air pollution - an unforeseen benefit of the pandemic - as well as quieter roads for cycling. But social distancing has highlighted the close proximity in which we all live, particularly in urban areas. In Manchester, Deborah Todd has given up on pavements and now walks in the roads with her children; Carrie-Ann Lightley had an accident because pedestrians did not make space for her wheelchair on the pavement in Cumbria; Julie Taylor has to queue to walk through the narrow alleyway outside her home in Wiltshire. And in London, Anne Bookless has stopped going outside altogether because there is no room for her wheelchair. Photos sent to BBC News show obstacles on pavements or queues outside shops Cycling has increased by 22% in places such as Greater Manchester, including those key workers commuting by bike where public transport is closed. When public transport does reopen, capacity will be severely restricted. In London,the Tube will be able to handle less than 15% of its pre-pandemic rush hour peak: 50,000 passengers every 15 minutes, compared with 325,000 before, according to leaked documents seen by the BBC. And if more people travel by car, instead of public transport, road space - already at a premium - will be under even greater pressure. Widened pavements in London this week were welcomed by a walking campaign group and residents ""The crisis has exposed how little space is allocated to people - it's exposed that everyone wants safe streets,"" Chris Boardman, Cycling Commissioner for Manchester and former Olympic cyclist, says. The UK is being urged to follow the lead of cities like Paris, Berlin and New York City and install temporary measures to create space for social distancing. Using temporary traffic orders, councils can widen pavements, install networks of temporary cycle lanes, and close residential streets to through-traffic. ""If we enable people to travel differently, we will protect them now during the crisis, and afterwards, when the public health benefits of more people exercising and breathing in cleaner air kick in. That's how you protect the NHS,"" says Mr Boardman. France offers subsidy to tempt lockdown cyclists How the virus cleared the world's most polluted skies Air pollution linked to raised Covid-19 death risk But banning cars ignores the needs of many road users, says Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA): ""Selective bans will have detrimental impacts on all other roads, add to congestion and journey times as well as increase pollution and CO2 emissions,"" he argues. Scientists warn we will need to practise social distancing for at least the next 12-18 months. Public transport will be severely reduced, meaning commuters will need to find other ways to travel. There are signs people will turn to their cars in greater numbers than pre-lockdown:56% of drivers currently without a car plan to buy one post-lockdown,external, according to car sales company AutoTrader. In Wuhan, China,private car usage nearly doubled when lockdown ended,external, rising from 34% before the outbreak to 66% after lockdown. ""There is an avalanche of private car usage coming if we don't do something about it,"" says Leo Murray from climate action charity Possible, which campaigns for green transport. In the UK's most polluted urban areas, where two studies suggest theair quality is putting people at higher risk of dying from Covid-19, there is a heightened sense of urgency. Eight ways the lockdown has changed the UK People in cities such as London, Birmingham, and Glasgow are already struggling withrespiratory disease and heart attacks linked to air pollution. If car use soars, it will be catastrophic for public health and well-being, Mr Murray suggests, as well as for the climate change goals that require a 50% decline in private car use in the UK. ""There is a real incentive to keep our respiratory health as good as possible. Walking and cycling is the way to keep London moving in a safe and socially distanced way,"" says Caroline Russell, London Assembly and Islington councillor for the Green Party. Just 9% of people want a total return to pre-lockdown life,external, according to a YouGov survey. Since lockdown measures were imposed, the US city of Los Angeles has had its longest stretch of air quality rated as ""good"" since 1995 Most journeys in the UK are short -68% are under five miles,external- meaning that most people could complete them easily by bike if they felt confident and safe. Habit change is notoriously difficult, according to psychologists, but the crisis has transformed behaviours overnight. ""We've got this really precious moment to change how we live and we can't let it slip between our fingers. Let this tragedy re-define, in a positive way, what living in cities is about,"" says Will Butler-Adams, the CEO of UK bike manufacturer Brompton. British cities are lagging behind their global counterparts in making effective changes. In Paris,650km of cycleways are being built,external, and subsidies offered to cyclists to prepare for the end of lockdown After motor traffic dropped 30-75%, Italian city Milan announced plans for a car-free future. Officials hope to avoid a post-lockdown resurgence in traffic by building cycle lanes, widening pavements and introducing 30kph (20mph) speed limits In the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius,cafes and bars will be allowed to take over public squares,externalto allow residents to more comfortably enjoy a drink outside In the US,75 miles of streets in New York City,externalwill be allocated to pedestrian and cyclists BogotÃ¡, Colombia converted 22km (13 miles) of car lanes,externalinto cycle lanes overnight Pedestrians in Brussels, Belgium now have priority,externaland can use the entirety of streets in the city centre, where the speed limit is lowered to 20kph So far, thegovernment has made it easier for councils to close streets to cars, and London has announced itsStreetspace Plan,externalto encourage millions more to cycle and walk. But councillors and planners say more is needed. ""Local councils are overwhelmed with emergency work and lack funding - the government itself needs to lead,"" says Adam Tranter, Cycling Mayor for the city of Coventry. In London, a group of women calling themselves the Tactical Urbanistas took matters into their own hands. Last week they widened the pavement outside a busy high street supermarket, using painted circles on the road surface and makeshift barriers of tyres filled with soil and flowers. Frustrated at the lack of space to queue, a group of women widened a London pavement themselves Residents in Tower Hamlets welcomed the change and the barriers were applauded on social media, the group say. However, the local council objected and removed the tyres, citing safety reasons. ""London's streets are not safe for social distancing and a disproportionate amount of space is given to cars at the expense of other road users. This is a public health risk and needs to be treated urgently,"" Tactical Urbanistas told BBC News. Plans for building cycle networks already exist - government and local authorities just need to enact them, say numerous experts including Brian Deegan, a street engineer who helped design the London and Manchester cycle networks. Light segregation of roads for cycle paths and widening pavements would be cheap and quick, he adds. ""It demands an emergency response. If residents don't like the temporary measures, councils can reverse them when the crisis is over. But history shows people prefer the quieter and cleaner streets,"" he suggests. Community groups that have long called for greener, sustainable cities hope the pandemic could bring that change. In Germany, officials concluded that temporary cycle lanes installed in Berlin  helped residents observe social distancing measures and had no negative impact on traffic flows. ""So much has been taken away from us, and now people are focussing on the smaller things,"" says Paul Riley, from Transition Liverpool. ""We've learnt that it is possible to implement change, if we want it.""

Analysis: How do we end lockdown?,"We have gone weeks without seeing friends and family, without school, holidays or even being able to go to work. On 10 May, Boris Johnson is expected to address lockdown measures, although people should ""not expect big changes."" So what can be lifted and when? This virus remains massively contagious. Before lockdown, one infected person passed it onto at least three others on average (the so called R-number). And less than 5% of the UK population is estimated to have been infected. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The goal of lockdown has been to cut infections by around 70% to force the R-number below one (the point at which the outbreak starts to decline). That has been achieved. However, it is only just below one. ""There isn't much wiggle room,"" a source within the government's science advisers told me, adding the country ""can't make a huge number of changes"". One set of modelling suggests opening schools - and nothing else - would be enough to almost tip us back into rising cases. The aim is to create more ""wiggle room"" - you identify cases and then perform rapid contact tracing and put those at risk in quarantine. This strategy, also called ""seek and destroy"", will be supported by a voluntary smartphone app which will help identify contacts. The more successfully this is done, the more it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and the more restrictions can be lifted on day-to-day life. ""At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,"" said Dr Kucharski. ""If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with."" But even this is not life as normal and other measures would still be needed to keep the disease in check. ""It is a more moderate version of where we are now,"" said Dr Kucharski. When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal? How does contact tracing work and is my data safe? Another strategy proposed by some is ""enhanced shielding"". Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society, you could instead aim to stop it completely forthe most vulnerable. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. ""If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently."" That would mean all staff hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting those deemed vulnerable being regularly tested to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally, antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could put those ""shields"" under intense pressure. Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus. Some restrictions are less risky in terms of spreading the virus. ""Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options - it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. Dr Kucharski argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories: Those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Wales has already announced that from 11 May, people will be able able to exercise more than once a day. Moderate risk would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. ""I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,"" he says. There remains a nervousness within the scientific advice to government about lifting restrictions in areas, like pubs, whose whole purpose is to bring people together. And there is an emerging question around primary schools as young children, some studies suggest, cannot be infected as easily. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? R-NUMBER:Is this the crucial number? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? There is a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus now we've passed the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible. That will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave and make testing and contact tracing more likely to be effective. The trade-off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown now and accept having a higher number of cases, which creates its own problems. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine, as immunising people would mean there was no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. Failing that, the concept of herd immunity may kick in when around 70% of the population have been infected and the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference if they could stop Covid-19 progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul. Download theBBC News Appfor all the latest headlines.

Self-taught artist gets top prize: A worthy winner? âââââ,"Jiab Prachakul won the BP Portrait Award 2020 for Night Talk, which judges described as an ""an evocative portrait of a fleeting moment in time"" The working life of the professional portrait painter was put in jeopardy by what must have been the thoroughly unwelcome advent of photography. What was your mid-19th Century artist to do? The camera was faster, cheaper and better at capturing a likeness. One day their studio was packed with Lady This and Lord That posing in their finest clothes, the next they were painting tumbleweed. And then, just in the nick of time, some brilliant young artist - probably not so fresh from the brothels of Paris - realised that photography didn't herald the death of painting at all, in fact, it had set it free. Convention went out of the window, along with the Victorian backdrops and fake backgrounds of rolling pastures.  In their place came a new wave of radical artists with not-so-radical names like Edgar, Claude and Paul who would take portrait painting to a place it had never been before: the sitter's soul. Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Paul CÃ©zanne left the dull business of superficial representation to the one-eyed machine with a mechanical lens, while they got on with the important task of painting the person, inside and out. They developed a less-is-more style, removing all the extraneous detail of an old-fashioned portrait, which rendered the picture lifeless, and instead created simplified images that revealed the subject's character. Claude Monet mastered the art of looking beyond the surface, as in Portrait of PÃ¨re Paul, 1882, at Ãsterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna They showed that a single expressive brushstroke could say more about someone than any photograph or old-school portrayal. Impressionism was born. But not without first going to the photographer's studio on a dawn raid, where they learnt how cropping a picture can create dynamism and a feeling of instant creation. This was Degas's stock-in-trade, along with an elevated vantage point, a technique he copied from Japanese ukiyo-e artists like Utagawa Hiroshige. Sudden Shower over Shin-Åhashi Bridge and Atake by Utagawa Hiroshige, whose skilful use of the raised vantage point influenced Degas It was this combination of aesthetics from east and west that led to modernism and the art of today. It is evident everywhere you look, from David Hockney's Swimming Pool pictures to Jiab Prachakul's painting Night Talk, which won the Thai-born, Lyon-based artist this year's BP National Portrait Award, and with it a cheque for Â£35,000 and the guarantee of a future commission from the National Portrait Gallery (NPG). Thai-born Jiab Prachakul says of the friends she painted ""We are all outsiders, and their friendship has offered me a ground on where I can stand and embrace my own identity"" Night Talk could be a work of Parisian Impressionism circa 1874 if it wasn't for the acrylic paint (only became available in the 20th Century) and the Berlin setting. It depicts two of the artist's friends sitting at a low wooden table, looking glum. They are both dressed in black, a colour repeated in the vase in the foreground, which serves as a navigation tool for our eyes as we scan the picture. The painting has more than an echo of Degas, both in terms of composition and subject matter: artists taking a break (one is a Korean designer, the other a Japanese composer). Degas was a big influence on Hockney who was, in turn, a big influence on Prachakul, who says it was the Yorkshireman's 2006 exhibition at the NPG that made her realise she wanted to be an artist (she started out in film as a casting director). Portrait of Elena Carafa, c. 1875 by Edgar Degas, who had a major influence on David Hockney Jiab Prachakul had the ""instant realisation"" of wanting to be an artist, after seeing the Hockney retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery Fourteen years later she returns triumphant as the winner of its portrait prize, an achievement that has been overshadowed by two news stories. Firstly, the prize is sponsored by BP, a decades-old arrangement with the oil and gas giant which has now become highly contentious - not to say toxic - as artists and others lobby the NPG to end the relationship. And secondly, due to Covid-19, there will be no physical BP Portrait Award show in 2020. Instead there's a perfectly serviceable virtual show online, which is all that can be done in the circumstances but is obviously not the same. You can see BP Portrait Award 2020 at the NPG's online show It makes critiquing the picture difficult. As the Impressionists knew, there's a big different between a photograph and a painting, even when it is a photograph of a painting, which is what I'm looking at like everyone else. Any sense of scale is lost, as are the material and technical qualities to which you immediately respond (or don't) when seeing an artwork in the flesh. It is clearly an accomplished piece of work. The foreshortening of the man's hands, the colours and patterns of the table top mirrored in the protagonists' faces, and the tautness of the composition with its geometric structure are all noteworthy. It's good. But I'm not sure if it is great. Maybe it would be different when seen hanging on a wall, but Night Talk doesn't appear to have the palpable psychological charge that makes a memorable picture, it lacks the atmosphere that gives life to a work by Degas or Hockney. The female figure feels a little flat, her expressions cartoon-like. The facial emotions of the man have more depth but the highlights around his left cheek and the bridge of his nose aren't quite right. Nor are their clothes. Black is a notoriously difficult colour to master. Titian, Rembrandt, and Manet have all done it, but then they are the best of the best. Head of an Old Man in a Cap (circa 1630) by Rembrandt, who was a genius in his use of black There's nothing wrong with Prachakul's line, which is confident and flowing, but the shadowing and tonal transitions don't appear to be of the same technical quality. There's also a slight visual awkwardness in the way the top of the bar cuts across the cafÃ© dwellers' necks. That said, there is plenty to admire, not least the way the three separate flower arrangements form a v-shape to frame the two characters, which is mirrored by their outward-facing crossed legs. It gives the painting a pleasing symmetry, while also suggesting a feeling of discomfort and alienation. Much has been made of the fact Jiab Prachakul is self-taught, which puts her in good company along with the likes of Vincent van Gogh and Henri Rousseau. They both used their lack of formal training (Van Gogh had some) to take painting in a new direction, to uncover universal truths through apparently naÃ¯ve imagery. Van Gogh did it with his warped lines, Rousseau with his surreal jungle images. Prachakul could do it too, but she needs to get inside our heads as well as her own and the sitters'.

China concerned over N Korea coronavirus outbreak,"North Korea's government maintains it has not reported a single case of Covid-19 there China's president has expressed concern about the threat of the coronavirus to North Korea and offered help. Xi Jinping was responding to a message that he received from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Chinese state media reported that the message congratulated Mr Xi on China's apparent success in fighting Covid-19. North Korea's government maintains that there has not been a single confirmed case there, though analysts have questioned whether that is possible. North Korea was the first country to suspend tourism and to shut its borders in response to the virus, in the third week of January. The country has a fragile health system, which experts fear would be quickly overwhelmed by even a small outbreak of Covid-19. So what DID China do when outbreak emerged? Kim Jong-un and the brutal North Korea rumour mill Scepticism over N Korea's claim to be virus free In his ""verbal message of thanks"", Mr Xi said he highly appreciated Mr Kim's support during China's outbreak and ""showed his personal attention to the situation of the pandemic and people's health"" in North Korea, according to state media. Mr Xi called for more efforts to strengthen co-operation in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and said China was ""willing to continue to provide assistance within its own capacity for [North Korea] in the fight against Covid-19"". On Friday, North Korean state media reported that Mr Kim had sent a verbal message to the president that ""congratulated him, highly appreciating that he is seizing a chance of victory in the war against the unprecedented epidemic"". Kim Jong-un disappeared from public view for 20 days, before visiting a factory on 2 May Mr Kim recently went 20 days without appearing in public, and missed the celebration of his grandfather's birthday - one of the biggest events of the year. Some media reports claimed he was ""gravely ill"", or even dead. But he then appeared at a fertiliser factory on 2 May - apparently in good health. On Wednesday, South Korea's National Intelligence Service told a parliamentary committee that there had been no signs the health rumours were true. ""He was performing his duties normally when he was out of the public eye,"" a member of the committee, Kim Byung-kee, told reporters afterwards. The lawmaker said the North Korean leader's absence could have been down to a Covid-19 outbreak that the authorities in Pyongyang had not reported. By Celia Hatton, Asia Pacific Editor, BBC World Service For months, North Korea-watchers have questioned Pyongyang's claims that it has managed to isolate itself from Covid-19. Admittedly, North Korea was the first country to suspend travel in response to the virus. There are unconfirmed reports that North Korean guards have been ordered to shoot at those who try to cross the lengthy border the North shares with China. However, it will be difficult to completely seal that dividing line for long. North Korea's underground economy relies on illicit trade with Chinese entrepreneurs. Beijing has a few good reasons for wanting to help North Korea. On a practical level, China needs to suppress a possible Covid-19 outbreak there if it wants to keep its own population healthy. Beijing also worries about what might happen inside North Korea if the virus takes hold. The North's decrepit health system would quickly be overwhelmed by an outbreak of Covid-19, and that could threaten the fragile Kim Jong-un regime. Beijing has been Pyongyang's biggest aid donor for decades, and it will continue to do what it can to keep Mr Kim in power. The alternatives to Kim Jong-un are much riskier for China, which does not want change on its doorstep. China's global political interests are also at play. Diplomatically, Mr Xi's public exchange with Kim Jong-un underlines the seemingly close ties between China and North Korea. Pyongyang has been slow to accept public offers of help from the United States, and peace talks with Washington have stalled. If North Korea appeared to accept Beijing's help, China would reassert itself as North Korea's ""true"" ally in a time of need. South Korea itself reported 18 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Saturday. Seventeen of them are linked to a 29-year-old man,externalwho tested positive after spending time at five nightclubs and bars in Seoul's Itaewon leisure district last weekend, the Yonhap news agency said. Mayor Park Won-soon ordered nightclubs, bars and hostess venues across the capital to suspend business in response. ""Carelessness can lead to an explosion in infections - we clearly realised this through the group infections seen in the Itaewon club case,"" Mr Park said. Health officials have urged people who have visited the five venues in Itaewon to self-isolate and get tested to prevent additional transmissions. At least 1,500 people signed their entry logs, according to Yonhap. The new infections brought the nationwide total to 10,840, while the death toll remained unchanged at 256.

Unions warn over schools reopening,"Schools should not reopen unless key measures are in place to stop the spread of coronavirus, unions have warned. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is urging ministers to work closely with unions to agree a way forward. There was speculation schools may return in England from 1 June, but it was ruled out inScotlandandWales. England's Department for Education said it would follow scientific advice about the ""right time"" to reopen schools. Schools across the UK closed in the last week of March as part of the lockdown measures to prevent the virus spreading. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will give details on Sunday of his ""roadmap"" to get the UK out of lockdown. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said Mr Johnson's plans for easing the measures in England would be ""very much in line"" with""modest"" changes already outlined in Wales,ScotlandandNorthern Ireland. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford added: ""We're not going to be reopening schools in Wales in the next three weeks, or indeed in June."" What is the UK's test, track and trace strategy? Teachers warn of early school return 'virus spike' Welsh schools not reopening on 1 June Reopening schools too early could 'overwhelm' NHS Unions, including the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) and the National Education Union (NEU), have called for ""clear, scientific published evidence"" that schools are safe to re-open. In a joint statement sent to UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, they said there should be no increase in pupil numbers until a national test, track and trace scheme has been fully rolled out. The government's three-pronged coronavirus strategy is being rolled out in various stages, with the NHS contact-tracing smartphone app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight before a UK-wide expansion. They have called for extra resources for deep cleaning, personal protective equipment (PPE) and local powers to close schools if there is an outbreak of the virus in a particular area. Some of the other ""essential"" measures unions said must be in place before pupils return, include: Safety and welfare of pupils and staff as the paramount principle A national Covid-19 education taskforce with government, unions and education stakeholders to agree statutory guidance for safe reopening Consideration of the specific needs of vulnerable students and families facing financial hardship Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC which published the statement, said: ""Parents and staff need full confidence that schools will be safe before any pupils return."" She urged No 10 to ""work closely"" with unions to ""agree a plan that meets the tests we have set out"", adding the best way to do this would be through a ""national taskforce"" between ""government, unions and education stakeholders"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? A spokeswoman for England's Department for Education said Mr Williamson has not set a date for schools reopening, and the department would ensure the education sector has ""sufficient notice to plan and prepare"" for schools, nurseries and colleges to return. ""Schools will remain closed, except for children of critical workers and vulnerable children, until the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to re-open and the five tests set out by government to beat this virus have been met,"" she added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, meanwhile, said pupils will only be allowed to return to school when it is safe to do so. It follows a warning by the British Irish Group of Teacher Unions of the""very real risk of creating a spike in the transmission of the virus by a premature opening of schools"". Labour's shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey called on the government to ""take heed of the tests set out today by trade unions and commit to not opening schools unless they have been met"". Last week at the Downing Street daily briefing, NHS England's national medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the ""science is still evolving"" on how much children contribute toward virus spread. It comes as the public was urged to be ""realistic"" about the easing of lockdown measures, asa further 626 coronavirus deaths were confirmed on Friday, taking the UK total to 31,241. Leading the No 10 news conference on Friday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said there would be ""no dramatic overnight change"" and the government would be ""very, very cautious as we loosen the restrictions we have"". Meanwhile, the government announced 97,029 tests had been delivered in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Friday, just shy of the 100,000 target Mr Hancock set for the end of April. Mr Johnson hasset a target of increasing testing capacity to 200,000 by the end of May. What is the UK's test, track and trace strategy?

Musk vows to move Tesla HQ over lockdown row,"Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of electric car company Tesla, is embroiled in a row over reopening its California-based factory Billionaire Tesla boss Elon Musk has said he will move the electric carmaker's headquarters out of California, after he was ordered to keep its only US vehicle plant closed. ""Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately,"" the CEO tweeted. The company was filing a lawsuit against Alameda County, he added. The county's health department had refused to let the Tesla factory reopen on Friday, citing lockdown measures. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

According to figures from Johns Hopkins University, 2,715 people in California have died with coronavirus. Since 23 March, all but ""basic operations"" have been suspended at Tesla's Fremont plant, near San Francisco, because of ""shelter in place"" orders enacted in Alameda County. The factory employs more than 10,000 workers, and makes about 415,000 vehicles every year. California's government has eased some restrictions around the state this week, allowing businesses to resume operations. But several Bay Area counties have issued their own criteria for which businesses may reopen, which take precedence. In Alameda, all but essential businesses must remain shut until the end of May. Mr Musk suggested the factory's future could now be in doubt, tweeting: ""If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen[t] on how Tesla is treated in the future."" Elon Musk tweet wipes $14bn off Tesla's value Elon Musk and Grimes confirm baby name X Ã A-12 New dad Elon Musk puts luxury homes up for sale In a statement released before Mr Musk's tweets, Alameda County said: ""We welcome Tesla's proactive work on a reopening plan, so that once they fit the criteria to reopen, they can do so in a way that protects their employees and the community at large."" Mr Musk, 48, who welcomed a baby with Canadian singer Grimes earlier this week,wiped $14bn (Â£11bn) off Tesla's value on 1 Mayafter tweeting that its share price was too high. He has donated over 1,200 ventilators to hospitals in the US to assist with treating coronavirus patients. The tech billionaire has also poked fun at the mass purchasing of toilet paper when the pandemic began. But he has also sparked controversy for promoting an unproven treatment for the virus, and for asserting, falsely, that children are ""essentially immune"". Mr Musk has continually voiced his opposition to ""fascist"" lockdown measures, tweeting ""FREE AMERICA NOW"" last month. Tesla has suspended operations at its plant in the Chinese city of Shanghai, according to Bloomberg. It had previously closed the factory as a temporary measure when the virus was at its peak in China. The company reported a net profit in the first three months of this year, and its stock has risen to nearly $820 (Â£669; â¬756).

Deal agreed to manufacture PPE gowns in Scotland,"A deal has been agreed to manufacture more personal protective equipment for health and care workers in Scotland. The agreement will provide more than half of NHS Scotland's weekly requirement for non-sterile gowns, the Scottish government said. Forfar-based firm Don and Low will supply about 2.8 million square metres of the base material required. That will be converted into gowns by Glenrothes firm Keela, as well as Lancashire-based Redwood TTM Ltd. Keela will then work with two firms in Livingston - Transcal and Endura - to deliver the equipment. The deal comes amid supply issues of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with global demand for gloves and masks at unprecedented levels. Supplies to Scotland have so far come from a number of areas, includinglarge imports of face masks from China. Earlier this month Scotland's largest health board - NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde - saidhospitals were experiencing PPE shortagesand it had been forced to make purchases ""at above usual prices"". Nicola Sturgeon has previously said there were ""adequate stocks of the main PPE"" but acknowledged difficulties with delivering gowns. Meanwhile, in April there was confusion over the distribution of PPE following claims that some suppliers inEngland had been told not to prioritise sending items to Scotland. Westminster Health Secretary Matt Hancock later told Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman that this was not the case. Suppliers 'not asked' to divert PPE to England 'Shortages' in supplies of hospital protective equipment The Scottish government said the new contracts would help strengthen and expand the supply of protective equipment and secure long-term stock levels. Trade Minister Ivan McKee said they help ""protect us from any global supply issues"". He said the new supply chain agreement would ""ensure frontline staff continue to have the protection they need"". Mr McKee added the deal demonstrates what can be achieved through collaboration between public and private sectors during the pandemic. The minister said: ""The Scottish government, along with our colleagues at Scottish Enterprise and NHS Scotland, will continue to work with partners across the country to ensure that all frontline health and social care workers have access to the PPE they need.""

Â£2bn for 'once in generation change' to transport,"This video can not be played ""Public transport cannot go back to where it left off"" - Transport Secretary Grant Shapps The government will proceed with ""extreme caution"" exiting lockdown, the transport secretary said as he revealed plans to ""get Britain moving again"". Grant Shapps said the move beyond Covid-19 would be a ""gradual progress"" and not a ""single leap to freedom"". He pledged Â£250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure but would not confirma 14-day quarantine for passengers arriving in the UK. Another 346 UK coronavirus deaths were recorded, taking the total to 31,587. Can cities be reshaped for the world after lockdown? What do I need to know if I fly? Mr Shapps, who was speaking a day before the prime minister is due to address the country on lockdown measures, said there had been unprecedented levels of walking and cycling during the pandemic. He said: ""Whilst it's crucial that we stay at home, when the country does get back to work we need to ask those people to carry on cycling or walking and for them to be joined by many others as well."" Even if the UK transport network was running at full capacity, social distancing rules would mean only one in 10 passengers could travel, he said. Pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle and bus-only corridors will be created in England within weeks as part of a Â£250m emergency fund. It is the first part a Â£2bn package for cycling and walking, which was part of a Â£5bn investment announced in February, the Department for Transport said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? The extra funding is for English local authorities to help alter road networks with the aim of taking pressure off roads and public transport network. Matters concerning cycling and walking are devolved. For example, Wales had legislation in place to boost both activities since 2013, while Scotland announced fundingfor ""active travel infrastructure"" in April,external. The Welsh Government has suggested new policies including road or lane closures with filters for cyclists, 20 mph limits and footway widening. In Scotland, Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, infrastructure and connectivity, told the Scottish parliament his government had put forward a package of support to help local authorities implement ""temporary active travel measures"" to allow people to walk and cycle while physically distancing and keeping safe from traffic. No specific measures have been announced yet in Northern Ireland although Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is expected to appoint a cycling and walking champion. The transport secretary announced an emergency Â£250m fund for cycling and walking improvements Asked by the BBC's Ben Wright aboutreports of 14-day quarantine measures for people entering the country, Mr Shapps said he would not announce anything ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's speech on lockdown measures on Sunday. But deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the virus had an incubation period of up to 14 days, during which symptoms develop. Mr Shapps said: ""Bearing in mind the sacrifice the British people have made over seven weeks and counting, you can't have a situation where someone is asked to stay at home but others can come into the country."" The airline industry has raised concerns about the plans with trade body Airlines UK saying the policy needed ""a credible exit plan"" and should be reviewed weekly. And a spokesman for Heathrow said any measures must be medically effective, meet public expectations and be deliverable by airports. Announcing Â£10m for electric car charging points and extended an e-scooter trial across England, Scotland and Wales, the transport secretary said better air quality had been one of the few benefits of the current crisis. Mr Shapps was also asked about the apparent rise in people going outside which came after warnings against sending out ""mixed messages"" with newspaper reports suggesting sunbathing and picnics could be permitted as early as Monday. He dismissed allegations the government's messaging strategy was confusing, and said ""I think that most people are more than capable of understanding what is meant"". Asked about social distancing in schools, particularly for younger children who may not follow the rules, Mr Shapps said: ""Extreme caution is actually the watchword on this. And we've seen in other countries where second, not quite spikes have come along, but where social distancing has been relaxed and there've been problems, so we will wait to see."" The government did not hit the 100,000 daily testing target for the seventh day running but there were 96,878 tests delivered in the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Friday. The Local Government Association welcomed the transport announcements but said local councils must have ""long-term certainty"" around funding. David Renard, LGA transport spokesman, said: ""Local control over infrastructure and public transport budgets would enable them to deliver the widespread improvements to promote more active travel."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said funding for walking and cycling schemes was important for people who have to return to work and said enabling people to walk and cycle would be ""critical to easing the pressure on our busy public transport network"". RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said the success of the new walking and cycling schemes would depend on motorists' attitudes to short car journeys, and said if e-scooters were to be used as alternative transport to get around cities, safety must be taken into account.

"Warning over coronavirus scams and fake productsCouncils have seen a ""significant surge"" in criminal activity, including the sale of bogus medical kit.","The public have been warned to stay vigilant to criminals selling fake coronavirus-related products. The Local Government Association said some councils have seen a ""significant surge"" in reports of scams by those seeking to exploit virus fears. More than 500,000 sub-standard masks were seized by a London council, while other criminals have attempted to trick people into giving personal details. The LGA is calling on the public to report scams to their local council. Fraudsters are seeking to take advantage of public fears by selling bogus medical products and other counterfeit items. Victims lose thousands to fake puppy sales New mums targeted in breastfeeding photo scam Scammers use coronavirus 'hook' to target victims The LGA - which represents councils in England and Wales - said criminals have been preying on vulnerable and older people who are self-isolating. In one case, a woman in her 80s answered the door to a man who demanded Â£220 to complete a health and safety check. Meanwhile, a telephone conman is being investigated after posing as a Swindon Council worker sorting lockdown food parcels, in a bid to obtain a pensioner's personal details. A car repair garage was reported after allegedly trying to sell coronavirus testing kits to customers. In Ealing, 2,600 illegal bottles of hand sanitiser as well as 500,000 substandard face masks were taken off the market by the local council, according to the LGA.

Residents are being tricked into buying goods online, door-to-door, by phone, text and email, the LGA said, with councils advising people not to accept services from strangers or cold callers. Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, warned the public to be ""cautious"", adding: ""If something doesn't seem right or sounds too good to be true, don't hesitate to end a phone call, bin a letter, delete an email or shut the door."" He advised people to report scams to avoid others becoming victims of these ""despicable crimes"" and so fraudsters could be brought to justice, with councils seeking ""the toughest penalties"". It comes after the National Crime Agency (NCA) warned thevirus was increasingly being used as a ""hook to commit fraud""and that such scams were ""likely to increase"" during the pandemic. And it's not just bogus health products being sold by fraudsters.

"Self-taught artist gets top prize: A worthy winner? âââââNight Talk is clearly an accomplished work, but the artist needs to get inside our heads as well as the sitters'.","Jiab Prachakul won the BP Portrait Award 2020 for Night Talk, which judges described as an ""an evocative portrait of a fleeting moment in time"" The working life of the professional portrait painter was put in jeopardy by what must have been the thoroughly unwelcome advent of photography. What was your mid-19th Century artist to do? The camera was faster, cheaper and better at capturing a likeness. One day their studio was packed with Lady This and Lord That posing in their finest clothes, the next they were painting tumbleweed. And then, just in the nick of time, some brilliant young artist - probably not so fresh from the brothels of Paris - realised that photography didn't herald the death of painting at all, in fact, it had set it free. Convention went out of the window, along with the Victorian backdrops and fake backgrounds of rolling pastures.  In their place came a new wave of radical artists with not-so-radical names like Edgar, Claude and Paul who would take portrait painting to a place it had never been before: the sitter's soul. Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Paul CÃ©zanne left the dull business of superficial representation to the one-eyed machine with a mechanical lens, while they got on with the important task of painting the person, inside and out. They developed a less-is-more style, removing all the extraneous detail of an old-fashioned portrait, which rendered the picture lifeless, and instead created simplified images that revealed the subject's character. Claude Monet mastered the art of looking beyond the surface, as in Portrait of PÃ¨re Paul, 1882, at Ãsterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna They showed that a single expressive brushstroke could say more about someone than any photograph or old-school portrayal. Impressionism was born. But not without first going to the photographer's studio on a dawn raid, where they learnt how cropping a picture can create dynamism and a feeling of instant creation. This was Degas's stock-in-trade, along with an elevated vantage point, a technique he copied from Japanese ukiyo-e artists like Utagawa Hiroshige. Sudden Shower over Shin-Åhashi Bridge and Atake by Utagawa Hiroshige, whose skilful use of the raised vantage point influenced Degas It was this combination of aesthetics from east and west that led to modernism and the art of today. It is evident everywhere you look, from David Hockney's Swimming Pool pictures to Jiab Prachakul's painting Night Talk, which won the Thai-born, Lyon-based artist this year's BP National Portrait Award, and with it a cheque for Â£35,000 and the guarantee of a future commission from the National Portrait Gallery (NPG). Thai-born Jiab Prachakul says of the friends she painted ""We are all outsiders, and their friendship has offered me a ground on where I can stand and embrace my own identity"" Night Talk could be a work of Parisian Impressionism circa 1874 if it wasn't for the acrylic paint (only became available in the 20th Century) and the Berlin setting. It depicts two of the artist's friends sitting at a low wooden table, looking glum. They are both dressed in black, a colour repeated in the vase in the foreground, which serves as a navigation tool for our eyes as we scan the picture. The painting has more than an echo of Degas, both in terms of composition and subject matter: artists taking a break (one is a Korean designer, the other a Japanese composer). Degas was a big influence on Hockney who was, in turn, a big influence on Prachakul, who says it was the Yorkshireman's 2006 exhibition at the NPG that made her realise she wanted to be an artist (she started out in film as a casting director). Portrait of Elena Carafa, c. 1875 by Edgar Degas, who had a major influence on David Hockney Jiab Prachakul had the ""instant realisation"" of wanting to be an artist, after seeing the Hockney retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery Fourteen years later she returns triumphant as the winner of its portrait prize, an achievement that has been overshadowed by two news stories. Firstly, the prize is sponsored by BP, a decades-old arrangement with the oil and gas giant which has now become highly contentious - not to say toxic - as artists and others lobby the NPG to end the relationship. And secondly, due to Covid-19, there will be no physical BP Portrait Award show in 2020. Instead there's a perfectly serviceable virtual show online, which is all that can be done in the circumstances but is obviously not the same. You can see BP Portrait Award 2020 at the NPG's online show It makes critiquing the picture difficult. As the Impressionists knew, there's a big different between a photograph and a painting, even when it is a photograph of a painting, which is what I'm looking at like everyone else. Any sense of scale is lost, as are the material and technical qualities to which you immediately respond (or don't) when seeing an artwork in the flesh. It is clearly an accomplished piece of work. The foreshortening of the man's hands, the colours and patterns of the table top mirrored in the protagonists' faces, and the tautness of the composition with its geometric structure are all noteworthy. It's good. But I'm not sure if it is great. Maybe it would be different when seen hanging on a wall, but Night Talk doesn't appear to have the palpable psychological charge that makes a memorable picture, it lacks the atmosphere that gives life to a work by Degas or Hockney. The female figure feels a little flat, her expressions cartoon-like. The facial emotions of the man have more depth but the highlights around his left cheek and the bridge of his nose aren't quite right. Nor are their clothes. Black is a notoriously difficult colour to master. Titian, Rembrandt, and Manet have all done it, but then they are the best of the best. Head of an Old Man in a Cap (circa 1630) by Rembrandt, who was a genius in his use of black There's nothing wrong with Prachakul's line, which is confident and flowing, but the shadowing and tonal transitions don't appear to be of the same technical quality. There's also a slight visual awkwardness in the way the top of the bar cuts across the cafÃ© dwellers' necks. That said, there is plenty to admire, not least the way the three separate flower arrangements form a v-shape to frame the two characters, which is mirrored by their outward-facing crossed legs. It gives the painting a pleasing symmetry, while also suggesting a feeling of discomfort and alienation. Much has been made of the fact Jiab Prachakul is self-taught, which puts her in good company along with the likes of Vincent van Gogh and Henri Rousseau. They both used their lack of formal training (Van Gogh had some) to take painting in a new direction, to uncover universal truths through apparently naÃ¯ve imagery. Van Gogh did it with his warped lines, Rousseau with his surreal jungle images. Prachakul could do it too, but she needs to get inside our heads as well as her own and the sitters'.

Airports insist on masks and gloves,"Passengers travelling through some UK airports are being told to cover their faces and wear gloves due to Covid-19. The new rules will apply to those travelling through Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports from Thursday. Manchester Airports Group (MAG), which owns the sites, said the measure will show ""one way in which air travel can be made safe"". The announcement comes as the aviation sector struggles with coronavirus. The three airports are believed to be the first in the UK to introduce such strict hygiene rules. Heathrow trialling passenger temperature checks Air fares face turbulence when flights slowly restart Those passing through the airport will be given face coverings or masks as well as gloves during the initial stages of the trial. All airport staff serving passengers will also be required to wear the items. MAG boss Charlie Cornish said: ""It's clear that social distancing will not work on any form of public transport. But we're confident that when the time is right, people will be able to travel safely. We now need to work urgently with government to agree how we operate in the future."" He added: ""This has to be a top priority so that people can be confident about flying, and to get tourism and travel going again."" Temperature screening trials will also be conducted at Stansted over the next few weeks to test equipment. It follows the boss of Heathrow airport confirming on Wednesday that it is trialling large-scale temperature checks. Chief executive John Holland-Kaye said they are already being carried out at departure gates on people going to places where this is a requirement. He also urged the government to produce a plan on what common standards UK airports should adopt, so that the aviation sector could ""get started again"". Many airlines have been struggling as the coronavirus pandemic has brought global travel to a virtual standstill. On Thursday, British Airways owner IAG has said it is hoping for a ""meaningful return"" of flights in July at the earliest if lockdown measures are relaxed. However, IAG - which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus - said these plans were ""highly uncertain"", and were subject to various travel restrictions. IAG said it did not expect passenger demand, which has been hit by the pandemic, to recover before 2023. ""We will adapt our operating procedures to ensure our customers and our people are properly protected in this new environment,"" chief executive Willie Walsh said. The group said that even if flights resumed in the summer it expected that passenger capacity would still only be half the usual level in 2020. Since late March, capacity has fallen by 94%, with most of the group's aircraft grounded. The announcement came as IAG reported losses after tax hit  â¬1.68bn (Â£1.47bn) during the first three months of the year, which  included a â¬1.3bn charge for fuel hedges. Many airlines are struggling during the pandemic IAG also reported an operating loss of â¬535m (Â£466.6m) for the quarter, down from a â¬135m profit in 2019. The group added that it expected the second quarter to be ""significantly worse"". In an attempt to shore up cash during the coronavirus crisis, IAG said that it expected to defer deliveries of 68 aircraft. Although IAG is planning for a resumption of some services, it says it will still need to let go of many staff. Last month, BA said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce. It also told staff thatits Gatwick airport operation might not reopenafter the pandemic passes. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh will delay his retirement until September IAG chief executive Willie Walsh had been due to retire in March, but will stay on until September ""to focus on the immediate response to the crisis"". Luis Gallego, head of the group's Spanish division, Iberia, since 2014, will succeed him. On Wednesday, other aviation bosses called for additional support for the sector from the UK government. Speaking to MPs on the Transport Select Committee, Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye argued that the French, German and US governments had provided large, bespoke rescue packages for their aviation industries as they saw them as ""fundamental"", and suggested that was not the case in the UK. Air France KLM, for example, won a â¬7bn loan package from the French government in April. However, IAG's competitor has reported that it made a loss in its day-to-day business of â¬815m in the three months of the year due to travel grinding to a halt.

"'Up to 2,000' UK seafarers stranded due to virus","Up to 2,000 UK seafarers are stranded on ships around the world because of coronavirus lockdowns, the industry's trade body has told the BBC. The UK Chamber of Shipping wants the UK government to become the first to sign up to a global plan to get crews home. And the Nautilus International maritime union said seafarers stuck on ships for months were depressed and homesick, ""with no end in sight"" to their ordeal. The government said it was working to ""ensure"" those affected could get home. Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping UK 'to bring in 14-day quarantine' for air passengers Because of port and air route bans for individual travellers, many of the world's1.6 million,externalseafarers cannot go home, while relief crews cannot be brought in. Theyare working past the end of their contracts,externaland the International Chamber of Shipping estimates 150,000 of them are stuck on board cruise ships, transporters, tankers and other vessels. The UK Chamber of Shipping said up to 2,000 - or around one in 13 - of the UK's25,750 seafarers,externalwere among the stranded. It has written to Shipping Minister Kelly Tolhurst, urging the UK government to become the first in the world to sign up to theInternational Maritime Organisation's new plan,externalto ensure crew changeovers can resume. The letter, seen by the BBC, also calls for seafarers and offshore workers to be exempt from ""any potential air travel quarantine restrictions which may be introduced"". Getting them home is ""increasingly taking on a humanitarian dimension"", it adds. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:How to self-isolate and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mark Dickinson, general secretary of Nautilus International, said many UK seafarers were working 90-hour weeks. He said: ""It's a confined workplace - not the Hilton Hotel - for three, four or five months. The accommodation is fairly basic and you're with a small group of people. ""You get into a situation where you think, 'I've got six weeks to go,' 'I've got four weeks to go,' and even when this is extended by 24 hours it's pretty awful. It's worse when it's so open-ended."" Mr Dickinson praised the UK government for classifying seafarers as key workers and allowing them to travel via the country's ports and airports, unlike those of many other countries. He added: ""My frustration has been with the governments who faff about, locking things down without actually giving any thought to the consequences of that."" A Foreign Office spokesperson said it was a ""worrying time for British crew on board cruise ships around the world"", but it was ""primarily the responsibility of their employers"" to ensure their welfare and safety. They added: ""The government is in direct contact with these operators about the issues, as well as directly with many crew members and their families, and we will continue to do what we can to ensure UK crew can access flights home."" Ms Tolhurst has said she is in ""constant dialogue"" with operators and that seafarers have""responded magnificently"" to the coronavirus crisis,,external""working round the clock to keep the nation fuelled, fed and supplied with vital goods"".

Tesla ordered to keep main US plant closed,"Alameda County authorities say opening the plant could lead to a spike in virus cases Electric car firm Tesla has been ordered to keep its main plant in the US closed, as California grapples with a coronavirus outbreak. Chief executive Elon Musk had told staff ""limited"" production would resume on Friday at the Fremont factory, near San Francisco, according to CNBC. But Alameda County says this could lead to a spike in coronavirus cases. Nearly 9,500 cases have been reported in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with 342 virus-related deaths. Since 23 March, all but ""basic operations"" have been suspended at the plantbecause of ""shelter in place"" orders enacted in the county. The factory employs more than 10,000 workers, and makes about 415,000 vehicles every year. California's government has eased some restrictions around the state this week, allowing businesses to resume operations. But several Bay Area counties, including Alameda, have issued their own criteria according to which businesses may reopen, which take precedence. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has drawn criticism for his opposition to coronavirus lockdown measures ""Tesla has been informed that they do not meet those criteria and must not reopen,"" Alameda County said in a statement. ""We welcome Tesla's proactive work on a reopening plan, so that once they fit the criteria to reopen, they can do so in a way that protects their employees and the community at large."" Tesla did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Mr Musk has drawn controversy for his opposition to coronavirus restrictions, and his promotion of unproven treatments for the virus. In a series of tweets, the tech billionaire has said ""the coronavirus panic is dumb"" and ""FREE AMERICA NOW"". It comes as Tesla has suspended operations at its plant in the Chinese city of Shanghai, according to Bloomberg. It had previously closed the factory as a temporary measure when the virus was at its peak in China. The company reported a net profit in the first three months of this year, and its stock has risen to nearly $820 (Â£669; â¬756). But analysts expect the coronavirus pandemic will adversely affect its earnings in 2020.

Ms Law raised the money in partnership with the Devon and Cornwall Chinese Association, for whom she ran hiking tours for before the lockdown. The money will be donated to the NHS charity, with some being used towards more PPE equipment for staff at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. Ms Law, whose daughter is a psychologist for the NHS, said the response was ""overwhelming"". ""It is a pleasure to do something like that. It gives you an incentive to walk even more with a reason,"" she said.

"Deal agreed to manufacture PPE gowns in ScotlandMinisters say the deal between the NHS and private firms will help protect Scotland from ""global supply issues"".Scotland","A deal has been agreed to manufacture more personal protective equipment for health and care workers in Scotland. The agreement will provide more than half of NHS Scotland's weekly requirement for non-sterile gowns, the Scottish government said. Forfar-based firm Don and Low will supply about 2.8 million square metres of the base material required. That will be converted into gowns by Glenrothes firm Keela, as well as Lancashire-based Redwood TTM Ltd. Keela will then work with two firms in Livingston - Transcal and Endura - to deliver the equipment. The deal comes amid supply issues of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with global demand for gloves and masks at unprecedented levels. Supplies to Scotland have so far come from a number of areas, includinglarge imports of face masks from China. Earlier this month Scotland's largest health board - NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde - saidhospitals were experiencing PPE shortagesand it had been forced to make purchases ""at above usual prices"". Nicola Sturgeon has previously said there were ""adequate stocks of the main PPE"" but acknowledged difficulties with delivering gowns. Meanwhile, in April there was confusion over the distribution of PPE following claims that some suppliers inEngland had been told not to prioritise sending items to Scotland. Westminster Health Secretary Matt Hancock later told Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman that this was not the case. Suppliers 'not asked' to divert PPE to England 'Shortages' in supplies of hospital protective equipment The Scottish government said the new contracts would help strengthen and expand the supply of protective equipment and secure long-term stock levels. Trade Minister Ivan McKee said they help ""protect us from any global supply issues"". He said the new supply chain agreement would ""ensure frontline staff continue to have the protection they need"". Mr McKee added the deal demonstrates what can be achieved through collaboration between public and private sectors during the pandemic. The minister said: ""The Scottish government, along with our colleagues at Scottish Enterprise and NHS Scotland, will continue to work with partners across the country to ensure that all frontline health and social care workers have access to the PPE they need.""

Self-taught artist gets top prize: A worthy winner? âââââCoronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this morning.UK,"Jiab Prachakul won the BP Portrait Award 2020 for Night Talk, which judges described as an ""an evocative portrait of a fleeting moment in time"" The working life of the professional portrait painter was put in jeopardy by what must have been the thoroughly unwelcome advent of photography. What was your mid-19th Century artist to do? The camera was faster, cheaper and better at capturing a likeness. One day their studio was packed with Lady This and Lord That posing in their finest clothes, the next they were painting tumbleweed. And then, just in the nick of time, some brilliant young artist - probably not so fresh from the brothels of Paris - realised that photography didn't herald the death of painting at all, in fact, it had set it free. Convention went out of the window, along with the Victorian backdrops and fake backgrounds of rolling pastures.  In their place came a new wave of radical artists with not-so-radical names like Edgar, Claude and Paul who would take portrait painting to a place it had never been before: the sitter's soul. Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Paul CÃ©zanne left the dull business of superficial representation to the one-eyed machine with a mechanical lens, while they got on with the important task of painting the person, inside and out. They developed a less-is-more style, removing all the extraneous detail of an old-fashioned portrait, which rendered the picture lifeless, and instead created simplified images that revealed the subject's character. Claude Monet mastered the art of looking beyond the surface, as in Portrait of PÃ¨re Paul, 1882, at Ãsterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna They showed that a single expressive brushstroke could say more about someone than any photograph or old-school portrayal. Impressionism was born. But not without first going to the photographer's studio on a dawn raid, where they learnt how cropping a picture can create dynamism and a feeling of instant creation. This was Degas's stock-in-trade, along with an elevated vantage point, a technique he copied from Japanese ukiyo-e artists like Utagawa Hiroshige. Sudden Shower over Shin-Åhashi Bridge and Atake by Utagawa Hiroshige, whose skilful use of the raised vantage point influenced Degas It was this combination of aesthetics from east and west that led to modernism and the art of today. It is evident everywhere you look, from David Hockney's Swimming Pool pictures to Jiab Prachakul's painting Night Talk, which won the Thai-born, Lyon-based artist this year's BP National Portrait Award, and with it a cheque for Â£35,000 and the guarantee of a future commission from the National Portrait Gallery (NPG). Thai-born Jiab Prachakul says of the friends she painted ""We are all outsiders, and their friendship has offered me a ground on where I can stand and embrace my own identity"" Night Talk could be a work of Parisian Impressionism circa 1874 if it wasn't for the acrylic paint (only became available in the 20th Century) and the Berlin setting. It depicts two of the artist's friends sitting at a low wooden table, looking glum. They are both dressed in black, a colour repeated in the vase in the foreground, which serves as a navigation tool for our eyes as we scan the picture. The painting has more than an echo of Degas, both in terms of composition and subject matter: artists taking a break (one is a Korean designer, the other a Japanese composer). Degas was a big influence on Hockney who was, in turn, a big influence on Prachakul, who says it was the Yorkshireman's 2006 exhibition at the NPG that made her realise she wanted to be an artist (she started out in film as a casting director). Portrait of Elena Carafa, c. 1875 by Edgar Degas, who had a major influence on David Hockney Jiab Prachakul had the ""instant realisation"" of wanting to be an artist, after seeing the Hockney retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery Fourteen years later she returns triumphant as the winner of its portrait prize, an achievement that has been overshadowed by two news stories. Firstly, the prize is sponsored by BP, a decades-old arrangement with the oil and gas giant which has now become highly contentious - not to say toxic - as artists and others lobby the NPG to end the relationship. And secondly, due to Covid-19, there will be no physical BP Portrait Award show in 2020. Instead there's a perfectly serviceable virtual show online, which is all that can be done in the circumstances but is obviously not the same. You can see BP Portrait Award 2020 at the NPG's online show It makes critiquing the picture difficult. As the Impressionists knew, there's a big different between a photograph and a painting, even when it is a photograph of a painting, which is what I'm looking at like everyone else. Any sense of scale is lost, as are the material and technical qualities to which you immediately respond (or don't) when seeing an artwork in the flesh. It is clearly an accomplished piece of work. The foreshortening of the man's hands, the colours and patterns of the table top mirrored in the protagonists' faces, and the tautness of the composition with its geometric structure are all noteworthy. It's good. But I'm not sure if it is great. Maybe it would be different when seen hanging on a wall, but Night Talk doesn't appear to have the palpable psychological charge that makes a memorable picture, it lacks the atmosphere that gives life to a work by Degas or Hockney. The female figure feels a little flat, her expressions cartoon-like. The facial emotions of the man have more depth but the highlights around his left cheek and the bridge of his nose aren't quite right. Nor are their clothes. Black is a notoriously difficult colour to master. Titian, Rembrandt, and Manet have all done it, but then they are the best of the best. Head of an Old Man in a Cap (circa 1630) by Rembrandt, who was a genius in his use of black There's nothing wrong with Prachakul's line, which is confident and flowing, but the shadowing and tonal transitions don't appear to be of the same technical quality. There's also a slight visual awkwardness in the way the top of the bar cuts across the cafÃ© dwellers' necks. That said, there is plenty to admire, not least the way the three separate flower arrangements form a v-shape to frame the two characters, which is mirrored by their outward-facing crossed legs. It gives the painting a pleasing symmetry, while also suggesting a feeling of discomfort and alienation. Much has been made of the fact Jiab Prachakul is self-taught, which puts her in good company along with the likes of Vincent van Gogh and Henri Rousseau. They both used their lack of formal training (Van Gogh had some) to take painting in a new direction, to uncover universal truths through apparently naÃ¯ve imagery. Van Gogh did it with his warped lines, Rousseau with his surreal jungle images. Prachakul could do it too, but she needs to get inside our heads as well as her own and the sitters'.

"'Up to 2,000 UK seafarers stranded due to virus'","Up to 2,000 UK seafarers are stranded on ships around the world because of coronavirus lockdowns, the industry's trade body has told the BBC. The UK Chamber of Shipping wants the UK government to become the first to sign up to a global plan to get crews home. And the Nautilus International maritime union said seafarers stuck on ships for months were depressed and homesick, ""with no end in sight"" to their ordeal. The government said it was working to ""ensure"" those affected could get home. Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping UK 'to bring in 14-day quarantine' for air passengers Because of port and air route bans for individual travellers, many of the world's1.6 million,externalseafarers cannot go home, while relief crews cannot be brought in. Theyare working past the end of their contracts,externaland the International Chamber of Shipping estimates 150,000 of them are stuck on board cruise ships, transporters, tankers and other vessels. The UK Chamber of Shipping said up to 2,000 - or around one in 13 - of the UK's25,750 seafarers,externalwere among the stranded. It has written to Shipping Minister Kelly Tolhurst, urging the UK government to become the first in the world to sign up to theInternational Maritime Organisation's new plan,externalto ensure crew changeovers can resume. The letter, seen by the BBC, also calls for seafarers and offshore workers to be exempt from ""any potential air travel quarantine restrictions which may be introduced"". Getting them home is ""increasingly taking on a humanitarian dimension"", it adds. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:How to self-isolate and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mark Dickinson, general secretary of Nautilus International, said many UK seafarers were working 90-hour weeks. He said: ""It's a confined workplace - not the Hilton Hotel - for three, four or five months. The accommodation is fairly basic and you're with a small group of people. ""You get into a situation where you think, 'I've got six weeks to go,' 'I've got four weeks to go,' and even when this is extended by 24 hours it's pretty awful. It's worse when it's so open-ended."" Mr Dickinson praised the UK government for classifying seafarers as key workers and allowing them to travel via the country's ports and airports, unlike those of many other countries. He added: ""My frustration has been with the governments who faff about, locking things down without actually giving any thought to the consequences of that."" A Foreign Office spokesperson said it was a ""worrying time for British crew on board cruise ships around the world"", but it was ""primarily the responsibility of their employers"" to ensure their welfare and safety. They added: ""The government is in direct contact with these operators about the issues, as well as directly with many crew members and their families, and we will continue to do what we can to ensure UK crew can access flights home."" Ms Tolhurst has said she is in ""constant dialogue"" with operators and that seafarers have""responded magnificently"" to the coronavirus crisis,,external""working round the clock to keep the nation fuelled, fed and supplied with vital goods"".

"Tesla ordered to keep main US plant closedIt reportedly planned to re-open on Friday, but authorities say this could lead to more virus cases.US & Canada","Alameda County authorities say opening the plant could lead to a spike in virus cases Electric car firm Tesla has been ordered to keep its main plant in the US closed, as California grapples with a coronavirus outbreak. Chief executive Elon Musk had told staff ""limited"" production would resume on Friday at the Fremont factory, near San Francisco, according to CNBC. But Alameda County says this could lead to a spike in coronavirus cases. Nearly 9,500 cases have been reported in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with 342 virus-related deaths. Since 23 March, all but ""basic operations"" have been suspended at the plantbecause of ""shelter in place"" orders enacted in the county. The factory employs more than 10,000 workers, and makes about 415,000 vehicles every year. California's government has eased some restrictions around the state this week, allowing businesses to resume operations. But several Bay Area counties, including Alameda, have issued their own criteria according to which businesses may reopen, which take precedence. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has drawn criticism for his opposition to coronavirus lockdown measures ""Tesla has been informed that they do not meet those criteria and must not reopen,"" Alameda County said in a statement. ""We welcome Tesla's proactive work on a reopening plan, so that once they fit the criteria to reopen, they can do so in a way that protects their employees and the community at large."" Tesla did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Mr Musk has drawn controversy for his opposition to coronavirus restrictions, and his promotion of unproven treatments for the virus. In a series of tweets, the tech billionaire has said ""the coronavirus panic is dumb"" and ""FREE AMERICA NOW"". It comes as Tesla has suspended operations at its plant in the Chinese city of Shanghai, according to Bloomberg. It had previously closed the factory as a temporary measure when the virus was at its peak in China. The company reported a net profit in the first three months of this year, and its stock has risen to nearly $820 (Â£669; â¬756). But analysts expect the coronavirus pandemic will adversely affect its earnings in 2020.
